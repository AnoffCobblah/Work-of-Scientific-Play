       FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., V.P.         and Treasurer, in the Chair,
     "  Description of a new Barometer, recently fixed up in the Apart
  ments of the Royal Society ; with remarks on the mode hitherto
  pursued at various periods, and an account of that which is now
 adopted, for correcting the observed height of the mercury in the
  Society's Barometers." By Francis Baily, Esq., Vice-President and
  Treasurer, R.S.
     The barometer, here alluded to, may in some measure be consi
  dered as two separate and independent barometers, inasmuch as it
 is formed of two distinct tubes dipping into one and the same cistern
 of mercury. One of these tubes is made of flint glass, and the
  other of crown glass, with a view to ascertain whether, at the end of
  any given period, the one may have had any greater chemical effect
  on the mercury than the other, and thus affected the results. A brass
  rod, to which the scale is attached, passes through the framework,
  between the two tubes, and is thus common to both : one end of
  which is furnished with a fine agate point, which, by means of a rack
 and pinion moving the whole rod, may be brought just to touch the
 surface of the mercury in the cistern, the slightest contact with which
 is immediately discernible ; and the other end of which bears the
 usual scale of inches, tenths, &c. ; and there is a separate vernier
 for each tube.    A small thermometer, the bulb of which dips into
the mercury in the cistern, is inserted at the bottom : and an eye
piece is also there fixed, so that the agate point can be viewed with
more distinctness and accuracy.        The whole instrument is made to
turn round in azimuth, in order to verify the perpendicularity of the
 tubes and the scale.
    It is evident that there are many advantages attending this mode
 of construction, which are not to be found in the barometers as usu
 ally formed for general use in this country. The absolute heights
 are more correctly and more' satisfactorily determined ; and the per
manency of true action is more effectually noticed and secured. For,
every part is under the inspection and control of the observer ; and
any derangement or imperfection in either of the tubes is imme
diately detected on comparison with the other.         And, considering
the care that has been taken in. tilling the tubes, and setting off the
    VOL. IV.                         B

                                     i
scale,  it may justly be considered as a standard barometer. The pre
sent volume of the Philosophical Transactions will contain the first
register of the observations that have been made with this instru
ment.
     Mr. Baily then enters into a description of the several corrections
that are required for the various kinds of barometers, in order to
make them comparable with one another ; and treats of each of these
in their order.     First as to the correction for temperature, both of
the mercury and of the scale ; next for capillarity ; and afterwards
for the height of the barometer above the level of the sea. A table
is given for the first of these corrections ; and a convenient formula
for the latter : the correction for capillarity is constant, and of very
 small magnitude.
     The author next describes the mode in which the observations of
 the barometer have, from time to time, been recorded in the Meteor
 ological Journal of this Society ; and points out several inaccu
racies which have occasionally been committed            in this depart
ment, for want of an uniform plan of reduction.        Now this state of
 confusion and uncertainty he remarks ought not to exist in a me
 teorological journal emanating from this Society, more especially as
 the true values are as easily attainable as the approximate ones.
 And although, in a general point of view, the minute differences
 caused by such errors may be unimportant, yet as appeals are fre
 quently made to the barometer of this Society, as a standard, by
 persons engaged in important researches, the most scrupulous accu
 racy ought to be adopted and pursued, and the fullest explanation
 placed on record.      And Mr. Baily says that notwithstanding the de
  tails which he has given may create some doubt respecting the ac
  curacy of the past, yet he is persuaded that the system now pursued
  will inspire more confidence for the future. It is on this account
  that he has entered thus at large on the subject ; trusting that what
  he has stated will not only tend to preserve for the future a more
  correct and uniform system, but also justify the Council in directing
  that the register should henceforth contain the daily observations
  uncorrected, and thus prevent the possibility of any similar confusion
  and mistakes hereafter.
      Mr. Baily then adverts to the height of the Society's barometer
  above the mean level of the sea ; a subject of much interest to many
  persons engaged in various pursuits, but which appears, from the
  notes attached, at different periods, to the meteorological journal of
   this Society, to be involved in some confusion and uncertainty. Thus,
   prior to the year 1823, the cistern of the barometer is said to be 81
   feet above the level of low- water spring tides at Somerset House ;
   but without any information how this was connected with the sea.
   From 1823 to 1825, both inclusive, it is said to be 100 feet above
   the same level.    And from 1826 to 1836, both inclusive, the above
   indication is omitted, and the height is said to be 83 feet 2^ inches
                                                   "
   above a fixed mark on Waterloo Bridge ; or        above the mean level
   of the sea (presumed about) 95 feet." The discordance between
   the 81 feet and the 100 feet is easily accounted for by the fact that

the old barometer, prior to 1 823, was fixed up in the Council-room
of the Society, or the contiguous ante-room : but when Mr. Daniel's
barometer was finished, at the end of the year 1822, it was fixed up
in the closet adjoining the library, on the floor which is immediately
over the Council-room ; the assumed difference in the elevation of
the two floors (namely, 19 feet) having since been ascertained to be
correct.
   With respect to the new reference of altitude, namely, the fixed
mark at Waterloo Bridge, much doubt has frequently been expressed
about its existence, since no person had been able to discover it.
The fact is that there is no mark, in the common acceptation of the
term ; but the intended reference is nevertheless more conspicuous,
more durable, and more convenient than any mark that could have
been inscribed by hands.       This standard mark, or level, was fixed
on by Mr. Bevan in the year 1827, at the request of the Council of
this Society : and it is the surface of the granite pedestal at the
base of the columns, at the north abutment of the bridge, and on the
eastern side ; which is about 5 feet above the lowest platform, or
landing, at the stairs.    Nothing therefore was wanting but the dif
ference of level between this mark and the one made by Capt. Lloyd
at London Bridge, the height of which above the mean level of the
sea had been determined by him.       This has been recently done by
Sir John Rennie, at the request also of the Council : and the result
of the whole is, that the cistern of the barometer is 97 feet above the
mean level of the sea.
   The author concludes his paper with some remarks on the pro
priety of the position of the several meteorological instruments of
the Society. With respect to the barometer, he says he is not aware
that any objection can be offered ; and as to the hygrometer, the ob
servations have been found, by recent trials, not to differ materially
from some expressly made in another position, at King's College,
which was considered to be more favourable for such experiments.
It therefore only remains to speak of the external thermometer and
of the rain-gauge ; of which all that can be said on the subject would
be merely a repetition of what was justly said sixty years ago by Mr.
Cavendish on a similar occasion (Philosophical Transactions, 1776),
namely,
          " that, on the whole, the situation is not altogether such as
could be wished, but is the best the house affords."

    The following Address of His Royal Highness the President to
the present Meeting, was read from the Chair by the Chairman.
       Gentlemen,
 When     I last had the honour of addressing you from this Chair,      I
 ventured to express a hope that the happy restoration of my sight,
 and the continued possession of health, would have enabled me to
 discharge, with becoming regularity, the duties of President of this
 Society during those portions of the year in which I am generally
 resident in London : the fulfilment, however, of that hope was un
 happily frustrated by a long and dangerous illness, which confined
 me for several months to my apartments and from the effects of
 which    I  have hardly yet entirely recovered. I trust, Gentlemen,
 you will pardon me if       I look forward with brighter hopes to the
 prospects of another year; and if I hesitate to regard the unhappy
 experience of that which is past as a premonition of the fate which
 awaits me in those which are to come; if such were my assurance
 or reasonable fear, I should acquiesce in the duty and propriety of
 at once retiring from this Chair and of no longer soliciting the re
 newal of an honour which I have enjoyed for so many years ; but if
 it should be the pleasure of that good Providence, whose chastise
 ments and whose mercies I have so often before experienced, to dis
 able me from presiding over this Society in such a manner as might
 be considered necessary for the protection and maintenance of its
just interests and dignity,    I should bow with humble resignation to
the expression of His will, and resign into other hands the discharge
 of those duties for which I should feel myself no longer qualified.
    Since the last Annual Session of this Society we have lost, Gen
tlemen, a most munificent patron and benefactor, by the demise of
our late most gracious Sovereign, King William the Fourth, of whom
it is difficult for me to speak in terms which do justice to my feelings.
He was, indeed, not less distinguished by the exalted station which
he filled, than by the warmth and sincerity of his affections as a
husband, a brother, and a friend ; by the undisguised frankness and
truth of his character as a man ; and as a monarch, by his patriotic
zeal to increase the efficiency and secure the permanence of the
great institutions of his country and to extend to all classes of his
subjects the blessings of peace and knowledge and the protection

                                    6
 of just and equal laws.     I would gladly enlarge, if the time or the
 occasion would permit me to do so, upon these and many other
 virtues in the character of one who was so closely connected with
 me by the ties of relationship and of duty ; but I am quite sure that I
should fail in the expression both of your sentiments and my own,
 if I did not acknowledge, in becoming terms of respect and grati
 tude, the especial patronage and protection which he extended to
 the Royal Society, by the renewed grant of the two Annual Me
 dals which had been instituted by his royal brother and predecessor,
 and by the enactment of such statutes for their distribution as ap
 peared to him best calculated to stimulate the exertions of philo
 sophers, and to associate for ever the results of their labours with
 the publication of the Transactions of the Royal Society.
     The Council availed themselves of the earliest opportunity which
 the resumption of their meetings allowed, to present, in the name of
 the Fellows of the Royal Society, the homage of their loyalty and
 devotion to the person and throne of the illustrious Princess who
now wields the sceptre of this great empire ; and they ventured at
the same time to express a hope that Her Majesty would be gra
 ciously pleased, in conformity with the practice of her predecessors,
 to sign her royal name in our Register as Patroness of our Society,
and that she would likewise continue to us the annual grant of the
 two Medals which had been made by King George the Fourth and
 King William the Fourth.
    This Address has been presented to Her Majesty, who has been
graciously pleased to signify to me, through the Secretary of State,
that she is most sensible of the loyalty and attachment expressed in
it, and that she cordially joins in the wish of the Royal Society that
her reign may be distinguished by the triumphs of the arts of
peace and by the general diffusion and advancement          of religion
and knowledge amongst all classes of her subjects.        Her Majesty
was further graciously pleased to intimate that she would have great
satisfaction in becoming the Patroness of the Royal Society, and that
she would annually place at their disposal two Gold Medals, and
would continue to extend to them the same protection and patronage
which they had received from her royal predecessors.
    I feel proud, Gentlemen, in being able to communicate to you
these gracious assurances of support and protection from our Pa
troness and Queen, which are well calculated to confirm, though
they cannot increase, the loyal and devoted attachment which we
feel to her person ; and I trust that I shall be able, at no distant
period, to announce to you that Her Majesty has signed her royal
name in our Register as Patroness of the Royal Society.
    I now proceed to notice some of the more important events con
nected with the administration of the Royal Society during the last
year.
    One of the Royal Medals has been adjudged to Mr. Whewell for
his very valuable series of researches on the tides, which have been
published in our Transactions, chiefly during the last three years.
I  must refer you, Gentlemen, for a statement of the grounds upon

                                     T
 which this decision has been founded to the more detailed reports of
 the Council, which will be read to you by your Secretary Dr. Roget;
 but I gladly avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my respect
 for the great talents and varied attainments of the distinguished phi
 losopher upon whom this mark of honour has been conferred. If I
 regard him as occupied with the highest and most important prac
 tical duties connected with our system of academical education, and
 in providing and arranging the materials by which it is conducted,
 or the principles upon which it should be based, he will be found in
 the foremost rank of those whose labours do not deserve the less
 honour because they commonly absorb the entire time and attention
 of those who are engaged in them, and thus close up the avenue to
 those distinctions which are almost exclusively confined to great
 discoveries in science, or to important productions in literature.
 When I read his essays on the architecture of the middle ages, on
 subjects of general literature, or on moral and metaphysical philo
 sophy, exhibiting powers of mind so various in their application
 and so refined and cultivated in their character, I feel inclined to
 forget the profound historian of science in the accomplished man of
letters, or the learned amateur of art; but it is in his last and highest
 vocation, whilst tracing the causes which have advanced or checked
 the progress of the inductive sciences from the first dawn of philoso
 phy in Greece to their mature development in the nineteenth cen
tury, or in pointing out the marks of design of an all-wise and all-
 powerful Providence in the greatest of those works and operations of
nature which our senses or our knowledge can comprehend or ex
plain, that I recognise the productions of one of those superior minds
which are accustomed to exercise a powerful and lasting influence
upon the intellectual character and speculations of the age in which
they flourish.
    It is now three years since the Royal Medal was adjudged to Mr.
Lubbock for his Researches on the Tides ; and the Council have
availed themselves of the first opportunity which was presented by the
recurrence of the cycle of the subjects, which are successively enti
tled to the Royal Medals, to make a similar award to his colleague
and fellow-labourer in this very interesting and important series of
investigations.    It is not for me to attempt to balance the relative
claims and merits, in connection with this subject, of these two
very eminent philosophers ; it is quite sufficient to remark that the
first who ventured to approach this difficult and long-neglected in
quiry was the first also who was selected for honour : but I have long
noticed with equal pride and satisfaction the perfect harmony with
which they have carried on their co-ordinate labours, apparently in
different to every object but the attainment of truth, and altogether
superior to those jealousies which too frequently present themselves
amongst rival and cotemporaneous       labourers in the same depart
ments of science.
    I regret to observe that the second Royal Medal for the present
year has not been awarded, and that it has consequently lapsed to
the Executors of his late Majesty. It was proposed that it should be

                                   8
given to the best Memoir presented to the Royal Society between
the years 1834 and 1837, containing " Contributions towards a
System of Geological Chronology, founded upon an examination of
Fossil Remains and their attendant Phaenomena ;" a subject of the
greatest interest, and also of the greatest delicacy, from its con
nexion with those agitating topics which the speculations of philo
sophers are compelled to approach, though they may not always
venture to decide.       I should have rejoiced to have seen in the
Transactions of the Royal Society a record of the opinions of a
Buckland or a Sedgwick upon a theme which is so worthy of the
application of their highest powers ; and I trust that, though its an
nouncement as a Prize Question has failed to secure, within the
prescribed period, the accomplishment of the object proposed by        it,
it will still have done some service to the cause of science by ex
citing the attention of geologists in such     a   manner as may sooner
or later lead to   a    definite and philosophical exposition of their
views on a    subject of so much importance.
    Those who have attended to the Tidal researches of Mr. Whe-
well must be aware how much light has been thrown upon the
character and course of the phaenomena of the tides by the simul
taneous observations, under his instructions, which were made in
the month of June, 1834 and 1835, at nearly five hundred sta
tions of the Coast Guard Service in Great Britain and Ireland,
and simultaneously with the latter also at more than one hundred
stations in America, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Holland,
Denmark, and Norway.           These observations were undertaken by
the authority or through the influence of the Government of this
country, which likewise most promptly and liberally furnished the
requisite funds and assistance for reducing the observations            in
such a manner as was requisite for deducing general conclusions
from them,   a   labour much too extensive and costly to be under
taken by any single individual.         gladly seize this opportunity of
bearing testimony, occupying      I I
                                   as   do the highest scientific station
in this country, to the readiness which the Lords of the Treasury
and the Admiralty have shown on this and on every other occasion
to forward scientific inquiries, and particularly such as are con
nected with the advancement of astronomy and navigation.            They
have granted funds for reducing and publishing the Planetary
Observations at Greenwich, the valuable and extensive series of
observations of the late Mr. Groombridge, for repeating upon an
adequate scale the very important experiments of Mr. Cavendish,
and for many other subjects of great scientific interest and value      ;
and  I  feel satisfied that every application for assistance towards the
accomplishment of any important object in science, will receive from
them the most willing attention and support,   if  it comes before them
with the recommendation and authority of those persons who are
most competent to judge of its usefulness or necessity, and in such
a  form as may justify them in appealing to Parliament for its sanc
tion of the requisite expenditure.     I    rejoice, Gentlemen, in such
manifestations     of the sympathy of the Government of this great

                                    9
country for the progress of science, and I trust that its influence
will be felt in the cordial union and co-operation of philosophers
in planning and in executing those great systems of observations,
whether simultaneous or not, which are still requisite to fill up
some of those blank spaces which occupy so large a portion in the
map of human knowledge.
    In the course of last year the celebrated Baron de Humboldt ad
dressed a letter to me, as President of the Royal Society, expressing
a wish that Magnetical Observatories, upon a uniform plan, might
be established in this country and its colonies, with a view of making
simultaneous observations with those which are now making, or
which are in progress to be made, in different parts of the continent
ot Europe and of Northern Asia.        I felt it to be due to the illus
trious author of this communication to make it generally known to
the Fellows of the Royal Society, and to beg that a committee of
the Council might be appointed to consider the best mode of carry
ing its recommendations into effect. A very elaborate Report was
consequently made by the Astronomer Royal and Mr. Christie in
November last, enumerating many important consequences which
might result from such a system of observations, and pointing out a
series of stations where they might most efficiently be made.      I am
happy     to inform you, Gentlemen,  that  measures  are in progress for
the accomplishment of all these objects : a Magnetical Observatory,
which was long contemplated and earnestly recommended by the
Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory, has been established at
Greenwich, in a situation so remote from all other buildings as to
be altogether free even from the suspicion of external disturbances.
The Corps of Royal Engineers, which has always been distinguished
for the zeal and scientific acquirements of many of its Members,
has spontaneously offered to conduct the requisite observations, in
whatever quarter of the globe they may be stationed ; the Astrono
mer Royal has determined the species of observations to be made,
and the character and construction of the instruments to be used ;
and the Lords of the Treasury have placed at the disposal of the
 Royal Society the requisite funds for their purchase. I have felt
 it my duty, Gentlemen, to bring these circumstances under your
notice, not merely as forming an important part of the proceedings
 of the Council of the Royal Society during the last year, but as
an encouraging and instructive example of the facility with which
extensive co-operation and assistance may be obtained in the execu
tion of any scientific object, however extensive it may be, when the
practical means for performing it are distinctly and clearly defined.
    It is with real concern that I venture to call your attention to a
letter which has been recently published, on the subject of the new
Catalogue of the Library of the Royal Society, which        I somewhat
prematurely announced, when I last had the honour of addressing
you, as preparing for publication, and as likely very shortly to ap
pear. I was perfectly aware, when I made that announcement to
you, of the nature of the correspondence which had passed between
Mr. Panizzi and the Council relating to this Catalogue ; but I had

                                       10
  no suspicion that the very brief allusion which I made to this sub
 ject, or the incidental mention of Mr. Panizzi's name, which I made
  in no offensive or disrespectful sense, would have been considered
  sufficient ground for its publication. It is not my intention to make
  any observations    on the particular allegations which are made
  against the Council, both collectively and individually, in Mr.
  Panizzi's letter, which will be more properly noticed in a short
  statement, which has been drawn up, in deference to your good
  opinion, by the Council, and which will be read to you by Dr.
   Roget*; but I think it my duty to state to you, that I was not
  only cognisant of the whole course of the proceedings of the Coun
  cil at the time when they took place, but that I perfectly concurred
  in their propriety ; and I beg leave further to assure you, that a
 careful perusal of Mr. Panizzi's correspondence with the Council,
 of his comments upon their resolutions and of his imputations upon
 their conduct, has in no respect tended to modify the opinion which
 I originally formed, or to induce me to withdraw from the full
 share of responsibility which I incur, in connection with these
 proceedings, in common with every other Member of the Council.
     Before I conclude this portion of my address, I feel it to be my
 duty to notice the retirement of Mr. Children and Mr. Konig from
the offices which they have so long and so ably filled. The in
 creasing duties, which have been imposed upon them by recent re
 gulations at the British Museum, have been deemed by them in
 some degree incompatible with those which they owe to the Royal
 Society ; and they have determined therefore, with a promptitude
 and delicacy of feeling which does them honour, to retire from
their official connexion with us. It is quite unnecessary for me to
enlarge upon the merits of two gentlemen who are so well known
to you by their labours in your service, by the courtesy of their
manners and by the extent and variety of their acquirements ; but
I   should do injustice to my own feelings if I did not express, in the
strongest terms, my personal obligations to them for their kind at
tention to my wishes, and for the anxiety which they have always
shown that the interests of the Royal Society should not suffer from
my occasional inability to attend personally to the discharge of the
duties of my office.     I am quite sure, Gentlemen, that I do not
misinterpret your feelings, when        I propose to thank them, in your
name and my own,      for  their long   and   valuable services.
     The Society  has  lost  during  the   last year twenty-nine Members
on the Home, and two on the Foreign List, and I shall now pro
ceed to notice some of the most distinguished names which appear
amongst them.
     Henry Thomas Colebrooke was the son of Sir George Cole-
brooke, an eminent Director of the East India Company, under
whose auspices he proceeded to India, as a writer, in 1782. Though
a severe student in youth, and strongly disposed to follow a learned
profession at home, he gave no indications for many years after his
                    * This statement is given in page 18.

                                     11
arrival in India of those tastes for severe and abstract studies for
which he was afterwards so celebrated ; and we consequently find
that, whilst resident at Purneah, he devoted much of his time to the
wild and animating field-sports of the East, for which he long re
tained a passionate fondness.     He made his first appearance as an
author in 1 792, in a Treatise on the Agriculture and Commerce of
Bengal ; and it was about this period that he began, with all the
ardour and energy which distinguished his character, the study of
the Sanscrit language, chiefly with a view to acquire a knowledge
of the Lilawati and other Sanscrit treatises on Algebra and Astro
nomy, which the somewhat extravagant speculations of Bailly and
 others had begun to bring into notice. He subsequently undertook
 the translation of the Digest of the Hindu Laws of Contracts and
 Successions, which had been compiled under the direction of Sir
 William Jones, a most laborious and difficult task, which he com
 pleted in less than two years.       It was during his engagement on
 this work that he was appointed to a judicial situation at Mirza-
 pore, a position singularly suited to his tastes and pursuits, from its-
 vicinity to Benares, the great repository of the ancient treasures of
 the literature of Hindostan, and the place of residence of its most
 learned expounders.
     In the year 1800 he was removed to Calcutta, and raised to
 the highest judicial situation in the native courts of India, at the
 same time that he was made President of the Board of Revenue,
 Member of the Supreme Council, and Honorary Professor of San
 scrit in the College of Fort William.       But the important official
  duties which he was thus called upon to discharge seem rather to
 have stimulated, than to have checked, his labours and investiga
 tions in oriental literature and oriental science.   In the course of a
 few years there appeared from his pen many profound dissertations
 in the Asiatic Researches, on the Vedanta System of Philosophy, on
  Sanscrit and Pracrit Poetry and Grammar, on the Indian Classes,
  on the Origin and Tenets of the Mahometan Sects, on the Jains, on
 the Indian and Arabian Division of the Signs of the Zodiac, and
  on the Notions of the Hindu Astronomers on the Precession of the
  Equinoxes and the Motions of the Planets ; to which must be
 added the first volume of a very elaborate Sanscrit Grammar, the
 translation of the Peostra, a Sanscrit Dictionary, and two extensive
  Treatises on the Hindu Law of Inheritance, together with editions
 of the Amera Cosha, a Sanscrit Vocabulary, and of the Hitopadesa,
 or " Salutary Instruction", which had been translated by Mr. Wil-
 kins, and which is more commonly known under the name of the
  " Fables of Pilpay".
     It was some time after Mr. Colebrooke's return to this country
 that he published, in 1817, a translation of the Lilawati and Vija-
  Ganita, Sanscrit treatises on arithmetic, algebra and mensuration, to
 which was prefixed a dissertation on the early history of algebra and
  arithmetic in India, Arabia and Italy, which is equally remarkable
  for its profound knowledge of Hindu and Arabian literature and
 its correct views of the relations of oriental and ancient and mo

                                    12
dern European science.        He was also the first person who main
tained, from his own observations on the plains of Hindostan, the
superior elevation of the Himalayan mountains above the Andes of
 America, in opposition to the opinions generally entertained at that
period, and which had been sanctioned by the great authority of
Humboldt's theory of the range of the curve of perpetual congela
tion. The complete confirmation which his opinion afterwards
received, from accurate barometrical and trigonometrical measure
ments, was always referred to, in his later years, with particular sa
tisfaction and triumph.
   Mr. Colebrooke continued the steady pursuit of his oriental and
scientific studies until nearly the close of his life, and even when the
progress of his infirmities confined him almost entirely to his bed.
He was one of the founders of the Asiatic and Astronomical Societies,
and a short time before his death he gave to the library of the India
House his incomparable collection of Sanscrit and Asiatic manu
scripts, which had been collected at an expense of nearly 10,000/.,
with the noble view of preserving them for ever from the danger of
dispersion by the fluctuating accidents of inheritance.
   Mr. Colebrooke was probably, with one single exception, the
greatest Sanscrit scholar of his age ; and when we take into account
his great acquirements in mathematics and philosophy and in almost
every branch of literature, combined with the most accurate and
severe judgement, and also his great public services in situations of
the highest trust and responsibility, we shall not hesitate to pro
 nounce him one of the most illustrious of that extraordinary suc
cession of great men who have adorned the annals of our Indian
empire, the deaths of so many of whom it has been my misfortune
to record in my recent addresses from this chair.
   Dr. John Latham reached the extraordinary age of ninety-seven
years, having enjoyed the full possession of his faculties and almost
unbroken health until within a few days of his death : he was the father
of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and it is sixty-seven years since
his first paper, on a medical subject, was published in our Transactions.
 He was the author of many papers on antiquarian subjects ; but his
favourite study throughout life was natural history, and particularly
 ornithology.    He published, in 1781, his General Synopsis of Birds,
in six volumes quarto, and afterwards two supplementary volumes.
 In 1792 he published his Index Ornithologicus, a complete system
 of ornithology, arranged in classes, orders, genera and species, in
two volumes quarto. At the age of 82, he commenced his General
 History of Birds,amagnificentwork in eleven volumes quarto. He was
a man of very systematic habits and most amiable character, the tran
quil course of whose long life was neither disturbed by scientific or pro
fessional jealousies, nor embittered by the want of those enjoyments
which competence anddomestic happiness andvirtuealone can confer.
    Dr. Tiarks was born at Jever in Oldenburg, and came to England
in 1810, when he was appointed Assistant-Librarian to Sir Joseph
 Banks, through whose influence he was nominated Astronomer to
the Commission for settling the North American Boundary, under

                                     13
the authority of the Treaty of Ghent.       After his return to England,
in 1822,    he was commissioned by the Admiralty, at the request of
the Board of Longitude, to ascertain, by means of a great number
of chronometers, the difference of the longitudes of Falmouth and
Madeira, and subsequently of Falmouth and Dover, the results of
which were detailed in a very able paper in our Transactions for
1824, in which he pointed out and explained the origin of an error
of nearly 4" of time in the longitudes of all the stations of the Tri
gonometrical Survey. He was afterwards sent on a similar mission
to Heligoland and various stations in the North Seas, and on the
last occasion he was accompanied by Sir Humphry Davy, who
wished to try the effect of his protectors on the corrosion of the
copper sheathing of ships.      In 1825 he was recalled from Germany
to resume his astronomical surveys in America, where he was em
ployed to ascertain the position and extent of the north-western
boundary of the Lake of the Woods, an operation in the execution
of which both he and the party who assisted him suffered the great
est hardships and privations.      He published various reports of his
surveys, and was necessarily much employed and consulted in the
difficult and embarrassing negotiations which have attended, and
unhappily still attend, the settlement of the important question of
the North American boundaries. Dr. Tiarks died in the forty-
eighth year of age, at his native place, in consequence of a fever
which attacked     a constitution already shattered and broken by the
severe labours and privations which he had endured. He was a
 mathematician of no inconsiderable attainments, a very careful and
 efficient practical astronomer, and admirably qualified for the very
important and responsible duties which he was appointed to dis
 charge.
     Dr. Edward Turner was a native of Jamaica, and studied medi
 cine at Edinburgh, and chemistry at Gottingen under the instruc
 tions of the celebrated analytic chemist Stromeyer. He became a
 lecturer on chemistry at Edinburgh in 1824, and his first publica
 tion was a short introduction to the study of the laws of chemical
 combination and the atomic theory. He obtained the Professorship
 of Chemistry in the London University at its first establishment in
  1 828, a situation which he continued to hold to the end of his life.
  His Elements of Chemistry have enjoyed an uncommon degree
 of popularity, and are remarkable for clearness and precision both
 in the description of his experiments and in the deduction of
 his theory. He was the author of two papers in our Transactions ;
 the first " On the Composition of the Chloride of Barium," and the
  second containing " Researches on Atomic Weights," both written
  with a view of impugning the theory which had been promulgated by
  some English chemists of high authority, " that all atomic weights
  are simple multiples of that of hydrogen."       In the year 1 835 Dr.
  Turner was compelled by the declining state of his health to suspend
  all original researches, confining himself simply to the duties of his
  professorship, and he died in February last, in the fortieth year of
  his age, to the deep regret of every friend of the progress of chemi

                                    1+
cal science.    He was a person of most engaging manners and ap
pearance and of most amiable character; and his body was followed
to the grave, with every manifestation of respect and affectionate at
tachment, by the whole body of the pupils and professors of the
institution of which he had so long been a principal ornament.
    Dr. William Ritchie was originally Rector of the Royal Academy
of Tain in Inverness-shire, where he contrived, by extreme frugality,
to save a sufficient sum from his very small annual stipend to attend
a course of the lectures of Thenard, Gay-Lussac, and Biot at Paris,
and also to provide a substitute for the performance of his duties
during his temporary absence from Scotland. His skill and ori
ginality in devising and performing experiments with the most simple
materials, in illustration of various disputed points of natural phi
losophy, attracted the attention of the distinguished philosophers
whose occasional pupil he had become : he had also communicated,
through Sir John Herschel, who took a strong interest in his for
tunes, to the Royal Society, papers " On a new Photometer," " On a
new form of the Differential Thermometer," and " On the Permea
bility of transparent Screens of extreme tenuity by Radiant Heat,"
which led to his appointment, through the recommendation of Major
Sabine, to the Professorship of Natural Philosophy at the Royal In
stitution, where he delivered a course of probationary lectures in the
spring of 1829 : he became, from this time, a permanent resident in
London, and was appointed to the Professorship of Natural Philo
sophy at the London University in 1832.      He subsequently commu
nicated to the Royal Society, papers " On the Elasticity of Threads
of Glass, and the application of this property to Torsion Balances ;"
and also various experimental researches on the electric and che
mical theories of galvanism, on electro-magnetism and voltaic elec
tricity, which are more remarkable for the practical ingenuity mani
fested in the contrivance and execution of the experiments, than for
the influence of the views which they display on the progress of their
theory, which was so fully and so happily developed by the cotem-
porary labours of another illustrious chemist and philosopher.
 Dr. Ritchie was subsequently engaged in experiments, on an exten
sive scale, on the manufacture of glass for optical purposes, for the
examination of the results of which a Commission was appointed by
the Government, with a view to their further prosecution by a public
grant of money, or by affording increased facilities of experiment by
a relaxation of the regulations of the Excise. A telescope of 8 inches
aperture was made by Mr. Dollond from Dr. Ritchie's glass, at the
 recommendation of this commission ; but it is generally understood
that its performance was not so satisfactory as to sanction a further
 expenditure in the extension of these experiments.    Dr. Ritchie died
 in  the autumn   of the present year, of a fever  caught in Scotland ;
 and though   the traces of  an imperfect and  irregular education are
 but too manifest in most of his theoretical researches, yet he must
 always be regarded as an experimenter of great ingenuity and
 merit, and as a remarkable example of the acquisition of a very
 extensive knowledge of philosophy under difficulties and privations

                                       15
which would have arrested the progress of any person of less ardour
and determination of character.
     Mr. Joseph Sabine was educated in the University of Dublin,
and devoted himself, from a very early period of life, to the study
of botany, ornithology, and other branches of natural history, to the
neglect of those professional studies which his friends designed him
to pursue. One of his earliest labours was the formation of a col
lection of British birds of almost unrivalled extent and completeness.
He became secretary to the Horticultural Society at the period of
its first establishment ; and though his connection with it was after
wards very abruptly and perhaps very harshly terminated, he must
always be considered as the chief author of its successful and com
plete development. To the Horticultural Transactions he contri
buted 64 papers, the most important of which are those on the ge
nera Crocus, Dahlia, and Chrysanthemum ; and he was also required
to re-write the greatest part of the communications which were ad
dressed to the Society by gardeners and practical men, which were
rarely sent in a fit state for publication, but which frequently em
bodied very important information on the various processes of hor
 ticulture.
     Mr. Sabine was likewise an active and valuable member of the
 Zoological Society, whose gardens are chiefly indebted to his taste
 and knowledge for the introduction and systematic arrangement of
 those splendid flowers and shrubs which have added so greatly to
 their  beauty and interest.
      Mr. Sabine held, for   the greatest part of his life, the situation of
 Inspector-General      of Taxes,   and was called upon by his official du
 ties to make periodical visits to almost every part of the kingdom ;
 he never omitted any opportunity which his various journies afforded
 him, of acquiring or of communicating practical knowledge of hor
 ticulture and of botany ; and few persons have contributed so much,
  by their personal exertions, to add to the decorations of the cottage
  and the park, to increase and improve the produce of our gardens,
 and thus greatly to extend the sphere of the innocent enjoyments
  and luxuries of all classes of society.
      The Rev. Dr. Joseph Hallett Batten was a native of Penzance in
  Cornwall, and was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
  in 1801, after attaining very high academical honours. He was ap
  pointed Classical Professor at the East India College at Hayleybury
  at the period of its first establishment, and became Principal of the
  college upon the retirement of Dr. Henley, a situation which he con
  tinued to retain until within a month of his death.         He was a man
  of cultivated   taste  and of  very  extensive attainments,  both in theo
  logy  and  general  literature  ; and  in every way worthy, by his intel
  lectual powers and character, of presiding over an establishment
   which has been so justly distinguished by the very eminent men who
  have been, and now are, connected with it.
      Dr. John Johnstone was the sixth son of the celebrated Dr. James
   Johnstone of Worcester, and received his education at Merton Col
   lege, Oxford.     He was for upwards of forty years a very distin

                                    16
guished physician at Birmingham and its neighbourhood, and made
his first appearance as an author in a defence of his father's claim
to the first discovery of the disinfecting powers of muriatic acid gas,
which had been claimed by Dr. Carmichael Smyth. Though ear
nestly attached to the study and practice of his profession, he re
tained throughout life a fondness for classical literature, and lived
on the most intimate terms with some of the most distinguished
scholars of the age, including amongst their number the justly cele
brated Dr. Parr, whose life and voluminous correspondence he pub
lished, a work full of interesting literary anecdote and classical re
search ; and his Harveian oration, pronounced in 1819, and which
has been recently published, with a short memoir of his life, by his
friend the Bishop of Lichfield, is a model of spirited and correct
Latinity. Dr. Johnstone was a man of very warm affections and of
great independence of character, and he was universally respected
in the great manufacturing city in which he resided, for his great pro
fessional skill and services, and for the active support which he gave
to every benevolent and useful institution.
   Sir John Soane received his early architectural education under
Mr Dance and Mr. D. Holland, and was afterwards sent, by the
especial bounty of King George the Third, as a student of the Royal
Academy, to pursue his professional studies at Rome.           After his
return he gradually obtained extensive employment, both as an ar
chitect and a surveyor, and finally succeeded in securing almost
every important and honourable appointment which is connected
with the exercise of his profession in this country. In later life, when
in possession of an ample fortune and public honours, he became a
most munificent patron of public institutions, and more particu
larly of those which are connected with the advancement of the fine
arts; and in 1835 he bequeathed his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields,
and the magnificent collection of works of art which it contained, to
the nation, and secured the accomplishment of this noble project
by an Act of Parliament ; he continued to pursue his usual course
of public munificence until his death, which took place on the 20th
of January last, in the 84th year of his age.
   Sir John Soane was profoundly acquainted with the great prin
ciples of his art, and many of the interiors as well as exteriors of
his buildings are remarkable for skilful construction and for rich and
harmonious effects; but he was unfortunately disposed, in some cases,
to seek for novelty rather in new forms and decorations of architec
tural members, than for originality in the combination of those
which have been sanctioned by the concurrent voice of the most
cultivated of ancient nations and the greatest masters of modern
art ; it is for this reason that many of his works appear somewhat
capricious and extravagant, and fail to produce that undefinable
feeling of pleasure and satisfaction which always attends the contem
plation of those great productions of architecture which have been
celebrated for correct proportions, or for beautiful and appropriate
decoration.
   In connexion with this distinguished professor and patron of art,

                                      17
  I feel myself called upon to allude to the name of the venerable
  Earl of Egremont,    whose very recent loss we have to deplore.      He
  was a nobleman distinguished by his active yet discriminating be
  nevolence, and by his princely use of a princely fortune ; but it is as
  a judge and patron of art that his loss will be most severely felt
  beyond the precincts of his own family and the numerous poor who
  were the immediate partakers of his bounty. He was equally ju
  dicious in the selection of subjects for artists to execute, and liberal
  in rewarding them when done.
     Mr. J. D. Broughton, Surgeon of the Life Guards, had served
 with great distinction as a medical officer during a great part of the
  Peninsular war and at Waterloo.        He was an eminent physiologist,
 and devoted a great portion of his time and attention to the study
 and improvement of the science of medical jurisprudence, and more
 particularly to experiments on the effects of poisons, and to the best
 and most unerring tests for detecting their presence after death.
 His death, which followed a serious operation, rendered necessary
 by a long-neglected accident, was deeply lamented by a large circle
 of friends, by whom he was equally respected and beloved for his
 great professional talents and for his honourable character.
     Mr. John Davidson, the last known victim to the cause of African
 discovery, was formerly a partner in the house of Messrs. Savory
 and Moore, the well-known chemists, but was induced to quit it
 in 1826, partly with a view to gratify his passion for foreign travel,
 and partly from other causes.         He afterwards visited North and
 South America, India, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany,
 and France ; and the lectures which he gave at the Royal Institu
 tion and elsewhere, after his return, on the pyramids of Memphis
 and Mexico, on Thebes and the temples of Egypt and Jerusalem,
 afforded a sufficient proof both of his activity and of his accurate
 observation.    The spirit of enterprise and travels, when once ex
 cited, is not easily allayed, and Mr. Davidson devoted himself,
 almost from the period of his return to this country, to a course
 of preparation for a journey to Timbuctoo, which had already
 proved fatal to so many adventurers.       He was accompanied on this
journey by Abu-Bekr, an enfranchised African slave, who had been
 a prince in hisown country when young, and was well acquainted with
 the Arabic language. He had penetrated from Wadnoon to within
 twenty-five days' journey of Timbuctoo, when he was murdered by
 the El Hareb tribe, who were suspected to have been hired for that
 purpose by Moorish merchants, who, from not being able to under
 stand or conceive the real motives of such an undertaking, con
 ceived that its success would be injurious to their interests.       Mr.
 Davidson was a man of great activity and strength, in the full vi
 gour of life and health, and able to endure the severest labours and
privations ; but personal accomplishments the most calculated to se
cure success in ordinary attempts of this nature, serve only to aug
 ment the suspicion and to stimulate the cruelty of those savage
tribes, who tyrannize over these inhospitable and almost impenetrable
regions, and who are described by his companion, Abu-Bekr,

of every thing,  as a  lion lieth in wait for the cattle ; they     have no

    The only Foreign Members whom the Society has lost during the
last year are Dr. Adam Afzelius, of Upsala, and Professor Morichini,
of Rome.
    Dr. Adam Afzelius was born at Larg in West Gothland in 1750,
and was one of the last surviving pupils of Linnaeus. In 1777 he
was appointed Reader of Oriental Literature and in 1785 Demonstra
tor of Botany in the University of Upsala, and he made his first ap
pearance as an author by the publication of a short supplement to
the Flora Suecica of his master, in the Transactions of the Academy
of Stockholm for 1787. In the years 1792 and 1794, he made bo
tanical expeditions to Guinea and Sierra Leone, and a considerable
part of the collections which he formed in those countries passed
subsequently into the herbariums of Sir Joseph Banks and Sir James
Edward Smith. In 1797 he was made Secretary of Legation to the
 Swedish Embassy in this country, and in the following year he was
elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society on the ground of
his great knowledge of botany and zoology. Upon his return to his
 own country, he became Professor of Materia Medica and Diaetetics,
 at Upsala, situations which he retained for the remainder of his life.
 He was the author of a learned paper in the Linnean Transactions
 for 1791 on the genus Trifolium, and also of two works entitled
 Memedia Guinensia and Stirpium in Guinea medicinalium species :
 he edited likewise the botanical Correspondence of Linnaeus.             He
 was a botanist of great learning and acquirements, and highly
 esteemed by the leading founders of the Linnean Society ; but am       I
 unable to connect his name with any considerable advancement in
 natural knowledge.
    Professor Morichini, of Rome, was elected a Foreign Member of
 the Royal Society in 1827, and is chiefly known for his experiment
 on the magnetizing influence of the violet rays in the solar spectrum.
 His experiment was repeated by Configliachi at Pavia, and by
 Berard at Montpellier, without success, and in consequence doubts
 were expressed of the accuracy of his results, which appeared to be
 finally removed by the successful repetition of it by our justly cele
 brated countrywoman Mrs. Somerville, in the summer of 1 825.                I
 am not aware however that any other philosopher has succeeded in
 a similar attempt.
        Statement   of the Council relative        to Mr. Panizzi's
                                Pamphlet.
     In the pamphlet recently published by Mr. Panizzi, entitled " A
  Letter to His Royal Highness the President of the Royal Society,
  on the New Catalogue of the Library of that Institution now in
 the press," all the charges brought forward against the Council are
  founded on the most unwarranted and erroneous assumptions.

                                     19
    Mr. Panizzi, assumes, in the first place, that the Council was
bound to pay him in advance the remuneration agreed upon for the
completion of the Catalogue ; such payment in advance never having
been for a moment contemplated.         His payment was to have been at
the rate of £30 for every thousand titles the Catalogue might contain ;
but, in consideration that the work would probably require along time
to accomplish, it was agreed that one third of the money should be
given to him when he had written out all the titles on slips of paper,
another third when the revises were finally corrected for the press,
and the remaining third when the whole was printed off. The total
number of titles written out by Mr. Panizzi, as counted by Mr.
Shuckard, by whose computation he consented to abide, was found
to be 24,136 ; which at the rate of £10 per thousand, would render
the sum he ought to have received at the present stage of his work,
£241 : 7s. 2d., but from this sum £27 : 6s. is to be deducted in pay
ment of Mr. Roberton, as had been agreed to by Mr. Panizzi, re
 ducing it to £214 : Is. 2rf. At the period when Mr. Panizzi discon
tinued the work he had already received from the Society £450
on account, which is more than double the sum to which he was then
strictly entitled. The Council, therefore, far from imagining that he
had any further claims on the Society, considered that in advancing
him so large a sum before he had completed the second term of his
engagement, they had rather erred on the side of liberality.       They
could never have had an idea that he expected any additional pay
 ment, as he never gave them the slightest intimation to that effect ;
 and it is not until after the lapse of sixteen months that he suddenly
makes an appeal, not to the Council of the Royal Society, but to the
public, by the circulation of a pamphlet, claiming further remunera
tion, which he has never applied for to the party from whom he
imagines it to be due.
    In the second place, Mr. Panizzi assumes that the slips and revises
 are his own property, and that the Council has no right to them ; and
 to such a length does he carry this notion, that, even after he had
 ceased to be employed by the Council, he refused to give up the key
 of the drawers containing the slips, as if that key were his own pro
 perty. He likewise still withholds the revises containing the remarks
 of the Members who had seen them, alleging, while accused by no
 body, that they were necessary for his justification.   He is evidently
 not warranted in complaining of Members pointing out what ap
 peared to them to be errors, for if he had deemed this wrong he
 would not have done the very same thing in his pamphlet, wherein
 he subjects the sheets of a former Catalogue, not designed for publi
 cation and in a very rough and unfinished state, to the ordeal of his
 severest criticism.
     Another of Mr. Panizzi's unwarranted assumptions is his fancying
 himself at liberty to execute the work on which he was employed in
 whatever manner he pleased.         The Council certainly never dele
  gated to him this power ; but appointed a Committee for the ex
 press purpose of superintending the work as it proceeded, and of re
  gulating the manner in which it should be printed : and it was the

                                            20
 duty of Mr. Panizzi, or whoever else might have been employed
by the Council, to follow the directions and instructions which might
from time to time be given to him by that Committee.
     Mr. Panizzi was continually complaining of ill usage, while he at
the same time did not disclose the nature of his supposed injuries.
 He stated that he could not proceed with the work, but would not
point out any ground of complaint. When requested to explain
wherein he thought himself aggrieved, he would give no definite
answer to the inquiry, but proposed to refer matters to an arbitra
tion ; leaving the Council all the while unacquainted with the sub
jects of dispute, or with the points to be settled by such arbitration.
When, for the purpose of mutual understanding, he was invited to a
conference with the Committee, he refused to meet them, and would
only communicate by letter with the Council *.
     Finding, at length, that the great cause of the offence taken by
Mr. Panizzi consisted in his being directed by the Committee to
omit certain comments and notes which he had introduced, in his
own name, in the Catalogue, the Council, in deference to his wishes,
and in the spirit of conciliation, conceded the point in dispute, and
agreed that he might consider the manuscript corrections made by
the members of the Committee, merely " as suggestions for his gui
dance."        But, far from meeting them in the same spirit, he next re
quired of the Council, as a condition without which he could not
proceed with the Catalogue, a further concession, namely, that they
should rescind the whole resolution of its Committee, and declare it
null and void. It was obviously impossible to comply with so unrea
sonable a demand, which seemed so like a mere pretext for the total
abandonment of the work : and no alternative remained but to pass
the resolution of the 14th July, " that Mr. Panizzi be no longer em
ployed in the formation of the Catalogue."
     On the Council requesting the return of the revises in his pos
session, Mr. Panizzi refused to do so, alleging that they are his pri
vate property ; nor would he even deliver up the key of the drawers
containing the manuscript slips ; refusals which, of course, put an
end to all further correspondence                with him on the part of the
Council.
     So far from the Council having ever withheld from Mr. Panizzi,
as he asserts in his pamphlet they have done, the precise number of
titles which he wrote for the Catalogue, they have always been
ready to afford him that information.                    The slips were carefully
counted by Mr. Shuckard, in whose accuracy Mr. Panizzi placed
the fullest reliance, and who was appointed for that purpose with
     *  Note by Mr. Baily. — Mr. Panizzi having stated in his letter to the Secretary,
 of July 8th                                        " Mr. Baily took
                (see his pamphlet, page 38) that                       away my written
 " memorandum, and ordered Mr. Roberton not to take any step," I
                                                                         beg to remark,
 first, that, when that letter was read at the Council, I was surprised at the assertion,
 and distinctly denied the fact, never having seen nor heard of the written memo
 randum therein referred to : secondly, that Mr. Roberton was immediately called
 before the Council, and, on being questioned as to this subject, disclaimed also
 any knowledge of the circumstance. — Francis Bailv.

to make as to the results and details of that computation would, at
all times, have received the most immediate and complete answer.
      Report of the Proceedings of the Council for  the past year.
    The principal business of public interest which has occupied the
attention of the Council relates to the extension of accurate magne-
tical and meteorological observations in different parts of the world.
    A communication having been made by Lieut. William Denison,
of the Royal Engineers, of a proposal from General Mulcaster, In
spector-General of Fortifications, that the officers of engineers ge
nerally should be employed, under the direction of the Royal Society,
in promoting the advancement of science, by carrying on connected
series of observations relating to Natural History, Meteorology,
Magnetism, and other branches of physical science, and suggesting
an application to Government for a grant of funds necessary for ef
fecting so desirable an object ; a Committee was appointed to con
sider of the proposed measure, and of the means of carrying into
 effect the recommendations    contained in the letter of Baron Von
Humboldt, addressed in April last to His Royal Highness the Pre
sident. Conformably with the report made by this Committee, the
Council fixed on the ten following places, namely, Gibraltar, Corfu,
Ceylon, Hobart Town, Jamaica, Barbadoes, Newfoundland, Toronto,
Bagdad, and the Cape of Good Hope, as being the most eligible for
carrying on magnetic observations according to the plan recom
mended by Baron Von Humboldt ; those places being permanent
stations, where officers of engineers and clerks are always to be
found.    The Council also determined that, for the present, the ob
servations of magnetism may be limited to those of the direction of
the magnetic needle, and the meteorological observations restricted
to those made on the four days, and in the manner recommended in
 Sir John Herschel's instructions.
    A grant of 500/. from the public funds has since been obtained
from the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, in aid of
the purchase of the necessary instruments for carrying on the mag
netic observations, according to the plan proposed by the Committee,
and under the directions of the Royal Society.
    A statement having been also laid before the Council by Mr.
Christie of the importance of a more accurate determination than
has hitherto been made of the variation of the magnetic needle at
several points on the coasts and in the interior of Great Britain and
Ireland, and likewise of the dip and of the intensity of terrestrial
 magnetism, the Council, fully concurring in these views, presented
to the Lords of the Admiralty a strong recommendation that steps
should be taken for carrying into effect the course of observations
pointed out by Mr. Christie ; and their Lordships have in conse
quence appointed a Committee to meet and examine into this im
portant subject.
    The Council having deemed it desirable that the difference of level

                                                       I

between the brass mark fixed by Capt. Lloyd on the north-east
landing stairs of the New London Bridge, and Mr. Bevan's mark on
the basement of the pilasters of the north-east landing stairs of
Waterloo Bridge, should be accurately determined, requested Sir
John Rennie to undertake this determination. Sir John Rennie has
reported to the Council that, after repeated trials, the greatest varia
tion of which did not exceed two-tenths of an inch, he found that
 the mark on Waterloo Bridge is 3 feet and 1-65 inches above that
 on New London Bridge.
     The Council have awarded the Copley Medal of this year to M.
 Becquerel for his various Memoirs on the subject of Electricity,
 published in the " Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences de
 lTnstitut de France", and particularly for those on the production of
 Crystals of Metallic Sulphurets and of Sulphur, by the long-con
 tinued action of electricity of very low tension, and published in
 the tenth volume of those Memoirs.
      Among those who have been engaged in investigating the phae
 nomena of electricity, M. Becquerel holds an eminent rank, and
  the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris bear
  ample testimony to the success which has attended his researches
  in this department of science.       He appears early to have been sen
  sible that, for the detection of phaenomena which may occur at the
  instant of incipient molecular attraction, and which become masked
  by the more general effect of the transfer of the elements when
  powerful electric currents are employed, it was necessary to sub
  stitute for these currents of very low tension*.        Following out this
  view, carefully adjusting the strength of the current to the power of
  the affinities brought into action, he succeeded, by electric decom
  position, and by subsequent recomposition of the elements, in ob
  taining crystals of some of the metallic sulphurets, of sulphur, of
  the iodurets of lead and copper, of the insoluble sulphates of lime
  and barytes, of the carbonate of lead, and other substances, a few
   of which had previously, by other means, been obtained crystallized,
  but of which the great majority had only been recomposed in an
  amorphous state. In the Memoirs to which the Council have par
  ticularly adverted in the award of the Copley Medal to M. Bec
   querel, he had especially in view to explain, by the agency of elec
  tricity of very low tension, continued for an indefinite time, the oc
   currence of crystallized substances in mineral veins.              The suc
  cess with which his experiments           were crowned in obtaining by
  such means crystals of the metallic sulphurets and of other sub
   stances, perfectly resembling those found abundantly in mineral
   veins, is favourable to the correctness of the views he had enter
   tained ; and these views derive additional support from the results
   obtained by others, in perfect accordance with his own, by means
   differing from those he employed, but involving precisely the same
   principles. Mr. Fox, in his experiments, which appear to have been
      * Annales  de Chimie, tome xxxiv. p. 152. Memoire  lu a l'Academie Boyale
   des Sciences, &c,  21 Aout, 1826.

                                     33
 conducted on a larger scale than those of M. Becquerel, endeavoured
 more closely to imitate the arrangements of nature, by introducing,
 between the substances acted on, walls of clay, in imitation of the
 " flucan courses" in the Cornish mines ; these walls performing the
 same functions as the moistened clay in M. Becquerel's experiments ;
 and he infers from his results, that the phaenomena presented by the
 mineral veins of Cornwall are explicable on principles which are
 similar to those pointed out by M. Becquerel. It is thus rendered
 highly probable that the long-continued action of electricity of low
 tension has been at least one of the means by which crystallized
 bodies now existing in mineral veins have been produced.
     But quite independently of the bearing of M. Becquerel's results
 on a question of great geological interest, the formation of crystals
 of metallic sulphurets and other substances by the agency of elec
 tricity was a great step in chemical science. As M. Becquerel very
justly observes, the two branches of chemistry, analysis and syn
thesis, are at present in very different states. With the exception
 of crystals derived from aqueous solution, — which are by far the
least abundant of natural crystals, — and a few from fusion, the
 great mass of crystallized bodies existing in nature had as yet re
mained inimitable by chemical processes.             In the Memoirs re
 ferred to, not only are experiments described by which crystals
 of several of these substances have been obtained, but the principles
 are pointed out, by the application of which we may anticipate that
 large classes of others will be produced. M. Becquerel has thus
 opened a new field for inquiry and discovery, in which he has him
 self gathered the first fruits, but which still offers to future labourers
 the prospect of an abundant harvest of knowledge as regards both
 the recomposition of crystallized bodies, and also the processes
 which may have been employed by nature in the production of
 such bodies in the mineral kingdom.
     A Copley Medal has been awarded to John Frederick Daniell,
 Esq., for his two papers on Voltaic Combinations, published in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1836.
     The Council are desirous of testifying, by this award, their sense
 of the great value of Mr. Daniell's invention of a new form of the
 voltaic battery, capable of producing, for a considerable length of
 time, a perfectly equal and steady current of electricity.       The prin
 ciples on which his apparatus, which he terms the         constant battery,
 is constructed, were the results of a series of well-devised experi
 ments, directed to the discovery of the cause of those great and
 often rapid variations in the power of the ordinary battery, which
 have hitherto limited its utility when employed for purposes of
 philosophical research, and the removal of which has greatly ex
 tended the range and multiplied the applications of this powerful
 instrument of chemical analysis.
     The train of reasoning that led Mr. Daniell to this discovery,
  originated in an inquiry which he undertook with the view of de
 termining with precision the influence exerted by the different parts
  of the voltaic battery in their various forms of combination. For

                                     24
   this purpose he contrived an apparatus which he designates by the
   name of the dissected battery, and which consists of a series of cylin
   drical glass vessels capable of holding the fluid electrolyte, with a
    pair
          of metallic plates immersed in
                                          a it,
                                                 each plate communicating
      below by means of
                     a    separate wire, with    small quantity of mercury,
   as the medium of the various communications which may at pleasure
   be made with other metallic parts of the apparatus.        This arrange
   ment affords peculiar advantages for studying the difference of effect
   in reference to the quantity and the intensity of the electric current,
   consequent on the different modes of connecting the elements of the
   battery, and also the influence of retarding forces resulting from
   other modes of connexion. In the course of these researches
   Mr. Daniell, observing the great extent of negative metallic surface
   over which the deoxidating influence of the positive metal appeared
  to manifest itself, was induced to institute    a  more careful examina
  tion of the circumstances attending this class of phenomena, and was
  led to the discovery of the gradual deposition of zinc on the platina
  plates being the principal cause of the progressive        decline of the
  power of the battery. It was then that the means of counteracting
  this tendency presented itself to his mind. His plan consists in the
  constant application of a solution of sulphate of copper to the copper
  surface, while, at the same time, diluted sulphuric acid     isconstantly
  applied to the zinc surface, on which   it     exerts an oxidating anda
  solvent power, and  is    constantly renovated as   it  becomes charged
  with zinc. The two fluids are separated from one another by par   a
  tition formed of membrane, or other porous substance, which pre
  vents intermixture, but offers no obstacle to the transmission of
  galvanic action. Two principal objects are accomplished by this
  arrangement of the constituent parts of the battery first, the re
                                                           ;
  moval out of the circuit of the oxide of zinc, the deposit of which
 gradually reduces, and at length suspends, the action of the ordinary
 battery and secondly, the absorption of the hydrogen evolved upon
           ;
 the surface of the copper, without the precipitation of any substance
 tending to counteract the voltaic action of that surface.
     The advantages likely to arise to science from the invention of
 the constant voltaic battery are numerous and important.          Mr. Da
 niell has shown how it    may  be  made  to supply  a measure of chemical
 affinity, and has applied it   with effect in the investigation of the in
 fluence of changes of temperature on voltaic action.        The construc
 tion of a constant battery of large dimensions, which he has recently
 completed, has already opened new views of the possible application
 to economical purposes of the powers of voltaic electricity, an agent
of which the influence appears to be so energetic and so widely dif
fused throughout nature.
     The Council have adjudged one of the Royal Medals, in con
formity with the announcement made in 1834, to Mr. Whewell, for
his series of Researches on the subject of the Tides, which have been
published in our Transactions during the last three years.
     Mr. Whewell's researches have been chiefly directed to the three
following points first, the motion of the tide-wave at different points
                :

                                      25
   of the ocean ; secondly, the comparison of the observed laws at cer
   tain places with the theory ; and lastly, the laws of the diurnal in
   equality of the tide.
       It is to Mr. Lubbock that we are indebted for the first accurate
   comparison of the theory of the tides as given by Bernouilli in his
   treatise Du Jlux et reflux de la mer, with the results of observation
   as deduced from a period of nineteen years in the port of London.
   In this memoir, which was published in our Transactions for 1831,
   there was given a most elaborate discussion by Mr. Dessiou, under
   Mr. Lubbock's directions, of more than 13,000 observations, and
  the results were of great importance, not merely as furnishing the
  materials and the general rules for the construction of tide tables, but
  also for the general accordance which they exhibited with the equi
 librium theory of Bernouilli, particularly with respect to the semimen-
  strual inequality. This agreement was the more important, as af
  fording the indication of the real existence of a physical connection
  between the theory and observation, and as consequently justifying
  such a further examination of its consequences as might lead to the
 discovery or suggestion of such modifications of it as would lead to
 its general accordance with the laws of all the facts observed.
      In a subsequent discussion of the tides of Liverpool, published in
 our Transactions in 1835 and 1836, Mr. Lubbock showed, as had
 partly indeed been suggested by Mr. Whewell in his papers on the
 empirical laws of the tides of London and Liverpool, that by refer
 ring the tide, not to the lunar transit immediately preceding, but
 to an anterior lunar transit, one, two, or more days before, that the
 formulae furnished by the equilibrium theory would be brought into
 almost perfect accordance with the observed inequalities in the
 heights and times of the tides which are due to the changes in the
 moon's parallax. This was a most important step in the connexion
 between theory and observation, and has been found to apply, to a
 considerable extent, to all the periodical inequalities of the tides,
though very different epochs are required for different inequalities.
 Thus Mr. Whewell has shown that the diurnal inequality in the
heights of high and low water, which is due to the change in the
moon's declination, would require to be referred to the lunar transit
four days preceding.
     But though the formulae furnished by theory can be thus adjusted
to represent generally the results of observation for any assigned
station, yet our theory is quite incompetent to assign the physico-
mathematical grounds upon which such adjustments are made : the
complete solution of such a problem would probably require a know
ledge of the laws of hydrodynamics much beyond that which we
now possess.
     The first memoir which was published by Mr. Whewell was an
" Essay towards a first approximation to a map of cotidal lines," and
appeared in our Transactions for 1 833.
     By cotidal lines, Mr. Whewell means those lines which may be
drawn through all those points of the ocean which have high-water
at the same moment of absolute time.

                                   26
    By analysing the movements of the tides as determined by the most
simple considerations of the laws of fluid motion in open seas and in
channels, and by explaining the circumstances of their convergence
or divergence, their interference with each other, their retardation
in shallow water, and their consequent tendency to sweep round the
coasts and to approach them almost perpendicularly ; and further,
by discussing very carefully all the materials which nautical surveys
and books of navigation could furnish him, Mr. Whewell was en
abled to construct a map, which not only represented the general
circumstances of the tides of the coasts of Great Britain, but like
wise the movement of the great tidal wave, on the coasts of Europe,
in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Indian seas, and on the coasts of New
Zealand.
    It was with a view to correct this first approximation to a map
of cotidal lines that Mr. Whewell procured a very extensive series
of observations to be made on the coasts of Great Britain and Ire
land at 547 stations of the Coast Guard for an entire fortnight in
June, 1834. These observations were repeated in June, 1835, and
were accompanied by simultaneous observations made by the great
maritime powers of Europe and North America, at the request of
the Government of this country, at various stations on their coasts.
The immense mass of observations, thus furnished, were reduced,
under Mr. Whewell's directions, at the expense of the Admiralty,
and some of the results, which are extremely important and in
teresting, have been communicated by him to the Royal Society in
two Memoirs in our Transactions for 1835 and 1836.           The last of
these Memoirs was accompanied by a second map of the cotidal
lines of the coasts of Europe, accompanied also by indications, ef
fected by a peculiar notation, of the total range, in yards, of the tides
at the different stations at which observations had been made.
    Many very remarkable conclusions with respect to the motion of
the tide-wave have resulted from these observations ; amongst
others may be mentioned the rotatory motion of the tide-wave
which enters the German Ocean between the Orkneys and Norway,
sends a southerly detachment along the coasts of Great Britain,
which is reflected from the projecting coast of Norfolk upon the
north coast of Germany, and meets the main wave again on the
coast of Denmark.
    It is impossible in the course of a very brief abstract like the
 present to notice all Mr. Whewell's researches in detail.            His
 second great object was to compare the observed laws of the tides
with the theory, or to propose such modifications of the forms of
 the theory as would reconcile it with the observations.
    The interest which attaches to such investigations, which is so
 great during the progress of the structure which is to be raised
 upon them, ceases in many cases when the fabric is completed :
 a remark which is applicable to many of the most important re
 searches and discoveries in philosophy, where we are accustomed to
 regard the last form only in which the theory is compared with the
 facts which are observed, and to forget or to neglect the series of

                                      27
laborious investigations which have led to its establishment, but
which are no longer necessary for its explanation or proof. This
observation may be applied, in some degree, to his very ingenious
Memoir " On the Empirical Laws of the Port of London", in which
he attempts to deduce from observation and from very simple ge
neral considerations, the character of the formulae for determining
the establishment, the semimenstrual inequality, the corrections for
lunar and solar parallax and declination, both as affecting the times
and the height of high water.           Similar observations may be ex
tended to his papers on the " Empirical Laws of the Tides of the
 Port of Liverpool," and also on the " solar inequality and diurnal
 inequality" of the tides at the same place, which are full of valuable
 suggestions which the subsequent investigations of Mr. Lubbock
 have, in some cases, very remarkably confirmed and extended.
      The last of the series of researches of Mr. Whewell relate to the
 diurnal inequality of the height of the tide, which the discussion of
 the tides at Liverpool had exhibited, though under circumstances
 much less striking than those which characterize its appearance in
 other places.     The first of his memoirs on this subject relates to the
  diurnal inequality at Plymouth and Sincapore, at the last of which
 places its magnitude is very remarkable, making a difference of not
 less than six feet in the height of morning and evening tide, and quite
  sufficient to obliterate, under certain circumstances, one of the semi
  diurnal tides, and explaining certain phaenomena in the tides which
  have been considered as cases of interference. Mr. Whewell was
  led, from certain remarkable changes in the epoch of this phaeno
  menon, which seemed to be deducible from the observations at Bris
  tol, Liverpool and Leith, to suspect that its progress along the coasts
  of Europe and Great Britain was retarded according to some regular
  law.     His subsequent discussion, however, of the simultaneous ob
  servations made in June, 1835, with an especial view to this in
  equality, showed that the differences of diurnal inequality were go
  verned by local causes, and consequently negatived altogether the
  hypothesis of its progressive propagation according to a law distinct
   from that of the other inequalities of the tides.
       The preceding abstract of Mr. Whewell's Researches on the Tides
  is necessarily very brief and imperfect, and little calculated to con
   vey to the minds of those who have not read his very extensive series
   of memoirs an adequate notion of the amount of labour and of
   thought which the discussion of such extensive series of observa
   tions must have required.
       The importance of the results which have been obtained by him
   and Mr. Lubbock, may be best estimated by the rapid advancement
   which has been made in our knowledge of the laws which regulate
   the movements of the tides during the last six years, and which is
   entirely owing to their joint labours. Theory, though little culti
   vated and little known, was then in advance of observation : tide
   tables were constructed by unpublished rules, which formed a pro
   fitable possession to those to whom the secret was known : and the
    distinctive characters of the tides in the different ports of this king

                                    28
dom, that of Liverpool perhaps excepted, were confined to the expe
rience and tact of those who were accustomed to use them ; but how
different is the case at present ! The rules for the construction of tide
tables are not only public property, but are based upon the most ex
tensive observations : laws, whose existence was hardly suspected,
are now distinctly laid down : the progress of the waves in the most
frequented parts of the ocean is beginning to be accurately deve
loped : theory, which was formerly in advance of observation,
though greatly improved in those parts of it which do not involve
the hydrodynamical laws of the ocean, is now greatly behind it ;
and such a basis of facts has been laid down as may enable the
mathematician to commence such a series of investigations, as may
terminate in enabling another Laplace to give to the theory of the
tides a form which may rival, in the certainty of its predictions, the
almost perfect theories of physical astronomy.

JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN,                Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair.
   The reading of a paper, entitled " On low Fogs and stationary
Clouds."     By William Kelly, M.D. Communicated by Captain
Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S., &c, was resumed and concluded.
   The object of the present paper is to point out the circumstances
which influence the formation of low fogs, and to show what ana
logy exists between the causes that produce them and those that
occasion certain forms of clouds, which may be considered as differ
ing from fogs only in position. Having been attached for several
years to the naval party employed in the survey of the gulf and river
of St. Lawrence, the author had ample opportunities of observing the
phenomena in question. He concludes that the fogs described oc
cur chiefly when the air is nearly saturated with moisture, and when
at the same time the temperature of the water on which they rest
either exceeds that of the air, or is considerably below it. These
fogs are generally very dense, often limiting the sphere of vision to
a few fathoms ; but seldom extend to any considerable height.
They do not often cover the land to any distance from the shore ;
 and the tops of the hills, close to the water's edge, are clear, while
 the bases, or sides, are enveloped in the mist.
    The following papers were then read : —
    " On the Colours of Mixed Plates." By Sir David Brewster,
 K.G.H., F.R.S., &c.
    In the prosecution of his optical inquiries, the author was induced
 to study the phenomena     of mixed plates, (originally discovered by
 Dr. Young,    and described by him in the Philosophical Transactions
 for 1 802,) as he had observed similar appearances in various mineral
 bodies under analogous circumstances, to which he had been led to

                                      34
   ascribe an origin different from that assigned by Dr. Young.         In
  order to obtain a more distinct view of these colours, Sir David
  Brewster employed, instead of the substances used by Dr. Young,
  the white of an egg, beat up into froth, and pressed into a thin film
  between plates of glass. From observations of the colours exhibited
  by plates so prepared, and also by the edge of a thin film of nacrite
  in contact with copaivi balsam, the author deduces the conclusion,
  that all these phenomena, as well as those often seen in certain
  specimens of mica through which titanium is disseminated, and also
  in sulphate of lime, are cases of diffraction, where the light is ob
  structed by the edges of very thin transparent plates placed in a
 medium of different refractive power.         If the plate were opake,
  the fringes produced would be of the same kind as those often
  noticed, and which are explained on the principle of interference ;
 but, owing to the transparency of the plate, fringes are produced
 within its shadow ; and, owing to the thinness of the plate, the
 light transmitted through it is retarded, and, interfering with the
 partial waves which pass through the plate, and with those which
 pass beyond the diffracting edge with undiminished velocity, modify
 the usual system of fringes in the manner described by the author
 in the present paper.
     " Of  such Ellipsoids, consisting of homogeneous     Matter, as are
 capable of having the Resultant of the Attraction of the Mass upon
 a Particle in the Surface, and a Centrifugal Force caused by re
 volving about one of the Axes, made perpendicular to the Surface."
 By James Ivory, K.H., M.A.. F.R.S. L. and Ed., Inst. Reg. Sc.,
 Paris, Corresp. et Reg. Sc. Gotting. Corresp.
     Lagrange, who has considered the problem of the attractions of
 homogeneous ellipsoids in all its generality, and has given the true
 equations from which its solution must be derived, inferred from
 them that a homogeneous       planet cannot be in equilibrium unless it
 has a figure of revolution.    But M. Jacobi has proved that an equi
 librium is possible in some ellipsoids of which the three axes are un
 equal and have a certain relation to one another.        His transcend
ental equations, however, although adapted to numerical computa
tion on particular suppositions, still leave the most interesting points
of the problem unexplored.
     The author of the present paper points out the following property
as being characteristic of all spheroids with which an equilibrium is
possible on the supposition of a centrifugal force.      From any point
in the surface of the ellipsoid draw a perpendicular to the least axis,
and likewise a line at right angles to the surface : if the plane pass
ing through these two lines contain the resultant of the attractions
of all the particles of the spheroid upon the point in the surface,
the equilibrium will be possible, otherwise it will not. For the re
sultant of the centrifugal force and the attraction of the mass must
be a force perpendicular to the surface of the ellipsoid, which re
quires that the directions of the three forces shall be contained in

                                       35
 one plane.     This determination obviously comprehends all spheroids
 of revolution ; but, on account of the complicated nature of the at
 tractive force, it is difficult to deduce from it whether an equilibrium
 be possible or not in spheroids of three unequal axes, a problem which
 is unconnected with the physical conditions of equilibrium, and
 which is a purely geometrical question respecting a property of cer
 tain ellipsoids.
    The author then enters into an analytical investigation, from
 which he deduces the fundamental equation
            B-rr* = c-nrvi                                             (L)
the three axes of the ellipsoid being
                     k,  *V0      + *).   WO
and A, B, C, constants, afterwards expressed by certain definite in
tegrals.    He then remarks that every ellipsoid which verifies this
formula is capable of an equilibrium when it is made to revolve with
a proper angular velocity about the least axis ; for, in this case, the
centrifugal force will be represented in quantity and direction by a
line such that the resultant of this force and the whole attraction of
the ellipsoid upon a point in the surface will be perpendicular to the
surface.    Lagrange had concluded that the equation (1), which re
sults immediately from his investigations, admits of solution only in
spheroids of revolution, that is when X = X' and B = C ; but by ex
pressing the functions A, B, C in elliptic integrals, M. Jacobi has
found that the equation may be solved when the three axes have a
particular relation to one another. In order to ascertain the precise
limits within which this extension of the problem is possible, and to
determine the ellipsoid when the centrifugal force is given, the au
thor has recourse to the equations of Lagrange, which contain all
the necessary conditions, and he deduces the equations
where   f  represents the intensity of the centrifugal force at the di
stance equal to unity from the axis of rotation, and remarks that
these equations coincide with the equations of Lagrange.          Substi
tuting for   A,  B, C certain definite integrals given  in the Me'canique
Celeste, he deduces three equations expressing the value of g, the
ratio of the intensity of the centrifugal to that of the attractive force,
one of these being expressed in terms of the density and the other
two in the form of definite integrals; and then remarks that " these
equations comprehend all ellipsoids that are susceptible of equili
brium on the supposition of a centrifugal force."
   He then applies these equations to the more simple case of the
spheroid of revolution, where X = X' = I, and determines the value
of /
                                 /=  2-5293,

                                     36
and the     corresponding maximum value of g = 0-3370, and re
marks    that, " with respect to spheroids of revolution, it thus ap
pears    that an equilibrium is impossible when g, or its value
in terms of the density, is greater than 0-3370. In the extreme
case, when g is equal to 0-3370, there is only one form of equi
librium, the axes of the spheroid being
               k and k  */{l  + (2-5293)2} or    2 7197  A;
but when g is less than 0'3370 there are two different forms of equi
librium, the equatorial radius of the one being less, and of the other
greater than 2-7197 k, k being the semi-axis of rotation.
    The number of the forms of equilibrium in spheroids of revolution,
he remarks, is purely a mathematical deduction from the expression
of the ratio of the centrifugal to the attractive forces ; and as this has
been known since the time of Maclaurin, the discussion of it was all
that was wanted for perfecting this part of the theory.
    Returning to the general equations of the problem, the author
 deduces the equations
                                  da
                                   d <p
                                  r dr
where a is a definite integral,    such that
                          da             da'
                    p = X X'   and   tj = (X
                                             — X')5,
 which equations     apply exclusively to ellipsoids with three unequal
 axes, and solve the problem with regard to that class.       From these
 he derives another equation, which he states is no other than a trans
 formation of his first fundamental equation, and is equivalent to
 other transformations of the same equation found by M. Jacobi and
 M. Liouville.
    He also remarks that a limitation of one of the constants, which
 the verification of this formula requires, agrees with the limitation of
 M. Jacobi ; and further, that the relations which may subsist be
 tween the constants proves that there does exist an infinite number
 of ellipsoids not of revolution, which are susceptible of an equili
 brium.
    After determining the corresponding limits of these relations of
 the constants, p being contained between the limits 1-9414 and 1,
 while r2 increases from zero to infinity, he remarks that an elliptical
 spheroid formed of a homogeneous fluid can be in equilibrium by
 the action of a centrifugal force only when it revolves about the least
 axis.
    He next deduces the general value of g (the ratio of the forces),
 and thence its value in one extreme case, when r2 = 0, or when

                                     37
 >. and A.' are equal, and remarks that this is no other than the deter
 mination of g in a spheroid of revolution having its axes equal to
                     k and A  V 2-9414 = * X    1-7150.
 In the other   extreme case, when r* is infinitely great, g is zero,
    From this investigation the conclusion is arrived at, that for every
given value of t2 there is only one value of p, and only one ellip
soid ; and that to every such ellipsoid there is an appropriate value
of g : and, further, that for every possible value of g there will be
only one value of t2, and consequently only one ellipsoid susceptible
of an equilibrium.

JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN,                 Esq., Vice-President,   in the Chair.
    The ballot for Bryan Donkin, Esq., was postponed in consequence
 of the number of Fellows required by the Statutes not being present.
    The reading of a paper, entitled " Experimental Researches in
 Electricity," Eleventh Series, by Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L.,
 F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Chemistry        at the Royal Institution,
 &c,    was resumed and concluded.
     The object of this paper is to establish two general principles re
 lating to the theory of electricity, which appear to be of great im
 portance ; first, that induction is in all cases the result of the actions
 of contiguous particles ; and secondly, that different insulators have
 different inductive capacities.
     The class of phenomena usually arranged under the head of in
  duction are reducible to a general fact, the existence of which we may
  recognise in all electrical phenomena whatsoever ; and they involve
 the operation of a principle having all the characters of a first, essen
 tial and fundamental law. The discovery which he had already made
  of the law by which electrolytes refuse to yield their elements to a
  current when in the solid state, though they give them forth freely
 when liquid, suggested to the author the extension of analogous ex
  planations with regard to inductive action, and the possible reduction

                                      38
of many dissimilar phaenomena to one single comprehensive law.
As the whole effect upon the electrolyte appeared to be an action
of the particles when thrown into a peculiar polarized state, he was
led to suspect that common induction itself is in all cases an action
of contiguous particles, and that electrical action at a distance, which
is what is meant by the term induction, never occurs except through
the intermediate agency of intervening matter. He considered that a
test of the correctness of his views might be obtained by tracing the
course of inductive action ; for if it were found to be exerted in curved
lines it would naturally indicate the action of contiguous particles,
and would scarcely be compatible with action at a distance. More
over, if induction be an action of contiguous particles, and likewise
the first step in electrolyzation, there seemed reason to expect some
particular relation of this action to the different kinds of matter
through which it is exerted ; that is, something equivalent to a
specific electric induction for different bodies ; and the existence of
such specific powers would be an irrefragable proof of the dependence
of induction on the intervening particles. The failure of all attempts
to produce an absolute charge of electricity of one species alone, in
dependent of the other, first suggested         to the author the notion
that induction is the result of actions among the individual and con
tiguous particles of matter, having both forces developed to an ex
tent exactly equal in each particle.
   The author describes various experiments, with the view of show
ing that no case ever occurs in which an absolute charge of one spe
cies of electricity can be given. His first experiments were conducted
 on a very large scale : an insulated cube, twelve feet in the side,
consisting of a wooden frame, with wire net-work, every part of
which was brought into good metallic contact by bands of tin foil,
hacha, glass tube, containing a wire in connexion with a large elec
trical "machine, passed through its side, so that about four feet of the
tube entered within the cube and two feet remained without ; but it
was found impossible in any way to charge the air within this appa
ratus with the least portion of either electricity.
    For investigating the question whether induction is an action of
contiguous particles, the author employed, as an electrometer, the
torsion balance of Coulomb with certain alterations and additions ;
and for deciding that of specific inductive capacity, a new apparatus,
constructed for that express purpose. This apparatus consisted of
two hollow brass spheres, of very unequal diameters, the smaller
placed within the larger, and concentric with it ; the interval be
tween the two being the space through which the induction was to
be effected.     The apparatus had a tube in the lower part, furnished
with   a stop-cock, by means of which it might be connected with an
air-pump or filled with any required gas. In place of the lower hemi
spherical shell of air, occupying the interval between the two
spheres, any solid dielectric, of the same form, such as shell-lac,
glass, or sulphur, might be substituted.      Two of these instruments,
precisely   similar in every respect,  were  constructed, and the author
ascertained that the inductive power was the same in both, by alter

                                   39
nately charging each and dividing the charge with the other, and
finding that, in all cases, the charge remaining in the one, and also
that received by the other, was very nearly half the original charge.
    The experiments on which the author principally relies in support
of the correctness of his views relative to induction being exerted in
curved lines, are the following : a brass ball being laid on the top
of an excited cylinder of shell-lac placed vertically, the charge
which a carrier ball received when brought to different points near
to the brass sphere was measured by means of the electrometer ; and it
was inferred, from the character of the electricity, that the charge
was one by induction, and from its measure, that it proceeded in
curved lines. By substituting for the brass sphere a disc of metal
above the shell-lac cylinder.it was found that when the carrier ball was
brought near to the middle of the disc no charge was communicated,
although a sensible one was obtained at the edge of the disc, and
also at a point above its centre, farther removed from the excited
cylinder.    Corresponding and very striking results were obtained
when a brass hemisphere was placed on the top of the cylinder of lac.
The charge communicated at the centre of the hemisphere was only
one-third of that obtained at the edge of its periphery ; but by taking
it at a point at some height above the centre, and consequently much
farther removed from the inducing cause, the charge was nearly
equal to that of the periphery. Here, the author remarks, the in
duction fairly turned a corner, exhibiting both the curved lines or
courses of its action, when disturbed from their rectilineal form by
the shape, position and condition of the metallic hemisphere ; and
also a lateral tension, so to speak, of these lines on one another ; all
depending on induction being an action of the contiguous particles
of the dielectric thrown into a state of polarity and tension, and mu
tually related by their forces in all directions. In the foregoing ex
periments the dielectric was air; but they were afterwards varied by
substituting a fluid, as oil of turpentine, and likewise a few solid
dielectrics, namely, shell-lac, sulphur, carbonate and borate of lead,
flint-glass, and spermaceti, and with these, corresponding results
were obtained.     These results, the author considers, cannot but be
admitted as arguments against the received theory of induction,
 and in favour of that which he has put forth.
    In the course of these experimental researches, some effects due
 to conduction, which had not been anticipated, and which were si
 milar to the residual charge in the Leyden jar, had been obtained
 with such bodies as glass, lac, sulphur, &c. If the inductive appa
 ratus, fitted with a hemispherical cup of shell-lac, after having re
 mained charged for fifteen or twenty minutes, was suddenly and per
 fectly discharged, and then left to itself, it would gradually recover
 a very sensible charge ; the electricity which thus returned from an
 apparently latent to a sensible state being always of the same kind
 as that given by the charge.    This return charge is attributed to an
 actual penetration, by conduction, of the charge to some distance
 within the dielectric at each of its two surfaces, and several experi

                                     40
  ments are adduced in support of this view. With shell-lac and sper
 maceti the return charge was considerable ; with glass and sulphur
 it was much less ; but with air, no decided effect of the kind could
 be obtained.     As this was an effect which might interfere with the
 results, in the method the author adopted for deciding the question
 of specific inductive capacity, and as time was requisite for this pe
 netration of the charge, its influence on these results was guarded
 against by allowing, between the successive operations, as little
 time as possible for this peculiar action to arise.
    The author thus states the question of specific inductive capacity
 which he had proposed to investigate : — Suppose A an electrified
 plate of metal suspended in the air, and B and C two exactly similar
 plates, placed parallel to and on each side of A, at equal distances,
 and uninsulated    ;  A will then induce equally towards B    and C.    If
 in this position of  the plates, some other dielectric than air, as shell-
 lac, be introduced between A and C, will the induction between them
 remain the same ; or will the relation of C and B to A be altered
 by the difference of the dielectrics interposed between them ?
    The experiment of Coulomb, from which it appeared that a wire
 surrounded by shell-lac took exactly the same quantity of electricity
 from a charged body, as the same body took in air, seemed to the
 author to be no proof of the truth of the assumption, that, under
 such variation of the circumstances as he had supposed, no change
 would occur. Entertaining these doubts as to the conclusions deducible
 from Coulomb's result, he had the apparatus previously described
 constructed, as being well adapted for this investigation.      After re
jecting glass, resin, wax, naphtha, oil of turpentine, and other sub
 stances, as unfit for the purpose in view, he chose shell-lac as the sub
 stance best calculated to serve as an experimental test of the question.
    For the purpose of comparing the inductive capacities of shell-lac
 and air, a hemispherical cup of shell-lac was introduced into the lower
hemisphere of one of the inductive apparatus, so as to nearly fill the
 lower half of the space between the two spheres ; and their charges
were divided in the manner already described ; each apparatus being
 used in turn to receive the first charge, before its division with the
 other.    As the two instruments were known to have equal inductive
 powers when air was contained in both, any deficiencies resulting
from the introduction of the shell-lac would show a peculiar action
in it, and, if unequivocally referable to a specific inductive influence,
would establish the point in question.
    The air apparatus being charged, and its disposable charge being
290°, this charge was divided between the two.         After the division
the charge in the lac apparatus was 113°, and in the air apparatus
114°. From this it appears, that whilst by the division the induction
through the air lost 176°, that through lac gained only 113°. As
suming that this difference depends entirely on the greater facility
possessed by shell-lac of allowing or causing inductive action through
its substance than that possessed by air, then the capacity for electric
induction would be inversely as the respective loss and gain ; and as

                                    41
-suming the capacity of the air apparatus     as unity, that of the shell-
lac  apparatus would be    yjg or l-55.
    When the shell-lac apparatus was first charged, and then the
charge divided with the air apparatus, it appeared that the lac appa
 ratus, in communicating a charge of 118°, only lost a charge of 86°.
 This result gives 1-37 as the capacity of the lac apparatus.
    Both these results, the author considers, require a correction ;
the former being in excess, the latter in defect.      Applying this cor
rection, they become l-50 and 1-47.        From a mean of these and se
veral similar experiments, it is inferred that the inductive capacity of
the apparatus having the hemisphere of lac is to that with air as
1-50 tel.
   As the lac only occupied one half of the apparatus containing it,
the other half being filled with air, it would follow from the foregoing
result, that the inductive capacity of shell-lac is to that of air as
2 to 1.
    From all these experiments and from the constancy of their results
the author deems the conclusion irresistible, that shell-lac does ex
hibit a case of specific inductive capacity.
    Similar experiments with flint-glass gave its capacity 1-76 timesthat
of air. Using in like manner a hemisphere of sulphur, it appeared
that the inductive capacity of that substance was rather above 2-24
times that of air, and the author considers this result with sulphur
 as one of the most unexceptionable.
    With liquids, as oil of turpentine and naphtha, although the re
 sults are not inconsistent with the belief, that these liquids have a
 greater specific inductive capacity than air, yet the author does not
 consider the proofs as perfectly conclusive.
    A most interesting class of substances, in relation to specific in
 ductive capacity, the gases or aeriform bodies, next came under the
author's review.
    With atmospheric air, and likewise with pure oxygen, change of
 density was found to occasion no change in the inductive capacity.
Nor was any change produced, either by an increase of temperature
or by a variation in the hygrometric state.
   The details are then given of a very elaborate series of experiments
with atmospheric air, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, muriatic acid,
carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and other
gases, undertaken with the view of comparing them one with an
other under a great variety of modifications. Notwithstanding the
striking contrasts of all kinds which these gases present, of property,
 of density, whether simple or compound, anious or catious, of high
 or low pressure, hot or cold, not the least difference in their capacity
 to favour or admit electrical induction through them could be per
 ceived. Considering the point established, that in all these gases
 induction takes place by an action of contiguous particles, this is
 the more important, and adds one to the many striking relations
 which hold among bodies having the gaseous form.

                                   42
    In conclusion, the author remarks, that induction appears to be
essentially an action of contiguous particles, through the interme
diation of which the electric force originating or appearing at a cer
tain place, is propagated to or sustained at a distance, appearing there
as a force of the same kind and exactly equal in amount, but oppo
site in its direction and tendencies.    Induction requires no sensible
thickness in the conductors which may be used to limit its extent,
for an uninsulated leaf of gold may be made very highly positive on one
surface, and as highly negative on the other, without the least inter
ference of the two states, as long as the induction continues. But with
regard to dielectrics, or insulating media, the results are very differ
ent ; for their thickness has an immediate and important influence
on the degree of induction.       As to their quality, though all gases
and vapours are alike, whatever be their state, amongst solid bodies,
and between them and gases, there are differences which prove the
existence of specific inductive capacities.
   The author also refers to a transverse force with which the direct
inductive force is accompanied.      The experimental proof of the ex
istence of such a force, in all cases of induction, is, from its bearing
on the phaenomena of electro-magnetism and magneto-electricity, of
the highest importance ; and we cannot but look forward with the
greatest interest to the promised communication in which these and
other phaenomena relating to this subject will be reviewed.

  "On   the Variation of a  Triple Integral." By Richard Abbott, Esq.
F.R.A.S.    Communicated    by Benjamin Gompertz, Esq., F.R.S.
   In the calculus of variations, the discovery of which has immor
talized the name of Lagrange, that illustrious mathematician, by
differentiating the function with respect to a new variable which en
ters intoit,  reduced the general problem of indeterminate maxima
and minima to the solution of an equation depending on the variation
of the given integral, whether single or multiple, and whose differ
ential coefficient contains any number of variables, or which even de
pends on other integrals. The author investigates, in the present
memoir, the case in which the given function    is
                                                a    triple integral its

W. L.     Wharton,    Esq.    Communicated by James F.       W. Johnston,
Esq., M.A., F.R.S. L. & Ed.
    The author, considering the generally received explanation of in
termitting springs, founded on the operation of a simple syphon, as
being insufficient to account for the phaenomena, inasmuch as the
water which has risen above the lower side of the bend of the
 syphon will merely trickle down its longer leg, and be expended
 before it can fill the whole area of that part of the syphon, has pro
 posed the following hypothesis for the solution of the difficulty.
 He conceives that the stream, while falling obliquely down the long
 leg of the syphon, is broken into drops, and carries along with it
 numerous air-bubbles, which, if the lower end of the tube have an
 abrupt bend upwards, will be impelled forwards, and escape at the
 open part ; thus occasioning a rarefaction of the remaining air in
 the tube sufficient to ensure its full operation as a syphon. A model
 is described, which the author constructed for the purpose of illus
 trating and corroborating his views.

         FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., Vice-President           and Treasurer,
                                  in the Chair.
     The reading of   a paper, entitled " Fourth Letter on Voltaic Com
  binations, with reference to the mutual relations of the generating
  and conducting surfaces ;" addressed to Michael Faraday, Esq.,
  D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.        By John Frederic Daniell, Esq., F.R.S., Pro
  fessor of Chemistry in King's College, London, was resumed and
  concluded.
      In this communication the author describes a series of experiments,
  made for the purpose of determining the distribution of the voltaic
  force from its source in the generating metal, as indicated by the de
  position of reduced copper in the constant battery ; and, considering
  that the voltaic combination most perfect in theory would be one
   formed by a solid sphere, or point, of the generating metal, sur
   rounded by a hollow sphere of the conducting metal, with an inter
  vening liquid electrolyte, he constructed an apparatus making as near
   an approximation as possible to these conditions.          It consisted of
   two hollow brass hemispheres, applied to each other by exterior

                                   44
flanges, and rendered water-tight by an intervening collar of leather-
In the centre of the hollow sphere thus formed, a ball of amalgamated
zinc was suspended by a well-varnished copper wire, connected with
one of the cups of a galvanometer, and was contained in a mem
branous bag holding the acid solution ; the whole being introduced
through a short tube in the top of the upper hemisphere, and the
remaining space being filled with a saturated solution of sulphate of
copper.    The galvanic circuit was completed by wires establishing
connexions between either hemisphere and the other cup of the galva
nometer.     For measuring the forces developed, sometimes the ordi
nary magnetic, but in the greater number of instances the calorific
galvanometer of De la Rive was employed ; the indications given by
these instruments were noted, on the completion of the circuit, in
various ways ; and the deposition of copper in the hemispheres was
examined after the apparatus had been in action for a certain number
of hours.
    The following are the conclusions which the author deduced from
a series of experiments thus conducted :
    1st. The force emanating from the active zinc centre diffuses itself
over every part of the upper hemisphere, from which there is a good
conducting passage for its circulation.
    2nd. The same amount of force is maintained by either hemisphere
indifferently ; but when both conducting hemispheres are in metallic
communication there is no increase of force.
    3rd. Although the force is not increased, it spreads itself equally
over the whole sphere.
    4th. When one hemisphere is connected with the zinc centre by
a short wire capable of affording circulation to the whole force, and
the other hemisphere is connected by a long wire, through the gal
vanometer, with the same centre, the equal diffusion of the force over
the whole sphere is maintained.
    5th. There is no greater accumulation of precipitated copper about
the point with which the conducting wires are brought into contact,
and towards which the force diffused over the whole sphere must
converge, than at any other point: proving that the force must diverge
from the centre equally through the electrolyte, and can only have
drawn towards the conducting wires in the conducting sphere itself.
Other experiments showed that the force is but slightly increased by
a great increase of the generating surface.
   The author's attention was next directed to ascertaining the nature
of the law according to which the force emanates from the zinc centre
to the surrounding conducting sphere.       With this view, a variety of
experiments   were  made   with the zinc in different positions in the in
terior of the sphere ; and from these it appeared that, whatever may
be its position, the whole force is the same.     From these results it
is inferred, that the force emanating from the zinc ball diffuses itself
over the surrounding conducting sphere in obedience to the well-
known law of radiant forces being in the inverse duplicate ratio of
the distance.
   Experiments of the same kind were likewise made with the pre

                                     45
vious combination inverted, that is, with a small copper ball in the
interior of a large hollow sphere of zinc ; and from these the author
concludes that, in this case also, the law of radiation is maintained,
although the force is reduced to one half of that obtained from the
former combination.
     In order to ascertain the effect of cutting off the lateral radiation
from the zinc ball, it was placed in a glass tube, six inches long,
within half an inch of the lower aperture, over which a piece of mem
brane was tied, and the tube plunged into the solution of copper con
tained in a brass hemisphere, so as to rest upon the bottom.          The
results obtained by this arrangement, as also those when the zinc ball
 was raised in the tube to the surface of the solution, showed that the
 action of the zinc ball had been propagated from the aperture of the
 glass tube, as from a centre, diverging from this in the solution.
     The experiments next described appear to have an important bear
 ing on a question of vital interest in the theory of electricity, which
 has been discussed by Mr. Faraday, in a paper recently read to this
 Society : viz., whether the forces emanating from a centre of electric
 action act, like other central forces, in straight lines ; or whether
 they are propagated from particle to particle in the surrounding mat- .
 ter, and may, consequently, when obstacles interfere with their
  rectilinear propagation, exert their influence in curved lines.       An
  elliptical plate of copper, one side of which was covered with
 lac varnish, was placed in an earthen pan, with the varnished
  side upwards, and covered to the depth of a few inches with
  the acid solution of copper.       The zinc ball, placed in the tube
 half an inch from the diaphragm, was plunged just below the surface
  of the solution, and the circuit being completed, the galvanometer
  indicated an action nearly equal to that which had been previously
  observed when both sides of the copper had been exposed.             The
  under side of the copper presented the appearance of a border of pre
  cipitated compact pink copper, varying from 1-j- to -J of an inch in
  width, and the remainder was covered with precipitated copper of a
  darker red colour, into which the border gradually passed; and similar
  results were obtained with a circular disc of copper, having one side
  varnished. It hence appears, that the under surface, which, by itself,
  is capable of sustaining from the ball in the centre of the solution an
   action nearly as great as the upper surface, when combined with the
  latter adds no more than about one-eighth part of its efficiency ; and
   whereas, with the upper surface, the action varies in some inverse
   ratio of the distance of the generating from the conducting surface,
   with the under surface, there is a maximum point, on both sides of
   which it decreases : and this point is doubtless dependent on the
   angle at which the force which radiates from the ball meets the edge
   of the plate. The author having been led to the conclusion, that the
   force developed by voltaic combinations is subject to the law of ra
   diant forces, had been utterly at a loss to understand how, upon this
   hypothesis, it could extend its influence to the side of a plate oppo
   site to that to which it was directed in right lines ; but having per
   used Mr. Faraday's " Eleventh series of experimental researches in

                                    4G
Electricity,"  all his own results appeared to fall in naturally with
the general views therein explained. He considers, that the direction
of the force through an electrolyte may be expressed in the very
words employed in that paper to describe that of the direct inductive
force in statical electricity, simply substituting the term Electrolyte
for Dielectric, and the term Current for Induction.
   Experiments are further described, in which the effects of various
combinations of different generating and conducting surfaces, placed
at different distances apart, were measured by the calorific galvano
meter, from which the following conclusions are drawn :
    1st. That the energy of the force is about sextupled by the ab
sorption of the hydrogen at the conducting surface ; except in the
case of equal plates, when it is more than quadrupled.
    2nd. That the effect of distance is much more decided in the in
stances where the amount of the circulating force is greater, than in
the contrary cases.
   3rd. That the amount of force put into circulation from a large
surface of zinc towards a central ball of copper, is, as in former in
stances of similar combinations, about one half of that from the re
verse arrangement.
   4th. That a ball of zinc, exposing a surface of 3-14 square inches,
placed over the centre of a plate of copper, exposing on its two sides
a surface of 28 square inches, sustains an action of nearly the same
amount as a plate of zinc, of the same dimensions as the copper,
placed at the same distance.
   In conclusion, the author remarks, that the principal circumstance
which limits the power of an active point within a conducting sphere,
in any given electrolyte, is the resistance of that electrolyte, which
increases in a certain ratio to its depth or thickness ; and this thick
ness may virtually be considered the same wherever the included
point may be placed, but increases with the diameter of the sphere.
In an insulated hemisphere, however, the approximation of the active
point to the lower surface virtually decreases the thickness of the
electrolyte, and consequently the force increases.       In this respect,
the action of a point upon a plate may be considered the same as
upon an indefinitely large hemisphere, towards which, as the point
approaches, the force increases.

                                  " Researches towards
                                                          establishing a
 Theory of the Dispersion of Light", No. IV. By the Rev. Baden
 Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Professor of Geometry in the Uni
 versity of Oxford.
    In his former communications to the Royal Society the author
 had instituted a comparison of the results of observation and of
 theory with regard to the dispersion of light, in the instances of the
 respective indices for the standard rays in fifteen different cases of
 transparent media; and had found a sufficiently close agreement in
 the cases which gave the lower numbers ; but there yet appeared to
be an increasing discrepancy as an advance was made towards the
higher. The theoretical formula employed in this investigation was
one derived from the undulatory hypothesis, by a process involving
some limitations, which rendered it only approximative. By pur
suing the calculations to a greater degree of developement, or by
adopting methods of a more precise character, such as those of M.
Cauchy and of Mr. Kelland, the author was led to hope that a more
close coincidence might be obtained.      The formulae of M. Cauchy,
however, involved calculations of so elaborate and overwhelming a
character, that he was induced to make trial of the method of Mr.
Kelland, applying it, in the first instance, to the case of the most
highly dispersive substance, namely, oil of Cassia, in which the
greatest discrepancy had before appeared.
    The object of the present communication is to state the results
obtained, together with the necessary data employed in the calcu
lations ; and also to elucidate the general method, so as to render it
more easily applicable to other cases which may arise in the further
prosecution of the determination of specific indices.     For this pur
pose a general statement is given of Mr. Kelland's method, in whose
formulae, it is easy, knowing the value of the wave-length in air,
and taking the indices as given by observation for that particular
medium, to introduce the values of the wave-length in the medium.
Two of the constants are then determined for that medium ; and by
the aid of these, combined with the indices given by observation,
a value of the third constant is deduced for each ray : and the veri
fication of the theory will result from the equality of the respective
values of this latter constant thus obtained.
    The author then gives tables exhibiting the comparison of observed
refractive indices with the results of Mr. Kelland's theory ; first, in
the case of sulphuret of carbon, at a temperature of 12° (centigrade) ;
next, of the same substance at 22° ; and lastly, of oil of Cassia :
from which it appears, that the accordance between the results of
observation and of theory is sufficiently within the limits of the
errors in the experimental data to satisfy all reasonable expectation.

    Experimental Researches in Electricity : Twelfth Series.    By Mi-
chael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Phy
siology in the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
    The object of the present series of researches is to examine how
far the principal general facts in electricity are explicable on the
 theory adopted by the author, and detailed in his last memoir, re
 lative to the nature of inductive action. The operation of a body
 charged with electricity, of either the positive or negative kind, on
 other bodies in its vicinity, as long as it retains the whole of its
 charge, may be regarded as simple induction, in contradistinction to
 the effects which follow the destruction of this statical equilibrium,
 and imply a transit of the electrical forces from the charged body to

                                   50
those at a distance, and which comprehend the phenomena of the
electric discharge.    Having considered, in the preceding paper, the
process by   which   the former condition is established, and which con
sists in the successive polarization of series of contiguous particles
of the interposed insulating dielectric ; the author here proceeds to
trace the process, which, taking place consequently on simple in
duction, terminates in that sudden, and often violent interchange of
electric forces constituting disruption, or the electric discharge. He
investigates, by the application of his theory, the gradual steps of
transition which may be traced between perfect insulation on the
one hand, and perfect conduction on the other, derived from the
varied degrees of specific electric relations subsisting among the par
ticular substances interposed in the circuit : and from this train of
reasoning he deduces the conclusion that induction and conduction
not only depend essentially on the same principles, but that they
may be regarded as being of the same nature, and as differing merely
in  degree.
   The fact   ascertained by Professor Wheatstone, that electric con
duction, even in the most perfect conductors, as the metals, requires
for its completion a certain appreciable time, is adduced in corrobo
ration of these views ; for any retardation, however small, in the
transmission of electric forces can result only from induction; the
degree of retardation, and, of course, the time employed, being pro
portional to the capacity of the particles of the conducting body for
retaining a given intensity of inductive charge. The more perfect
insulators, as lac, glass and sulphur, are capable of retaining electri
city of high intensity ; while, on the contrary, the metals and other
excellent conductors, possess no power of retention when the in
tensity of the charge exceeds the lowest degrees.        It would appear,
however, that gases possess a power of perfect insulation, and that
the effects generally referred to their capacity of conduction, are
only the results of the carrying power of the charged particles either
of the gas, or of minute particles of dust which may be present in
them : and they perhaps owe their character of perfect insulators to
their peculiar physical state, and to the condition of separation
under which their particles are placed. The changes produced by
heat on the conducting power of different bodies is not uniform; for
in some, as sulphuret of silver and fluoride of lead, it is increased ;
while in others, as in the metals and the gases, it is diminished by
an augmentation of temperature.
    One peculiar form of electric discharge is that which attends elec-
trolyzation, an effect involving previous induction; which induction
has been shown to take place throughout linear series of polarized
particles, in perfect accordance with the views entertained by the
author of the general theory of inductive action. The peculiar fea
ture of this mode of discharge, however, is in its consisting, not in
a mere interchange of electric forces at the adjacent poles of con
tiguous particles, but in their actual separation into their two con
stituent particles; those of each kind travelling onwards in contrary
directions, and retaining the whole amount of the force they had ac

                                      51
  quired during the previous polarization.     The lines of inductive ac
  tion which occur in fluid electrolytes are exemplified by employing
  for that purpose clean rectified oil of turpentine, containing a few
  minute fibres of very clean dry white silk; for when the voltaic circuit
  is made by the introduction into the fluid of wires, passing through
  glass tubes, the particles of silk are seen to gather together from all
 parts, and to form bands of considerable tenacity, extending between
 the ends of the wires, and presenting a striking analogy to the
 arrangement and adhesion of the particles of iron filings between the
 poles of a horse-shoe magnet.
     The fact that water acquires greater power of electrolytic induc
 tion by the addition of sulphuric acid, which not being itself decom
posed, can act only by giving increased facility of conduction, is ad
 duced as confirming the views of the author.
     The phenomena of the disruptive electric discharge are next ex
amined with reference to this theory: the series of inductive actions
which invariably precede it are minutely investigated : and reference
is made to the accurate results obtained by Mr. Harris, as to the law
of relation between the intensity of a charge, and the distance at
which a discharge takes place through the air.
     The theory of Biot and others, which ascribes the retention of a
charge of electricity in an insulated body to the pressure of the sur
rounding atmosphere, is shown to be inconsistent with various phe
nomena, which are readily explained by the theory adopted by the
author.
     The author then enters into an inquiry relative to the specific con
ducting capacities of different dielectrics.
     With a view of determining the degrees of resistance to the transit
of electricity excited by different kinds of gases, he constructed an
apparatus, in which an electric discharge could be made along either
of two separate channels ; the one passing through a receiver filled
with the gas, which was to be the subject of experiment, and the
other having atmospheric air interposed.       By varying the length of
the passage through the latter, until it was found that the discharge
occurred with equal facility through either channel, a measure was
afforded of the relative resistances in those two lines of transit, and
a determination consequently obtained of the specific insulating
power of the gas employed.
    The circumstances attending the diversified forms of the disruptive
discharge, such as the vivid flash or spark, the brush or pencil of
light, and the lucid point or star, which severally represent different
conditions of the sudden transit of electrical forces through an inter
vening dielectric, are minutely investigated in their various modifi
cations. The spark is the discharge, or reduction of the polarized
inductive state of many dielectric particles, by the particular action
of a few of those particles occupying but a small and limited space,
leaving the others to return to their original or normal condition in
the inverse order in which they had become polarized : and its path
is determined by the superior tension which certain particles have ac
quired, compared with others, and along which the action is accord

                                      52
ingly conducted in preference to other lines of transit. The variety
in the appearance of the electric spark taken in different gases may
be ascribed partly to different degrees of heat evolved, but chiefly to
specific properties of the gas itself with relation to the electric forces.
These properties appear also to give occasion to diversities in the
form of the pencil or brush, which takes place when the discharge
is incomplete, and is repeated at short intervals, according to the
shape of the conductor on either side, and according to the species
 of electricity conveyed.     The diverging, converging, bent and rami
fied lines presented in these different forms of electric discharge,
 strikingly illustrate the deflexions and curvilinear courses taken by
 the inductive actions which precede the disruption ; these lines being
 not unlike the magnetic curves in which iron filings arrange them
 selves when under the action of opposite      magnetic polarities.

 termining the Longitude, by an absolute Altitude of the Moon," by
 John Christian Bowring, Esq. Communicated by John George
 Children, Esq., F.R.S.
     The method employed by the author for determining the longitude
 by the observation of an absolute altitude of the moon, was pro
  posed, many years ago by Pingre\and Lemmonier; and the princin
  pal difficulty which stood in the way of its adoption, was its re
  quiring the exact determination of the moon's declination reduced
  to the place of observation. This difficulty the author professes to
  have removed by supposing two meridians for which the altitudes
  are to be calculated : and the only remaining requisite is the accu
  rate determination of the latitude, which presents no great difficulty,
  either on land or at sea. Examples are given of the practical work--
  ing of this method ; showing that if the latitude of a place of obser
  vation be obtained within a few seconds, the longitude will be found
  by means of a single observation of the altitude of the moon.

      A paper was   also read, entitled,    An Inquiry into a new   Theory
   of earthy Bases    of Vegetable Tissues,"    by the Rev.  J.  B. Reade,
   M.A., F.R.S.
      The author, after briefly noticing the results of some of his expe
   riments described in two papers which appeared in the Philosophical
   Magazine for July and November, 1837, and also those of Mr. Ro
   bert Rigg in a paper read to the Royal Society, next adverts to the
   theory of M. Raspail, detailed in his Tableau Synoptique, and Nou-
   veau Systeme de Chimie.      In opposition to some of the views enter

                                   53
tained' by the latter, he finds that in the bark of the bamboo and the
epidermis of straw the silica incrusting these tissues is not crystal
lized, but, on the contrary, exhibits, both before and after incinera
tion, the most beautiful and elaborate organization, consisting of an
arranged series of cells and tubes, and differing in its character in
different species of the same tribe, and in different parts of the same
plant.
   The observations of Mr. Golding Bird, contained in the 14th
number of the Magazine of Natural History, New Series, are then
referred to ; and the author states in confirmation, that, by employ
ing caustic potash, the siliceous columns may be removed from the
leaf of a stalk of wheat, while the spiral vessels and ducts, which
form the principal ribs of the leaf, as well as the apparently metallic
cups which are arranged on its surface, remain undisturbed.         He
proposes,   therefore, to  substitute, in the description of vegetable
tissues, the term skeleton, instead of that of bases, whether saline or
siliceous, of those tissues.

River Avon, in front of the Hotwell House, Bristol, in 1837."
Communicated by the Rev. William Whewell, M.A., F.R.S.
    The principal parts of the machine here described, are an eight-
day clock, which turns a vertical cylinder, revolving once in twenty-
four hours ; a wheel, to which an alternate motion is communicated
by a float rising and falling with the tide, and connected by. a wire
with the wheel which is kept constantly strained by a counterpoise;
and a small drum on the same axis with the wheel, which by a sus
pending wire communicates one 18th of the vertical motion of the
float to a bar carrying a pencil which marks a curve on the cylinder,
or on a sheet of paper wrapped round     it,
                                           exhibiting the rise and fall

 neral Wilson.     Communicated by S. H. Christie, Esq., M.A.,
 Sec. R.S.
    The author states that the Regar of India is found, by chemical
 analysis, to consist of silica, in a minute state of division, together
 with lime, alumina, oxide of iron, and minute portions of vegetable
 and animal debris.    Hence it is usually considered as having been
 formed by the disintegration of trap rocks : the author, however,
 after examining its numerous trap dykes traversing the formation of
 the ceded districts, which he found invariably to decompose into a
 ferruginous red soil, perfectly distinct from the stratum of black
 regar through which the trap protrudes, was led to regard this opi
 nion of its origin as erroneous : and from the circumstance of its
 forming an extensive stratum of soil covering a large portion of the
 peninsula of India, he believes it to be a sedimentary deposit from
 waters in a state of repose.
     Specimens of basaltic trap and of the R6gar soil were transmitted
 to the Society by the author, for the purpose of analysis.

                                            Experimental Researches in
Electricity," Thirteenth Series, by Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L.,
F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
    The author, in this paper, pursues the inquiry into the general
differences observable in the luminous phenomena of the electric
discharge, according as they proceed from bodies in the positive or
the negative states, with a view to discover the cause of those dif
ferences.    For the convenience of description he employs the term
inductric, to designate those bodies from which the induction ori
ginates, and inducteous to denote those whose electric state is dis
turbed by this inductive action. He finds that an electric spark,
passing from a small ball, rendered positively inducteous, to another
ball of larger diameter, is considerably longer than when the same

                                      55
ball is  rendered positively inductric; and that a similar difference,
though to a less extent, is observable, when the smaller ball is ren
dered negative. The smaller ball, rendered positive, gives also a
much longer spark than when it is rendered negative ; in which
latter case, however, it affords, at equal distances, a luminous brush
of greater size, and gives it much more readily than when positive.
In order to ascertain the relative degrees of charge which the balls
acquire before the occurrence of the discharge, the author employed
an apparatus attached to the insulated conductor of the electrical
machine, and also to the conductor connected with the discharging
train, and consequently uninsulated, consisting, on each side, of a
rod branching out in the form of a fork, and terminating, at one of
its extremities in a large ball, and at the other in a small one ; the
position of the forks being capable of adjustment, so that the large
ball of each rod might be brought exactly opposite to the small one
of the other : and the distances between each pair admitted of being
regulated at pleasure, until the discharges through each interval
 were rendered apparently equal to one another. From numerous
 experiments made with this instrument, the author concludes that
 when two conducting surfaces of small but equal size, are placed in
 air, and electrified, the one positively and the other negatively, a
 discharge takes place at a lower tension from the latter than from
 the former ; but that, when a discharge does occur, a greater quan
 tity of electricity passes at each discharge from the positive, than
 from the negative surface.      Experiments of a similar nature were
 made   in  gases of different kinds,  by enclosing them in an apparatus
 constructed on the same plan as the former one, but capable of act
 ing in a receiver, from which the air could be exhausted, and the
 particular gas, whose powers in modifying the electric discharges
 were to be ascertained,       could be introduced in its place. The
 results of various trials are given in a table, from which it appears
 that different gases restrain the discharge in very different degrees.
 The discharge from the small ball, through nitrogen and hydrogen
 gases, most readily takes place when the charge is positive ; and
 through oxygen, carbonic acid, and coal gas, when it is negative.
     The author next directs his attention to the peculiar luminous
 phenomena attending the disruptive electrical discharge, which he
 terms a glow, and which appears to depend on a quick, and almost
 instantaneous charge given to the air in the immediate vicinity, and
  in contact with the charged conductor ; and he enters into a de
 tailed account of the circumstances by which it is influenced, and
 its production favoured ; such as diminution of the charging sur
 face, increase in the power of the machine, rarefaction of the sur
  rounding air, and the particular species of electricity concerned.
  The relations which the glow, the brush, and the spark bear to one
  another, as well as the steps of transition between each are minutely
  investigated ; and the conclusion is deduced that the glow is in its
  nature exactly the same as the luminous part of a brush or ramifi
  cation, namely, a charge of air ; the only difference being that the
  glow has a continuous appearance from the constant renewal of the
  same action in the same place, whereas the ramification is occa

                                     56
 sioned by a momentary and independent action of the same kind.
The disruptive discharge may take place at degrees of tension so
low as not to give rise to any luminous appearance ; so that a dark
space may intervene in the line of actual discharge, as is frequently
observable   between the brush on one side, and the glow on the
other. Thus it is inferred that electric light is merely a consequence
of the quantity of electricity which, after a discharge has com
menced, flows and converges towards the spot where it finds the
readiest passage : and these conclusions are further confirmed by the
phenomena which take place in other gases, besides atmospheric
air, and which are specifically detailed by the author.
    The last kind of discharge which is here considered is the con-
vective or carrying discharge, namely, that effected by the transla
tion of charged particles from one place to another. The phenomena
attending this mode of transference are examined under various
aspects as they occur in air, in liquids of various kinds, in flame,
and as they are exhibited in the case of particles of dust, which
perform the office of carriers of the electricity; and also in that of
solids terminated by liquids.       Thus all these apparently isolated
phenomena     comprised   under    the  heads of the electric currents
which characterize electrolyzation, of transference through dielectrics
by disruptive discharges of various kinds, or by the actual motion of
charged particles, and of conduction through conductors of various
degrees of power, are assimilated to one another by their being
shown to be essentially the result of actions of contiguous particles
of matter assuming particular states of polarization.
    The author lastly considers electric currents, not only in their
effects on the bodies they traverse, but also in their collateral in
fluences as producing inductive and magnetic phenomena.            The
analogies, which connect electrolytic discharge with that by con
duction, are pointed out, as tending to show that they are essentially
the same in kind, and that when producing different kinds of mo
tion in the particles of matter, their mode of operation may be re
garded as identical.     An attempt is made to connect with these
views the lateral or transverse actions of currents, which are most
distinctly manifested in their magnetic effects ; these effects being
produced equally by the disruptive, the conductive, and the electro
lytic discharges, and probably depending on the transverse condition
of the lines of ordinary induction. This transverse power has the
character of polarity impressed upon it, and, in its simplest form,
appears as attractive or repulsive, according as the currents them
selves are in the same, or in opposite directions. In the current and
in the magnet it assumes the condition of tangential force ; and in
magnets and their particles it produces poles.
    The author announces that he intends shortly to develop, in an
other series of these researches, some further views which he enter
tains concerning the nature of electric forces and electric excitation
in connexion with the theory he has here advanced.

    A  paper was read, entitled,
                                    " An Account of a line of Levels,
carried across Northern Syria, from the Mediterranean Sea to the
River Euphrates."      By William Taylor Thomson, Esq., with Geo
logical and Botanical Notes, by William Ainsworth, Esq. Com
municated by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S., &c.
    The operation of carrying a line of levels across Northern Syria,
from the Mediterranean sea to the river Euphrates, was undertaken
by Colonel Chesney, at the time he commanded the expedition sent
to that river in the year 1835, chiefly with a view to determine the
capabilities of the intervening country for the establishment of com
munications by roads, railways, or canals ; but it was expected also
that the examination would afford information of much historical
and geographical interest.       It was commenced in August of the
same year, by Lieutenant Murphy and Mr. Thomson, assisted by
 Sergeant Lyne, R.E., Gunner Waddell, and some Maltese : but
most of the party being disabled by sickness, and their numbers re
duced by deaths and removals, the levelling was at length conduct
ed principally by Mr. Thomson, with the assistance, in the latter
part of the work, of Mr. Elliott, commonly called Dervish Ali. The
result of this great labour was to determine the bed of the Euphrates
 to be 628 feet above the level of the Mediterranean.
    The whole of the district over which the line of levels was carried
 naturally divides itself into four regions, each of which is character
 ized by its relative elevation, its peculiar geological structure, its
 vegetation, and the manners and habits of its population.
    The first region, commencing from the Euphrates, comprises the
 country of the upper chalk and conide limestones, which averages
 an elevation of 1300 feet, and is but slightly undulated.      The soil
 is light, somewhat stony, and of no great depth, and is highly pro
 ductive in crops of corn and cotton. These uplands are inhabited by
 stationary Turcomans and Arabs, who are a mixed race of Fellahs.
 The large plains of this region are studded over in every direction
 with numerous mounds, of a more or less circular form, called by
 the Arabs Tets, and by the Turcomans Heuks, the origin of which
 appears to be partly natural and partly artificial.  A village is found
 at the foot of almost every one of these monticules.

                                   58
    The second region comprises the country of ostracite limestone
and feldspath   pyroxenic rocks, in the valley of Ghuidaries and the
Aphrean, having a mean elevation of 450 feet.       This district is ex
tremely fertile, for the most part cultivated, and inhabited by agri
cultural Kurds.
    The third region is the lacustrine plain of Umk, elevated about
305 feet above the Mediterranean, and covered, for the most part,
with the gramineous plants which feed the flocks of the pastoral and
nomadic Turcomans.
    The fourth region, formed by the valley of Antioch, is rocky,
irregular, and varying from elevations of 220 to 440 feet. It com
prises also the alluvial plain of the Orontes, which gradually sinks
to the level of the Mediterranean.      This latter district is covered
with shrubs, which are chiefly evergreens ; and inhabited by a few
families of Syrians, who, in these picturesque solitudes, chiefly fol
low mysterious rites, presenting a mixture of Mahomedanism and
Christianity.
    It appears, from the examination of this line of country, that
there here exist two distinct regions, the one low and already fur
nished with the means of water transport ; and the other elevated,
where the waters, which are lost in the valley of Aleppo, might be
turned with facility into an artificial channel. Both regions are re
markably level, and present, when separately viewed, very few diffi
culties to be overcome for the construction of artificial roads.

                                 " Supplementary Note to the Thir
teenth Series of Experimental Researches in Electricity." Bv Mi
chael   Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
    The author   describes, in this supplementary note, experiments
made with the view of determining the specific inductive capacities
of dielectrics, by means of an apparatus of the following form. Three
circular brass plates were mounted, side by side, on insulated pillars;
the middle one was fixed, but the two outer plates were moveable on
slides, so that all three could be brought with their sides almost into
contact, or separated to any required distance. Two gold leaves
were suspended in a glass jar from insulated wires, connecting each
of the leaves respectively with the adjacent outer plate. The amount
of disturbance in the electric equilibrium of the outer plates pro
duced by interposing a plate of the dielectric substance to be tried,
after charging the middle plate, was taken as a measure of the spe
cific inductive capacity of that dielectric.  By varying the size and

                                      59
distances of the plates, and also the distance of the gold leaves from
one another, new conditions are supplied for the more exact deter
mination of the relative inductive powers of dielectrics of every de
scription ; and by sufficiently reducing the dimensions of the instru
ment, it may be rendered applicable to comparatively small masses
of dielectrics, such as crystals, and even diamonds.        An instrument
capable of such universal application the author proposes to desig
nate by the name of Differential Inductometer.
   Also read, a Letter addressed to P. M. Roget, M.D., Secretary
to the Royal Society, by James Ivory, Esq., F.R.S., accompanying
a paper on Astronomical Refractions. Communicated by Dr. Roget.
   The author adverts in this letter to the attempts made by New
ton to solve the problem of atmospherical refractions, which were
baffled by the experience that the observed quantities fall far short
of the theoretical deductions ; whence he justly inferred that some
new cause must be sought for capable of effecting that change in
the density of the lower part of the atmosphere which is required for
reconciling theory with observation.        It becomes necessary, in par
ticular, to investigate the law according to which the temperature
diminishes as the height increases.       The initial value of the rate of
diminution has to be determined by experiment ; and the introduc
tion of this new element into the equation of an atmosphere in equi
librium must be an approach to the true solution of the problem of
the refractions, and is indispensable if arbitrary assumptions are to
be avoided.      The author proceeds to notice Laplace's solution,
which, though highly ingenious, is nevertheless hypothetical; and
he adverts to the want of precision exhibited in Biot's dissertation
on the influence which the presence of aqueous vapour in the air
has on the refractions : but refers to the paper which accompanies
his letter for the further explanation of his views on this subject.

        FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., V.P.         and  Treas.,in  the Chair.
    His Imperial and Royal Highness Leopold          II., Grand duke of
 Tuscany, was elected a Fellow.
    The reading of   the paper by Mr. Ivory, " On the Theory of the
 Astronomical    Refractions,"  was concluded.
     In this communication, the author, after stating that the mean
 refractions are the object of investigation, and fully defining what
 he understands by this term, gives an historical review of what has
 been done up to the present time on this very important subject.
 Having stated that the foundation of the theory of astronomical re
 fractions was laid by Dominique Cassini, he deduces on Cassini's
 hypothesis (that of an homogeneous atmosphere) a formula for the
 refraction, which agrees exactly with that of La Place, employed in
 computing the first part of the table of mean refractions, published
 by the French Board of Longitude.
    The labours of our immortal countryman Newton, in this vast
 field of inquiry, are next reviewed.     As the density of the atmo
 sphere in ascending decreases gradually, the path described by a ray
 from a star, in its passage through the atmosphere, is not a straight
line, as it would be on Cassini's hypothesis, but is a curve more and
 more inflected towards the earth's centre.     In the Principia there is
found whatever is necessary for determining the nature of this curve,
 and, consequently, for solving the problem of the astronomical re
fractions, which consists in ascertaining the difference between the
direction of light when it enters the atmosphere, and its ultimate
 direction when it arrives at the earth's surface.
    On the principles established in the second section of the Prin
cipia, the author deduces equations requisite for the solution of the
problem of astronomical refractions, and remarks that these equations
are perfectly general, and will apply in any constitution of the at
mosphere that may be adopted.        In this investigation, in preference
to employing functions with peculiar properties to express the mole
cular action, the manner in which the forces act has been consider
ed.     When the light, in passing through the atmosphere, arrives at
a surface of increased density, it receives an impulse which may be
considered as instantaneous; and this impulse being distributed over
the breadth of a stratum of uniform density, ascertains the centripetal
force tending to the earth's centre, by the action of which the tra
jectory is described.
    It appears, that Newton himself was the first to apply this new
method to the problem of the astronomical refractions.         In his first
attempt he assumes that the densities decrease in ascending, in the
 same proportion as the distances from the earth's centre increase.
 On this supposition the author investigates a formula, which M. Biot
has also obtained, and which is equivalent to the construction com
municated by Newton to Flamsteed.           On this basis a table was
computed and communicated to Flamsteed; but Newton subsequent

                                       Gl
ly informed Flamsteed that he did not intend to publish               it,
                                                                   in con
sequence of serious objection to the supposed scale of densities.
             a
Adopting the principles in the twenty-second proposition of the
second book of his Principia, Newton,        appears, succeeded at length
                                                it
in computing second table of refractions, which he likewise com
               a
municated to Flamsteed, and which, there           every reason to think,
                                                      is
is the same which he gave to Halley, and which was inserted by that
astronomer in the Philosophical Transactions for 1721.         As the de
termining whether the two tables are identical          question of much
                                                           is
                                                            a
interest, the author enters very fully into it, and, from the results
of elaborate calculations, concludes that Halley's table         no other
                                                                     is
than the one which Newton calculated on the supposition that the
densities in the atmosphere are proportional to the pressures.          He
remarks that, as far as the mathematics are concerned, the problem
of the astronomical refractions was fully mastered by Newton.
    After referring to the labours of Brook Taylor, Kramp, and Thomas
Simpson, the author again adverts to Newton's views, remarking
that, in assigning the rarefaction of the lower region of the atmo
sphere by heat as the cause why the calculated refractions near the
horizon so much exceeded the observed, as was found to be the case,
Newton had assigned the true cause but that he had no clear con
                                            ;
ception of the manner in which the density in the lower region                     is
altered by the agency of heat; and he considers that nearly the same
ignorance in that respect still prevails.
    The two atmospheres, with densities decreasing in arithmetical
and geometrical progression, which,         now appears, were imagined
                                            it
by Newton, and which have been discussed by Thomas Simpson and
other geometers, are found, when the same elements are employed,
to bring out horizontal refractions on opposite sides of the observed
quantities.    La Place conjectured that an intermediate atmosphere
which should partake of the nature of both, and should agree with
observation in the horizontal refraction, would approach nearly to
the true atmosphere.     If   recourse be had to the algebraical expres
sions of La Place,  it  will be found that the atmosphere he proposes
is  one of which the density      isthe product of two terms, the one
taken from an arithmetical, the other from geometrical series the
                                                      a                        ;
effect of which combination       isto introduce a supernumerary con
stant, by means of which the horizontal refraction         made to agree
                                                                is
with the true quantity. The author considers, with Dr. Brinkley,
that the French table, founded on La Place's investigation,          only a
                                                                          is
little less empirical than the other tables, and that the hypothesis of
 La Place does not appear to possess any superiority over other sup
posed constitutions of the atmosphere in leading to        better and less
                                                                a
exceptionable theory.
    After eulogizing Bessel's tables of mean refractions, published in
his Tabula Regiomontaine, the author refers to his own paper in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1823.       In this paper the refractions
 are deduced entirely from the very simple formula, —
                         l+/3r'                      -«

                                        62
 in which ft stands for the dilatation of air or gas by heat, r' and r"
 for the temperature at the earth's surface, and at any height above
 it, and c~" for the density of the air at that height in parts of its
 density at the surface.      If this formula be verified at the earth's sur
face in any invariable atmosphere,         by giving a proper value to the
constant   /, it will still hold, at least with a very small deviation from
exactness, at a great elevation; and this is immediately shown.
    This manner of arriving at the constitution of the atmosphere is
contrasted with the procedure of M. Biot of transforming an alge
braical formula, for the express purpose of bringing out a given re
sult. As the problem in the Mecanique Celeste is solved by means
of an interpolated atmosphere between two others ; as in Mr. Ivory's
paper of 1823, there is no allusion to such an atmosphere; and as
the table in that paper is essentially different from all the tables
computed by other methods, he contends that all these must be suf
ficient to stamp an appropriate character on his solution of the pro
blem. But if ingenuity could trace some relation, in respect of the
algebraic expression, between the paper of 1823 and La Place's cal
culations, he considers that it is not difficult to find, between the
same paper and the view of the problem taken by the author of the
Principia in 1696, an analogy much more simple and striking.
Newton having solved the problem, on the supposition that the den
sity of the air is produced solely by pressure, and having found that
the refractions thus obtained greatly exceeded the observed quantities
near the horizon, inferred, in the true spirit of research, that there
must be some cause not taken into account, such as the agency of
heat, which should produce, in the lower part of the atmosphere, the
proper degree of rarefaction necessary to reconcile the theoretical
with the observed refractions. The author's sole intention, in intro
ducing the quantity      f  in his formula, is to cause the heat at the
earth's surface to decrease in ascending, at the same rate that ac
tually obtains in nature, not before noticed by any geometer, but
which evidently has the effect of supplying the desideratum                of
Newton.
    The author considers, that the comparison of the table in the pa
per of 1 823, with the best observations that could be procured at the
time of publication, was satisfactory ; and after the publication of
the Tabulee Regiomontanee, he found that the table agreed with
Bessel's observed refractions to the distance of 88° from the zenith,
with such small discrepancies as may be supposed to exist in the
observations    themselves.
    The   paper   in the Philosophical Transactions for 1823, however,
takes into account only the rate at which the densities, in a mean
 atmosphere, vary at the surface of the earth ; but, in the present
 communication, the author proposes to effect the complete solution
 of the problem, by estimating the effect of all the quantities on which
the density at any height depends.          For this purpose, he finds it ne
 cessary  to employ   functions   of  a particular kind ; and then gives a
 formula, one part of which consists of a series of these functions, for
 the complete expression of the temperature           of an atmosphere in
 equilibrium ; the intention of assuming this formula being to ex

                                    63
press the temperature in terms of such a form as will produce, in the
refraction, independent parts that decrease rapidly.      By this means
he proceeds in the analytical investigation of the problem in its more
comprehensive form, and deduces two equations on which its solu
tion depends.
    The first of these contains the law according to which the heat
decreases as the height above the earth's surface increases ; and the
second determines the perpendicular ascent, when the difference of
the pressures and of the temperatures at its upper and lower extre
mity have been found. If the latter, with a slight transformation,
be multiplied by the proper factor, representing the variable force of
gravity in different latitudes, it becomes identical with the usual
barometric formula, all its minutest corrections included; and it has
this advantage ; that, whereas the usual formula is investigated on
the arbitrary assumption, that the temperature is constant at all the
points of an elevation, and equal to the mean of the temperatures at
the two extremities, this formula is strictly deduced from the gene
ral properties of an atmosphere in equilibrium.
    Having determined, from experimental results, the values of cer
tain constants in these formulae, — first, in an atmosphere of dry air,
and, secondly, in an atmosphere of air mixed with aqueous vapour,
the author remarks, that the analytical theory agrees in every re
spect with the real properties of the atmosphere, as far as these have
been ascertained.
    The object of Mr. Ivory's further investigation    is to show, that
the same theory represents       the  astronomical   refractions  with a
fidelity that  can  be deemed  imperfect only   as far as  the  values of
particular constants, which can only be determined by experiment,
are liable to the charge of inaccuracy.       He therefore proceeds to
determine, from the formulae previously deduced, the refraction of a
star in terms of its apparent zenith distance. For this purpose, the
differential equations are transformed by the introduction of new
symbols ; the limits of certain terms are determined previously to
their being neglected ; and the equation is finally reduced to a form,
in which the remaining operations consist in investigating the inte
grals of four expressions, and in subsequently assigning their nume
rical values. Great skill is displayed in conducting these intricate
investigations ; and after going through the most laborious calcula
tions and computations, the author exhibits a table of theoretical re
fractions, deduced solely from the phenomena of the atmosphere,
for zenith distances, extending from 10° to 8950. These refractions
are compared with those in Bessel's table, in the Tabula Regiomon-
tanee, and also with those in the table in the Connaissance des Temps.
From this comparison, it appears, that the three tables agree within
less than 1", as far as 80° from the zenith: from 80° to 88° of zenith
 distance, the numbers in the French table exceed those in Bessel's,
the excess being 2" at 84°, and 4" at 88° ; and with a single excep
 tion at 88°, (probably, judging from the character of the adjacent
number, arising from an error of computation,) the refractions in
 the new table are nearer to Bessel's than those in the French table ;

                                    64
but when the zenith distance is greater than 80°, the author con
siders the accuracy of the French table questionable, both on account
of the hypothetical law of the densities, and because the quantity
assumed for the horizontal refraction is uncertain.
   After giving a few examples, illustrative of the use of the new
table, the author inquires how far the refractions are likely to be
affected by the term which it was found necessary to leave out, be
cause the present state of our knowledge of the phenomena of the
atmosphere made it impossible to determine the coefficient by which
it is multiplied. For this purpose, the variable part of that term
has been computed for every half degree, from 85° to 88°, and the
results are exhibited in a table. From this it appears, that this co
efficient, although considerably less than that of the preceding term,
may still have some influence on the refractions at very low alti
tudes. The mean refraction in Bessel's table, and in the new table,
can hardly be supposed to differ 2" from the true quantity, which
would limit the coefficient in question to be less than one-tenth. It
is a matter of some importance to obtain a near value of this coeffi
cient ; and it is probable that this can be accomplished in no other
way, than by searching out such values of the two coefficients as will
best represent many good observed refractions at altitudes less than
5°. If such values were found, our knowledge of the decrease of
heat in ascending in the atmosphere would be improved, and the
measurement of heights by the barometer would be made more per
fect.
    At the end of the paper is given a table of mean refractions for
the temperature 50° Fahr. and barometric pressure 30 inches, at
 every degree from 0° to 70° zenith distance, and at every 10' from
 70° to the horizon ; and tables of the corrections requisite for va
riations of the thermometer and barometer are subjoined.

             DA VIES GILBERT, Esq., V.P., in the Chair.
    The Rev. John Hymers was duly elected          a Fellow of the So
 ciety.
    A paper was   read, entitled, " Remarks on the Theory of the Di
 spersion of Light, as connected with Polarization." By the Rev. Baden
 Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Professor of Geometry in the Uni
 versity of Oxford.
    The present paper is a sequel to those already presented by the
 author to the Royal Society, in which he had instituted a compari
 son of the observations of the refractive indices for the standard rays
 of light in various media, with the results calculated from theoretical
 formulae, deduced from the most improved views of the undulatory
 hypothesis ; the cases discussed including the greatest range of
 data as yet furnished by experiment.     The comparison exhibited an
 accordance sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the theory af

                                      63
  fords a very satisfactory approximation, at least, to the expression
  and explanation of the actual law of nature.      In order, however, to
 remove any possible discrepancy which may still exist, or hereafter
 be found to obtain, the author considers that further examination is
 requisite of the principles on which any extension or modification of
 the theory might be pursued ; and such is the object of the investi
  gation undertaken in the present paper.
     The phenomena of interference, on which the undulatory theory
 was originally based by Dr. Young, obliged us to adopt some idea
  of an alternating motion, as well as a motion of translation, in our
  conception of light ; and this, with all the accessions it has received,
 especially from the investigation of Fresnel, has, at the present day,
 been connected by the labours of M. Cauchy and others, with gene
 ral dynamical principles, which regulate the propagation of vibratory
 motions through an elastic medium. From such dynamical prin
 ciples there have been deduced certain differential equations of mo
 tion, the integration of which gives the well-known expression for a
 wave, involving the relation between the velocity and the wave
 length which explains the dispersion. The direct and complete in
 tegration of these forms, effected by M. Cauchy, and simplified by
 Mr. Tovey and M. Kelland, involves certain conditions ; namely,
 the evanescence of certain terms, the interpretation of which implies
 peculiar views of the constitution of the ether.       Mr. Tovey shows
 that without these conditions, a certain form of the wave-function
 is a particular solution of the equations ; and this form is precisely
 that expressing elliptically polarized light.    If the absence of the
 condition in question be essential to the case of elliptically and cir
 cularly polarized light, it follows that all the preceding investiga
 tions, which depend on the fulfilment of those conditions, are ap
 plicable only to unpolarized and plane-polarized light, and conse
quently the general integration is limited in a most material part of
its application ; a defect which is only remedied by the supplement
ary investigation of Mr. Tovey, in which, for this case, a particular
solution is assigned.    It seemed, then, necessary to show explicitly
that the non-fulfilment of the conditions, that is, the non-evane
scence of the terms in question, is essential for elliptically polarized
light, as their evanescence is for common light, and thus to exhibit
distinctly the relation between the cases of elliptically polarized, of
plane-polarized, and unpolarized light; and, again, to remove, if
possible, the obscurity and discrepancy of opinion in which the phy
sical interpretation of those conditions, with regard to the supposed
constitution of the ethereal medium, appeared to be involved.
    The author then enters upon the analytical investigation of the
subject, and in conclusion remarks that when light is elliptically or
circularly polarized, that is, when any one of the two component
vibrations is retarded behind the other, then, in the differential equa
tions of motion, the opposite terms do not destroy each other in the
summation, which they can only do in general by supposing a great
number taken into account ; that is, the number of terms is limited,
or the sphere of the influence of the force by which the vibrations

                                     66
are propagated is small.     When light is plane-polarized, or unpo-
larized, that is, when there is no retardation, or the phases of the
component vibrations are simultaneous,      then the opposite sums de
stroy each other ; that is, the number of terms involved is greater,
or the sphere of the influence of the force greater. Since both kinds
of light can be propagated indifferently through ordinary media, it
follows that the sphere of influence of the force, or number of mole
cules taken into account, does not here depend on the arrangement
of the molecules of ether in the medium, but on the retardation of
one of the vibrations behind the other, or the absence of it, origin
ally impressed on the ray in the respective cases.
  A   paper was also read,    entitled, " An Experimental Inquiry into
the influence of Nitrogen on the Growth of Plants." By Robert Rigg,
Esq. Communicated by the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S., &c.
    The author, after briefly alluding to a former paper laid before the
Royal Society, describing the chemical changes which occur during
the germination of seeds, and some of the decompositions of vege
table matter, proceeds, in the present paper, to trace a connexion
between the phenomena exhibited during the growth of plants, and
the direct agency of nitrogen.      The experiments by which the au
thor supports his views are arranged in separate tables, so drawn out
as to indicate not only the quantities of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, and residual matter, in about 120 different vegetable
substances, but also the quantity of nitrogen in each compound,
when compared with 1000 parts by weight of carbon in the same
substance.    The most important of these tables are those which ex
hibit the chemical constitution of the germs, cotyledons and rootlets
of seeds ; the elements of the roots and trunks of trees, and the cha
racters of the various parts of plants, especially of the leaves, at dif
ferent periods of their growth.      From this extensive series, which is
stated to form but a small portion of the experiments made by the
 author in this department of chemical research, it appears that ni
trogen and residual matter are invariably the most abundant in those
parts of plants which perform the most important offices in vege
table physiology ; and hence the author is disposed to infer, that
nitrogen (being the element which more than any other is perma
nent in its character) when coupled with residual matter, is the
moving agent, acting under the living principle of the plant, and
moulding into shape the other elements.        The method of ultimate
analysis  adopted  by  the author,  enables him, as he conceives, to de
tect very minute errors, and therefore to speak with certainty as to
the accuracy and value of every experiment.
    A paper was also read, entitled,
                                        " Researches   in Rotatory Mo
tion." By A. Bell, Esq. Communicated by the Rev. W. Whewell,
M.A., F.R.S., &c.
    This paper, which is altogether analytical, contains several new
theorems in rotatory motion, respecting the effect of the centrifugal
force arising from a rotation about any axis, in producing rotation

                                      C7
about another, inclined at any angle to the former ; and also a new,
and comparatively concise, demonstration of the equations of the
motion of rotation of a solid body, its centre of gravity being fixed,
and the body being acted on by any forces.
     The Society then adjourned     over Whitsun-week   to meet again on
the 14th June next.

                                                                    "
        paper was read,                                               by
 George Gulliver, Esq., Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Regiment of
Horse Guards. Communicated by John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., As
 sistant Inspector of Army Hospitals.
     The author, in consequence of some theoretical views of the sup
 purative process, was led to undertake an examination of the blood
in the different forms of fever accompanying inflammation and sup
 puration ; and the result has been the detection of globules of pus
 in that fluid in almost every instance where there had existed, du
 ring life, either suppuration, or great tumefaction of the external
 parts without the presence of pus.      The means by which he detect
 ed pus in the blood were partly chemical, and partly by the aid of
 the microscope.      Availing himself of the solvent power which water
 exerts on the globules of the blood, while it has no action on those
 of pus, he had merely to dilute the suspected blood sufficiently with
 water, by which means the red globules were made to disappear,
 while those of pus remained at the bottom of the fluid, and were
 easily recognised by a good microscope.       A number of cases are de
 tailed, from which the general result, above stated, was deduced.
 He considers that his experiments tend to establish the conclusion
 that suppuration is a kind of proximate analysis of the blood. As
 the fibrin separated from this fluid produces swelling of the part
 affected, or is attracted to the contiguous tissue for the reparation of
 the injury, the globules of the blood, altered by stagnation, become
 useless, and are discharged as excrementitious matter from the sy
  stem.    Such is the constitution of healthy pus : but when mixed
  with broken down fibrin, it assumes the flaky and curdled appear
  ance, with proneness to putrefaction, characterising unhealthy pus,
  and the presence of which in the blood is connected with fevers of
  the inflammatory or typhoid form.

   The Treasurer announced from the Chair that a deputation of the
Society, consisting of His Royal Highness the President, the Vice-
Presidents, Treasurer, Secretaries, and other Members of the Council,
waited yesterday on Her Majesty, for the purpose of receiving Her
Majesty's signature in the Charter-book of the Society, as Patroness
of the Royal Society, when Her Majesty was graciously pleased to
inscribe her name accordingly ; on which occasion His Royal High

    The following papers were then read, viz.
    " On the structure of the teeth, the vascularity of those organs,
and their relation to bone." By John Tomes, Esq.           Communicated
by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of Zoology in King's Col
lege, London.
    The microscopical examinations which the author has made of the
structure of the teeth of man and various animals, lead him to the
conclusion that their bony portions are formed of minute tubes, dis
posed in a radiated arrangement, in lines proceeding everywhere
perpendicularly from the inner surface of the cavity containing the
pulp. These tubuli are surrounded by a transparent material, which
cements them together into a solid and dense mass.           He finds, by
applying the test of muriatic acid, that carbonate as well as phos
phate of lime enters into their composition.       In man, the tubuli, du
ring their divergence from their origin at the surface of the central
cavity, send off a number of very minute fibrils ; and on approach
ing the enamel or the granular substance, which cover respectively
the crown and the fangs of the tooth, the tubuli divide into smaller
ones, which freely anastomose with one another, and then either are
continued into the enamel, or terminate at the boundary between
these two substances.        Various modifications of this structure, ex
hibited in the teeth of different animals, in the class Mammalia and
Fishes more particularly, are minutely described. The granular sub
stance appears to be composed of irregularly shaped osseous gra
nules, imbedded in the same kind of transparent medium which ce
ments the tubuli together.         External to the granular portion, the
 author finds another substance entering into the formation of the
 simple tooth, and commencing where the enamel terminates ; and
 which he describes as beginning by a thin and transparent layer con
 taining only a few dark fibres, which pass directly outwards ; but
 assuming, as it proceeds towards the apex of the fang, greater
 thickness and opacity, and being traversed by vessels.
    External to the enamel, and in close connexion with        it,in com
 pound teeth, is    situated the crusta petrosa, a substance very similar
 to the bony layer of the simple tooth. It contains numerous cor
 puscles, and is   traversed by numerous vessels entering it   from with
 out, and anastomosing freely with one another, but terminating in
 its substance. These investigations of the structure of the different
 component parts of teeth, furnish abundant evidence of their vascu
 larity and consequent vitality.
   " On  the evolution of Nitrogen during the growth of plants, and
the sources from whence they derive that element." By Robert Rigg
Esq.    Communicated by the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S., &c.
   In this communication the author follows up his inquiry into the

                                      71
influence and importance of nitrogen in vegetable physiology, by
noticing, in the first place, the experiments of Dr. Daubeny, M. De
Saussure, Sir Humphry Davy, and those which he himself has made ;
all of which tend to prove that nitrogen is evolved during the healthy
performance of the functions of plants ; that the proportion which
it bears to the oxygen given off is influenced by the sun's rays ; but
that owing to the necessary exclusion of the external atmosphere
during the progress of the experiments, it is impossible, with any
degree of accuracy, to calculate the volume of these evolved gases
during any period of the growth of plants in their natural state.
     If to this indefinite quantity of nitrogen given off by plants there
be added that definite volume incorporated into their substance and
shown in the author's former tables, the question arises, whence do
plants derive their nitrogen, and does any part of it proceed from
the atmosphere ? A problem which the author proposes to solve by
a series of tabulated experiments upon seeds, and seedling plants,
indicating a large excess of nitrogen in the latter, and under such
circumstances of growth that he is compelled to fix upon the at
mosphere as its source.
     By the same mode of experimenting, the author attempts to show
that the differences which we find in the germination of seeds and
 the growth of plants in the shade and sunshine, are apparently due
in a great measure to the influence of nitrogen. And he concludes
 by observing, that he does not touch upon the practical application
 of the subject wherein the real value of the inquiry consists ; it is
 his object to draw attention to an element which, though in some in
 stances so minute in quantity as to be with difficulty detected in
 our balances, has nevertheless been wisely assigned to discharge the
 most important functions.
     " On   the decussation of fibres at the junction of the Medulla Spi
 nalis with the Medulla Oblongata." By John Hilton, Esq.            Com
 municated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     The author first alludes to what usually happens in affections of
 the brain, namely, that the loss of voluntary power and of sensation
 manifest themselves in the opposite side of the body to that in which
 the cerebral lesion exists, a fact which has been attempted to be ex
 plained by the crossing of the fibres at the junction of the medulla
 oblongata with the anterior or motor columns of the medulla spina
 lis ; but such a structure, he observes, affords no explanation of the
 loss of sensation.      The author then, referring to the communication
  of Sir Charles Bell to the Royal Society, in the year 1835, descri
 bing a decussation connected with the posterior columns, or columns
  of sensation, mentions that the accuracy of these dissections was
  doubted by Mr. Mayo and other eminent anatomists.           The author
  proceeds to state that the symptoms of cerebral lesion do not always
  take place on the opposite side of the body to that in which the le
  sion of the brain exists, but that they occur sometimes on the same
  side ; that the loss of power and of sensation, although confined to
  the same side, may exist in either the upper or the lower extremity;

                                     72
but that both are not necessarily implicated ; and that, in fact, cases
 occur where there are marked deviations from what may be consi
dered the more common occurrence.         Having observed such cases,
and not being aware of any satisfactory explanation, the author ex
 amined with care the continuation upwards of the anterior and pos
terior columns of the spinal marrow into the medulla oblongata and
found that the decussation at the upper part of the spinal marrow
 belonged in part to the columns for motion, and in part to the
 columns for sensation ; and farther, that the decussation is only par
 tial with respect to either of these columns ; thus elucidating by the
 observation of the actual structure what before appeared very un
 satisfactory in pathology, and anomalous in disease.
    The paper is illustrated by drawings made from the dissections of
the author.
    " Description of a self-registering Thermometer and Barometer in
vented by the late James Coggan, Esq., and bequeathed by him to the
Royal Society."        By Roderick    Impey Murchison,    Esq., F.R.S.,
V.P.G.S., &c.
    The self-registering thermometer used by Mr. Coggan is of Six's
construction, and consists of a siphon tube, open at one extremity,
and operating by the expansion and contraction of a large body of
 spirit pressing on a column of mercury in the lower bend of the tube.
 On the other side of the wooden frame to which this thermometer is
 fixed, a siphon barometer is attached ; and both these instruments are
made to act on iron-floats suspended by a thread, and counterpoised
 over a pulley. Transverse wires are affixed to these threads, and are
forced against a sheet of ruled paper on a frame, which from its
connexion with a clock is advanced a certain space each day, by a
spring hammer forming part of the striking machinery of the clock.
    " On the action of light upon the colour of the River Sponge."
By John Hogg, M.A., F.L.S., C.P.S., &c, Fellow of St. Peter's Col
lege, Cambridge.        Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author found that the green colour of the Spongilla fluviatilis,
or river sponge, is acquired solely through the agency of light, and
is lost when the sponge is removed from its influence.      As this does
not appear to be the case with Actiniae, the Hydra viridis, or any
other Polype, the author is disposed to consider this production as
being nearer allied to the Algae or Fungi, than to any tribe belonging
to the animal kingdom.
    " Researches on the Tides.      Ninth Series. On the deduction of
the Laws of the Tides, from short Series of Observations." By the
Rev. W. Whewell, M.A. Trin. Coll., Cambridge.
    It is very desirable to ascertain whether it is possible to deduce
the laws of the tides from short series of observations ; since, if it
be so, not only does the construction of good tide tables for differ
ent places become more easy ; but also the value of tide tables is
much increased, if the predicted tides agree with those of each year
as well as with the mean of many years.       The object of the author

                                          73
in the    present paper is to determine this point by the discussion of
several years' observations of the tides at Plymouth and at Bristol.
The calculations for the former place were executed by Mr. Dessiou
and Mr. Ross in the Hydrographer's Office at the Admiralty; the cal
culations for Bristol were performed by Mr. Bunt, in virtue of a
grant of money from the British Association.                  The result of these
discussions is, that a very regular form and good approximation for
the semimenstrual inequality may be obtained from the observations
of one year ; that the existence of the lunar parallax corrections ap
pears very clearly in the observations of one year ; and that its value
may be determined from a series of three or four years.                 The lunar
declination corrections are more irregularly given by short series of
observations ; but in a series of four or five years, the general form
and approximate value of the corrections become manifest.                  In the
 course of these calculations such questions as the following were
proposed, and their solution attempted : 1 . To which transit of the
moon ought we to refer the tide ? It appears that the transit which
produces the best accordance with theory, is that which Mr. Lubbock
 terms transit B, which is an epoch about 42 hours anterior to the
 high water at Bristol and Plymouth.                 2. How does a change of
 the epoch       affect,  first,  the  semimenstrual       inequality ; secondly,
 the parallax     correction   of  the time  ;  thirdly,  the  declination correc
 tion of the times ; fourthly, the parallax correction of heights ; and
 fifthly, the declination correction of the heights ? 3. Does the pa
 rallax corrections of height vary as the parallax ? 4. Does the pa
 rallax correction of time vary as the parallax ? 5. Does the declina
 tion correction of the heights vary as the square of the declination ?
  6. Does the declination correction of time vary as the square of the
 declination ? 7. Can the laws of the corrections be deduced from
 a single year ?       8. Are there any regular differences between the
 corrections of successive years ? 9. Do the corrections at different
 places agree in themselves ? It does not appear that any change
 of the epoch will produce an accordance of the observed laws with
 the theory, some of the inequalities requiring one epoch for this
 purpose, and some requiring another. The inequalities in different
  years and different places are also compared.
     Mr. Whewell remarks, that since it has now been shown that
  good tide tables may be obtained from short series of observations,
  his researches with regard to the determination of the lunar correc
  tions may be concluded ; and the proper mode of farther prosecuting
  the subject, would be to have tide observations at several stations,
  each observatory reducing its own observations,              and thus constantly
  improving the tables, as is practised in other branches of Astro
  nomy.
     "  Researches     in Embryology."         First  Series.   By Martin Barry,
  M.D., F.R.S.E., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in Edin
  burgh.     Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
      This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part the author
   describes   the origin and structure of the ovisac, a vesicle          common

                                           74
  to all vertebrated animals, but hitherto regarded as the inner mem
  brane of the " foOiculus Graafianus
                                                "
                                                    in Mammalia, and by some
  authors denominated the " chorion
                                              "  in other Vertebrata. He also
  describes the real nature of the " folliculus Graafianus," and its re
  lation to the calyx of the Bird ; the germinal vesicle and its con
  tents, as being the most primitive portion of the ovum ; the order of
  formation of the several other parts of the ovarian ovum ; and the
 true chorion of Mammalia as being a structure superadded within
 the ovary.
     In the second part the author describes a granulous tunic of the
  ovum of Mammalia not hitherto observed ; the manner of origin
 of the " membrana granulosa " of authors ; the different situations of
 the ovum in the Graafian vesicle at certain periods ante coitum, not
 hitherto observed ; and certain structures by means of which the
 ovum is made to occupy these several situations.
     The following are the principal facts made known by Dr. Barry
 in this memoir ; but other facts are also mentioned, which he in
 tends to make the subject of a future communication. In Mammalia
 and in Birds the germinal vesicle and its contents are those parts
 of the ovum which are first formed.                 The germinal vesicle at an
 early period is surrounded by peculiar granules, forming an envelope
 not hitherto described. The ovum of all vertebrated animals is con
 tained in a vesicle (the " chorion
                                            " of some authors, found in Birds,
 Amphibia, and Fishes), which is essentially the same in structure
 wherever found, and which he thinks it desirable universally to
 denominate an ovisac.            This vesicle is the " couche interne" of
 the   Graafian    vesicle, as  described by Professor Baer.        The Graafian
vesicle     of  Mammalia       is  nothing more than an ovisac that has
 acquired a covering or tunic, susceptible of becoming highly
 vascular, which covering is the " couche externe
                                                               " of
                                                                     the Graafian
 vesicle as    described    by  Baer.     The  ovisac   of Birds, Amphibia, and
Fishes ("chorion" of some authors), acquires in like manner a
 covering or tunic, susceptible of becoming highly vascular ; and by
the union of the ovisac with this covering, there is constituted a
structure analogous to the Graafian vesicle of Mammalia. The quan
tity of yelk in the former being large, that portion of the ovary
which contains the structure here referred to (as analogous to the
 Graafian vesicle of Mammals) becomes pendent ; and now the united
coverings of the yelk-ball, — viz. the ovisac, its external tunic, the
ovarian stroma, and the peritoneal investment, — are together called
the calyx.       From this it will be obvious that the Graafian vesicle is
not a structure peculiar to Mammalia, as it has been supposed.
    The ovisac has at first an elliptical or ellipsoidal form, becomes
more spherical, and in Mammalia is often met with somewhat tapered
at one end.        The structure of the ovisac in some of the Mammalia
may be      examined    when it does not exceed in length the 50th or
even    the  100th   part of a Paris line, that is, in the latter case, the
1125th    of   an English inch.       Myriads of ovisacs with their contents
are formed      that  never   reach  maturity.      Some of the ovisacs which
do not reach maturity            are  situated   in   the parietes of Graafian

                                    75
 vesicles in Mammalia, or of the corresponding structures in other
 Vertebrata ; being sometimes formed in this situation, and sometimes
included within the covering which the larger ovisac acquires.        The
minute ovisacs so situated the author proposes to denominate^arasift'c
ovisacs. The ovisac is often found in a cavity proper to itself, with
the walls of which it has no organic union. The granules forming
the envelope of the germinal vesicle above referred to, and sub
sequently found in the fluid of the ovisac, are very peculiar in their
appearance, contain a nucleus, and sometimes also a pellucid fluid,
and are intimately connected with the evolution of the ovum. These
granules are present in largest quantity in the ovisac of Mammalia ;
yet granules essentially the same exist in an early stage in the ovisac
of Birds, and are sometimes met with in that of Fishes.
   A continual disappearance of ova, and a formation of others,
are observable even at a very early age.      The ovum of Mammalia
when completely formed is at first situated in the centre of the
ovisac. It is at this period supported in the centre of the ovisac by
an equable diffusion of granules throughout the fluid of the latter.
The ovisac about the same time begins to acquire a covering or tunic,
by which addition, as already stated, there is constituted a Graafian
vesicle; and of the latter, the ovisac is now the inner membrane.
After this period, then, it is proper to speak, not of an ovisac, but of
a Graafian vesicle.     The peculiar granules of the Graafian vesicle
arrange themselves to form three structures, viz. the membrana gra
nulosa of authors, and two structures not hitherto described, one of
which the author proposes to name the tunica granulosa, and the other,
which is rather an assemblage of structures than a single structure,
the retinacula. The tunica granulosa is a spherical covering proper to
the ovum, and its presence explains why the outer line in the double
contour of the thick chorion has remained so long unobserved. At a
certain period this tunic, in some animals at least, is seen to have tail
like appendages, consisting of granules similar to its own. The re
tinacula consist of a central mass containing the ovum in its tunica
granulosa, and of cords or bands extending from this central mass to
the membrana granulosa.         These structures at a certain period
became invested by a membrane.         The offices of the retinacula ap
pear to be, — first, to suspend the ovum in the fluid of the Graafian
vesicle, — next, to convey it to a certain part of the periphery of this
vesicle, — and subsequently to retain it in the latter situation, and
also to promote its expulsion from the ovary.       The particular part
of the periphery of the Graafian vesicle to which the ovum is con
veyed, is uniformly that directed towards the surface of the ovary.
The mass of granules escaping with the ovum on the bursting of a
 Graafian vesicle under the compressor, is composed chiefly of the
tunica granulosa and the ruptured retinacula.          The " cumulus "
of Professor Baer is made up of the parts called by Dr. Barry the
tunica granulosa and the central portion of the retinacula ; and the
band-like portions, collectively, of what Dr. Barry calls the retina
cula, mainly contribute to produce the appearance denominated the
" flat disc " by Professor Baer.

                                       7C
    In Mammalia       a thick and highly transparent membrane, — the true
chorion, — is formed external to the proper membrane of the yelk,
while the latter is in the ovary. The inner part of the substance of
 the chorion in its early stages is in a fluid state, so that the yelk-
 ball moves freely in it ; but it subsequently acquires more consistence.
 There is not any structure corresponding to the chorion in the ovary
 of other vertebrated animals.
    The following appears to be the order of formation, as to time, of
 the more permanent parts of the ovum and the Graafian vesicle in
 Mammalia, viz. :
    1. The germinal vesicle, with its contents, and its envelope of
          peculiar granules.
    2. The proper membrane of the ovisac, which forms around this
          envelope of granules.
    3. The yolk, which forms around the germinal vesicle.
    4. The proper membrane of the yolk, which makes its appearance
          while the yolk is still in an incipient state.
    5. The chorion.
         -The covering or tunic of the ovisac; and about the same
                time, the peculiar granules of the ovisac arrange them-

    " Contributions to the Physiology of Vision." By Charles Wheat-
 stone, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Philosophy in King's
College, London. Part the First. "On some remarkable and hitherto
unobserved      Phenomena of Binocular Vision."
    The author first shows that the perspective projections of an ob
ject upon the two retinae differ according to the distance at which
the object is placed before the eyes ; if it be placed so distant that
to view it the optic axes must be parallel, the two projections are
precisely similar ; but if it be placed so near that to regard it the op
tic axes must converge, a different perspective projection is present
ed to each eye ; and these perspectives become more dissimilar as
the convergence of the optic axes becomes greater.         Notwithstand
ing this dissimilarity between the two pictures, which is in some
 cases very great, the object is still seen single ; contrary to the very
prevalent metaphysical opinion, that the single appearance of ob
jects seen by both eyes is owing to their pictures falling on corre
 sponding points of the two retinae. After establishing these prin
 ciples, the author proceeds to ascertain what would result from pre
senting the two monocular perspectives, drawn on plane surfaces, to
the two eyes, so that they shall fall on the same parts of the two re
tinae as the projections from the object itself would have fallen. Seve
ral means are described by which this may be accomplished ; but the
author especially recommends for this purpose an apparatus called by

                                      77
him a    stereoscope, which enables the observer to view the resulting
appearances without altering the ordinary adaptation of the eyes,
and therefore without subjecting these organs to any strain or
fatigue.     It consists of two plane mirrors with their backs inclined
to each other at an angle of 90°, near the faces of which the two
monocular pictures are so placed that their reflected images are seen
by the two eyes, one placed before each mirror, in the same place ;
the apparatus has various adjustments by means of which the mag
nitude of the images on the retinae may be varied, and the optic
axes differently converged.       If the two monocular pictures be thus
presented one to each eye, the mind will perceive, from their com
bined effect, a figure of three dimensions, the exact counterpart of
the object from which the pictures were drawn ; to show that this
curious illusion does not in the least depend on shading or colouring,
the illustrations principally employed are simple outline figures,
which give for their perceived resultants skeleton forms of three di
mensions. Each monocular outline figure is the representation of two
 dissimilar skeleton forms, one being the form which it is intended to re
 present, and another, which Prof .Wheatstone calls its converse figure
 Viewed by one eye alone the outline may with equal ease be ima
 gined to be either ; but when the two monocular pictures are viewed
 one by each eye, the proper or the complemental form may be fixed
 in the mind ; the former, if the right and left pictures be presented
 respectively to the right and left eyes ; and the latter, if the right pic
 ture be presented to the left eye, and the left picture to the right
 eye. Many new experiments are then detailed, and a variety of in
 stances of false perception of visual objects, some new, others former
 ly observed, are traced to these principles ; among others, the well-
 known apparent conversion of cameos into intaglios. The author
 next proceeds to show that pictures similar in form but differing in
 magnitude within certain limits, when presented one to each eye,
 are perceived by the mind to be single and of intermediate size ; and
 also that when totally dissimilar pictures, which cannot be combined
 by the mind into the resemblance of any accustomed objects, are
 presented one to each eye, they are in general not seen together, but
 alternately. The memoir concludes with a review of the various hypo
 theses which have been advanced to account for our seeing objects
  single with two eyes ; and the author states his views respecting the
 influence which these newly developed facts are calculated to have
  on the decision of this much debated question.
     " Experimental     Researches in Electricity," Fourteenth Series.
     On the general nature and relation of the Electric and Magnetic
  Forces.    By Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c. &c.
     The author commences by observing that the theory of electrical
  induction, which he had set forth in the 11th, 12th, and 13th se
  ries of researches, does not assume or decide anything as to the
  real nature of the electric forces, but only as to their distribution ;
  the great question respecting the existence of any electric fluid, or
  of one, or of two fluids remaining untouched. He then states what

                                     78
 the theory does assume   ; as, for instance, that all particles, whether
 of insulators or conductors, are, as wholes, conductors ; that, being
 conductors,   they can readily be charged either bodily or polarly ;
 that contiguous particles being on the line of inductive action can
 communicate their forces more or less readily; that those doing so
 most readily constitute the bodies called conductors, and those do
ing so least readily those called insulators, &c.
    Having thus given a brief summary of the conclusions drawn
from the previous investigations, the author proceeds to consider
 the particular condition of the particles which, in an insulating
body, are considered as polarized ; and after showing that the
 theory requires that they should be able to polarize in any di
rection, he states his expectation that a greater facility to polarize
in one direction than another would still be found to belong to
them, and proceeds experimentally to determine this point.        His ex
periments were made by observing the degree of inductive force
across cubes of perfectly crystallized bodies, as rock crystid and
 Iceland spar ; these being cut so as to have the axis of the crystal
parallel to the line joining two opposite faces of the cube ; but
the experiments, which are laborious, require extension, and he has
not as yet been able to prove or disprove the expected result.
    The author then considers whether in compound bodies it is the
ultimate and elementary particles or the compound particles which
polarize as wholes. He concludes that it is the latter which assume
that state ; and shows how this point bears upon the electrolyzation
of such bodies as are separated into simpler substances, or otherwise
altered by the action of the voltaic current.
    He then proceeds to certain experiments bearing upon the nature
of the relation of the electric and magnetic forces, giving his view
of the character of this relation ; and concludes his paper by briefly
stating what he thinks is more satisfactorily explained by the theory
which refers inductive action to an action of contiguous particles
than by the old theory.
    "Experiments on the Vibration of the Pendulum."             By W. J.
Frodsham. Communicated by Francis Beaufort, Capt. R.N., F.R.S.
    The object of this paper is to show the advantages that may re
sult from attaching to the top of the pendulum a brass tube, which
the author terms " an isochronal piece," about five inches in length,
fitting the pendulum very nicely, and slit so as to form a spring for
about an inch at the bottom, sliding rather stiffly on the rod, so that
its position, and consequently its influence on the action of the
pendulum, maybe varied at pleasure; and that unequal arcs of vibra
tion may be made to correspond to equal intervals of time.
    "An Account of some Experiments on the Blood in connexion
with the Theory of Respiration."         By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. ,
Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals.
    The author has investigated, experimentally, several of the im
portant questions connected with the theory of respiration and of

                                    79
 animal heat ; and arrives at the following results. He finds that
 the blood is capable of absorbing oxygen both from atmospheric air,
 and from oxygen gas, independently of putrefaction.        After blood
has been agitated in common air, a trace of carbonic acid, not ex
 ceeding one per cent., is found in the residual air; but when pure
oxygen is employed, no carbonic acid can be detected in it by the most
carefully conducted trials.     When pure carbonic acid is brought
into contact with blood, or serum, over mercury, and moderately
agitated, the absorption of gas exceeds the volume of the fluid.
Both arterial and venous blood are rendered very dark, and serum
more liquid by the absorption of this gas to saturation.      Serum, in
its healthy state, is incapable of absorbing oxygen, or of immediate
ly furnishing carbon to form carbonic acid : and after it has ab
sorbed carbonic acid, only one-tenth of the absorbed gas is expelled
by successive agitation with atmospheric air, or with hydrogen. The
author is inclined to think that the alkali in the blood, in its
healthiest condition, is in the state of a sesquicarbonate.       In the
majority of trials manifest indications of the disengagement of air
from blood in vacuo were obtained : but as it occasionally happened
that no air could be thus extricated, the author is induced to believe
that the quantity of air contained in the blood is variable : and he
has found this air to consist solely of carbonic acid gas.     It would
also appear, from the experiments detailed in this paper, that a por
tion of oxygen exists in the blood, not capable of being extracted
by the air-pump, yet capable of entering into combination with ni
trous gas ; and existing in largest proportion in arterial blood. The
absorption of oxygen by blood is attended with an increase of tem
perature.
   The experiments of the author tend to show that the lungs are
absorbing and secreting, and perhaps also inhaling organs, and that
their peculiar function is to introduce oxygen into the blood and
separate carbonic acid from the blood : and they favour the idea that
animal heat is owing, first, to the fixation or condensation of oxygen
in the blood in the lungs during its conversion from venous to arte
rial ; and secondly, to the combinations into which it enters in the
circulation in connexion with the different secretions and changes
essential to animal life.
   " On the Geometrical Forms of Turbinated        and Discoid Shells."
By   the Rev.  H. Moseley, Professor of Natural Philosophy and As
tronomy   in  King's College, London. Communicated by Thomas Bell,
Esq., F.R.S.
   This paper is occupied by an investigation of certain mathemati
cal principles which the author considers as governing the formation
of turbinated and discoid shells. According to these views, all such
shells may be conceived to be generated by the revolution about a
fixed axis of the perimeter of a geometrical figure, which, remaining
always similar to itself, increases continually its dimensions.     The
spiral lines which are observable on the opercula of certain classes
of shells, taken in connexion with the well-known properties of the

                                   80
logarithmic or equiangular spiral, appear to have suggested the idea,
that not only the boundary of the operculum, which measures the
sectional expansion of a shell, but also the spiral lines, which in
general are well marked both externally and internally in the shell
itself, are curves of this nature.
    From an examination of the spirals marked on opercula, it appears
that the increase of their substance takes place on one margin only;
the other margin still retaining the spiral form, and acquiring an in
crease of length by successive additions in the direction of the curve.
As in the logarithmic spiral the distances of successive spires, mea
sured on the same radius vector produced from the pole, from
each other, are respectively in geometrical progression, if similar
distances between the successive whorls on the opercula of shells be
found to observe the same law, it will follow that these whorls must
have a similar form; and that such is the case, the author shows by a
variety of numerical results obtained by careful measurements on
three different opercula of shells of the order Turbo.    That such is
the law of nature in the formation of this class of shells is rendered
probable by the instances adduced by the author, in which a con
formity to this law is found to exist.
    From the known properties of the logarithmic spiral the author
concludes that the law of the geometrical description of turbinated
shells is, that they are generated by the revolution about a fixed
axis, (namely, the axis of the shell,) of a curve, which continually
varies its dimensions    according to the law, that each linear incre
ment shall vary as the existing dimensions of the line of which it is
the increment. If such be the law of nature, the whorls of the shell,
as well as the spires on the operculum, must have the form of the
logarithmic spiral ; and that this is likewise the case is shown by
the almost perfect accordance of numerical results, deduced from the
property of that curve, with those deduced from a great variety of
careful measurements made of the distances between successive
whorls on radii vectores drawn on shells of the Turbo duplicatus,
 Turbo phasianus, Buccinum subulatum, and in a fine section of a
Nautilus pompilius. The author further states that, besides the results
given in the paper, a great number of measurements were similarly
made upon other shells of the genera Trochus, Strombus, and Murex,
all confirmatory of the law in question.
    One of the interesting deductions which the author has derived
from the prevalence of this law in the generation of the shells of a
large class of mollusca, is that a distinction maybe expected to arise
with regard to the growth of land and of aquatic shells, the latter
 serving both as a habitation and as a float to the animal which forms
it ; and that, although the facility of varying its position at every
period of its growth may remain the same, it is necessary that the
enlargement of the capacity of the float should bear a constant ratio
to the corresponding increment of its body ; a ratio which always
 assigns a greater amount to the increment of the capacity of the shell
than to the corresponding increment of the bulk of the animal.
    Another conclusion deducible from the law of formation here con

                                     81
sidered is, that the growth of the animal, corresponding to a given
increment in the angle of the generating curve, will always be pro
portional to the bulk it has then attained : and if the physical vital
energies of the animal be proportional to its actual bulk, its growth,
in any given time, will be proportional to its growth up to that time.
Hence the whole angle of revolution of the curve generating the
shell will be proportional to the whole corresponding time of the
animal's growth ; and therefore, the whole number of whorls and
parts of whorls will, at any period, be proportional to its age.
    The form of the molluscous animal remaining always similar to
itself, the surface of the organ by which it deposits its shell will
vary as the square of the linear dimensions ; but as the deposition
of its shell must vary as the cube of the same dimensions, there must
be an increased functional activity of the organ, varying as the sim
ple linear dimensions.
    Since to each species of shell there must correspond a particular
number expressing the ratio of the geometrical progression of the
similar successive linear dimensions of the whorls ; and since the
constant angle of the particular logarithmic spiral, which is affected
by that species of shell, is deducible from this number, the author
considers that, connected as the form of the shell is with the cir
cumstances of the animal's growth and the manner of its existence,
this number, or the angle of the particular spiral, determinable as
it is in each case by actual measurement, may be available for the
purposes of classification, and may suggest relations by which,
eventually, they may become linked with characteristic forms, and
modes of molluscous existence.
    The concluding portion of the paper contains a mathematical dis
cussion of certain geometrical and mechanical elements of a con-
choidal surface.     These are, the extent of the surface itself; the vo
lume contained by it ; the centre of gravity of the surface, and also
of the volume, in each case, when the generating figure revolves
about a fixed axis without any other motion, and also when it has,
besides this, a motion of translation in the direction of that axis ;
and, lastly, the angle of the spiral. The author states that his ob
ject in this inquiry is the application of these elements to a discussion
 of the hydraulic theory of shells.     The constant angle of the spiral,
which each particular species affects, being connected by a necessary
relation with the economy of the material of the habitation of each,
with its stability, and the condition of its buoyancy, it is therefore
necessary to determine the value of this angle.
    " On  the relative attractions of Sulphuric Acid for water, under
particular circumstances : with suggestions of means of improving
the ordinary process of manufacturing Sulphuric Acid." By Henry
Hugh Watson, Esq., Corresponding Member of the Manchester
Philosophical Society.      Communicated by John Dalton, D.C.L.,
F.R.S., &c.
    The object of the inquiry detailed in the present paper is to de
termine at what degree of concentration the affinity of sulphuric

                                   82
acid for aqueous vapour is equal to that of anhydrous space for the
same vapour at given temperatures.       It has long been known that
concentrated sulphuric acid abstracts moisture from the atmosphere,
but the amount and the rate of this absorption have never been as
certained with accuracy ; and consequently, in applying this acid to
purposes of exsiccation, the experimenter has often been at a loss to
know whether the acid was sufficiently strong to render the space
in which it was confined perfectly anhydrous. By placing portions
of the acid, previously weighed, and diluted with known quantities
of water, under the receiver of an air-pump, with equal portions of
concentrated acid, of the specific gravity 1-8428, in similar dishes,
the author ascertained that the dilute acid could be concentrated to
the specific gravity 1/814, at a temperature varying from 65° to
57° : whence he concludes that acid of such strength is capable
of drying a vacuum when the temperature does not exceed 5 7°. By
making similar experiments in air, the author compared together the
weights lost by ten grains of dilute sulphuric acid of the specific
gravity 1-135, at three different periods of the day for six days,
taking note of the dew-point and the temperature ; and infers that
when the affinity of space for vapour, or the evaporating force, is
equal to 0'15 of an inch of mercury, it is just able to balance the
affinity for water of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity l-249.
   The author next instituted a series of experiments to ascertain
whether the evaporation of water from dilute sulphuric acid is capa
ble of being carried on to the same extent in air as in vacuo, and
found that the evaporating force of air exerted upon such acid is less
than that of a vacuum at the same temperature.        He observes that
his experiments offer conclusive evidence that the evaporation of
water is not owing to the existence of a chemical affinity between
the vapour of the liquid and atmospheric air ; but thinks that they
favour the notion that the obstruction t o this process in the open
atmosphere is rather owing to the pressure than to the vis inertia
of the particles of air. He is also of opinion that improvements will
hereafter arise from this inquiry with regard to the economical
management of the process of manufacturing sulphuric acid, which
process would be greatly expedited by the regulated admission of
steam into the condensing chambers kept at a constant high tem
perature.
   The Society then adjourned over the long vacation to meet again
on the 15th of November next.

    A  paper was read, entitled,
                                    " On  the State of the Interior of the
 Earth." By W. Hopkins, Esq., M. A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., &c.
    The object of the present memoir is to inquire into the modes in
 which the refrigeration of the earth may have taken place, on the

hypothesis that its entire mass was originally in a fluid state ; an
hypothesis which was at first founded on astronomical considera
tions, and is now corroborated by the discoveries of modern geology,
exhibiting the apparent injection from below of large masses of un-
stratified rocks, through the fissures of sedimentary strata.         As
suming that this state of fluidity was the effect of heat, we are led
to consider the steps of transition by which the earth has passed into
its present state of solidity, and apparently permanent temperature.
After adverting to the analytical investigations of Fourier and Poisson
 on this subject, the author proceeds to inquire into the results of the
laws of refrigeration of heated bodies, which may be conceived to
 operate in the present case ; namely, refrigeration by circulation,
 which obtains when the fluidity is perfect, and that by conduction,
 when the particles of the mass, by the diminution of fluidity, no
 longer retain that mobility among one another which is requisite
 for their circulation.     Thus while, in either case, the superficial
 parts of the earth would rapidly cool and solidify by the radiation
 of their heat into sidereal space, forming a crust of small thickness
 compared with the whole radius of the globe, the internal mass may
 be in one or other of the three following conditions : — First, it may
 consist of matter still in a state of fusion, of which both the tem
 perature and the fluidity are greatest at the centre, but which has
 been brought, by the long-continued process of circulation, into a
 state no longer admitting of this process, and capable, therefore, of
 cooling only by conduction.        Secondly, the earth may consist of
 an external shell, of a central nucleus, rendered solid by the enor
  mous pressure to which it is subjected,        and of an intermediate
  stratum of matter in a state of fusion. The thickness of the shell,
  as well as the radius of the solid nucleus, may possibly be small
  compared with the radius of the earth.        The fluidity of the inter
  vening mass must necessarily be here, also, considerably more im
  perfect than that which would just admit of cooling by circulation.
  Thirdly, the earth may be solid from the surface to the centre.
     The author then shows that the direct investigation of the manner
  in which the earth has been cooled, assuming its original fluidity
  from heat, cannot determine the actual condition of its central
  parts, not from any imperfection in the analytical process, but from
  the want of the experimental determination of certain values, which
  it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, accurately to obtain. It
  has occurred to the author that a more indirect test of the truth of
  the hypothesis of the central fluidity of the earth might be found in
  the delicate but well-defined phenomena of precession and nutation.
  The investigation of the problems thus suggested is reserved by the
  author for the subject of a future memoir.

    It was stated that the report of the death of R. Z. Mudge, Capt.
R.E., noticed    at the last Anniversary, has been since found to be
erroneous.
     The following Address of His Royal Highness the President was
read from the Chair    :
       Gentlemen,
I cannot     quit the Chair of the Royal Society, which I have now
occupied during a period of eight years, without availing myself of
the opportunity which the customary proceedings of the Anniver
sary afford me, of expressing to you the grateful sense I entertain
of the great honour conferred upon me, by being chosen to fill so
distinguished an office, as likewise of the uniform kindness and
support which I have always received from the Members of the
Council and the Fellows of the Society generally, in the discharge
of its various and important duties.
     A review of my conduct during the period of my Presidency, re
calls to my mind many occasions in which I am sensible that I have
been more or less wanting in the very responsible trust confided to
me, of watching over the interests of a Society most justly illustrious
by the succession of great men who have been connected with it
and by the great advances which nearly every department of science
has received from those portions of their labours which are recorded
in its Transactions ; for some of these deficiencies I am unfortunately
 enabled to refer to the severe and long continued visitations of dis
ease and infirmity under which I have laboured, as a very sufficient
apology ; and I feel less oppressed than I otherwise should have been,
by my consciousness of many others, by my knowledge of the ac
tivity and zeal of the very able and efficient officers upon whom the
temporary discharge of my duties devolved, and from the assurance
 which I felt, that the interests of the Society, when entrusted to
 their care, would suffer no detriment by my absence.
     Though justly proud of the distinction of presiding over the Royal
 Society, and most anxious to promote, to the utmost of my power,
 the great objects for which it was founded, I no sooner ascer
 tained that circumstances would probably, for a time, interfere with
 my residence in London, during a considerable part of its An
 nual Session, and prevent my receiving its Members in a manner
 compatible with my rank and position in this country, than I deter
 mined to retire from an office whose duties I could no longer flatter
  myself as likely to be able to discharge in a manner answerable to
 their expectations, or in accordance with my own feelings.      Having
  come to this conclusion after the most anxious and painful consi
  deration, I deemed it due to the Members of the Council, in the first
  instance, and next to the Fellows, to make it speedily and generally

                                     87
known, with the view of enabling them to look out for a proper per
son to fill a situation of such dignity in the scientific world, and
whose occupation could not fail to be an object of honourable am
bition to men of the most eminent social rank, as well as of the most
distinguished scientific attainments.
    I will not attempt to disguise from you, Gentlemen, the feelings of
deep and poignant regret I experienced upon taking a step that
would thus necessarily abridge the opportunities, which       I had as
much enjoyed as I had highly prized, of being brought officially
into frequent and familiar contact with the most distinguished
philosophers of my own or other countries, and of employing
whatever influence my station in society enabled me to exert in
 advocating the just claims and interests of men of science, in pro
moting the objects of their labours, in fostering and encouraging
their mutual co-operation and intercourse, and in endeavouring to
soothe the violence of personal or national jealousies, whenever they
unfortunately existed, by bringing them together in social or other
meetings where the discussion of topics of irritation could be either
suppressed     or controlled, and where imaginary prejudices would
disappear under the softening operation of reciprocal knowledge and
 experience. But though deprived for a season, by my retirement, of
 some of the highest privileges I have hitherto exercised and enjoyed,
 yet  I do not abandon the hope of being still able to maintain and
 cultivate the very valuable and delightful friendships which I have
thus fortunately for myself been enabled to form during the period
 of my connection with you, by seizing every occasion when pre
 sented to me, of appearing at the meetings of the Royal Society,
 and by co-operating with its members, to the utmost extent of my
limited means, in furthering those objects that may be considered to
 be most important for the advancement of the interests of science.
    I am afraid however, Gentlemen, that I have already trespassed
 unreasonably upon your time and attention in endeavouring to ex
 plain to you the motives of my conduct, and to express, though most
 inadequately, my grateful sense of the kindness which I have inva
 riably experienced from you. I shall therefore now proceed to the
 more immediate subject of this Address, which is to notice some of
 the most important Proceedings of the Society which have taken
 place during the last year.
    The Address voted to Her Majesty by the President and Council
 of the Royal Society, on the Queen's accession to the throne, em
 bodying likewise u petition to Her Majesty to become the Patron
 of the Society, and to continue to it the Grant of the Medals which
 had been instituted by King George the Fourth and regranted
 by William the Fourth, as well as the gracious reply of the Sove
 reign, transmitted through the Secretary of State for the Home
 Department, have been already communicated to you at one of the
 weekly meetings of the Society*.          On the 20th of June last, the
 President and Council were summoned to attend at the Palace of
                              * June  21, 1838.

                                   88
St. James's to witness Her Majesty's signature in our Charter- Book
as Patron   of the Society.    I availed myself of the occasion thus
presented  to me  to  address the Queen in your name, and to assure
Her Majesty that we felt bound by the obligations of our Charter,
as well as by the recollection of our foundation, to look up to the
Sovereign of these realms as our Patron and protector : that we
most gratefully acknowledged the assurances which Her Majesty
had conveyed to us through Her minister the Secretary of State for
the Home Department, of the continuance of the same support and
favour as had been always accorded to us by the Sovereigns of
this Kingdom, and likewise the signification of Her Majesty's in
tention of renewing the grant of the two Medals which had been in
stituted by one and confirmed by another of Her Majesty's royal
uncles and predecessors, accompanied by Her gracious permission
to propose such modification and amendments in the statutes which
had been provided for their distribution, as would tend most effect
ually to promote the advancement         of science, and would most
certainly accomplish the liberal and patriotic views and intentions
of their Royal Founders. I further ventured to advert to the close
connection which exists between the cultivation of Science and
the Arts, and the progress and developement of the great elements
of the prosperity and happiness of nations, and to express my
earnest hope and prayer that the triumphs of the arts of peace and
commerce, which had so signally marked the beginning of Her
Majesty's reign, might be continued without intermission to its
distant conclusion.
    The Queen having received the Address in the most gracious
manner, was pleased to sign her august and royal name in our
Charter-Book as Patron of the Royal Society : after which the
officers and different members of the Council were presented by
me to Her Majesty, and had the honour of kissing Her Majesty's
hand.
    The alterations in the laws for the distribution of the Royal Me
dals, which Her Majesty was graciously pleased to authorize and
permit, have been made by a Committee of the Council appointed
for that purpose, and have since received the especial sanction
and approbation of Her Majesty.         They are directed to be given
hereafter to such papers, and to such papers only, as have been
presented to the Society, or inserted in its Transactions, within
three years of the date of the award ; and they are to be awarded
to departments of science whose order of succession is defined by a
cycle of three years, comprising in the first Astronomy and Physi
ology, in the second Physics and Geology, and in the third Mathe
matics and Chemistry.       And it is further added and commanded,
that no departure from this order of succession shall be allowed,
unless it shall appear that no memoir of sufficient merit to be en
titled to such an honour shall have been presented to the Society
within the period afore-named ; in which case, and in which case
only, it shall be competent for the Council, with the approbation
of Her Majesty, to award the Medal to one of those branches

                                       89
of science which       are comprehended in the cycle     of the preceding
year.
     I  trust, Gentlemen, that these laws for the distribution of the
Royal Medals, if strictly adhered to, and judiciously administered,
will be found to stimulate the exertions of men of science, by se
curing to their labours, when inserted in our Transactions, that cer
tain and periodical revision which they are naturally so anxious to
obtain ; and by signalizing any remarkable investigation, or notable
discovery, by the marked and prompt approbation of those persons
in this country who are most likely to be able to judge of its value.
     It was partly for the furtherance of the same great object, which
was proposed in framing the statutes for the award of the Royal
Medals, so as to secure to each branch of science in succession its
 due amount of notice and encouragement, that the Council have
 determined to establish permanent Committees of Science. They
 are composed of a selection of those Fellows of the Society who
 are known to have devoted their attention, in a more especial man
 ner, to those departments of science to which they are severally
 assigned, and to whom all questions connected with such branches
are proposed to be referred, including the selection of the memoirs
 to which the Royal Medals shall be given.             The Council have
 thought proper, likewise, in the formation of these committees, to
 enlarge the number of the sciences, which form the Medallic cycle
 above referred to, from six to eight, by separating the science of
 Meteorology from that of Physics, and the science of Botany and
 the laws of Vegetable Organization and Life, from that of Zoology
 and Animal Physiology.           I sincerely rejoice, Gentlemen, in the
 adoption of this arrangement, as I think it admirably calculated to
 give a more marked and specific distinction to those sciences which
 the Fellows of the Royal Society are bound more especially, by the
 obligations of the Charter, to cultivate, and as tending, likewise, to
 bring those persons who are engaged in common pursuits into more
 frequent intercourse with each other ; and thus to afford them in
  creased opportunities of appreciating their mutual labours, of de
 vising new and important trains of investigation, as well as of se
 curing public aid and general co-operation in the accomplishment
  of objects which are too costly or too vast for individuals to under
  take or to attempt.
     The future developement of many of the sciences is becoming
  daily more and more dependent upon co-operative labour. We are
 rapidly approaching great and comprehensive generalizations, which
  can only be completely established or disproved by very widely
  distributed and, in many cases, by absolutely simultaneous observa
  tions. Major Sabine has lately collected with great labour, and re
  duced and analysed with great ability, a vast mass of observations
  relating to the distribution of the earth's magnetism ; and the result
  has pointed out not merely the proper fields of our future researches,
  but likewise their great extent and the enormous amount of labour
  still required for their cultivation. A society on the continent, headed
  by the justly celebrated Gauss, to whom the Copley Medal has been

                                      90
   this year adjudged for his magnetical researches, my cotemporary and
   fellow student at GSttingen, has instituted a system of simultaneous
   observations on the periodical and irregular movements of the mag
   netic needle at various stations in different parts of Europe, which
   suggest conclusions of the most surprising and interesting nature ;
   these can only be fully worked out and confirmed by the adoption
   of a similar system of observations in places extremely remote from
   each other on the surface of the globe. The researches on the tides,
   which have been so laboriously and so successfully prosecuted by
   Professor Whewell and Mr. Lubbock, have led, and can lead to few
   general and certain conclusions without the aid of labours of this
  nature ; and a memorable exemplification of their value, even when
   given in their rudest and least perfect form*, is presented in the
   discovery of the " Law of Storms," which Col. Reid has recently
  published, and which promises results so important to the interests
  of navigation and the cause of humanity. In the science of Mete
  orology, which still remains destitute even of approximations to ge
  neral laws, it is to a well-organized system of simultaneous observa
  tions that we must look for the acquisition of such a knowledge of
  the range and character of atmospheric influences and changes, as
  may become the basis of a well-compacted and consistent theory,
  and rescue this science from the reproach, under which it has too
 long and too justly laboured, of presenting little more than a con
  fused mass of almost entirely insulated results. Undertakings, how
  ever, of this extensive and laborious nature are far beyond the
  reach of individual enterprize, and can only be accomplished by
 national aid and co-operation.
     We have lately witnessed an example where the Storthing, or
 National Assembly of Norway, a body composed partly of peasants,
 and representing one of the poorest countries in Europe, undertook
 the charge of a magnetical expedition to Siberia, on the recom
 mendation and under the direction of their distinguished country
 man, M. Hansteen, at the same time that they refused a grant of
 money to aid in building a palace for their sovereign ; and      I feel
 confident that the united wishes of men of science in this and
 other countries, whose influence on public opinion is becoming
daily more and more manifest, particularly when expressed in favour
of purely scientific objects which cannot be effected without the as
sistance and the resources of the nation, will not be without their
effect on the Government of our own country, which has always
taken the lead in the promotion of geographical as well as scientific
investigations and discoveries, and which possesses, beyond any other
nation, advantages for their prosecution and accomplishment, not
merely from its superior wealth, but from the range and distribution
of its commerce and its colonies in every region of the globe.
     There is one other event to which I wish to advert previously to
concluding this portion of my address to you, and which I conceive
I may do with the strictest propriety, as it is closely connected with
                          * From the logs of ships.

                                   91
the general interests of the Royal Society. I allude to the return of
Sir John Herschel to this country, after an absence of several years,
devoted, from a sense of filial duty, to the completion of that great
task which he felt to have been transmitted to him as an inheritance
from his venerable and illustrious father. I have so often had oc
casion to allude, from this Chair, to the merits of that distinguished
person, and to express the respect which I felt for his great attain
ments, the pride with which I cherished his friendship, the deep in
terest which I took in his labours, and my admiration of the truly
modest and philosophical spirit in which they were conducted, that
I  should be guilty of a very superfluous repetition of what I have
before addressed to you, if I ventured to enlarge upon them now ;
but I should ill discharge my duty, whilst still entitled to address
you as the official head of the scientific establishment of this coun
try, if I omitted to avail myself of this or any other opportunity of
expressing the gratification which    I experienced in June last, when
called upon to preside at that great convention of the most eminent
men who adorn our country, who combined together with such sin
gular unanimity and enthusiasm to pay their homage to science and
knowledge, and those great interests with which their cultivation
and progress are connected, by paying so signal a tribute of respect
and honour to the most accomplished and the most devoted of our
living philosophers. I feel assured, Gentlemen, that the proceed
ings of that memorable day will produce marked and durable ef
fects upon the scientific prospects of our country, by proving that
pre-eminent merit will meet with sympathy at least, if not with re
ward, and as offering sure and unequivocal indications both of the
power and direction of public opinion amongst the most cultivated
and enlightened classes of society ; and it was chiefly as an expres
 sion of the deference paid by the government of this country to the
 opinions and wishes of the scientific world, that I rejoiced in being
authorized and requested by the prime minister of the crown to
 offer to Sir John Herschel the rank of baronet, on the occasion of
the coronation of Her Majesty, though well convinced that such an
accession of social rank was not required to give dignity to one
whose name is written in the imperishable records of the great sy
stem of the universe.
    It would ill become me, while gratefully acknowledging my sense
 of your past kindnesses towards myself, to venture to refer to the
name of my presumed successor in the Chair of this Society in any
 terms which might be interpreted as an undue anticipation of the
 result of this day's proceedings, or as appearing to interfere with the
 free use of the franchise which every Fellow possesses, and is ex
 pected and required to exercise ; but I cannot be ignorant of the
 various accomplishments,     the courteous and unassuming manners,
 the warmth of heart and active benevolence which distinguish the
 nobleman who has been nominated by the Council : and I rejoice
 most sincerely that the Society possesses amongst its members, as a
  candidate for your suffrages, one so well qualified to preside at your
  meetings, and to watch over your interests.

    Amongst the deceased members, I find twenty-seven on the
Home, and four on the Foreign list, including some very consider
able names.     I shall now proceed to notice such of their number
as have been most distinguished for their scientific labours, for their
public services, or for their encouragement and patronage of science
and the arts.
   Thomas Andrew Knight, of Downton Castle, Herefordshire, the
President of the Horticultural Society of London, to the establish
ment and success of which he so greatly contributed, was born in the
year 1758.     He was educated at Ludlow school, and afterwards be
came a member of Balliol College, Oxford.       From his earliest years
he appears to have shown a predominant taste for experimental
researches in gardening and vegetable physiology, which the imme
diate and uncontrolled possession of an ample fortune gave him
every opportunity of indulging ; proposing to himself in fact, as one
of the great objects of his life, to effect improvements in the pro
ductions of the vegetable kingdom, by new modes of culture, by the
impregnation of different varieties of the same species, and various
other expedients, commensurate with those which had already been
effected by agriculturists and others in the animal kingdom, by a
careful selection of parents, by judicious crossing, and by the avoid
ance of too close an alliance of breeds. In the year 1795 he contri
buted to our Transactions his first, and perhaps his most important
paper, on the transmission of the diseases of decay and old age of
the parent-tree to all its descendants      propagated by grafting or
layers, being the result of experiments which had already been long
continued and very extensively varied, and which developed views
of the greatest importance and novelty in the economy of practical
gardening, and likewise of very great interest in vegetable physio
logy.    This paper was succeeded by more than twenty others,
chiefly written  between the years 1799 and 1812, containing the de
tails of his most ingenious and original experimental researches on
the ascent and descent of the sap in trees ; on the origin and offices
of the alburnum and bark ; on the phenomena of germination ; on the
functions of leaves ; on the influence of light, and upon many other
subjects, constituting a series of facts and of deductions from them,
which have exercised the most marked influence upon the progress
of our knowledge of this most important department of the laws of
vegetable organization and life.
   Mr. Knight succeeded Sir Joseph Banks in the presidency of the
Horticultural Society, and contributed no fewer than 114 papers
to the different volumes of its Transactions: these contributions
embrace almost every variety of subject connected with Horti
culture; such as the production of new and improved varieties
of fruits and vegetables ; the adoption of new modes of grafting,
planting, and training fruit-trees ; the construction of forcing-frames
and hot-houses ; the economy of bees, and many other questions
of practical gardening, presenting the most important results of his
very numerous and well-devised experiments.
   Mr. Knight was a person of great activity of body and mind,

                                     93
and of singular perseverance and energy in the pursuit of his fa
vourite science : he was a very lucid and agreeable writer, and it
would be difficult to name any other cotemporary author in this
or other countries who has made such important additions to our
knowledge of horticulture and the economy of vegetation.
     Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the owner of the beautiful domain of
 Stourhead in Wiltshire, was the author of many valuable historical
and topographical works, and more especially of the history of his
native county, presenting so numerous and such splendid funereal
and other monuments of the primitive inhabitants of Great Britain,
which he investigated with a perseverance and success unrivalled
by any other antiquary. The early possession of an ample fortune
and of all the luxuries of his noble residence, seem to have stimu
lated, rather than checked, the more ardent pursuit of those favourite
studies, which occupied his almost exclusive attention for more than
fifty years of his life: and he was at all times, both by his co-operation
and patronage, ready to aid other labourers in the same field which
he had himself cultivated with so much success and industry.
     Sir Richard Hoare was a very voluminous original author, and on
 a great variety of subjects; he printed a catalogue of his unique
 collection of books relating to the history and topography of Italy,
the whole of which he presented to the British Museum, to which
he was, on other occasions, a liberal benefactor. He likewise pub
lished editions of many of our ancient chronicles ; and it is only
to be lamented that one who has contributed under so many forms
to our knowledge of antiquity, and who presents so many claims
to the grateful commemoration of the friends of literature and the
 arts, should have been influenced so much, and so frequently, by
 the very unhappy ambition, of which some well-known and di
 stinguished literary bodies of our own time have set so unworthy
 an example, of giving an artificial value to their publications, by the
 extreme smallness of the number of copies which they allow to be
 printed or circulated ; thus defeating the very objects of that great
 invention, whose triumphs were pretended to be the very ground
 work of their association.
     Mr. George Hibbert was one of the most distinguished of those
 princely merchants whose knowledge of literature, patronage of the
 arts, and extensive intercourse with the world have contributed so
 much, in a great commercial country like our own, to elevate the
 rank and character of the class to which they belong, and to give to
 the pursuits of wealth an enlarged and liberalizing spirit. Mr. Hib
 bert possessed, during the most active period of his life, an uncom
 mon influence amongst the great commercial bodies of the me
 tropolis, and more particularly amongst those connected with the
  West India trade, from his integrity and high character, his great
  knowledge of business, his excellent sense and judgement, and his
  clearness and readiness in public speaking.     He was an excellent bo
  tanist, and the collection of plants which he had formed at his resi
  dence at Clapham, was remarkable not merely for its great extent, but
  likewise for the great number of extremely rare plants which it con

                                        94
  tained.   He was well known also as a very extensive and judicious
  collector of books, prints, drawings and paintings, and was endeared
  to a large circle of private friends, amongst the most cultivated classes
  of society in this country, by his refined yet simple manners, his
  happy temper, and his many social and domestic virtues.
     Sir Abraham Hume, who had attained at the time of his death
 the venerable age of ninety years, was the father of the Royal So
 ciety ; he was a man of cultivated taste and very extensive ac
 quirements, and throughout his life a liberal patron and encourager
 of the fine arts.
     Lord Farnborough was the son-in-law of Sir Abraham Hume,
 whom he greatly resembled in his tastes and accomplishments ; for
 more than thirty years of his life he held various public situations
 in the successive administrations of this country, but quitted his
 official employments on his elevation to the peerage in 1 826 :
 from that period he devoted himself almost entirely to the improve
 ment and decoration of his beautiful residence at Bromley Hill ; to
 the proposal and promotion of plans for the architectural improve
 ment of the metropolis ; to the selection of pictures for the National
 Gallery, which he greatly enriched by his bequests ; and to the va
 rious duties imposed upon him by his official connexion with the
 British Museum, and many other public institutions.
    The Earl of Eldon, though possessing few relations with science
or literature, presents too remarkable an example of the openings
afforded by the institutions of this country to men of great and com
manding talents for the attainment of the highest rank and wealth,
to be passed over without notice in this obituary of our deceased
Fellows.     Lord Eldon was matriculated as a member of University
College, Oxford, under the tuition of his brother, afterwards Lord
Stowell, in 1766; and an academical prize which he gained in the
following year, for an
                           " Essay on the Advantages of Foreign Tra
vel," gave the first evidence of his possession of those great powers
of minute analysis and careful research, which made him afterwards
so celebrated.     His early marriage terminated somewhat prematurely
his academical prospects, and forced him to adopt the profession of
the law, after narrowly escaping other occupations of a much more
humble character. He was compelled to struggle for several years of
his life with poverty and discouragement, when a fortunate opportunity
enabled him to give proof of his extraordinary attainments, and ra
pidly conducted him to the command of wealth and professional emi
nence. After filling with great distinction the offices of Solicitor and
Attorney-General, he became Chief- Justice of the Common Pleas and
a peer in 1799, and finally Lord Chancellor of England in 1801, a
situation which he continued to hold, with a short interruption, for
nearly a quarter of a century. Of his political character and con
duct it becomes not me to speak ; but his profound knowledge of
the laws of England, his unrivalled acuteness and sagacity, and his
perfect impartiality and love of justice, have received the concur
rent acknowledgment and admiration of men of all parties.
    The Rev. Thomas Catton, Senior Fellow of St. John's College,

                                   9.5
Cambridge, was in early life a schoolfellow of Lord Nelson, of whose
talents or character, however, he retained no very vivid impressions :
he became a Member of the University in 1777, and when he took
his degree in 1781 he was fourth Wrangler and first Smith's Prize
man, a discrepancy in the results of two similar examinations, which
is said to have led to the adoption of some regulations prevent
ing their recurrence in future. In the year 1800 he became one
of the public tutors of his college, in conjunction with its pre
sent venerable and distinguished master, and secured, in a very
uncommon degree, the respect and love of his pupils, by his skill
and knowledge as a teacher, and by his kind and vigilant attention
to their interests: he quitted the tuition in 1810, and for the re
mainder of his life he devoted himself, almost exclusively, to the
cultivation of practical and theoretical astronomy, having succeeded
to Mr. Ludlam in the management of the observatory which is
placed over one of the interior gateways of the college. He possessed
a most accurate knowledge of the theory and use of astronomical
instruments, and was a most scrupulous and skilful observer ; and he
is known to have left behind a very large mass of observations, par
ticularly of occultations, most carefully detailed and recorded. Mr.
 Catton was a man of very courteous manners and most amiable
character, and possessed of a very extensive acquaintance both with
literature and science.     He died in the month of January last, in the
eightieth year of his age, deeply regretted by the members of the
 college in which he had passed the greatest part of his life.
     Mr. Henry Earle, one of the Senior Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's
 Hospital, was the son of one very eminent surgeon, Sir James Earle,
 and the grandson of another, Mr. Percival Pott. He was the author
 of many valuable articles in different medical journals, and likewise
 of two papers in our Transactions ; one detailing the result of a
 very novel and difficult surgical operation, and the other on the
 mechanism of the spine, which were published in 1822 and 1823.
 Mr. Earle was considered to be one of the most skilful and scien
 tific surgeons of his age, and was justly esteemed by his professional
 and other friends not merely for his great acquirements, but for his
 kindness of heart and upright and honourable character.
     John Lloyd Williams, formerly British resident at Benares, was
 the author of three short papers in our Transactions in the year
 1 793 ; two of them upon the method of making ice at Benares, by
 means of extremely porous and shallow evaporating pans of unglazed
 earthenware, placed upon dry straw or sugar-cane ; and the last fur
 nishing additional descriptions of the great quadrants and gnomon
 in the observatory at Benares, which had been described in a paper
 in our Transactions in 1777 by Sir Robert Barker.
     The Foreign Members whom the Society has lost during the last
 year, are Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch, of Boston, in America ; Messieurs
  Dulong and Frederic Cuvier, of Paris ; and Dr. Martin van Marum,
  of Haarlem.
     Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch of Boston, in the State of Massachusetts
 in America, was born at Salem, in the same State, in 1773 : he was

                                    96
removed from school at the age of ten years to assist his father in
his trade as a cooper, and was indebted for all his subsequent acqui
sitions, including the Latin and some modern languages and a pro
found knowledge of mathematics and astronomy, entirely to his own
exertions unaided by any instruction whatever. He became after
wards a clerk to a ship-chandler, where his taste for astronomy first
showed itself, and was sufficiently advanced to enable him to master
the rules for the calculation of a lunar eclipse ; and his subsequent
occupation as supercargo in a merchant vessel sailing from Salem
to the East Indies, led naturally to the further developement           of
his early tastes, by the active and assiduous study of those depart
ments of that great and comprehensive science which are most im
mediately subservient to the purposes of navigation. It was owing
to the reputation which he had thus acquired for his great knowledge
of nautical astronomy, that he was employed by the booksellers to
revise several successive editions of Hamilton Moore's Practical
Navigator, which he afterwards replaced by an original work on
the same subject, remarkable for the clearness and conciseness of
its rules, for its numerous and comprehensive        tables, the greatest
part of which he had himself recalculated and reframed, and for its
perfectly practical character as a manual of navigation : this work,
which has been republished in this country, has been for many years
almost exclusively used in the United States of America.
    Dr. Bowditch having been early elected a Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boston, commenced the publica
tion of a series of communications in the Memoirs of that Society,
which speedily established his reputation as one of the first astro
nomers and mathematicians of America, and attracted likewise the
favourable notice of men of science in Europe.
    During the last twenty years of his life, Dr. Bowditch was em
ployed as the acting president of an Insurance Company at Salem, and
latterly also as actuary of the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance
Company at Boston : the income which he derived from these
employments, and from the savings of former years, enabled him to
abandon all other and more absorbing engagements, and to devote
his leisure hours entirely to scientific pursuits. In 1815 he began his
great work, the translation of the Mecanique Celeste of Laplace, the
fourth and last volume of which was not quite completed at the time of
his death. The American Academy over which he presided for many
years, at a very early period of the progress of this very extensive
and costly undertaking, very liberally offered to defray the expense of
printing it ; but he preferred to publish it from his own very limited
means, and to dedicate it as a splendid and durable monument of his
own labours and of the state of science in his country.       He died in
March last, in the sixty-fifth year of his age, after a life of singular
usefulness and most laborious exertion, in the full enjoyment of
every honour which his grateful countrymen in every part of
America could pay to so distinguished a fellow-citizen.
    Dr. Bowditch's translation of the great work of Laplace is a pro
duction of much labour and of no ordinary merit : every person who

is  acquainted with the original must be aware of the great number
of  steps in the demonstrations    which are left unsupplied, in many
cases comprehending the entire processes which connect the enun
ciation of the propositions with the conclusions, and the constant
reference which is made, both tacit and expressed, to results and
principles, both analytical and mechanical, which are co-extensive
with the entire range of known mathematical science : but in Dr.
Bowditch's very elaborate commentary every deficient step is sup
plied, every suppressed demonstration is introduced, every reference
explained and illustrated, and a work which the labours of an ordi
nary life could hardly master, is rendered accessible to every reader
who is acquainted with the principles of the differential and inte
gral calculus, and in possession of even an elementary knowledge
of statical and dynamical principles.
    When we consider the circumstances of Dr. Bowditch's early life,
the obstacles which opposed his progress, the steady perseverance
with which he overcame them, and the courage with which he ven
tured to expose the mysterious treasures of that sealed book, which
 had hitherto only been approached by those whose way had been
 cleared for them by a systematic and regular mathematical educa
tion, we shall be fully justified in pronouncing him to have been a
 most remarkable example of the pursuit of knowledge under diffi
 culties, and well worthy of the enthusiastic respect and admiration
 of his countrymen, whose triumphs in the fields of practical science
 have fully equalled, if not surpassed, the noblest works of the ancient
 world.
    Pierre Louis Dulong was born at Paris in 1785: he became an
 orphan at the age of four years ; and though hardly possessing the
 most ordinary advantages of domestic instruction or public education,
 his premature talents and industry gained him admission at the age
 of 16 to the Polytechnic School, which has been so fertile in the pro
 duction of great men, of which he became afterwards successively ex-
 miner, professor, and director. He first followed the profession of
 medicine, which he abandoned on being appointed Professor of
 Chemistry to the Faculty of Sciences.      He became a member of the
 Institute in 1823, in the Section of the physical sciences.      On the
 death of the elder Cuvier he was appointed Secretaire Perpetuel
 to the Institute, a situation from which he was afterwards compelled
 to retire by the pressure of those infirmities which terminated in
 his death in the fifty-fourth year of his age.
     M. Dulong was almost equally distinguished for his profound
 knowledge of chemistry and of physical philosophy.            His " Re
 searches on the mutual decomposition of the soluble and insoluble
 Salts," form a most important contribution to our knowledge of che
 mical statics.   He was the discoverer of the hypophosphorous acid,
 and also of the chlorure of azote, the most dangerous of chemical
 compounds, and his experiments upon it were prosecuted with a
 courage nearly allied to rashness, which twice exposed his life to
 serious danger ; and his memoirs on the " Combinations of phospho
 rus with oxygen," on the " hyponitric acid," on the oxalic acid,

                                    98
  and other subjects, are sufficient to establish his character as a most
 ingenious and accurate experimenter, and as a chemical philosopher
 of the highest order.
    But it is to his researches on the "Law of the conduction of
 heat," " On the specific heat of the gases," and " On the elastic
 force of steam at high temperatures," that his permanent fame as a
 philosopher will rest most securely : the first of these inquiries, which
 were undertaken in conjunction with the late M. Petit, was published
 in 1817; and presents an admirable example of the combination of
 well-directed and most laborious and patient experiment with most sa
 gacious and careful induction : these researches terminated, as is well
 known, in the very important correction of the celebrated law of
 conduction, which Newton had announced in the Principia, and
 which Laplace, Poisson, and Fourier had taken as the basis of their
 beautiful mathematical theories of the propagation of heat. His ex
 periments on the elastic force of steam at high temperatures,         and
 which were full of danger and difficulty, were undertaken at the re
 quest of the Institute, and furnish results of the highest practical
 value ; and though the conclusions deduced from his " Researches
 on the specific heat of gases" have not generally been admitted by
 chemical and physical philosophers, the memoir which contains them
 is replete with ingenious and novel speculations, which show a pro
 found knowledge and familiar command of almost every department
 of physical science.
    M. Frederic Cuvier, the younger brother of the illustrious Baron
 Cuvier, Professor of Animal Physiology to the Museum of Natural
 History at Paris, and Inspector-general of the University, was born
 at Montbelliard, in Alsace, in 1773 : he had from an early period
 attached himself to those studies which his brother had cultivated
 with so much success, and his appointment as keeper of the mena
 gerie at the Jardin des Plantes, furnished him with the most favour
 able opportunities of studying the habits of animals, and of prose
 cuting his researches on their physiology and structure.         The An
 nates d'Histoire Naturelle, and the Memoires du Museum, contain a
 series of his memoirs on zoological subjects of great value and in
 terest, and his work " Sur les Dens des Mammiferes considerees comme
  Caracteres Zoologiques," is full of novel and original views and ob
servations, and has always been considered as one of the most va
luable contributions to the science of Zoology which has been made
 in later times: the great work " Sur THistoire des Mammiferes," of
 which seventy numbers have been published, was undertaken in con
junction with Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and is the most considerable and
most extensive publication on Zoology which has appeared since
the time of Buffon.      He was likewise the author of many other
works and memoirs on zoological subjects in various scientific jour
 nals and collections.
    M. F. Cuvier, like his celebrated relative, combined a remarkable
 dignity and elevation of character, with the most affectionate tem
 per and disposition. Like him, too, his acquisitions were not con
 fined to his professional pursuits, but comprehended a very exten

                                  99
sive range of literature and science.   In his capacity of inspector
of the university, he devoted himself with extraordinary zeal to the
improvement of the national education of France in all its depart
ments, from the highest to the lowest.    It was in the course of one
of his tours of inspection that he was attacked at Strasburg with
paralysis ; the same disease which, under similar circumstances, had
proved fatal to his brother, and likewise in the same year of his age.
    Dr. Martin van Marum was secretary to the Batavian Society of
 Sciences at Haarlem, and superintended the publication of their
 Transactions for many years.      He was also director of the Tey-
lerian Museum at the same place, and the noble library of natural
history and science which adorns that establishment was chiefly
collected by his exertions : it was under his directions also that the
great electrical machine belonging to the Teylerian Museum was
constructed, and he published in 1795 and 1800 the results of a
very extensive series of experiments on the various forms of elec
trical phenomena which were produced by      it,  and more particularly
with reference to a comparison of its effects with those produced
by a powerful voltaic pile, which were undertaken at the express
request of Volta himself. Dr. van Marum was remarkable for his
very various acquirements, and was the author of many memoirs in the
Haarlem and other Transactions, on botanical, chemical, physical, and
other subjects he was man of the most simple habits and of the most
              :        a
amiable character, and devoted himself most zealously during the
greatest part of a very long life to the cultivation of science, and to
the promotion of the interests of the establishment over which he
presided.
   Gentlemen,I   have now arrived at the last and most painful part
of my duty in addressing you, which    ismost gratefully and most re
spectfully to bid you farewell.
  On the motion of Mr. Davies Gilbert, seconded by Mr. Hatchett,
itwas unanimously resolved that the cordial thanks of the Society
be presented to His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex for the nu
merous and valuable services which he has rendered the Society
during the period of his filling the office of their President.
    The following Report of the Council respecting the awards they
have made of two Copley Medals, two Royal Medals, and one Rum-
ford Medal, was read.
    The Council have awarded a Copley Medal to Professor Gauss,
for his researches and mathematical researches on Magnetism.
    Professor Gauss's labours on the subject of magnetism, published
at various periods, and continued with increasing activity up to the
present time, have given to our knowledge of that subject very va
                                                             "
luable and striking additions. In his dissertation entitled, Inten-
sitas vis magnetics terristris at mensuram absolutam revocata,"
(Gottingen, 1833,) he showed how, by a skilful combination of ex
periment with mathematical calculation, several of the most difficult

                                   100
problems belonging to the subject may be solved ; namely, the de
termination of the magnetic axis of a needle ; the exact determination
of the moment of inertia of an oscillating needle ; the deviation pro
duced in the direction of the horizontal needle by the neighbour
hood of a magnet ; and the determination of the absolute intensity
of the horizontal magnetic force of the earth. A combination of
magnetic observers in different places had been set on foot by M.
von Humboldt in 1828 ; a magnetic observatory was erected at Got-
tingen in 1833 ; and in consequence of these circumstances the cu
rious discovery was made in 1834, that the minute momentary
changes in the position of the horizontal needle are simultaneous
and corresponding at distant places.        This led M. Gauss to direct
the attention of men of science more particularly to this subject ;
and the operations of the " Magnetic Union" of observers were car
ried on with great activity under his guidance. The " Results of
the observations of the Magnetic Union" for 1836 and for 1837,
published by MM. Gauss and W. Weber, contain an account of the
consequences of these exertions.      They also contain descriptions of
 instruments invented by M. Gauss for the purpose of these obser
vations, namely, the magnetometer, and other magnetical apparatus
 of his construction, which has already been sent to the observatories
 of Bonn, Dublin, Freiberg, Greenwich, Kasan, Milan, Munich, Na
ples, Upsala, Krakow, Leipzig, and Marpurg.            Also the Bifilar
 Magnetometer, which determines directly the variation of horizontal
 intensity.    The " Results" further contain various mathematical
 calculations of great importance, on the subject of the above instru
 ments, and of the observations made by them.         And it appears by
 observations made in March, 1838, at Gottingen and three other
 places, with the Bifilar apparatus, that there is the same correspond
 ence in the simultaneous changes of intensity at different places
 which had already been discovered in the declination.        The inge
 nuity shown in the invention of instruments and processes, the ma
 thematical skill employed in treating the observations, and the im
 portance and interest of the results, are well deserving of being ho
 nourably marked by the Royal Society, and the adjudication of the
 Copley Medal to M. Gauss.
     The Council have also awarded a Copley Medal to Dr. Faraday
 for his discovery of Specific Electrical Induction, published in the
 eleventh series of his Experimental Researches in Electricity.
     From the peculiar view which he had taken of the phenomena
 of induction, Dr. Faraday was led to expect some particular relation
 of this process to different kinds of matter, through which it might
 be exerted.    This relation he succeeded in establishing by the most
 decisive experiments.
     The phenomena are shown in their simplest form by an instru
 ment which he has named a Differential Inductometer.         It consists
  of three insulated metallic plates, placed facing each other; the cen
  tre one being fixed, and the other two moveable upon slides, by
 which they may be approximated to or withdrawn from the centre.

                                    101
 Each end plate is connected with an insulated leaf of an electro
 meter. When a charge is communicated to the centre plate under
 ordinary circumstances, the induction is equal on both sides, and
the gold leaves are not disturbed.      But if after uninsulating them,
and again insulating them, a thick plate of shell-lac or sulphur be
interposed between two of the plates, unequal induction will take
place on the two sides, and the gold leaves will attract one another.
By these means Dr. Faraday ascertained that, taking the specific
inductive capacity of air to be                       1-
          That of Glass is                            1- 76
                     Shell-lac                        2-
                     Sulphur                          2-24
    The results obtained with spermaceti, oil of turpentine, and naph
tha were higher than that of air, but their conducting powers inter
fered with the accuracy of the experiments.
    By another form of apparatus he ascertained that all aeriform
matter has the same power of sustaining induction ; and that no
variations in the density or elasticity of gases produced any varia
tion in their electric tension until rarefaction is pushed so far as that
 discharge may take place across them.
    Hot and cold air were compared together, and damp and dry air,
but no difference was found in the results.
    The great importance of the discovery and complete establishment
of such a principle as that of specific inductive capacity, in all its
relations both experimental and theoretic, is so palpable, that any
comment must be superfluous ; and the Council have felt they can
not better mark their sense of the value of this discovery than by
awarding the Copley Medal to its author.
    The Council    have awarded the Royal Medal for Mathematics to
H. F.  Talbot,  Esq., for his two memoirs entitled, " Researches in the
Integral  Calculus,"   published in the Philosophical Transactions for
 1836  and   1837.
    Nothing perhaps tends more directly to bring the correctness of
refined theoretical investigations in physics to the test/of numerical
results, than improvements in and extensions of the processes of
integration.    Any advance therefore which is made in this difficult
branch of analysis must be viewed not merely in the light of a diffi
culty overcome in the progress of abstract science, but likewise as hav
ing an important bearing on the advancement of physical inquiry.
    The branch of analysis to which Mr. Talbot's researches belong
is one which is connected with a long series of valuable investiga
tions from the time of Fagnani and Euler to that of Legendre, Jacobi,
and Abel : it relates to integrals under the same form which are
separately nonscendental, but which furnish, under particular con
ditions of the variables, an algebraical result when two or more of
them are connected together with the signs + or — . The celebrated
theorem of Abel, which may be made to comprehend some of Mr.
 Talbot's results, is the most comprehensive and most important of
all the general conclusions which have been arrived at in this de-

                                   102
partment of analysis : but the process adopted by Mr. Talbot is more
allied to that followed by Fagnani than by Abel, and is equally re
markable for its great simplicity and for the vast number of novel
and interesting results which it furnishes, including not merely several
of the most remarkable of those which are already known, but like
wise many others which are apparently not deducible by other
methods.
    The Council have awarded the Royal Medal for Chemistry to
Professor Thomas Graham for his paper entitled " Inquiries respect
ing the Constitution of Salts ; of Oxalates, Nitrates, Phosphates,
 Sulphates, and Chlorides," which was read to the Society on the 24th
of November 1836, and since published in the Philosophical Trans
actions. This paper they have considered as being the last of a
series on a general subject of great importance : and as the sequel
of Professor Graham's researches on the Arseniates, Phosphates, and
modifications of Phosphoric Acid, read to the Society on the 19th
of June 1833, and published in the Philosophical Transactions of
the same year.       He has therein shown that, by considering the
water which enters into the composition of the different classes of
salts, which the phosphoric acid forms with the several bases, and
which has been considered as water of crystallization as standing in
 a basic relation to the acid, a very simple view might be taken of
this very complicated subject. According to this theory, there are
three sets of phosphates, in which the oxygen of the acid being 5,
the oxygen in the base is respectively 3, 2, or 1 ; the remaining
 equivalents of oxygen, in the two first cases, being supplied by that
portion which exists in the 2 or 3 equivalents, respectively, of the
basic water, which water is wholly absent in the third case. These
 three classes of salts Professor Graham proposes to term, respect
 ively, monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic salts.   Professor Graham has
 extended these views of the basic formation of water in salts to the
 case of the sulphates, in a paper communicated to the Royal Soci
 ety of Edinburgh, and published in the 13th volume of their Trans
 actions, on " Water as a constituent of Salts." The principal ob
ject of this paper, however, was to show that water exists in a dif
 ferent state in certain salts, and does not exercise a true basic func
 tion, being capable of being replaced by a salt, and not by an alka
 line base, and giving rise to a class of double salts.     This inquiry
 was suggested by the tendency of phosphate of soda to unite with
 an additional dose of soda, and form a submit, which had been traced
 to the existence of basic water in the former. The result was, that
 in the well-known class of sulphates, consisting of sulphates of mag
 nesia, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, nickel and cobalt, all of which
 crystallize with either five or seven equivalents of water, one equi
 valent proved to be much more strongly united to the salt than the
 other four or six. The latter, to which the name of water of cry
 stallization should be restricted, may generally be expelled by a heat
 under the boiling point of water ; while the remaining equivalent
 uniformly requires a heat above 400° of Fahrenheit for its expul

                                  103
sion, and seems to be, in a manner, essential to the salt.      Thus in
the double sulphate of zinc and potassa, the single equivalent of
water, existing in the sulphate of zinc, is replaced by an equivalent
of sulphate of potassa, while the six equivalents of water of crystal
lization remain ; and all the other salts of this class combine with
one another in a similar manner.
    The super-sulphates must also be regarded as analogous to dou
ble salts ; the bisulphate of potassa, for example, being a sulphate
of water and potassa.
    There is likewise a provision in the constitution of hydriated sul
phuric acid for the production of a double salt analogous in its con
stitution to sulphate of zinc. Sulphuric acid, of the specific gravity
1-78, contains two equivalents of water, and is capable of crystal
lizing at a temperature of 40° of Fahrenheit, being, in fact, the only
known crystallizable hydrate of sulphuric acid. The second equi
valent of water, contained in the hydrated acid, is capable of being
replaced by an equivalent of sulphate of potassa, which is itself a
salt, and a bisulphate of potassa is the result of this substitution.
But the first equivalent of water can be replaced only by an alkali,
or true base. Professor Graham distinguishes water in these two
states of combination as basic and saline water.      Thus the hydrate
of sulphuric acid, already mentioned, contains one equivalent of
 basic, and one equivalent of saline water. It       is,
                                                       in his nomencla
ture,a   sulphate of water with saline water, as the hydrous sulphate
of zinc    is is
               sulphateof    zinc with saline water. The bi-sulphate of
potassa       a
            also   asulphateof   water with sulphate of
                                                      potassa, and cor
responds with the double salt of sulphate of zinc with sulphate of
potassa.
    The results which Professor Graham has thus obtained, and which
he has communicated, partly to the Royal Society, and partly to
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, suggested to him the probability
that the law with respect to water in the constitution of the sul
phates would extend to any hydrated acid, and the magnesian salt
of that acid and his researches on this extension of the subject
               ;
constitute the substance of his last communication to the Royal So
ciety. As he had already found that the sulphate of water        is  con
stituted like the sulphate of magnesia, so he now finds oxalate of
water to resemble the oxalate of magnesia, and the nitrate of water
to resemble the nitrate of magnesia.     He moreover of opinion, that
                                            is
this correspondence between water and the magnesian class of ox
ides extends beyond their character as bases, and that, in certain
subsalts of this class, the metallic oxide replaces the water of cry
stallization of the neutral salt, and discharges a function which was
thought peculiar to water.
    The same kind of displacement, which takes place in the forma
tion of a double sulphate by the substitution of     a  salt of the same
class for an equivalent of water, appears to occur likewise in the
 constitution of double oxalates ;  and the application of this princi
ple elucidates the constitution of that class of salts, as well as of the
super-oxalates, and to explain the mode in which they are derived.

                                   104
   Lastly, the same law is traced in the constitution of the chlorides
of  the magnesian class of metals, which are found to have two equi
valents of water strongly attached to them, and which may therefore
be considered as constitutional.     Many of them have two or four
equivalents more, the proportion advancing by multiples of two
equivalents.
   Professor Graham has supported these views, not only by nume
rous arguments, but also by experimental investigations of the phy
sical properties of different classes of salts, and a great number of
chemical analyses ; and he has thus largely added to our positive
knowledge of this somewhat neglected branch of chemical science.
   The Council, without pronouncing any judgement on the ques
tion whether Professor Graham's hypothesis concerning the differ
ent functions of water in the constitution of salts be a representa
tion of the real mechanism of nature, are of opinion, that the dis
cussion of his new and ingenious views will be highly conducive to
the progress of science, particularly in the department of organic
chemistry, in which they have been already followed out with suc
cess by some eminent foreign chemists, and have accordingly awarded
to Professor Graham the Royal Medal for Chemistry of the present
year, for his valuable researches in this department of science.
   The Council have awarded the Rumford Medal to Professor
Forbes, for his discoveries and investigations of the Polarization
and Double Refraction of Heat, published in the recent volumes of
the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.        »
   That solar heat, like the light which it accompanies, may be po
larized, was shown by the early experiments of MM. Malus and
Berard; but the announcement of M. Berard, that heat from other
sources was also capable of polarization, not having been confirmed
in subsequent repetitions of his experiments by other philosophers,
it became of the highest importance to establish this analogy be
tween light and heat from whatever source the latter might be
derived.
   The admirable instrument, the Thermo-multiplier, invented by
MM. Nobili and Melloni, afforded facilities for the prosecution of
inquiries of this nature, of which the inventors and others were not
tardy in availing themselves.      One of the most important results
obtained by M. Melloni, and confirmed by Professor Forbes, the
refrangibility of non-luminous heat by a prism of rock-salt, appeared
to point to the polarization and double refraction of heat as almost
necessary consequences.     The experiments, however, of both these
philosophers with tourmaline, undertaken nearly at the same time,
appeared to negative the fact ; but Professor Forbes becoming sen
sible of the source of error, in the conclusions he had at first drawn
from his experiments, soon saw that his results clearly indicated the
effect he was in search of.   His subsequent experiments established
the fact, that in the transmission of heat from an Argand lamp, from
incandescent platinum, and even from non-luminous heated brass,
through slices of tourmaline cut parallel to the axis of the crystal,

                                   105
a portion of the heat is polarized, when the axes of the crystals are
at right angles to each other ; and these results were confirmed by
M. Melloni.
   But Professor Forbes did not allow the polarization of heat to
rest solely upon the results obtained with tourmaline.      By employ
ing bundles of plates of mica, and adjusting them at proper angles,
he not only obtained much more decisive results, particularly with
heat from a non-luminous source, but such results as go to esta
blish the singular fact, that the degree of the polarization of heat is
dependent on the nature of its source.      He has further shown the
depolarization of heat by the interposition of a mica plate, and its
circular polarization by means of two total internal reflections in
an interposed rhomb, or two prisms of rock-salt.
   The Council consider that they cannot better testify their estima
tion of the discoveries and experimental investigations of Professor
Forbes, than by awarding to him a Medal, bequeathed by its distin
guished founder, as a premium to the author of discoveries tending
to improve the theories of heat and light.

   The reading of a paper, entitled, " Experimental Researches in
Electricity." Fifteenth Series. — " Note of the Character and Direc
tion of the Electric Force of the Gymnotus."         By Michael Faraday,
Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c, was resumed and concluded.
   The author first briefly refers to what has been done by others in
establishing the identity of the peculiar power in the Gymnotus and
Torpedo with ordinary electricity, and then in reference to the in
tended conveyance to this country of Gymnoti from abroad, gives
the instructions which he himself had received from Baron Humboldt
for that purpose.    A living Gymnotus, now in the possession of the
Proprietors of the Gallery of Science in Adelaide Street, was placed
for a time at the disposal of the author for the purpose of research,
upon which he proceeded, with suitable apparatus, to compare its
power with ordinary and voltaic electricity, and to obtain the direction
of the force. Without removing it from the water he was able to ob
tain not only the results procured by others, but the other electrical
phenomena required so as to leave no gap or deficiency in the evi
dence of identity.    The shock, in very varied circumstances of posi
tion, was procured: the galvanometer affected; magnets were made;
a wire was heated; polar chemical decomposition was effected, and
the spark obtained.     By comparative experiments made with the

                                       112
animal and a powerful Leyden battery, it was concluded that the
quantity of force in each shock of the former was very great. It was
also ascertained by all the tests capable of bearing on the point, that
the current of electricity was, in every case, from the anterior parts
of the animal through the water or surrounding conductors to the
posterior parts.     The author then proceeds to express his hope that
by means of these organs and the similar parts of the Torpedo, a
relation as to action and re-action of the electric and nervous powers
may be established experimentally ; and he briefly describes the form
of experiment which seems likely to yield positive results of thi9
kind.

                                       On the Curvature of Surfaces." By
John R. Young, Esq. Communicated by John W. Lubbock, Esq.,
M.A., V.P. and Treas. R.S.
   The principal object of this paper is, to remove the obscurity in
which that part of the theory of the curvature of surfaces which re
lates to umbilical points has been left by Monge and Dupin, to
whom, however, subsequently             to the labours of Euler, we are
chiefly indebted for a comprehensive and systematic theory of the
curvature of surfaces.      In it the author shows, that the lines of cur
vature at an umbilic are not, as at other points on a surface, two in
number, or, as had been stated by Dupin, limited ; but that they pro
ceed in every possible direction from the umbilic.
   The obscurity complained of is attributed to the inaccurate con
ceptions entertained by Monge and Dupin, of the import of the sym
bol  -  in the analytical discussion of this question, the equation which
determines    the directions of the lines of curvature    taking the form
at an umbilic.      After stating that Dupin has been guided by the de
termination    of the differential calculus, the author remarks, that in
no case is the differential calculus competent to decide whether 5, the
form which a general analytical result takes in certain particular hy
potheses, as to the arbitrary quantities entering that result, has or
has not innumerable values.        He then states the principle, that those
values of the arbitrary quantities (and none else) which render the
equations of condition indeterminate        must also render the final re

                                             113
*ult, to which they lead, equally indeterminate                         ;   and that, therefore,
when such result assumes the form                   -,      its true character          is to be
tested by the equations that have led to                      it,
                                              after these have been
modified by the hypothesis from which that form has arisen.
   In " Memoire sur la Courbure des Surfaces," (Journal de l'Ecole
     a
Polytechnique, Tom. XIII.), Poisson has arrived at the conclusion,
that the number of lines of curvature passing through an umbilical
point is   infinite, and that those selected by Dupin differ from the
others only by satisfying an additional differential equation        those              ;
others equally satisfying the conditions of a line of curvature.
These are precisely the conclusions arrived at by the author. As,
however, he considers that the mode of investigation pursued by
Poisson  is  peculiar and ill adapted to the objects apparently in view,
namely,   to  reconcile the results of Monge and Dupin and to remove
their obscurities, he was induced to investigate some of the more
important properties of curve surfaces, by       method somewhat dif
                                                              a
ferent from that usually employed.

plane, an equation equivalent to, and nearly identical with, Dupin's
equation of his indicatrix,     readily deduced.
                                 is                 From this are imme
diately derived some properties of the radii of curvature, first shown
by Dupin and likewise the theorem of Meusnier. The author then
           ;
enters upon the subject of the lines of curvature.
   From the equations
                                A   =   0,         B   =»    0,

                                                 the equations of the
normal at a point near to the former are determined.        That these
normals may intersect, which       the condition giving the directions
                                        is
of the lines of curvature, the two sets of equations must simulta
neously exist   and hence are deduced the differential equations of

By this method, which fundamentally      not very different from that
                                                       is
of Monge, substituting the usual expressions for    and B, the equa         A
tion that determines the directions of the lines of curvature  de                           is
duced, in the form in which    had been previously given by Monge
                                      it
and Dupin.
   This final equation becoming at an umbilic of the form,
                           •&)¦+           •(£)+•-»
in which   ^ way         be indeterminate,         the author inquires how this in-

                                         114
determinate    form will affect the equations of condition.           As by this
supposition,    these   are reduced    to  equations from    which  would  result
the conditions that would render all the coefficients of the determi
ning equation 0, it is inferred that               must he ^determinate, and
                                               ^
that therefore, at an umbilic there issue lines of curvature in all di
rections.
    Of these lines of curvature, it is possible that some may be di
stinguished from others, by proceeding from the point in more inti
mate contact with the osculating sphere, and it is therefore necessary
to determine the analytical character of such particular lines of cur
vature. With this view, the author resumes the equation of the
normal in the immediate vicinity of the umbilic. He then points out,
that a straight line, whose equations contain the second differential
coefficients,    thus involving a new condition, will coincide more
nearly with this normal, than can any straight line not having that
condition. That the lines may intersect in the centre of the oscu
lating sphere, their equations must simultaneously exist ; and thus,
that which most nearly coincides with the normal in the immediate
vicinity of the umbilic has the new conditions,

in addition to the former ones.
    From this it appears, that when the direction of a line of curvature
issuing from an umbilic is such as to fulfil, besides the ordinary con
ditions, the foregoing new conditions, that line of curvature will lie
more closely to the osculating sphere than any other not satisfying
these additional equations.          These new conditions arise from differ
entiating the preceding ones with respect to x and y, considered as
                            dy
dependent,    regarding           as constant   ; and as these are equivalent
to a single condition (Monge's and Dupin's equation) it will be suf
ficient to differentiate this, under the above restrictions, in order to
obtain a single condition equivalent to the new ones. As this single
condition will appear under the form of an equation of the third
degree in          there  will, in  general, be at least one line of curvature,
proceeding from the umbilic, of more than ordinary closeness to the
osculating sphere ; and there may be three.               If, indeed, this equa
tion of the third degree       should,   like  that of  the second from which
it is deduced, be identical for the coordinates of the umbilic, it is
obvious from the investigation, that we must then proceed to an
other differentiation ; and so on, till we arrive at a determinate
equation, the real roots of which will make known the number and
directions of the lines of closest contact.

                                      115
      When, however, the author remarks in conclusion, all the lines of
  curvature issuing from the umbilic are equally close to the oscu
  lating sphere, then these successive differentiations will either at
  length exhaust the coefficients, and thus no determinate equation
  will arise ; or else they will conduct to an equation whose roots are
  all imaginary : and one or other of these circumstances must always
  take place at the vertex of a surface of revolution.

 Charles Jellicoe,     Esq.    Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
 Sec. R.S.
     The author, considering that the variations and discrepancies in
 the annual decrements of life which are exhibited in the tables of
 mortality hitherto published would probably disappear, and that
 these decrements would follow a perfectly regular and uniform law,
 if the observations on which they are founded were sufficiently nu
 merous, endeavours to arrive at an approximation to such a law, by
 proper interpolations in the series of the numbers of persons living
 at every tenth year of human life. The method he proposes, for
 the attainment of this object, is that of taking, by proper formulae,
the successive orders of differences, until the last order either disap
pears, or may be assumed equal to zero.        With the aid of such dif
ferences, of which, by applying these formulae, he gives the calcula
tion, he constructs tables of the annual decrements founded princi
pally on the results of the experience of the Equitable Assurance
Society.

    A  paper was read,    entitled, " On the state of the Interior of the
Earth." By W. Hopkins, Esq. A.M., F.R.S., Second Memoir. "On
the Phenomena of Precession and Nutation, assuming the Fluidity of
the Interior of the Earth."

                                      116
    In this memoir     the author investigates     the amount of the luni-
solar precession     and nutation, assuming       the  earth to consist of a
solid spheroidal shell filled with fluid. For the purpose of present
ing the problem under its most simple form, he first supposes the
solid shell to be bounded by a determinate inner spheroidal surface,
of which the ellipticity is equal to that of the outer surface ; the
change from the solidity of the shell to the fluidity of the included
mass being, not gradual, but abrupt.           He also here supposes both
the shell and the fluid to be homogeneous, and of equal density.
The author then gives the statement of the problem which he pro
poses to investigate ; the investigation itself, which occupies the re
mainder of the paper, being wholly analytical, and insusceptible of
abridgement.       The following, however, are the results to which he
is conducted by this laborious process : namely, that, on the hypo
thesis above stated, 1. The Precession will be the same, whatever be
the thickness of the shell, as if the whole earth were homogeneous
and solid. 2. The Lunar Nutation will be the same as for the homo
geneous spheroid to such a degree of approximation that the differ
ence would be inappreciable to observation.           3. The Solar Nutation
will be sensibly the same as for the homogeneous spheroid, unless
the thickness of the shell be very nearly of a certain value, namely,
something less than one quarter of the earth's radius ; in which case
this nutation might become much greater than for the solid spheroid.
4. In addition to the above motions of precession and nutation, the
pole of the earth would have a small circular motion, depending en
tirely on the internal fluidity.       The radius of the circle thus de
scribed would be greatest when the thickness of the shell was the
 least : but the inequality thus produced would not, for the smallest
 thickness of the shell, exceed a quantity of the same order as the
polar nutation, and for any but the most inconsiderable thickness of
 the shell would be entirely inappreciable to observation.
     In his next communication, the author purposes considering the
 case in which both the solid shell and the inclosed fluid mass are of
 variable density.

 lieux sur la forme cristalline." Par M. L. A. Necker. Communicated
 by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     In this communication, after adverting to Haiiy's theory of cry
 stallization, in which the molecules are considered to be polyhedrons,
 to the views subsequently taken by Wollaston and Davy, and par
 ticularly to Brewster's conclusions, that there ought to be different
 forms of molecules,        some spherical,      some elliptical with two
  equal axes, and a third unequal to these, and others elliptical with
  three unequal axes ; M. Necker states, that Mr. Dana is the only
  mineralogist who has attempted to introduce into crystallography
  the consideration     of molecules with curved surfaces.         Although,
  adopting the forms proposed by Brewster, and adding to them those

                                     117
of    oblique solids, by introducing the idea of polarity in the axes of
crystallization, Mr. Dana has successfully applied this molecular
theory to crystallography, yet he goes no farther ; and the most im
portant and difficult steps in this branch of physical science still re
main to be made, and many phenomena in crystallization, with the
cause of which we are at present wholly unacquainted, still require
to be explained by the theory.        The author particularly refers to
the important facts discovered by MM. Leblanc and Beudant, of
the influence that solutions or mediums in which bodies crystallize
have on the secondary forms which these bodies take ; and states,
that the present views of crystallography afford not even a glimpse
of the least relation between such forms and the properties of the
mediums.       Why, he asks, does pure water appear, in general, to
tend to simplify the forms, precisely as do certain mixtures, those of
chlorite in axinite, quartz, felspar, &c, and why, on the contrary,
do other mediums,      acid or earthy, complicate them ?
     Impressed with the importance which must attach to the solution
of such questions, M. Necker offers some ideas which long medita
tion on this important subject has suggested to him.
     Adopting the ellipsoid as the form of the molecule, he remarks,
that the more complicated the form of the crystal, the more the
number of its faces increases, and the more, at the same time, does
it approach to the ellipsoidal form of the molecule ; and, on the con
trary, the simpler the form becomes, the more does it recede from
that with a curved surface. All crystalline forms may be considered
 as making a part of one or more series, which, in each system of
 crystallization, have for extreme terms, on the one side, the most sim
 ple solid of the system, or that which has the least number possible
 of faces, and on the other, the solid having the greatest number,
 namely a sphere or an ellipsoid. Although it is more convenient in
 the calculation of forms to start from the most simple polyhedral
 forms in order to arrive at the more complex, nothing proves that
 such has been the route which nature has followed.        As long as we
 considered the integral molecules as polyhedral, it appeared natural
 to view them as grouping in polyhedrons ; but when once we cease
 to admit polyhedral molecules, it then becomes most natural to sup
 pose, that ellipsoidal molecules should have a tendency, more or less
 decided, to group in solids of the same form as themselves, when no
 extraneous circumstances interpose an obstacle to this tendency.
      In order to give an idea of the kind of effect which would be pro
 duced on the form of the solid by these obstacles, such as the nature
 of the medium in which crystallization takes place, a hurried or tu
 multuous crystallization, &c, the author conceives that each mole
  cule, as well as each solid formed by their union, has different axes
  of attraction, endued with different degrees of energy, and symme
  trically disposed in groups, the weaker and the most numerous round
  the stronger, which are, at the same time, the smallest in number ;
  all, in short, symmetrically arranged around the principal axes of
  crystallization, which are the most energetic of all. Thus we shall
  conceive that sort of polarity by which crystallization is distin

                                      118
   guished from molecular attraction.       The effect of obstacles, »ucb
   as the attraction exerted by mediums, by interposed bodies, by the
   molecular attraction of the molecules themselves, when they arrive
  both in too great numbers and too rapidly towards the same point,
  will be the annihilation of the weaker axes ; whence will follow the
  formation of a tangent plane to the spherical or elliptical surface.
  If the action of the obstacle goes on increasing, axes of attraction,
  which, by their intensity, had resisted the first obstacles, are destroyed
  by the new ones ; and new tangential planes are produced, in which
  those that had been first formed finish by being confounded : thus it
  will happen that, by the increase of obstacles, the surface of the solid
  from being curved has become polyhedral, and finishes by presenting
  only an assemblage of a small number of plane faces, separated by
  edges, and placed tangentially at the extremity of the axes whose
  forces have longest resisted the action of the obstacles.       But since
 the   most energetic axes are necessarily the least  numerous,  the greater
  the energy they possess, the number of faces which bound the solid
 will continually decrease according as the obstacles increase ; until,
 at length, the solid, reduced to its most simple form, no longer pre
 sents any but that constituted by the principal axes of crystallization,
 terminating at the summits of the solid angles of the simple poly
 hedron, which axes alone have been capable of withstanding the ac
 tion of all the obstacles opposed to the tendency of the molecules to
 unite in the form of an ellipsoid.
     On this hypothesis, the author explains how common salt, alum,
 sulphate of iron, &c, crystallize in pure water in the most simple
 forms, the reciprocal attraction of their molecules being controlled
 and diminished by the affinity exerted on them by the molecules of
 the water; whilst if some of these molecules of water are neutralized
by mixture with another soluble principle, they cease to act as an
 obstacle to the crystallization of the body, which then takes forms
more complicated and approaching nearer to that of the normal solid
with a curved surface.
     M. Necker considers that the new views he has sketched require,
for their complete developement, many ulterior details, as well as
many new experiments and new facts ; but that the tendency which
the crystals of all systems present, to progress towards the curved
surface form appropriate to each system, by the complication of their
forces, is a fundamental fact of the first importance ; and that an ad
vance has been made by showing the bearing of the important ex
periments of MM. Leblanc and Beudant, and by having brought
the theory of crystallography nearer to those views which the pro
gress of chemistry and of physics have led us to adopt, relative to
the form of the elementary molecules of bodies.

F.R.S.
   The researches which form the subject of this paper were sug
gested by an inquiry into the most effectual method of ascertaining
the quantity of nitrate of potassa existing in crude saltpetre.                  The
author found that by the action of hydrochloric acid the nitrate of
potassa was converted into the chloride of potassium; and converse
ly, that the chloride of potassium might, by the proper regulation of
the temperature, be reconverted into the nitrate of potassa by the
action of nitric acid.       These mutual conversions afforded excellent
means of determining, with great exactness, the relative equivalent
numbers, in the theory of definite proportions, belonging to these
salts, and to their respective constituent elements.           The author, ac
cordingly, pursued the investigation of these numbers by several suc
cessive steps, of which the details occupy the greater part of the
present paper.       He first determines the equivalent of chloride of
potassium by decomposing chlorate of potassa into oxygen and chlo-

                                   120
 ride of potassium ; the proportion between which gives the ratio
 which the respective equivalent numbers of each bear to one another,
 and also to that of chlorate of potassa.    The equivalent of nitrate of
 potassa is next obtained by converting the chlorate and the chloride
 of potassium into that salt ; and from these data the equivalents of
 chlorine and of nitrogen are deduced.      A similar train of inquiry is
 next instituted with the corresponding salts having sodium for their
 base : chlorate of soda being decomposed into the chloride, and
 into the nitrate ; nitrate of soda into chloride ; and chloride of so
 dium into nitrate of soda. The results of these different series of
 experiments coincide so closely with one another as mutually to con
 firm their general accuracy in the most satisfactory manner.         For
 the purpose of determining the equivalent numbers of the element
 ary bodies themselves, (namely, chlorine, nitrogen, potassium, and
 sodium,) the author employed the intermedium of silver, the several
 saline combinations of which with chlorine and with nitric acid were
 found to afford peculiar advantages for the accurate determination of
 the relative weights of the constituents of these salts, when subjected
 to various combinations and decompositions. The conclusions to
 which the author arrives with regard to the equivalent numbers for
 the six elementary bodies in question, tend to corroborate the views
 of the late Dr. Turner, and to overturn the favourite hypothesis that
 all equivalent numbers are simple multiples of that for hydrogen.
 He finds these numbers to be as follow :
                   Oxygen                         8-
                   Chlorine                      35-45
                   Nitrogen                      14-02
                   Potassium                     39-08
                   Sodium                        23-05
                   Silver                       107-97
     The author intends to pursue these inquiries, by applying similar
methods to the investigation of other classes of salts.

genic Drawing, or the Process by which Natural Objects may be
made to delineate themselves without the aid of the Artist's Pencil."
By H. F. Talbot, Esq., F.R.S.
   In this communication the author    states, that during the last four
or five years he has invented and brought to a considerable degree

                                    121
of perfection,  a process  for copying the forms of natural objects by
means of solar    light, which  is received upon paper previously pre
pared  in  a particular  manner.   He observes, that a prior attempt of
this kind is recorded in the Journal of the Royal Institution for
1 802 ; by which it appears that the idea was originally suggested
by Mr. Wedgwood, and afterwards experimented on by Sir Hum
phry Davy. These philosophers found, that their principle, though
theoretically true, yet failed in practice, on account of certain diffi
culties ; the two piincipal of which were : first, that the paper could
not be rendered sufficiently sensible to receive any impression what
ever from the feeble light of a camera obscura ; and secondly, that
the pictures which were formed by the solar rays could not be pre
served, owing to their still continuing to be acted upon by the light.
   The author states that his experiments were begun without his
being aware of this prior attempt ; and that in the course of them
he discovered methods of overcoming the two difficulties above re
lated. With respect to the latter, he says, that he has found it pos
sible by a subsequent process, so to fix the images or shadows form
ed by the solar rays, that they become insensible to light, and con
sequently admit of being preserved during any length of time : as
an example of which, he mentions, that he has exposed some of his
pictures to the sunshine for the space of an hour, without injury.
   With respect to the other point, he states that he has succeeded
in discovering a method of preparing the paper which renders it
much more sensitive to light than any which had been used previ
ously ; and by means of which he finds, that there is no difficulty
in fixing the pictures given by the camera obscura and by the solar
microscope.
   He states that in the summer of 1835 he made a great number of
portraits of a house in the country of ancient architecture, several
of which were this evening exhibited to the Society.
   After some speculations on the possibility of discovering a yet
more sensitive paper, the author mentions, that the kind employed
by him may be rendered so much so, as to become visibly affected
by the full light of the sun, in the space of half a second.
   The rest of this paper contains an account of various other ways
in which this method may be employed in practice, according to the
kind of object which it is required to copy : also, a brief mention of
the great variety of effects resulting from comparatively small differ
ences in the mode of preparation of the paper : and, of certain ano
malies which occur in the process, the cause of which has not hitherto
been rendered distinctly manifest.
   In conclusion, the author designates this as "a new process,
which he offers to the lovers of science and nature."

valents of certain Bodies."    By Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author examines, by a new series of experiments, the truth
of the theory of Dr. Prout and Dr. Thomson, namely, that " all
atomic weights are simple multiples of that of hydrogen," a theory
which the late Dr. Turner had maintained is at variance with the
most exact analytic researches, and consequently untenable. Although
the experiments of Dr. Turner, and the inferences which he drew
from them, agree very nearly with those of Berzelius, it still ap
peared to the author desirable to investigate this subject ; and it
occurred to him that the inquiry might be conducted in a mode not
liable to some of the objections which might be urged against the
processes usually employed.
    Dr. Turner having adopted a whole number, namely 108, as the
equivalent of silver, this substance was selected by the author as the
basis of his inquiry into the equivalent numbers of chlorine, and
some other elementary gases.       It appeared to him that the chance
of error arising from the fusing of the chloride of silver might be
entirely removed, and other advantages gained, by experimenting on
silver on a large scale, with such proportions of the substances em
ployed as were deemed to be equivalents ; and instead of calculating
from the whole product of the fused chloride, to do it merely from
the weight of such small portion only, as might arise from the dif
ference between theoretical views and experimental results.
    The author concludes, from the train of reasoning he applies to
the series of experiments so undertaken, that no material, and even
 scarcely any appreciable error can arise from considering the equiva
lent numbers of hydrogen, oxygen, azote, and chlorine, as being 1,
 8, 14, and 36 respectively.

     After describing the position of his house, and the nature of the
 instruments employed for observation, the writer gives his observa
 tions of the barometer and thermometer on the 6th and 7 th of Ja
 nuary last, and proceeds to state, that on the 6th, at about ten
 minutes past ten o'clock p.m. violent squalls commenced, at first
  with intermissions of perfect calms, but gradually becoming more
 frequent, and being accompanied by the sound of strong and in
 creasing whirlwinds.       By eleven o'clock the wind was observed to
 proceed from the East, and its velocity was estimated at forty miles
 an hour.     Its violence then increased, and threatened to blow down
 the chimneys.      At midnight it abated, at the same time shifting to
 the south or west.       At two o'clock in the morning nearly two tons
  of lead were torn away by the wind from the west end platform on
 the house-top, and thrown down behind the house in a westerly di
 rection.    Some of the lower windows having been left a little open,
 the wind thus admitted into the house forced up and blew off the
 very heavy hatch-door of the roof, which was covered with lead.
 The whole house rocked terribly, and even the stone floor of the
 half-sunk kitchen story heaved as if shaken by an earthquake : the
 slates from the roof were blown in every direction, some being car
 ried to a prodigious distance.      During the greater part of the night
 the rain fell in tremendous torrents.       In the interval from two to
 half-past  three  in   the morning,  the barometer    sunk very nearly an
 inch and a half, and reached its greatest depression.       But the tem
 pest  continued   till about four o'clock,   when  it  began gradually to
 subside.    Extensive devastation occurred among the trees ; some that
 were blown down raising two or three tons of clay soil with the roots.
 Several trees thus thrown down fell with their tops to the W.N.W.
     The writer concludes from these and other observations, that the
 first and squally part of the storm began from the E.S.E., and blew
 from S. by W. at about midnight ; and that most injury was done
 to the slating and roof when the wind was not far from the south. It
 then gradually veered to the west, till noon, and reached the N.W.
point by eight o'clock in the evening of the same day.

the author selects, in the first place, paper of a good firm quality
and smooth surface ; and thinks that none answers better than su

                                        125
    perfine writing paper.     He dips it into a weak solution of common
    salt, and wipes it dry, by which the salt is uniformly distributed
   throughout its substance.       He then spreads a solution of nitrate of
   silver on one surface only, and dries it at the fire. The solution
   should not be saturated, but six or eight times diluted with water.
   When dry, the paper is fit for use.         He has found by experiment
   that there is a certain proportion between the quantity of salt and
   that of the solution of silver which answers best, and gives the
   maximum effect.       If the strength of the salt is augmented beyond
   this point, the effect diminishes, and in certain cases becomes ex
   ceedingly small. This paper, if properly made, is very useful for all
   ordinary photogenic purposes.        For example, nothing can be more
  perfect than the images it gives of leaves and flowers, especially with
  a summer sun.         The light passing through the leaves delineates
  every    ramification of their nerves. If a sheet of paper thus prepared,
  be taken and washed with a saturated solution of salt, and then
  dried, it will be found (especially if the paper has been kept some
  weeks before the trial is made) that its sensibility is greatly diminish
  ed, and in some cases seems quite extinct. But if it be again washed
  with a liberal quantity of the solution of silver, it becomes again
  sensible to light, and even more so than it was at first. In this way,
  by alternately washing the paper with salt and silver, and drying it
  between times, Mr. Talbot has succeeded in increasing its sensibility
  to the degree that is requisite for receiving the images of the camera
 obscura. In conducting this operation it will be found that the re
 sults are sometimes more and sometimes less satisfactory in conse
 quence of small and accidental variations in the proportions employ
 ed.      It happens sometimes that the chloride of silver is disposed to
 darken of itself without any exposure to the light : this shows that
 the attempt to give it sensibility has been carried too far. The object
 is, to approach to this condition as near as possible, without reaching
 it, so that the substance may be in a state ready to yield to the
 slightest extraneous force, such as the feeble impact of the violet
 rays when much attenuated.          Having therefore prepared a number
 of sheets of paper slightly different from one another in the composi
 tion, let a piece be cut from each, and having been duly marked or
 numbered, let them be placed side by side in a very weak diffused
light for about a quarter of an hour. Then, if any one of them, as
frequently happens, exhibits a marked advantage over its compe
titors, Mr. Talbot selects the paper which bears the corresponding
number, to be placed in the camera obscura.
     With regard to the second object, that of fixing the images, Mr.
Talbot observed that after having tried ammonia and several other re
agents, with very imperfect success, the first which gave him a suc
cessful result was the iodide of potassium much diluted with water.
If a photogenic picture is washed over with this liquid, an iodide of
silver is formed, which is absolutely unalterable by sunshine. This
process requires precaution ; for, if the solution is too strong, it at
tacks the dark parts of the picture.        It is requisite therefore to find
by trial the proper proportions.        The fixation of the pictures in this
way, with proper management, is very beautiful and lasting.              The

                                      126
specimen of lace which Mr. Talbot exhibited to the Society, and
which was made five years ago, was preserved in this manner. But
his usual method of fixing is different from this, and somewhat sim
pler, or at least, requiring less nicety.        It consists in immersing the
picture in a strong solution of common salt, and then wiping off the
superfluous moisture and drying it.            It is sufficiently singular that
the same substance which is so useful in giving sensibility to the
paper, should also be capable, under other circumstances, of destroy
ing it, but such is nevertheless the fact.          Now, if the picture which
has been thus washed and         dried, is placed in the sun, the white parts
colour themselves of a pale lilac tint ; after which they become in
sensible.    Numerous experiments have shown the author, that the
depth   of this  lilac tint varies according to the quantity of salt used
relatively  to  the   quantity of silver. But by properly adjusting these,
the images may, if desired, be retained of an absolute whiteness. He
mentions also, that those preserved by iodine are always of a very
pale primrose yellow, which has the extraordinary and very remark
able property of turning to a full gaudy yellow whenever it is ex
posed to the heat of a fire, and recovering its former colour again
 when it is cold.
    A  paper   was also read,     entitled,   " A Description of      a Hydro-
 pneumatic Baroscope."         By J. T. Cooper, Esq., Lecturer on Che
 mistry.
    The liability of the ordinary mercurial barometer to derangement
 and to fracture, led the author to the construction of an instrument
 for measuring atmospheric pressure that should be exempt from
 these objections.       It consists of a float, formed by a brass tube,
 having the shape of the frustum of an inverted cone, nine inches
 long, two inches in diameter above, and one inch below, and its
 content being about fourteen cubic inches. From the centre of the
 upper and wider end, which is closed, a brass wire proceeds, sur
 mounted by a cup, for the purpose of holding such weights as are
 necessary for bringing the float, when immersed in water, to the
 same constant level.        The lower and smaller end of the tube is
 closed by a brass plug, sufficiently heavy to sink the instrument to the
 proper depth, and maintain its position, and having a small perfora
 tion in its centre.     This float is inclosed in a case, containing the
 water in which it is to be immersed, and which is to be raised to a
 constant given temperature by a spirit lamp burning beneath it.
 The float being first filled with water, a given portion of this water
 is poured out into a measure of known capacity, and is consequently
 replaced by an equal volume of air, the dilatations or contractions of
 which will, when the temperature is constant, be dependent only on
 the external pressure of the atmosphere ; and the latter will, there
 fore, be indicated by the weights requisite to be placed in the cup of
 the float, in order to maintain it at the same level in the fluid, on the
 principle of the hydrometer. The author gives a minute description
 of all the parts of the apparatus, of the method of using it, and of
 the adjustments and calculations required for determining by its
 means the difference of level of two stations.

      JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK,              Esq., V.P. and Treas.,
                              in the Chair.
    Commander Henry Mangles Denham, R.N., and Richard Drew,
Esq., were balloted for, and duly elected into the Society.
    The reading of a paper, entitled, " Observations on the Parallel
 Roads of Glen Roy, and of other parts of Lochaber, with an attempt
to prove that they are of Marine Origin." By Charles Darwin, Esq.,
M.A., F.R.S., Sec. Geological Society, was resumed and con
cluded.
    The author premises a brief description of the parallel roads,
shelves, or lines, as they have been indefinitely called, which are
most conspicuous     in Glen Roy and the neighbouring valleys, re
ferring for more detailed accounts to those given by Sir Thomas
Lauder Dick, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh, and by Dr. Macculloch in those of the Geological Society of
London.     Both these geologists endeavour to explain the formation
of these shelves on the hypothesis of their resulting from depositions
at the margin of lakes, which had formerly existed at those levels.
The author, however, shows that this hypothesis is inadmissible,
from the insuperable difficulties opposed to any conceivable mode of
the construction and removal, at successive periods, of several bar
riers of immense size, whether placed at the mouths of the separate
glens, or at more distant points.      He does not, however, propose
the alternative, that the beaches, if not deposited by lakes, must of
necessity have been formed by channels of the sea, because he deems
it more satisfactory to prove, from independent phenomena, that a
sheet of water, gradually subsiding from the height of the upper
shelves to the present level of the sea, occupied for long periods not
only the glens of Lochaber, but the greater number, if not all the
valleys of that part of Scotland ; and that this water must have been
that of the sea. It is argued by the author, that the fluctuating ele
ment must have been the land, from the ascertained fact of the land
rising in one part, and at the same time sinking in another ; and
therefore, that this change of level in Scotland, attested as it is by
marine remains being found at considerable        heights both on the
eastern and western coasts, implies the elevation of the land, and
not the subsidence of the surrounding waters.        The author next
shows, that in all prolonged upward movements of this kind, it might
be predicted, both from the analogy of volcanic action, and from
the occurrence of lines of escarpment rising one above the other
in certain regions, that in the action of the subterranean im
pulses there would be intervals of rest.    On the hypothesis that the

                                   128
land was subjected to these conditions, it appears that its surface
would have been modeled in a manner exactly similar, even in its
minute details, to the existing structure of the valleys in Lochaber.
Considering that he has thus established his theory, the author pro
ceeds to remove the objections which might be urged against its
 truth, derived from the non-extension of the shelves, and the ab
sence of organic remains at great altitudes.        He then shows how
various details respecting the structure of the glens of Lochaber,
such as the extent of corrosion of the solid rock, the quantity of
shingle, the numerous levels at which water must have remained,
the forms of the heads of the valley, where the streams divide, and
especially their relation with the shelves, and the succession of ter
races near the mouth of Glen Spean, are all explicable on the suppo
sition that the valleys had become occupied by arms of a sea which
had been subject to tides, and which had gradually subsided during
the rising of the land ; two conditions which could not be fulfilled in
any lake. From the attentive consideration bestowed by the au
thor on these several and independent steps of the argument, he re
gards the truth of the theory of the marine origin of the parallel roads
of Lochaber (a theory, of which the foundation stone may be said to
have been laid by the important geological researches of Mr. Lyell,
establishing the fact of continents having slowly emerged from be
neath the sea) as being sufficiently demonstrated.
    The author states, in the concluding part of his paper, the follow
ing as being the chief points which receive illustration from the
examination of the district of Lochaber by Sir Thomas Lauder Dick,
Dr. Macculloch, and himself. It appears that nearly the whole of
the water- worn materials in the valleys of this part of Scotland were
left, as they now exist, by the slowly retiring waters of the sea ;
and the principal action of the rivers since that period has been to
remove such deposits ; and when this had been effected, to excavate
a wall-sided gorge in the solid rock. Throughout this entire district,
every main, and most of the lesser inequalities of surface are due,
primarily to the elevating forces, and, secondarily, to the modeling
power of successive beach-lines. The ordinary alluvial action has
been exceedingly insignificant ; and even moderately sized streams
have worn much less deeply into the solid rock than might have
been anticipated, during the vast period which must have elapsed
since the sea was on a level with the upper shelves : even the steep
slopes of turf over large spaces, and the bare surface of certain rocks,
having been perfectly preserved during the same lapse of time. The
elevation of this part of Scotland to the amount of at least 1278 feet
was extremely gradual, and was interrupted by long intervals of
rest.    It took place either during the so called " erratic block pe
riod," or afterwards ; and it is probable that the erratic blocks were
transported during the quiet formation of the shelves.     One of these
was found at an altitude of 2200 feet above the present level of the
sea.    The most extraordinary fact is, that a large tract of country
was elevated to a great height, so equably, that the ancient beach-
lines retain the same curvature, or nearly so, which they had when
forming the margin of the convex surface of the ancient waters.

                                     129
The inferences drawn by the author from these facts, and which he
corroborates   by other evidence, are that a large area must have been
uplifted, and that its rise was effected by a slight change in the
convex form of the fluid matter on which the crust of the earth rests ;
and therefore that the fluidity of the former is sufficiently perfect to
allow of the atoms moving in obedience to the law of gravitation,
and consequently, of the operation of that law modified by the cen
trifugal force : and lastly, that even the disturbing forces do not
tend to give to the earth a figure widely different from that of a
spheroid in equilibrium.

                                   " On the Male Organs of some of the
Cartilaginous Fishes."      By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., Assistant
Inspector of Army Hospitals.
   In this paper, which is wholly occupied with anatomical details,
the author refers to his paper on the Torpedo, which was published
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1834; and also to Midler's
work " De Glandularum secernentium structura penitiori," whose
descriptions and views are not in accordance with those given in
that paper.    In the present memoir he adduces evidence of the ac
curacy of his former statement, chiefly founded on microscopical ob
servations, and offers some conjectures respecting the functions of
several organs found in cartilaginous fishes ; but does not pretend
to attach undue importance to his speculations.
   A paper was also     read,  entitled, " Researches in Physical Geo
logy. — Third Series.     On the Phenomena of Precession and Nuta
tion, assuming the interior of the earth to be a heterogeneous fluid."
By W. Hopkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c.
    Having, in his last memoir, completed the investigation of the
amount of precession and nutation, on the hypothesis of the earth's
consisting of a homogeneous fluid mass, contained in a homogeneous
solid shell, the author here extends the inquiry to the case in which
both the interior fluid and external shell are considered as hetero
geneous.     After giving the details of his analytical investigation, he
remarks, that he commenced the inquiry in the expectation that the
solution of this problem would lead to results different from those
previously obtained on the hypothesis of the earth's entire solidity.
This expectation was founded on the great difference existing be
tween the direct action of a force on a solid, and that on a fluid mass,
in its tendency to produce a rotatory motion ; for, in fact, the dis
turbing forces of the sun and moon do not tend to produce directly

                                    130
any motion in the interior fluid, in which the rotatory motion causing
precession and nutation is produced indirectly by the effect of the
same forces on the position of the solid shell. A modification is thus
produced in the effects of the centrifugal force, which exactly com
pensates for the want of any direct effect from the action of the dis
turbing forces ; acompensation which the author considers as scarcely
less curious than many others already recognized in the solar system,
and by which, amidst many conflicting causes, its harmony and per
manence are so beautifully and wonderfully preserved.
    The solution of the problem obtained by the author destroys the
force of an argument, which might have been urged against the hy
pothesis of central fluidity, founded on the presumed improbability
of our being able to account for the phenomena of precession and
nutation on this hypothesis, as satisfactorily as on that of internal
solidity.    The object, however, of physical researches of this kind
is not merely to determine the actual state of the globe, but also to
trace its past history through that succession of ages, in which the
matter composing it has probably passed gradually through all the
 stages between a simple elementary state and that in which it has
become adapted to the habitation of man.        In this point of view the
author conceives the problem he proposes is not without value, as
 demonstrating an important fact in the history of the earth, pre
 suming its solidification to have begun at the surface ; namely, the
 permanence of the inclination of its axis of rotation, from the epoch
 of the first formation of an exterior crust. This permanence has
 frequently been insisted on, and is highly important as connected
 with the speculations of the author on the causes of that change of
 temperature which has probably taken place in the higher latitudes :
 all previous proofs of this fact having rested on the assumption of
 the earth's entire solidity ; an assumption which, whatever may be
 the actual state of our planet, can never be admitted as applicable
 to it at all past epochs of time, at which it may have been the habi
 tation of animate beings.
     The author concludes, by expressing a hope that he may be enabled
 to prosecute the inquiry still further, and to bring before the Royal
 Society, at a future time, the matured results of his speculations.

Formation of Alkaline and Earthy Bodies, with reference to their
presence in Plants, the Influence of Carbonic Acid in their genera
tion, and the equilibrium of this gas in the atmosphere." By Ro
bert Rigg, Esq.      Communicated by the Rev.       J.  B. Reade, M,A.,
F.R.S.
    The object of the author, in the present memoir, is to show that
the solid materials which compose the residual matter in the analy
sis of vegetable substances, and which consist of alkaline and earthy
bodies, are actually formed during the process of fermentation, whe
ther that process be excited artificially, by the addition of a small
quantity of yeast to fermentable mixtures, or take place naturally
in the course of vegetation, or of spontaneous decomposition. His
experiments also tend to show that this formation of alkaline and
earthy bodies is always preceded by the absorption of carbonic acid,
whether that acid be naturally formed or artificially supplied. He
finds, also, that different kinds of garden mould, some being calca
reous, others siliceous, and others aluminous, exposed in retorts to
atmospheres consisting of a mixture of carbonic acid gas and com
mon air, absorb large quantities of the former, combining with it
 in such a manner as not to afford any traces of this carbonic acid
being disengaged by the action of other acids.         He considers the
result of this combination to be the formation of an alkaline body,
 and also of a colouring matter.     This combination takes place to a
 greater extent during the night than during the day ; and in gene
 ral, the absorption of carbonic acid by the soil is greatest in pro
portion as it is more abundantly produced by the processes of vege
 tation ; and conversely, it is least at the time when plants decom
pose this gas, appropriating its basis to the purposes of their own
 system.    Hence he conceives that there is established in nature a
 remarkable compensating provision, which regulates the quantity of
carbonic acid in the atmosphere, and renders its proportion constant.
     A paper was also read,   entitled, " Note on the Art of Photogra
 phy, or the application of the Chemical Rays of Light to the pur
 poses of Pictorial Representation."     By Sir John F. W. Herschel,
 Bart., K.H.,  V.P.R.S.,   &c.
     The author states that his attention was first called to the subject
 of M. Daguerre's concealed photographic processes, by a note from
 Captain Beaufort, dated the 22nd of January last, at which time he
 was ignorant that it had been considered by Mr. Talbot, or by any
 one in this country.    As an enigma to be solved, a variety of pro
 cesses at once presented themselves, of which the most promising
  are the following; 1st, the so-called de-oxidizing power of the che
  mical rays in their action on recently precipitated chloride of silver;
  2ndly, the instant and copious precipitation of a mixture of a solu
 tion of muriate of platina and lime-water by solar light, forming an
  insoluble compound, which might afterwards be blackened by a va
  riety of agents ; 3rdly, the reduction of gold in contact with de
  oxidizing agents ; and, 4thly, the decomposition of an argentine
  compound soluble in water, exposed to light in an atmosphere of
  peroxide of chlorine, either pure or dilated.

                                    132
     Confining his attention, in the present notice, to the employment
 of chloride of silver, the author inquires into the methods by which
 the blackened traces can be preserved, which may be effected, he
  observes, by the application of any liquid capable of dissolving and
  washing off the unchanged chloride, but of leaving the reduced, or
 oxide of silver, untouched. These conditions are best fulfilled by
 the liquid hyposulphites.     Pure water will fix the photograph, by
  washing out the nitrate of silver, but the tint of the picture result
 ing is brick -red ; but the black colour may be restored by washing
 it over with a weak solution of hyposulphite of ammonia.
     The author found that paper impregnated with the chloride of
 silver was only slightly susceptible to the influence of light : but an
 accidental observation led him to the discovery of other salts of silver,
 in which the acid being more volatile, adheres to the base by a weak
 affinity, and which impart much greater sensibility to the paper
 on which they are applied : such as the carbonate, the nitrate, and
 the acetate.    The nitrate requires to be perfectly neutral ; for the
 least excess of acid lowers in a remarkable degree its susceptibility.
    In the application of photographic processes to the copying of
 engravings or drawings, many precautions, and minute attention to
a number of apparently trivial, but really important circumstances,
are required to ensure success.     In the first tranfers, both light and
shadow, as well as right and left, are the reverse of the original :
and to operate a second transfer, or by a double inversion to repro
duce the original effect, is a matter of infinitely greater difficulty ;
and in which the author has only recently ascertained the cause of
former failures, and the remedy to be applied.
    It was during the prosecution of these experiments that the au
thor was led to notice some remarkable facts relating to the action
of the chemical rays. He ascertained that, contrary to the prevail
ing opinion, the chemical action of light is by no means proportional
to the quantity of violet rays transmitted, or even to the general
tendency of the tint to the violet end of the spectrum : and his ex
periments lead to the conclusion that, in the same manner as media
have been ascertained to have relations sui generis to the calorific
rays, not regulated by their relations to the rays of illumination and
of colour, they have also specific relations to the chemical spectrum,
different from those they bear to the other kinds of spectra.         For
the successful prosecution of this curious investigation, the first step
must consist in the minute examination of the chemical actions of
all the parts of a pure spectrum, not formed by material prisms,
and he points out, for that purpose, one formed in Fraunhofer's me
thod, by the interference of the rays of light themselves in passing
through gratings, and fixed by the heliostat.
    He notices a curious phenomenon respecting the action of light
on nitrated paper ; namely, its great increase of intensity, under a
certain kind of glass strongly pressed in contact with it ; an effect
which cannot be explained either by the reflection of light, or the
presence of moisture ; but which may possibly be dependent on the
evolution of heat.

   I. " Description of a Compensating Barometer, adapted to Me
teorological purposes, and requiring no corrections either for Zero,
or for Temperature."     By Samuel B. Howlett, Esq., Chief Military
Draftsman, Ordnance.      Communicated by Sir John F. W. Herschel,
Bart., K.H., V.P.R.S., &c.
   In the instrument here described, there is provided, in addition to
the ordinary barometric tube (inverted, in the usual way, in a cistern
of mercury.) a second tube of the same dimensions, placed by the
side of the former, and likewise filled with mercury, but only to the
height of twenty-eight inches above the level of the mercury of the
cistern. This tube is closed at its lower end, and fixed to a float
supported by the mercury in the cistern : and it bears, at its upper
end, an ivory scale, three inches in length.      The elevation of the
mercury in the barometric tube is estimated by the difference be
tween its level and that of the mercury in the closed tube ; and is
measured on the ivory scale by the aid of a horizontal index, em
bracing both the tubes, and sliding vertically along them.       As the
float which bears the closed tube, to which the scale is attached,
rests freely on the mercury in the cistern, and consequently always
adjusts itself to the level of that fluid, no correction for the zero
point is needed ; and as every change of temperature must similarly
affect the columns of mercury in both the tubes, after the scale has
been adjusted so as to read correctly at any given temperature, such
as 32°, which may be effected by comparison with a standard baro

and will require no correction.       The author considers the error
arising from the difference of expansion corresponding to the dif
ferent lengths of the two columns of mercury, and which will rarely
amount to one four-hundredth of an inch, as too small to deserve
attention in practice, being, in fact, far within the limits of error in
ordinary observations.
    Subjoined to the above paper is a letter from the author to Sir
John Herschel, containing a statement of comparative observations
made with a mountain barometer, and with the compensation baro
meter, from which it appears that the use of the latter is attended
with the saving of a great quantity of troublesome calculation. The
comparative observations are given in a table, exhibiting a range of
differences from +-012 to — -016 of an inch.

Bokkeveld,       Cape   of Good Hope."          By Thomas Maclean, Esq.,
F.R.S., &c, in aletter to Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., V.P.R.S.,
and communicated by him.
     The appearance attending the fall of this aerolite, which happen
ed at half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 1 3th of October,
1838, was that of a meteor of a silvery hue, traversing the atmo
sphere, for a distance of about sixty miles, and then exploding with
a loud noise, like that from artillery, which was heard over an area
of more than seventy miles in diameter ; the air at the time being
calm and sultry.        The fragments were widely dispersed ; and were
at first so soft as to admit of being cut with a knife ; but they after
wards spontaneously hardened.              The entire mass of the aerolite is
estimated at about five cubic feet.

     The stone is stated as being soft, porous, and hygrometric ; having
when dry, the specific gravity of 2' 94 ; and possessing a very small
degree of magnetic power irregularly dispersed through it.                 One

of the following constituents ; namely,

     IV. " Note respecting a new kind of Sensitive Paper." Bv Henrv
Fox Talbot, Esq., F.R.S.
     The method of preparing the paper here referred to consists in
washing it over with nitrate of silver, then with bromide of potas
 sium, and afterwards again with nitrate of silver; drying it at the
fire after each operation. This paper is very sensitive to the light
 of the clouds, and even to the feeblest daylight.
     The author supplies an omission in his former memoir on photo
 genic drawing, by mentioning a method he had invented and prac
 tised nearly five years ago, of imitating etchings on copper plate, by
 smearing over a sheet of glass with a solution of resin in turpentine,
 and blackening it by the smoke of a candle. On this blackened sur
 face a design is made with the point of a needle, the lines of which
 will of course be transparent, and will be represented by dark lines
 on the prepared paper to which it is applied, when exposed to sun
 shine. The same principle may be applied to make numerous copies
 of any writing.

Bicyanide with Binoxide of Mercury." By James F. W. Johnston,
Esq., F.R.S.
   In this paper an account is given of the properties of a salt, ob
tained by agitating with red oxide of mercury a small proportion of
hydrocyanic acid, and which the author finds to be distinguished
from the bicyanide of mercury by its sparing solubility in cold water,
by the strong alkaline reaction exhibited by its solution, (a property
which indicates an excess of mercury,) and by its susceptibility of
detonation by heat, depending on this excess being in the state of
an oxide, and on the action of the oxygen on a portion of the car
bon of the cyanogen it contains, and the presence of which is shown
by the disengagement of hydrocyanic acid gas when acted on by
hydrosulphuric and hydrochloric acids.

  " On the Constitution of the Resins." Parti. By James F. W.
Johnston, Esq., F.R.S.
    The object of the general investigation, of which the commence
ment is given in this paper, is to determine the relative composition
of the various resins which occur in nature, and to trace the analogies
they exhibit in their constitution ; and also to ascertain how far they
may be regarded as being derived from one common principle, and
 whether they admit of being all represented by one or more general
formulae.
    The chemical investigation of the resin of mastic shows that this
 substance   consists of two resins ; the one soluble, and acid ; the
other insoluble, and having no acid properties. The formulae ex
pressing the analysis of each of these are given by the author. He
 also shows that a series of analyses may be obtained which do not
indicate the true constitution of a resin. The soluble resin, when
exposed to the prolonged action of a heat exceeding 300° Fahr. is
partly converted into a resin containing three, and partly into one
containing five equivalent parts of oxygen, the proportion of carbon
 remaining constant.     The same resin combines with bases, so as to
form four series of salts ; which, in the case of oxide of lead, consist
 of equivalents of resin and of oxide in the proportions, respectively,
 of two to one ; three to two ; one to one ; and one to two. This
 soluble resin in combining with bases does not part with any of its
oxygen ; but if any change takes place in its constitution, it consists
in the hydrogen being replaced by an equivalent proportion of a
metal; and formulae are given representing the salts of lead on this
theoretical view. By boiling the resin in contact with ammonia and
nitrate of silver, or perhaps with nitrate of ammonia, it is converted
into a resin which forms a bisalt with oxide of silver, in which there
is also an apparent replacement of hydrogen by silver.
    The resin next examined is that of dragon's blood : and the con
clusions deduced from its analysis are the following.     First, that the
lump dragon's blood is the natural and pure resin, while the strained
and red varieties, being manufactured articles, are more or less de
composed : secondly, that this resin retains alcohol and ether, as
most other resins do, with considerable tenacity ; but that these sol
vents may be entirely expelled by a long-continued exposure to a
temperature not higher than 200° Fahr. : and lastly, the formulae
representing its chemical composition is given.
    " Researches in Embryology." — Second Series.            By Martin
Barry, M.D., F.R.S.E., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians
in Edinburgh.      Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D. Sec. R.S.
    The author having, in the first series of these researches, investi
gated the formation of the mammiferous         ovum, describes in this
second series its incipient developement.    The knowledge at present

                                       137
  supposed to be possessed of the early stages in the developement of
  that ovum, consists chiefly of inferences from observations made on
  the ovum of the bird.
     But there exists a period in the history of the ovum of the mam
  mal, regarding which we have hitherto scarcely any direct or posi
  tive knowledge.      It appeared, therefore, highly desirable to obtain
  a series of observations in continuous succession on the earliest stages
  of developement.      In conducting this investigation, the author pur
 posely confined his attention to a single species, namely, the rabbit,
 of which he examined more than a hundred individual animals.
 Besides ova met with in the ovary, apparently impregnated, and
 destined to be discharged from that organ, he has seen upwards of
 three hundred ova in the Fallopian tube and uterus ; very few of the
 latter exceeding half a line in their diameter.      The results of these
 investigations have compelled the author to express his dissent from
 some of the leading doctrines of embryology, which at present prevail,
 as respects not only the class Mammalia, but the animal kingdom at
 large. The following are the principal facts which the author has
 observed in the developement of the mammiferous ovum.
     The difference between the mature and immature ovum consists
 in the condition of the yelk ; the yelk of the mature ovum contain
 ing no oil-like globules. Both maceration and incipient absorption
 produce changes in the unimpregnated ovum, which in some respects
 resemble those referable to impregnation.        During the rut, the num
 ber of Graafian vesicles appearing to become prepared for dischar
 ging their ova, exceeds the number of those which actually discharge
 them.     Ova of the rabbit which are destined to be developed, are in
 most instances discharged from the ovary in the course of nine or ten
 hours post coitum ; and they are all discharged about the same time.
     There is no condition of the ovum uniform in all respects which
 can be pointed out as the particular state in which it is discharged
 from the ovary ; but its condition is in several respects very different
 from that of the mature ovum ante coitum.            Among the changes
 occurring    in the  ovum   before it  leaves  the  ovary, are the follow
ing   : viz. the  germinal spot, previously    on the inner surface, passes
to the centre of the germinal vesicle ; the germinal vesicle, previously
at the surface, returns to the centre of the yelk ; and the membrane
investing the yelk, previously extremely thin, suddenly thickens.
Such changes render it highly probable that the ovary is the usual
seat of impregnation.       The author considers this view as being not
incompatible with the doctrine that contact between the seminal
fluid and the ovum is essential to impregnation, since he has found,
in the course of his researches, that spermatozoa penetrate as far as
to the surface of the ovary.     The retinacula and tunica granulosa are
the parts acted upon by the vis a tergo, which expels the ovum from
the ovary.       These parts are discharged with the ovum, render its
escape gradual, probably facilitate its passage into the Fallopian tube,
and appear to be the bearers of fluid for the immediate imbibition of
the ovum.        After the discharge of the ovum from the ovary, the
ovisac is obtainable free from the vascular covering, which, together

                                   138
with the ovisac, had constituted the Graafian vesicle.            It is the
vascular covering of the ovisac which becomes the corpus luteum.
Many ova, both mature and immature, disappear at this time by ab
sorption.    In some animals minute ovisacs are found in the infundi-
bulum, the discharge of which from the ovary appears referable to
the rupture of large Graafian vesicles, in the parietes or neighbour
hood of which those ovisacs had been situated.
    The diameter of the rabbit's ovum, when it leaves the ovary, does
not generally exceed the 135th part of an inch, and in some in
stances it is still smaller.    The ovum enters the uterus in a state
very different from that in which it leaves the ovary ; hence the
opinion, that " in their passage through the tube the ova of Mam
malia undergo scarcely any metamorphosis          at all," is erroneous.
Among the changes taking place in the ovum during its passage
through the Fallopian tube are the following ; viz.         1 . An outer
membrane, the chorion, becomes visible.       2. The membrane origin
ally investing the yelk, which had suddenly thickened, disappears
by liquefaction ; so that the yelk is now immediately surrounded by
the thick transparent membrane of the ovarian ovum.            3.    In the
centre of the yelk, that is, in the situation to which the germinal
vesicle returned before the ovum left the ovary, there arise several
very large and exceedingly transparent vesicles : these disappear,
and are succeeded by a smaller and more numerous set ; several sets
thus successively come into view, the vesicles of each succeeding set
being smaller than the last, until a mulberry-like structure has been
produced, which occupies the centre of the ovum.         Each of the ve
sicles of which the surface of the mulberry-like structure is com
posed contains a pellucid nucleus ; and each nucleus presents a nu
cleolus.
    In the uterus a layer of vesicles of the same kind as those of the
last and smallest set here mentioned makes its appearance on the whole
 of the inner surface of the membrane which now invests the yelk. The
 mulberry-like structure then passes from the centre of the yelk to a
 certain part of that layer, (the vesicles of the latter coalescing with
 those of the former where the two sets are in contact to form a
 membrane,) and the interior of the mulberry-like structure is now
 seen to be occupied by a large vesicle containing a fluid and gra
 nules. In the centre of this vesicle is a spherical body having a
 granulous appearance, and containing a cavity apparently filled with
 a colourless and pellucid fluid.     This hollow spherical body seems
 to be the true germ.      The vesicle containing it disappears, and in
 its place is seen an elliptical depression filled with a pellucid fluid.
 In the centre of this depression is the germ, still presenting the ap
 pearance of a hollow sphere. The germ separates into a central and
 a peripheral portion, the central portion occupies the situation of the
 future brain, and soon presents a pointed process which is the rudi
 ment of the spinal cord.     These parts at first appearing granulous
 are subsequently found to consist of vesicles.
    Thus the central portion of the nervous system is not originally
 a fluid contained within a tube, but developes itself in a solid

                                      139
form before      any other part.    The central portion of the nervous
system sometimes attains a considerable degree of developement,
although it be exceedingly minute ; thus an instance has been met
with in which the developement of this part had reached a stage
scarcely inferior to that in another instance, in which the corre
sponding part measured more than ten times the length.
     There does not occur in the mammiferous ovum any such pheno
menon as the "splitting" of a membrane into the so-called "se
rous, vascular, and mucous laminae." Rathke had already found
that parts previously supposed by Baer and others to be formed by
the so-called " germinal membrane," really originate independently
of it : these parts are the ribs, pelvic bones, and the muscles of the
thorax and abdomen, which according to Rathke arise in a part pro
ceeding out of the
                       " primitive trace" itself. Reichert had previously
discovered that the part originating the lower jaw and hyoid bone
" grows out of the primitive trace." The author beginning with an
 earlier period goes farther than these observers, and shows that
 the so-called " primitive trace" it?elf does not arise in the substance
 of a membrane, but presents a comparatively advanced stage of the
 object above described as the true germ. Hence the author suggests,
 there is no structure entitled to be denominated          the " germinal
 membrane."
     The most important of the foregoing facts respecting the deve
 lopement of the mammiferous ovum, however opposed they may be
 to received opinions, are in accordance with, and may even explain,
 many observations which have been made on the developement of
  other animals as recorded in the delineations of preceding observers.
  If in the ovum of the bird the germinal vesicle in like manner re
  turns to the centre of the yelk, the canal and cavity known to exist
  in the yelk of that ovum might be thus explained. The ovum may
  pass through at least one-and-twenty stages of developement,           and
  contain, besides the embryo, four membranes, one of which has two
  laminae, before it has itself attained the diameter of half a line, a fifth
 membrane having disappeared by liquefaction within the ovum.
      The size of the minute ovum in the Fallopian tube and uterus
  affords no criterion of the degree of its developement ; nor do any
  two parts of the minute ovum, in their developement, necessarily
  keep pace with one another.
      The proportion of ova met with in these researches, which seemed
  to be abortive, has amounted to nearly one in eight.          Sometimes
  two yelk-balls exist in the same ovum.         With slight pressure, the
  ovum, originally globular, becomes elliptical.       Its tendency to as
   sume the latter form exists especially in the chorion, and seems to
  be in proportion to its size.
      The author has discovered that when the germinal vesicle is first
   seen it is closely invested by an extremely delicate membrane. This
   membrane      subsequently   expanding is that in which the yelk is
   formed. He has traced the chorion from stage to stage up to the
   period when it becomes villous, and shows that it is not, as he for
   merly supposed, the thick transparent membrane itself of the ovarian

                                    140
ovum, but a thin envelope closely investing that membrane, and not
appreciable as a distinct structure until the ovum has been crushed.
When the chorion first admits of demonstration as a distinct struc
ture the ovum consists of three membranes, a state which the author
has seen in an ovum no farther advanced than about an inch into the
Fallopian tube.      The chorion subsequently thickens and imbibes a
quantity   of fluid presenting a gelatinous appearance.

    The reading of a paper, entitled, " On the Motion of the Blood."
By James Carson, M.D., F.R.S. , was resumed and concluded.
    After referring to his paper contained in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1820, relative to the influence of the elasticity of the
lungs as a power contributing to the effectual expansion of the heart,
 and promoting the motion of the blood in the veins, the author states
 that his object in this paper is to explain more fully the mode in
which these effects are produced, and to corroborate by additional

                                    141
 facts and observations the arguments adduced in its support.          He
 endeavours, from a review of the circumstances under which the veins
 are placed, to show the inconclusiveness of the objections which
 have been urged by various physiologists against his and the late
 Sir David Barry's theory of suction : namely, that the sides of a
 pliant vessel, when a force of suction is applied, will collapse and
 arrest the further transmission of fluid though that channel. The
 considerations which he deems adequate to give efficacy to the
 power of suction in the veins of a living animal are, first, the posi
 tion of the veins by which, though pliant vessels, they acquire in
 some degree the properties of rigid tubes ; secondly, the immersion
 of the venous blood in a medium of a specific gravity at least equal
 to its own ; thirdly, the constant introduction of recrementitious
 matter into the venous system at its capillary extremities by which
 the volume of the venous blood is increased, and its motion urged
 onwards to the heart in distended vessels ; and lastly, the gravity
 of the fluid itself, creating an outward pressure at all parts of the
 veins below the highest level of the venous system.       The author il
 lustrates his positions by the different quantities of blood which
 are found to flow from the divided vessels of an ox, according to the
 different modes in which the animal is slaughtered.
    The reading of a paper, entitled, " Account of Experiments on
 Iron-built Ships, instituted for the purpose of discovering a Correc
 tion for the Deviation of the Compass produced by the Iron of the
 Ships."    By George Biddell Airy, Esq., A.M., F.R.S., Astronomer
 Royal, was also resumed and concluded.
    In this paper the problem of the deviation of a ship's compass,
 arising from the influence of the iron in the ship, more particularly
in iron-built ships, is fully investigated ; and the principles on which
the correction for this deviation depends having been determined,
practical methods for neutralizing the deviating forces are deduced
 and illustrated by experimental application.     The author states that,
for the purpose of ascertaining the laws of the deviation of the com
pass in the iron-built steam-ship the Rainbow, four stations were
selected in that vessel, about four feet above the deck, and at these
the deviations of the horizontal compasses were determined in the
various positions of the ship's head.      All these stations were in the
vertical plane, passing through the ship's keel, three being in the
after part of the ship and one near the bow. Observations were also
made for determining the horizontal intensity at each of the stations.
The deviations of dipping needles at three of these stations were
also determined, when the plane of vibration coincided with that of
the ship's keel, and also when at right angles to it.
    After describing the particular method of observing rendered ne
cessary by the nature of the vessel and the circumstances of her
position, the author gives the disturbance of the horizontal compass
at the four stations deduced from the observations.            The most
striking features in these results are, the very great apparent change
in the direction of the ship's head, as indicated by the compass nearest

                                           14-2
the stern, corresponding to a small real change in one particular
position, the former change being 97°, whereas the latter was only
23°, and the small amount of disturbance indicated by the compass
near the bow.
   After giving the observations for the determination of the influ
ence of the ship on the horizontal intensity of a needle suspended
at each of the stations, in four different positions of the ship's head,
and the disturbances of the dipping needle at three of these stations,
the author enters upon the theoretical investigation.
   The fundamental supposition of the theory of induced magnetism,
on which Mr. Airy states his calculations to rest, is, that, by the ac
tion of terrestrial magnetism, every particle of iron is converted into
a magnet, whose direction is parallel to that of the dipping needle,
and whose intensity is proportional to that of terrestrial magnetism,
the upper end having the property of attracting the north end of
the needle, and the lower end that of repelling it.
   The attractive and repulsive forces of a particle on the north end
of the needle, in the directions of rectangular axes towards north,
towards east, and vertically downwards, and of which the compass
is taken as the origin, are first determined on this supposition in
terms of the co-ordinates ; and thence the true disturbing forces of
the particle in these directions.     The disturbing forces produced by
the whole of the iron of the ship are the sums of the expressions for
every particle.     Expressing this summation by the letter S, and
transforming the rectangular into polar co-ordinates, Mr. Airy gives
to the expressions for the disturbing forces the simplifications which
they admit of, on the supposition that the compass is in the vertical
plane passing through the ship's keel, and that the iron is symme
trically disposed on both sides of that plane.       He thus deduces for
the disturbing forces acting on the north or marked end of the needle,
    — I cos 2. M + I cos S. P cos 2 A + I sin       N cos A, towards the
                                                      «S.
magnetic north        ;
 I    cos   S. sin A
               P      2     sin N sin A, towards magnetic east
                              +   1                             ;
    —   I sin    2.   Qcos+
                          I    cos A, vertically downwards
                                  2.   N                    :
   Where    I  represents the intensity of terrestrial magnetism;   8the
dip A the azimuth of the ship's head
   ;                                         and M, N, P, Q, constants
                                                  ;
depending solely on the construction of the ship, and not changing
with any variations of terrestrial localities or magnetic dip or inten
sity.
   From the consideration of these expressions for the disturbing
forces    isdeduced the following simple rule for the correction of
                                                                        a a
compass disturbed by the induced magnetism only of the iron in
ship.
  1   Determine the position of Barlow's plate with regard to the
      .
compass, which will produce the same effect as the iron in the
ship.
   2. Fix Barlow's plate at the distance and depression determined
by the last experiment, but in the opposite azimuth.
   3. Mount another mass of iron at the same level as the compass,
but on the starboard or larboard side, and determine its position so

                                         143
    that the compass points correctly when the ship's head is N.E., S.E.,
    S.W. or N.W. ; then the compass will be correct in all positions of
    the ship's head, and in all magnetic latitudes.
       When the disturbing iron of the ship is at the same level as the
   compass, the correction is stated to be much more simple, it being
   then only necessary to introduce a single mass of iron at the star
   board or larboard side, and at the same level as the compass.
       It is farther remarked that if one mass of iron is placed exactly
   opposite another equal mass, both in azimuth and in elevation, it
   doubles its disturbing effect : if one mass be placed opposite the
   other in azimuth, but with elevation instead of depression, or vice
   versd, it destroys that term of the disturbance which depends on sin
   A, and doubles that which depends on sin 2 A : and if one mass
   be placed at the same level as the compass, its effects may be de
   stroyed by placing another mass at the same level, in an azimuth
   differing 90° on either side.     If a disturbance, from whatever cause
   arising, follow the law of + sin 2 A, (changing sign in the success
  ive quadrants, and positive when the ship's head is between N. and
  E.), it may be destroyed by placing a mass of iron on the starboard
  or larboard side at the same level as the compass ; if it follow the
  law of — sin 2 A, the mass of iron must be on the fore or aft side.
      From the consideration of the expression for the disturbing forces
  produced by the ship, it is farther inferred, that both in the con
  struction of the ship and in the fixing of correctors, no large mass of
 iron should be placed below the compass.
      The expressions for the disturbing forces towards north and east,
 being transformed into forces towards the ship's head and towards
  the starboard side, give
     I                                I
       cos S. (— M + P) cos A + sin 2. N, for the former, and
     I cos S. (M + P), for the latter.
     The author next proceeds to investigate the effects which        result
 from the combination of induced magnetism with permanent              mag
 netism. Calling H, S and V the new forces arising from the          latter,
 and directed towards the ship's head, its starboard side, and        verti
 cally downwards, the whole disturbing force towards the              ship's
 head becomes
                                                      I
                 H + I cos S. (— M + P) cos A + sin S. N ;
 and the whole disturbing force towards the starboard side,
                         S +  I cos i. (M + P) sin A.
     The manner in which     the numerical values of these quantities may
be found from experiment is then pointed out, and being determined
from the observations on board the Rainbow, at Station I., a compa
rison is made between the observed disturbances of the needles, and
those which would result from the action of the ship as a permanent
magnet.        From this comparison it appears that almost the whole
disturbance is accounted for by the permanent magnetism, and that
the residual part follows with sufficient approximation the law of
changing signs at the successive quadrants.          For the complete veri
fication of the theory it remained only to effect an actual correction
of the    compass.    This was   done by placing below the compass, in a

                                     144
position determined     by the previously-ascertained numerical values,
a large bar magnet to neutralize the effects of the permanent mag
netism of the ship, and a roll of soft iron on one side of the compass
to counteract the disturbance arising from induced magnetism.         That
this correction was effective appears from the very small amount of
uncorrected disturbance then observed in the compass.
    The observations of the compasses at stations II., III., IV., are
similarly discussed : the disturbing force arising from the permanent
magnetism of the ship being in like manner determined, a comparison
is instituted between the observed and computed disturbance of the
compass ; and the results of this comparison, with the exception of
the observations at Station IV., are found to be in perfect accordance
with the theory. Attempts are made to correct the compasses at
these stations in the same manner as at Station I., but owing to the
imperfection of the compasses they did not succeed so perfectly.
     The observations made with the dipping needle are next discussed,
and the values of the constants are deduced from them.           The gene
ral agreement of those determined from the observations when the
 needle vibrated in the direction of the ship's keel, with those de
 duced from the observations when the needle vibrated transversely,
 is pointed out, and is considered an additional proof of the general
 correctness of the theory.
     Observations on the disturbance of the compass in the iron- built
 sailing-ship Ironsides are next described.         These are similar to
 those in the Rainbow, but not so extensive ; and they are discussed
  on the same principles.     From this discussion it is considered that
  the theory is in perfect accordance with the facts observed both with
  regard to the deviations and the intensities.      The correction of one
  compass was effected by a tentative process, which the author consi
  ders likely to be of the highest value in the correction of the compasses
  of iron-ships in general. The ship's head being placed exactly north,
  as ascertained by a shore compass, a magnet was placed upon the
  beam from which the compass was suspended, with the direction of
  its length exactly transverse to the ship's keel : it was moved upon
  the beam to various distances till the compass pointed correctly, and
  then it was fixed.     Then the ship's head was placed exactly east,
  and another magnet, with its length parallel to the ship's keel, was
  placed upon the same beam, and moved to different distances till
  the compass pointed correctly, and then it was fixed. The correc
  tion for induced magnetism was neglected, but there would have
  been no difficulty in adjusting it by the same process, placing the
  vessel's head in azimuth 45° or 135° or 225° or 315°.
      In conclusion Mr. Airy makes the following remarks : —
     The deviations of the compass at four stations in the Rainbow,
  and at two stations in the Ironsides, are caused by two modifications
  of magnetic power ; the one being the independent magnetism of
  the ship, which retains, in all positions of the ship, the same mag
  nitude and the same direction relatively to the ship ; the other being
  the induced magnetism, of which the force varies in magnitude and
  direction when the ship's position is changed.          In the instances

                                     145
mentioned, the effect of the former force was found greatly to exceed
that of the latter.
    It appears that experiments and observations similar to those
applied in the above cases are sufficient to obtain with accuracy the
constants on which at any one place the ship's action on the hori
zontal needle depends, namely
                     H                   S
                 -:     5 + tan 3.N,
                                      ;       , M, and P ;
                  I COS i             I COS 5
                                            6
and that by placing a magnet so that its action shall take place in a
direction opposite to that which the investigations show to be the
direction of the ship's independent magnetic action, and at such a
distance that its effect is equal to that of the ship's independent
magnetism, and by counteracting the effect of the induced mag
netism by means of the induced magnetism of another mass, accord
ing to rules which are given, the compass may be made to point
exactly as if it were free from disturbance.
    It appears also, that by an easy tentative method, the compass
may now be corrected without the labour of any numerical investi
 gations or any experiments        except those of merely making the
 trials. Although the uniformity of the induced magnetism under
 similar circumstances is to be presumed, yet the invariability of the
independent magnetism during the course of many years is by no
 means certain.
    These statements suggest the following as rules which it is desi
 rable to observe in the present infancy of iron-ship building.       It
 appears desirable that
     1. Every iron sea-going ship should be examined by a competent
 person for the accurate determination of the four constants above-
 mentioned for each of the compasses of the ship, and a careful re
 cord of these determinations should be preserved as a magnetic
 register of the ship.
     2. The same person should be employed to examine the vessel at
 different times, with the view of ascertaining whether either of the
 constants changes in the course of time.
     3. In the case of vessels going to different magnetic latitudes,
 the same person should make arrangements for the examination of
 the compasses in other places with a view to the determination of
 the constant N.
     4. The same person should examine and register the general
 construction of the ship, the position and circumstances of her build
 ing, &c, with a view to ascertain how far the values of the magnetic
 constants depend on these circumstances, and in particular to ascer
 tain their connexion with the value of the prejudicial constant M.
     5. The same person should see to the proper application of the
 correctors and the proper measures for preserving the permanency
 of their magnetism.
    The most remarkable result in a scientific view from the experi
 ments detailed in the present paper is, the great intensity of the per
 manent magnetism of the malleable iron of which the ship is com
 posed.

    The author states his having observed an extension of the red por

 the space it occupies when seen by the naked eye, by viewing it
 through a piece of deep blue cobalt glass.    He finds that the part of
 the spectrum thus rendered perceptible to the right is crossed by
 two or more very broad lines or bands : and observes that the space
 occupied by the most powerful calorific rays, coincides with the si
tuation of the red rays thus rendered visible by transmission through
a blue medium.      The author expresses a regret that he has not had
sufficient leisure to pursue the investigation of these phenomena.

   The reading of a paper entitled, " Fifth letter on Voltaic Com
binations; with some account of the effects of a large Constant

lerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Bri
tain.     By John Frederic Daniell, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of Che
mistry   in King's College, London," was resumed and concluded.
    The author, pursuing the train of reasoning detailed in his pre
ceding letters, enters into the further investigation of the variable
conditions in a voltaic combination on which its efficiency depends ;
and the determination of the proper proportions of its elements for
the economical application of its power to useful purposes.        He
finds that the action of the battery is by no means proportioned to
the surfaces of the conducting hemispheres, but approximates to the
simple ratio of their diameters ; and hence concludes that the cir
 culating force of both simple and compound voltaic circuits in
 creases with the surface of the conducting plates surrounding the
active centres.    On these principles he constructed a constant bat
 tery consisting of seventy cells in a single series, which gave, be
 tween charcoal points separated to a distance of three-quarters of
 an inch, a flame of considerable volume, forming a continuous arch,
 and emitting radiant heat and light of the greatest intensity.   The
latter, indeed, proved highly injurious to the eyes of the spectators,
 in which, although they were protected by grey glasses of double
 thickness, a state of very active inflammation was induced.      The
 whole of the face of the author became scorched and inflamed, as if
 it had been exposed for many hours to a bright midsummer's sun.

                                   148
The rays, when reflected from an imperfect parabolic metallic mir
ror in a lantern, and collected into a focus by a glass lens, readily
burned a hole in a paper at a distance of many feet from their source.
 The heat was quite intolerable to the hand held near the lantern.
 Paper steeped in nitrate of silver and afterwards dried, was speedily
 turned brown by this light : and when a piece of fine wire-gauze
 was held before it, the pattern of the latter appeared in white lines,
 corresponding to the parts which it protected.       The phenomenon
 of the transfer of the charcoal from one electrode to the other, first
observed by Dr. Hare, was abundantly apparent ; taking place from
 the zincode (or positive pole,) to the platinode, (or negative pole).
The arch of flame between the electrodes was attracted or repelled
by the poles of a magnet, according as the one or the other pole
 was held above or below it: and the repulsion was at times so great
as to extinguish the flame.       When the flame was drawn from the
pole of the magnet itself, included in the circuit, it rotated in a
beautiful manner.
    The heating power of this battery was so great as to fuse, with
the utmost readiness, a bar of platinum, one-eighth of an inch square :
 and the most infusible metals, such as pure rhodium, iridium, tita
nium, the native alloy of iridium and osmium, and the native ore of
platinum, placed in a cavity scooped out of hard carbon, freely
melted in considerable quantities.
    In conclusion, the author briefly describes the results of some ex
periments on the evolution of the mixed gases from water in a con
fined space, and consequently under high pressure ; with a view to
ascertain, first, in what manner conduction would be carried on,
supposing that the tube in which the electrodes were introduced
were quite filled with the electrolyte, and there were no space for
the accumulation of the gases ; secondly, whether, decomposition
 having been effected, recombination would take place at any given
pressure ; and lastly, whether any reaction on the current-force of
the battery would arise from the additional mechanical force which
it would have to overcome.       These experiments he purposes pur
suing   at some  future  time.
                                       " An experimental inquiry into
    A paper was also read, entitled,
the influence of nitrogen in promoting vegetable decomposition, and
the connexion of this process with the growth of plants."           By
Robert Rigg, Esq. Communicated by the Rev.         J.  B. Reade, A.M.,
F.R.S.
    The author considers it as a general fact, to which there are very
few if any exceptions, that vegetable bodies in the state in which
they are produced in nature, undergo spontaneous decomposition
when kept under circumstances favouring such an action ; and that,
from the decomposition of each, compound products peculiar to that
substance result.     A variety of experiments are detailed and tabu
lated ; the first series of which contains those made on solutions of
compounds, such as sugar, honey and extract of malt, showing that
in each the amount of spontaneous decomposition is in proportion

                                   149
to the quantity of nitrogen it contains. This law is found to ex
tend to those parts of plants which are not in solution in water, but
which remain in their natural state of elaboration, only having their
texture broken down.
   The author is led to infer from his experiments that the chemical
action to which any vegetable matter is naturally disposed, may, to
a certain extent, be changed into some other, differing both in its
kind and in its products ; and that in order to effect such a change
nothing more is required than to excite in other vegetable matter
mixed with the former, some action which shall preponderate over
the rest, so that the whole mass may obey this new and predomi
nant influence. The vapour which is disengaged during the rapid
decomposition of vegetable matter he finds to be highly noxious ;
and thence draws the inference that the Author of the universe has
wisely ordained, that, when young plants, containing large quantities
of nitrogen, are by any means checked in their growth, they shall
be consumed by certain insects ; which insects may be conceived to
form one of the links of that harmonious chain which binds together
all the parts of the universe.
   The relation between the decomposition of vegetable matter and
the growth of plants is apparent from the similarity of the influence
of nitrogen on both these processes : this double function which
nitrogen performs in favouring chemical decomposition by the roots
of plants at the same time that it assimilates the matter thus formed
in their other parts, is regarded by the author as another link in the
same chain.     In support of this view, he adduces the different che
mical constitutions of the roots of the same plants when very young,
and when fully grown.       He finds that when plants have to perform
the important   offices of providing nourishment for the rapid growth
of their young and tender shoots, they contain a quantity of nitro
gen two or three times greater than that which they possess when
fully grown ; and he concludes by showing that, in accordance with
these views, the seeds, roots and plants when placed in highly de
composing or decomposed matter, cease to grow, and under these
circumstances,    their germinating or vegetating power being super
 seded by the chemical action established in the matter which sur
 rounds them, the whole becomes one mass of contaminated and in
fectious matter.

    George Barker, Esq., was balloted for, and duly elected into the
 Society.
    A paper was read, entitled, "Experiments on the chemical consti
 tution of several bodies which undergo the vinous fermentation, and
 on certain results of the chemical action."    By Robert Rigg, Esq.,
 F.R.S.

                                        150
    The special object of this paper is to show, first, that sugar is not
constituted of carbon and water only ; secondly, that during the
vinous fermentation water is decomposed; thirdly, that neither pure
carbonic acid nor alcohol is, in the common acceptation of the term,
the product of this chemical action ; and fourthly, that fermented
liquors owe some of their valuable qualities to peculiar products
formed during fermentation.
    In order to trace the various chemical changes which occur in
this part of his research, the author has had recourse to numerous
experiments,       the details of which are recorded in tabular forms.
The first table exhibits the analysis of different kinds of sugar, honey,
treacle, grape-juice and extract of malt and hops, the general result
of which is that all these compounds contain oxygen in excess above
the proportion in which it exists in water, and that they also con
tain a small quantity of nitrogen.           He shows, by two independent
 modes of experimenting, that these bodies, when in solution, can
not be the only compounds undergoing decomposition during that
fermentation, which has for its product spirit and carbonic acid; and
ia proof of this proposition he recapitulates the different elements
 in the compounds at the commencement and at the conclusion of
the experiments.         He finds that when the proximate elements are
 made the subject of calculation, the weight of the alcohol (consti
 tuted of two equivalents of carbon, three of hydrogen and one of
 oxygen) added to that of the carbonic acid and undecomposed sugar,
 exceeds the weight of the sugar employed by about 7 per cent.
 On recapitulating the ultimate elements, he finds that the hydro
 gen and the oxygen in the compounds after the fermentation ex
 ceed their quantity in the sugar experimented upon, by 15 per cent,
 of the former, and nearly 14 per cent, of the latter ; and as a proof
 that no material error is occasioned by the mode of experimenting,
it is found that the difference between the quantity of carbon at the
 first and at the last is very small.
     Having arrived at these conclusions, the author infers from his
 experiments that the water of solution is decomposed by the carbon
 of the dissolved vegetable matter, in every case of the vinous fer
 mentation, and in proportions proximately represented by the fol
lowing formulae : viz.
 2 equivalents of the carbon of sugar        6-12
2 equivalents of the hydrogen of the water   1-       g!24 1 14-24 olefiant gas.
 1 equivalent of the carbon of the sugar...  6-12
                                                      ci12 1 22-12 carbonic acid.
 2 equivalents of the oxygen of the water... 8-
    This decomposition he conceives is brought about by the influence
 of nitrogen, a very small quantity of which enters into the constitu
 tion of the olefiant gas, forming the base of all spirituous fluids of
 the alcohol and ethereal kind ; and thus each compound experi
 mented upon, forms these products in proportion to the quantity of
 carbon which undergoes chemical change, whether that compound
 be sugar, soluble parts of malt, grape-juice, or any other body.
     The author proceeds to inquire into the constitution of the pro-

                                    151
 ducts which result from this chemical action. He finds the gas
 which is given off to be composed of carbonic acid, mixed with a
 small proportion of carburetted hydrogen; and the spirit, when sub
jected to careful analysis, to resolve itself into carbonic acid, water,
 and a very small proportion of nitrogen : and in further proof of
 the existence of this last- mentioned element in spirit, the author
 has recourse to the ultimate analysis of the charcoal obtained from
 alcohol and defiant gas, a mode of experimenting which he con
 ceives is less liable to error.
     He states that the views thus sought to be established are con
 firmed, not merely by these direct experiments, but likewise by other
 changes which fermented liquors undergo on being kept under cir
 cumstances favourable for further chemical action ; and that having
 proved the existence of such a compound as one constituted of car
 bon, hydrogen and nitrogen, and shown that water is decomposed
 during its formation, he thinks we are enabled to account for many
 other changes which occur during the decomposition of vegetable
 matter and the growth of plants : whence he proceeds to show that
 evidence of the presence of such a compound as the above in fer
 mented liquors is afforded by the changes which take place in con
 sequence of keeping them.
     On subjecting to ultimate analysis the semi-fluids obtained by ex
posing fermented liquors to a temperature of 110° Fahr., the author
found a decided difference between the chemical constitution of
 those procured from old, and those from new vinous fluids ; and on
 searching for the law by which these differences are regulated, he
 found that the spirituous part entered into such combination with
 the excess of oxygen before referred to, and the undecomposed ve
getable matter, so as to form with them new compounds.
     After experiencing some difficulty in effecting a separation of
these newly formed bodies, he found that while rectified pyroxylic
spirit, of the specific gravity from 830 to 835, scarcely dissolved an
appreciable quantity of the extract of malt and hops, considerable
portions of the semi-fluids obtained from old ale and old porter were,
by agitating, dissolved therein. By using this spirit as a solvent he
effected such a separation as enabled him to discover decided differ
ences between the proximate chemical constitution of the semi-
fluids obtained from old ale and old porter, and those from liquors
of the same description when new.
    In accounting for many of the phenomena which accompany
the vinous fermentation, the author observes that the small excess
of oxygen found in all these compounds, which undergo this chemi j
cal action, is an essential and indispensable circumstance ; a con
clusion which is corroborated both by the formation of these new
compounds which have been described, and by the generation of the
acetic, tartaric, or malic acid, which is found in fermented liquors at
all times, and in quantities varying according to the situations un
der which these fluids have been kept.

    " Researches on the Tides. Tenth Series. On the Laws of Low
Water at the Port of Plymouth, and on the permanency of mean
water."     By the Rev. W. Whewell, B.D., F.R.S., Fellow of Tri
nity College, Cambridge.
    In this memoir the author investigates the question, how far the
mean water, that is the height of the tide midway between high and
low water, is permanent during the changes which high and low
water undergo.        That it is so approximately at Plymouth having
been already ascertained by short series of observations, it was de
sirable to determine the real amount of this permanency by induction
from longer series of observations.     A period of six years was chosen
for that purpose ; and the method of discussing these observations
was the same, with slight modifications, as in former researches.
    The height of low water, cleared from the effects of lunar parallax,
 and very nearly so from those of lunar declination, and compared
 with the height of high water, similarly cleared, enabled the author
 to ascertain whether the mean water also was affected by the semi-
 menstrual inequality.     The results of the calculation show that the
 height of mean water is, within two or three inches, constant from
 year to year : and that, for each fortnight, it has a semi-menstrual
 inequality amounting to six or seven inches; — the height being great
 est when the transit is at 6h. and least when at 1 1 h., — the imme
 diate cause of this inequality being, that the semi-menstrual inequality
 of low water is greater than that of high water : this inequality,
 however, is probably modified by local circumstances.
     These researches have also verified the theoretical deduction, that
 the height both of low and of high water being affected by the moon's
 declination, their mean height partakes of the variations in this latter
 element, in successive years, consequent on the change of position
 of the moon's orbit.     At Plymouth the increase in mean low water
 amounts to about two inches for each degree of increase in the de
 clination.    In the high water this change is less marked.
     The parallax correction of the height of low water is obtained
 from all years alike, by taking the residue of each observation, which
  remains when the semi-menstrual inequality is taken away, and ar
                                                                     to the
  ranging these residues, for each hour of transit, according
  parallax. The declination correction is obtained in a    manner    analo
                                                       observations,   with
  gous to the parallax correction, from each year's
  some correction for the variation in the mean declination   of the  moon
 in  each year.

Observations made in the Indian Seas." By the Rev. W. Whewell,
B.D., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
    This paper contains the results of the examination by the author
of certain series of tide observations made at several places in the
Indian Seas, which were forwarded to the Admiralty by the Hon.
East India Company. These localities were Cochin, Corringa River,
Surat roads in the Gulf of Cambay, Gogah, on the opposite side of
the same gulf, and Bassadore, in the Island of Kissmis in the Persian
Gulf.
    " On the Electrolysis of Secondary Compounds." In a letter ad
dressed to Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., Fullerian Pro
fessor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain, &c,
&c. By John Frederic Daniell, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry
in King's College, London.
     The discovery of definite electrochemical action naturally suggests
the inquiry into the relative proportion of that part of a voltaic cur
rent, which, in the case of its decomposing a saline solution, is car
ried by the elements of the water, and that part which is carried by
 the elements of the saline compound, and into the definite relations,
 if any such there be, subsisting between the two electrolytes so de
 composed.     This question was the origin of the investigation which
 forms the subject of the present letter. The power which the author
 employed in this experimental inquiry was that of a small constant
 battery of thirty cells, six inches in height, with tubes of earthen
 ware, charged in the manner he has described in his former commu
 nications to the Society. The result of the first experiment evidently
 indicated that the decomposition of one equivalent of water was ac
 companied by the decomposition of an exact equivalent of sulphate
 of soda. The author then endeavours to ascertain whether the power
  of the current is equally divided between what had hitherto been re
  garded as the two equivalent electrolytes. The first experiments
  he made in order to determine this point seemed to lead to the ex
  traordinary conclusion, that the same current which is just sufficient
  to separate an equivalent of oxygen from an equivalent of hydrogen
  in one vessel, will at the same time separate an equivalent of oxygen
  from one of hydrogen, and also an equivalent of sulphuric acid from
  one of soda in another vessel.
      The author then examines the remarkable phenomena relative to
  the transfer of matter from one electrode to the other without the
  decomposition of the transported compound ; a phenomenon which
  was first observed by Mr. Porret in glass cells divided into two com
   partments by a diaphragm of bladder.
      Having observed that the products of electrolyzation cannot be
   kept long separate in their respective cells, on account of the ulti
   mate mixture of the liquids on the platinode side of the diaphragm,
   the author was led to construct an apparatus by which this evil is
   remedied much more perfectly, and to which he gives the name of
   the double diaphragm cell.    It consists of two cells, formed of two
   glass cylinders, with collars at their lower ends, fitted by grinding

                                   154
to a stout glass tube bent into the form of the letter U, and firmly
fixed on a wooden post. The current transmitted by this double
cell is more retarded than when passing through the single cell, on
account of the greater distance of the electrodes ; but it answers its
intended purpose of stopping the transfer of the liquid even in the
case of saline solutions, and there is still sufficient conducting power
to render it powerfully effective.    Experiments were then made to
ascertain whether in the electrolysis of the dilute sulphuric acid any
transfer of the acid takes place ; from which the author concludes
that during the electrolysis of an equivalent of water, a portion of
acid passes over from the platinode to the zincode ; and possibly an
equal portion of water also passes over from the zincode to the plati
node.     These experiments appear to confirm the results previously
obtained ; namely, that one fourth of an equivalent of sulphuric
acid passes from the platinode to the zincode for every single equiva
lent of a compound which has been electrolyzed by the current.
    The author then proceeds to examine the following question, viz. : does
the acid during its transfer, in the case of the mixed acid and water,
 or do the acid and the alkali, in the case of the saline solution, con
 vey any portion of the current which effects the simultaneous de
 composition of the water in both instances ? He next investigates
 the action of the voltaic current on the aqueous solution of the chlo
 rides, as the simpler constitution of this class of salts promised to
 throw some light on the nature of the electrolysis of secondary com
 pounds.
     The results of all these experiments tend to the establishment of
 the fundamental principle, that the force which is measured by its
 definite action at any one point of a circuit cannot perform more
 than an equivalent proportion of work at any other point of the same
 circuit ; and that the current, which is measured by its electrolysis
 of an equivalent of simple chloride of lead, cannot at the same time
 be sufficient to electrolyze an equivalent of chloride of sodium, and
 an equivalent of water, at the same electrodes.          The sum of the
 forces which held together any number of ions, in a compound elec
 trolyte, could, moreover, only have been equal to the force which
 held together the elements of a simple electrolyte, electrolyzed at
 the same moment in one circuit.
     In applying these principles to the electrolysis of the solution of
  sulphate of soda, water seems to be electrolyzed, and at the same
  time the acid and alkali of the salt appear in equivalent proportions
  with the oxygen and hydrogen, at their respective electrodes.           It
  cannot be admitted, that after the decomposition of the water there
  is any excess of force applicable to the decomposition of the salt ;
  but it must be concluded that the only electrolyte which yields is
  the sulphate of soda, the ions of which, however, are not the acid
  and alkali of the salt, but an anion, composed of an equivalent of
  sulphur, and four equivalents of oxygen and the metallic cathion,
  sodium. From the former, sulphuric acid is formed, at the anode,
  by secondary action, and the evolution of one equivalent of oxygen ;
  and from the latter, soda at the cathode, by the secondary action df

                                      155
the metal, and the evolution of an equivalent of hydrogen. The for
mation of these secondary electrolytes, and compound anions and
cathions, will probably furnish the key to the explanation of many
of those decompositions and recompositions, to which the presence
 of water is necessary, such as those of nitric acid on the metals, and
 the formation of Schoanbein's      circuit : but the author reserves for a
future opportunity the examination of this hypothesis, as well as of
the general question.
    " Experimental    Researches   on the mode of operation of Poisons."
By James Blake, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec.
R.S.
    In this paper the author examines more particularly the action of
those poisons which appear to produce death by affecting the nervous
 system.
    After reviewing the evidence adduced in support of the opinion,
 that the effects of some poisons are owing to an impression made on
 the nerves of the part to which they are directly applied, he proceeds
 to relate a series of experiments undertaken in order to show with
 what rapidity the blood is circulated through the body, and tending
 to prove, that a substance may be generally diffused through the
 system in nine seconds after its introduction into the veins.
    Experiments are then related in which the more rapidly fatal poi
 sons had been used, and in which it was found, that an interval of
 more than nine seconds always elapsed, between the administration
 of a poison, and the appearance of the first symptoms of its action.
 The mere contact of a poison with a large surface of the body ap
 pears to be insufficient to give rise to general effects, as long as it
 is prevented from entering into the general circulation.
    Various causes of fallacy in experiments of a similar kind, which
 have been adduced in support of an opposite opinion, are pointed
 out. The following is a summary of the conclusions arrived at by
 the author.
     1. The time required for a substance to penetrate the capillary
 vessels, may be considered as inappreciable.
     2. The interval elapsing between the absorption of a substance by
 the capillaries, and its general diffusion through the body, may not
  exceed nine seconds.
     3. An interval of more than nine seconds always elapses between
  the introduction of a poison, into the capillaries, or veins, and the
  appearance of its first effects.
    4. If a poison be introduced into a part of the vascular system
  nearer the nervous centres, its effects are produced more rapidly.
     5. The contact of a poison with a large surface of the body is
  not sufficient to give rise to general symptoms, as long as its diffu
 sion through the body is prevented.

   1.   "Inquiries concerning the Elementary Laws of Electricity."
Third Series.     By W. Snow Harris, Esq., F.R.S.
  The author     states, that it has been his object, in this series of in
vestigations, to perfect the methods of electrical measurement, whe
ther relating to the quantity of electricity, intensity, inductive
power, or any other element requiring an exact numerical value, and
by operating with large statical forces both attractive and repulsive,
to avoid many sources of error inseparable from the employment of
extremely small quantities of electricity, such as those affecting the
delicate balance used by Coulomb.          He then describes some im
provements in his hydrostatic electrometer, an instrument already
mentioned in his first paper, which, although not available for the
measurement of such minute forces as those to which the balance of
torsion is applicable, is still peculiarly delicate and well adapted to
researches in statical electricity.    Its indications depending on the
force between two opposed planes operating on each other under
given conditions, are reducible to simple laws, and are hence in
variable and certain ; the attractive force between the discs is not
subject to any oblique action, is referable to any given distance, and
may be estimated in terms of a known standard of weight.              The
author next proceeds to the further consideration of the subject of
his former papers, viz. the elementary laws of electrical action. He
proves, by the following experiments, that induction invariably pre
cedes, or at least accompanies attraction and repulsion.
   A circular disc of gilded wood, about six inches in diameter, is sus
pended by an insulating thread of varnished silk from a delicate ba
lance; a delicate electroscope is attached to this disc, and the whole
is counterpoised by a weight.       A similar disc insulated on a glass
rod, and having also an electroscope attached to          it,
                                                            placed at any
                                                                is
convenient distance immediately under the former. One of the lower
discs being charged with either electricity and the other remaining in
sulated and neutral, the electroscope of the neutral disc begins to
rise, whilst that of the charged disc, already in state of divergence,
                                                      a
tends to collapse  : when these respective effects ensue, the suspend
ed disc descends the charged disc.       Two inductive actions are in
dicated in this experiment, the one the author considers to be          di   a
rect induction, the other a reflected induction.
   If the two discs are both charged with opposite electricities, on
opposing them as before, the electroscopes begin to fall back, at

                                     157
which moment the discs appear to attract each other. But if the
discs are both charged with the same kind of electricity, the diver
gence of the electroscopes increases, and at this instant the suspended
disc recedes from that which is fixed, being apparently repelled
by it.
   The author proceeds to examine strictly the nature of this in
ductive influence, and adduces experiments to render probable that
it is in some way dependent on the presence of an exquisitely subtile
form of matter which may become disturbed in bodies, and assumes
new states or conditions of distribution.
   Very numerous experiments are detailed, showing the influence of
changes of different intensity, of changes in the dimensions and di
stances of the opposed discs, of interposed bodies of different forms,
&c. on the phenomena of induction. The author concludes by giving
the following formulae as the results of his investigations regarding
the elementary laws of electrical induction and attraction.           In these
expressions     Q =  quantity   of  charge,   T   =  the   direct   induction,
q = the quantity of electricity displaced, t
                                                   = its intensity,   T = the
reflected induction, q' = the disturbed quantity, t' = its intensity,
q" = the total quantity in the opposed charged surface, A = the
surface, D = the distance between the opposed points, F = the
force of attraction.

the particles of which are    acted  upon   by  Accelerating    Forces."    By
James Ivory, Esq., K.H., M.A., F.R.S., &c.
    The intention of this paper is to examine the principles and me
thods that have been proposed for solving the problem of which
                                                                             it
treats, with the view    of obviating  what   is  obscure  and  exceptionable
in the investigation usually given of it.
   The principle first advanced by Huyghens is clearly demonstrated,
and is attended with no difficulty.       This principle requires that the
resultant of the forces   in action   at the   surface of a fluid in equili

                                    158
brium and at liberty, shall be perpendicular to that surface : and it
is grounded on this, that the forces must have no tendency to move
a particle in any direction upon the surface, that is, in a plane touch
ing the surface.
    In the Principia, Sir Isaac Newton     assumes that the earth, sup
posed a homogeneous mass of fluid in equilibrium, has the figure of
an oblate elliptical spheroid of revolution which turns upon the less
axis : and, in order to deduce the oblateness of the spheroid from
the relation between the attractive force of the particles, and their
centrifugal force caused by the rotatory velocity, he lays down this
principle of equilibrium, that the weights or efforts of all the small
columns extending from the centre to the surface, balance one an
other round the centre. The exactness of this principle is evident
in the case of the elliptical spheroid, from the symmetry of its figure :
and it is not difficult to infer that the same principle is equally true
in every mass of fluid at liberty and in equilibrium by the action of
accelerating forces on its particles.    In every such mass of fluid, the
pressure, which is zero at the surface, increases in descending below
the surface on all sides : from which it follows that there must be a
point in the interior at which the pressure is a maximum. Now
this point of maximum pressure, or centre, is impelled equally in all
directions by all the small columns standing upon it and reaching to
the surface ; and as the pressure in every one of these columns in
creases continually from the surface to the centre, it follows that
the central point sustains the total effect of all the forces which
urge the whole body of fluid. It follows also, from the property of
a maximum, that the central point may be moved a little from its
place without any variation of the pressure upon it : which proves
that the forces at that point are zero. Thus the point of maximum
pressure is in stable equilibrium relatively to the action of the whole
mass of fluid : which establishes Newton's principle of the equi-
ponderance of the central columns in every instance of a fluid in
equilibrium and at liberty.
    The two principles of Huyghens and Newton being established
on sure grounds, the next inquiry is, whether they are alone suffi
cient for determining the figure of equilibrium.      Of this point there
is no direct and satisfactory investigation : and, in applying the two
principles to particular cases, it has been found that an equilibrium
 determined by one, is not in all cases verified by the other ; and
even in some instances, that there is no equilibrium when both prin
ciples concur in assigning the same figure to the fluid. Further re
 searches are therefore necessary to dispel the obscurity still inherent
in this subject.
    In a mass of fluid in equilibrium, if we suppose that small canals
 are extended from a particle to the surface of the mass, the particle
 will be impelled with equal intensity by all the canals : for, other
 wise, it would not remain immoveable, as an equilibrium requires.
 It has been inferred that the equal pressures of the surrounding fluid
 upon a particle are sufficient to reduce it to a state of rest.   Hence
has arisen the principle of equality of pressure, which is generally

                                     159
admitted in this theory. Now, if the matter be considered ac
curately, it will be found that the only point within a mass of fluid
in equilibrium which is at rest by the sole action of the surrounding
fluid, is the central point of Newton, or the point of maximum-
pressure.     The reason is that, on account of the maximum, the
pressure of all the canals terminating in the central point, increases
continually as the depth increases ; so that, besides the pressures of
the canals, there is no other cause tending to move the particle.
With respect to any other particle, the pressure caused by the action
of the forces in some of the canals standing upon the particle, will
necessarily increase at first in descending below the surface, and
afterwards decrease ; so that the effective pressure transmitted to
the particle, is produced by the action of the forces upon a part only
of the fluid contained in such canals.          If a level surface be drawn
through any particle, it is proved in the paper, that the equal press
 ures of the surrounding fluid on the particle, are caused solely by
 the forces which urge the portion of the fluid on the outside of the
 level surface, the fluid within the surface contributing nothing to the
 same effect. Thus a particle in a level surface is immoveable by the
 direct and transmitted action of the fluid on the outside of the level
 surface ; but it will still be liable to be moved from its place unless
 the body of fluid within the level surface have no tendency to change
 its form or position by all the forces that act on its own particles.
      What has been said not only demonstrates the insufficiency of the
 principle of equality of pressure for determining the figure of equili
 brium of a fluid at liberty, but it points out the conditions which are
  necessary and sufficient for solving the problem in all cases.             The
  pressure   must  be  a maximum   at a  central   point within   the  mass   : it
  must be zero at the surface of the fluid : and, these two conditions
  being fulfilled, there will necessarily exist a series of interior level
  surfaces, the pressure being the same at all the points of every sur
  face, and varying gradually from the maximum quantity to zero.
  Now all the particles in the same level surface have no tendency to
  move upon that surface, because the pressure is the same in all di
  rections : wherefore if we add the condition that every level surface
   shall have a determinate figure when one of its points is given, it is
   evident, both that the figure of the mass will be ascertained, and
   that the immobility of the particles will be established.
       Maclaurin's demonstration of the equilibrium of the elliptical
   spheroid will always be admired, and must be instructive from the
   accuracy and elegance of the investigation. That geometer was the
   first who discovered the law of the forces in action at every point of
   the spheroid ; and it only remained to deduce from the known forces
   the properties on which the equilibrium depends.           These properties
   he states as three in number ; and of these, the two which relate to
   the action of the forces at the surface and the centre of the spheroid,
   are the same with the principles of Huyghens and Newton, and co
   incide with two of the conditions laid down above.           The third pro
   perty  of equilibrium,  according  to  Maclaurin,     consists   in this, that
   every  particle is impelled equally  by  all  the rectilineal  canals  stand

                                           160
  ing upon it and extending to the surface of the spheroid. Now it
  does not follow from this property that a particle is reduced to a
  state of rest within the spheroid, by the equal pressures upon it of
  the surrounding fluid : because these pressures may not be the effect
  of all the forces that urge the mass of the spheroid, but may be
  caused by the action of a part only of the mass.                      Maclaurin de
  monstrates that the pressure impelling a particle in any direction is
  equivalent to the effort of the fluid in a canal, the length of which
  is the difference of the polar semi-axes of the surface of the spheroid
  and a similar and concentric surface drawn through the particle,
  which evidently implies both that the pressures upon the particle
 are caused by the action of the fluid between the two surfaces, and
 likewise that the pressures are invariably the same upon all the par
 ticles in any interior surface, similar and concentric to the surface
 of the spheroid. Such surfaces are therefore the level surfaces of
 the spheroid ; and every particle of the fluid is at rest, not because
 it is pressed equally in all directions, but because it is placed on a
 determinate curve surface, and has no tendency to move on that sur
 face on account of the equal pressures of all the particles in contact
 with it on the same surface.              Maclaurin seems ultimately to have
 taken the same view of the matter, when he says that* " the sur
 faces similar and concentric to the surface of the spheroid, are the
 level surfaces at all depths."           It thus appears that the conditions
 laid down above as necessary and sufficient for an equilibrium, agree
 exactly with the demonstration of Maclaurin, when the true import
 of what is proved by that geometer is correctly understood.
     The general conditions for the equilibrium of a fluid at liberty
 being explained, the attention is next directed to another property,
 which is important, as it furnishes an equation that must be verified
 by every level surface.         If we take any two points in a fluid at rest,
 and open a communication between them by a narrow canal, it is
 obvious that, whatever be the figure of the canal, the effort of the
 fluid contained in it will be invariably the same, and equal to the
difference of the pressures at the two orifices.                As the pressure in a
fluid in equilibrium by the action of accelerating forces, varies from
 one point to another, it can be represented mathematically only by
 a function of three co-ordinates that determine the position of a
point : but this function must be such as is consistent with the pro
perty that obtains in every fluid at rest.              If a, b, c, and  a',b
                                                                            ',    c, de

function       (a,
                 (j>   b, must have such a form as will be changed into

this  it    is
            easy   to  prove  that   the   co-ordinates    in  the  expression    of  the
pressure    must   be   unrelated    and   independent quantities.         The    forces
in action are deducible from the pressure              ; for the forces produce the
variations    of the  pressure.    As   the  function    that stands for the press-

                                       161
 ure is restricted, so the expressions of the forces must be functions
 that fulfil the conditions of integrability, without which limitation
 an equilibrium of the fluid is impossible.        Thus, when the forces
  are given, the pressure may be found by an integration, which is
 always possible when an equilibrium is possible : and as the pressure
  is constant at all the points of the same level surface, an equation is
-hence obtained that must be verified by every level surface, the
 upper surface of the mass being included.         But although one equa
 tion applicable to all the level surfaces may be found in every case
 in which an equilibrium is possible, yet that equation alone is not
 sufficient to give a determinate form to these surfaces, except in one
 very simple supposition respecting the forces in action. When the
 forces that urge the particles of the fluid, are derived from independ
 ent sources, the figure of the level surfaces requires for its determi
 nation as many independent equations as there are different forces.         ,
     In the latter part of the paper the principles that have been laid
 down are illustrated by some problems. In the first problem, which
 is the simplest case that can be proposed, the forces are supposed to
 be such functions as are independent of the figure of the fluid, and
 are completely ascertained when three co-ordinates of a point are
 given. On these suppositions all the level surfaces are determined,
 and the problem is solved, by the equation which expresses the
 equality of pressure at all the points of the same level surface.
     As a particular example of the first problem, the figure of equili
 brium of a homogeneous fluid is determined on the supposition that
 it revolves about an axis and that its particles attract one another
 proportionally to their distance. This example is deserving of at
 tention on its own account ; but it is chiefly remarkable, because it
 would seem at first, from the mutual attraction of the particles, that
 peculiar artifices of investigation were required to solve it. But in
 the proposed law of attraction, the mutual action of the particles
 upon one another is reducible to an attractive force tending to the
 centre of gravity of the mass of fluid, and proportional to the di
 stance from that centre : which brings the forces under the condi
 tions of the first problem.
     The second problem investigates the equilibrium of a homogene
 ous planet in a fluid state, the mass revolving about an axis, and the
 particles attracting in the inverse proportion of the square of the
 distance.    The equations for the figure of equilibrium are two ; one
 deduced from the equal pressure at all the points of the same level
 surface ; and the other expressing that the stratum of matter be
 tween a level surface and the upper surface of the mass, attracts every
 particle in the level surface in a direction perpendicular to that surface.
 No point can be proved in a more satisfactory manner than that the
 second equation is contained in the hypothesis of the problem, and
 that it is an indispensable condition of the equilibrium.       Yet, in all
 the analytical investigations of this problem, the second equation is
neglected, or disappears in the processes used for simplifying the
calculation and making it more manageable : which is a remarkable

                                   163
instance of attempting to solve a problem, one of the necessary
conditions being omitted.
    The equations found in the second problem, are solved in the third
problem, proving that the figure of equilibrium is an ellipsoid.
    3.  "Report of a Geometrical Measurement of the Height of the
Aurora Borealis above the Earth." By the Rev. James Farquharsonr
LL.D., F.R.S.
    The principal object to which the author directed the inquiries of
which he here gives an account, is the determination by geometrical
measurement of the height of the aurora borealis, and of the altitude
and azimuth of the point to which the streamers seem to converge,
 and which has been termed the centre of the corona : these latter de
 terminations constituting important data for enabling us to form a
 clear conception of the whole definite arrangement and progress of
 the meteor, and also a correct judgement of the degree of reliance
 to be placed on the methods employed for measuring its height above
 the earth.    The paper is chiefly occupied with the details of the ob
 servations made or collected by the author, with their critical dis
 cussion, with the correction of some misapprehensions       which have
 existed respecting the views stated by the author in his former
 papers, and with a reply to the strictures of M. Arago on those views.
    The result of the geometrical measurement of one particular au
 rora, gave as the height of its upper edge, 5693 feet above the level
 of the Manse at Alford ; and the vertex of its arch was found to be
  14,831 feet northward of the same place.      The vertical extension of
 the fringe of streamers was 3212 feet; leaving 2481 feet for the
 height of the lower edge above the level of Alford. The tops of the
 Corean hills, immediately under the aurora, are about 1000 feet
 higher than that level ; so that the lower edge of the arch was only
  1500 feet above the summit of that range of hills.
    4. " On the Phosphates." By John Dalton, D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
    The author takes a review of the labours of preceding chemists
 which bear upon the subject of the atomic constitution of phospho
 ric acid, and the salts in which it enters as a constituent ; and shows
 their conformity with the views he has already advanced on the sub
 ject. A supplement is added, giving an account of the effects of
 various degrees of heat on the salt denominated the pyrophosphate of
 soda.
     5. " On the Arseniates."     By the Same.
     The author here examines the conformity of the results of the
  analysis of the salts of arsenic with his theory, in the same manner
  as he has done with the phosphates in the preceding paper.
     6.  " On the Constitution of the Resins." Parts II. and III. By
  J. F. W. Johnston, Esq., F.R.S.
     In this paper the author, pursuing the train of investigation of

                                    163
 which he has already given an account in a former communication,
 gives tabulated results of his chemical examination of several va
 rieties of gamboge, and formulae expressing their chemical constitu
 tion. A detailed account is given of the properties of the gambodic
 acid, and of the salts it forms with various bases, such as the gam-
 bodiates of potash and soda, of ammonia, and of different earths and
 metals, particularly lime, strontia, magnesia, lead, copper, zinc, and
 silver. He concludes from this investigation that the most probable
formula for gamboge is C10 H21 Os.         In the analysis, however, of
 every specimen, there occurred a deficiency of carbon, amounting to
 nearly one per cent. ; a deficiency supposed to be due to a change
produced during the preparation of the natural resin for the market.
 By a heat of 400° Fahr. gamboge undergoes a partial decomposi
tion ; a resin, soluble in alcohol, and another resin, insoluble in
 that menstruum being formed : the formula representing the latter
being Ct0 H22 O,.. Gamboge forms with the metallic oxides nume
 rous salts, the existence and constitution of which, however, the ex
periments of the author only render probable.
    The inquiries of the author were next directed to the chemical
 constitution of the resin of guaiacum, and to the properties of the
 salts it forms with various bases.      He then examines the acaroid
resin, which exudes from the Xanthorrhaa hastilis, and is often
known by the name of Botany-bay resin, or yellow gum ; and finds
its formula to be G40 H20 0,2, showing that it contains more oxygen
than any other resinous substance hitherto analyzed.
    The general conclusions drawn by the author from these researches
are the following.
    1 . Many of the resins may be represented by formulae exhibiting
their elementary constitution, and the weight of their equivalents,
in which 40 C is a constant quantity.
    2. There appear to be groups, in which the equivalents, both of
carbon and the hydrogen, are constant, the oxygen only varying ;
and others, in which the hydrogen alone varies, the two other ele
ments being constant.
    In the third part of the same series of investigations, the author
examines the constitution of the resin of Sandarach of commerce,
which he finds to consist of three different kinds of resin, all of
which possess acid properties. In like manner he finds that the
resin of the Pinus abies, or spruce fir, commonly called Thus, or or
dinary Frankincense, consists of two acid resins ; the one easily so
luble in alcohol, the other sparingly soluble in that menstruum. The
gum resin olibanum, of commerce, was found to consist of a mix
ture of at least two gum resins, the resinous ingredient of each of
which differs from that of the other in composition and properties.

common in      Scotland;" in a letter to P. M. Roget, M.D.,'Sec. R.S.

of Edinburgh, F.R.S. Ed., F.L.S., &c. Communicated by Dr.
Roget.

                                     164
     The author states some observations which he has made on the
  coloured marks apparent in a variety of the horse, common in Scot
  land, and there called the Eel-back Dun, and which afford grounds
  for doubting the accuracy of the conclusions deduced in a paper, by
  the late Earl of Morton, published in the Philosophical Transactions
  for 1820.    The title of the paper referred to is " A Communication
  of a singular fact in Natural History," namely, that a young chestnut
  mare of seven-eighths Arabian blood, after producing a female hybrid
  by a male quagga, had subsequently produced, by a fine black Ara
  bian horse, a filly and a colt, both of which had the character of the
  Arabian breed as decidedly as could be expected where fifteen-
 sixteenths of the blood are Arabian, but in colour, in the hair of
 their manes, and the markings of the back and legs, bore a striking
 resemblance to the quagga.
     The author, finding that similar markings are very commonly met
 with on the Eel-back dun ponies of Scotland, suggests, that as the
 breed of the mare in question was not pure she may have inherited
 the tendency to those peculiar markings.           He moreover observes,
 that the cross bar markings on the legs are not found in the quagga,
 but only in the zebra, which is a species quite distinct from the
 quagga ; a fact which he considers as completely overturning the
 reasoning by which the conclusions stated in Lord Morton's paper
were deduced.       The facts, he thinks, admit of a more natural ex
planation, and one more consistent with the known physiological
laws of developement, by supposing the stain in the purity of the
mare's Arab blood to have arisen from the circumstance of an early
progenitor of the mare having belonged to the Eel-backed dun va
riety, the peculiarities of which reappeared in a later generation.
    8. " On  the Structure and Functions of the Spleen." By Thomas
 Gordon Hake, M.D.         Communicated by Francis Kiernan, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    The author, passing in review the various opinions which have
been advanced by anatomists respecting the intimate structure of
the spleen, arrives at the conclusion that hitherto only vague and
premature inductions have been made. It is generally admitted that
the fibrous envelope of this organ is formed of the external fibres of
the splenic vein ; and that from the internal surface of this envelope
fibrous prolongations are continued into the interior of its substance,
giving support to a fine cellular membrane, which is continuous with
their edges, and variously reflected so as to constitute cells. The
parenchyma,     or solid structure of the spleen, everywhere accom
panies these membranous productions, and forms the exterior walls
of the cells ; being composed of branches of the splenic arteries, of
the granular terminations of those arteries constituting the splenic
grains of Malpighi, of venules, which ramify around the splenic
grains, and of cellules, into which the venules open, and from which
the splenic veins take their rise.     The author concludes, as the re
sult of his inquiries, that a dilatable cellular tissue exists, containing
venous blood, between the granules within which the arteries ter

                                   165
minate, and the venules on the outer side of the splenic grains : that
the venous membrane, which is continued from the cells to the
cellules, as well as to the venules, becoming more and more atte
nuated, but without changing its essential structure, gradually loses
its tubular form, and resumes its primitive character of cellular
tissue ; and that the artery, in like manner, is limited in its distri
bution within the granules by a cellular structure, which becomes
 vicarious of     it,
                  and determines the function       has to perform.
                                                   it
    The author, in conclusion, offers some observations on the pro
 bable functions of the spleen.      He considers the opinion which sup
poses that organ to be     distended,   at particular times, with arterial
blood, as being completely refuted by the evidence derived from the
preceding account of its minute structure; and suggests the proba
bility of the spleen being rather diverticulum for venous blood.

By Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author gives      a detailed account of several experiments in
which sugar, water, and yeast only were employed, and from which
he deduces the conclusion that alkaline and earthy matters are form
ed by chemical action.      In one set of experiments, some of which
were made in silver, others in china, and others in glass apparatus,
after the vinous fermentation had gone on during five days, the
quantity of ashes obtained was, in the silver apparatus eighteen, in
the china nineteen, and in the glass fifteen times greater than the
previous quantity.       Afurther examination of these ashes showed
that they consisted of potass, soda, lime, and       residue not acted
                                                        a
upon by muriatic acid.      The author states that, however irrecon
cilable to our present chemical knowledge this important conclusion
may at first sight appear, yet when      it   taken in connexion with
                                              is
the decomposition of other vegetable matter, and with the pheno
mena which accompany the growth of plants,          may not excite sur
                                                    it
prise  ;and may   be regarded   as in harmony  with  the phenomena of
natural science.    He concludes by offering suggestions towards ex
tending the inquiry into the subject of the formation of bones of
animals by the action of the powers inherent in their organization.

             the Difference of Colour in different parts of the Bodies
of Animals." By James Alderson, M, A., M.D., late Fellow of Pem
broke College, Cambridge. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Sec. R.S., &c.
   The hypothesis advanced by the author in explanation of the well-
known partial absence    ofthe coloured pigment or rete mucosum, in dif
ferent parts of the human body, and that of other animals,        that
                                                                  is   it
is due to the union or adhesion of the epidermis and the true skin,
so as to exclude the rete mucosum.       He supports this hypothesis by
the analogy of    cicatrix, which
                    a              is the result of an organization of a

                                  166
certain portion of lymph, poured out from the cut surfaces of a wound,
as part of the process of nutrition, or as the consequence of a small
amount of inflammation, induced either from mechanical irritation,
or other accidental circumstance. This hypothesis was suggested
by the colourless appearance of the cicatrix from the section of the
umbilical cord in the negro, and also of that seen by the author at
the umbilicus of the bottle-nosed whale, the Hyperoodon bidentatus.

   The President then addressed the meeting           as follows :
      Gentlemen,
A year    having now elapsed since you conferred upon me the highly
honourable office of your President, it becomes my duty, in accord
ance with the example of my predecessors, to address you.                  The
first and most agreeable part of my task is to express my feelings of
gratitude to those Gentlemen whom you were pleased to select as my
Council.   I am most highly indebted to them for the zealous co-ope

                                    169
ration and hearty assistance which        I  have ever received at their
hands.      It is to them that I have looked to aid my inexperience, and
 to supply my manifold deficiencies, and I have not been disappointed.
 To those who are the more permanent officers of the Society, the
 Treasurer and the Secretaries, my obligations are particularly great,
 and I will venture to add, that to them, as well as to the other mem
 bers of the Council, your thanks are due as well as mine.
     The past year has indeed been to that portion of the Royal So
 ciety which takes an active part in its affairs, one of more than usual
 labour and exertion, — of labour and exertion, destined, as I hope, to
 produce rich and ample fruit.       The great and marking peculiarity
which has attended       it, has been the sailing of the Antarctic Expe
 dition. The importance of following up in the southern regions of
 the globe the magnetic inquiries so interesting to men of science in
 Europe, was strongly felt by one of our distinguished Fellows, Ma
jor Sabine, and by him brought before the notice of the British As
 sociation at their meeting at Newcastle, as he had also previously
 done at Dublin.         That great assemblage of men of science, con
 curring in the views of Major Sabine, resolved to suggest to Her
 Majesty's Government the propriety of sending out scientific ex
                                                           a
 pedition and the Royal Society lost no time in warmly and zeal
         ;
 ously seconding the recommendation. It would, Gentlemen, be an
 idle inquiry to ask whether the success of the application be owing
 to the British Association or to the Royal Society.        It would seem,
 indeed, probable, that, considering the financial difficulties of the
 time, the Government might have hardly considered itself justified
 in yielding to the prayers of either body separately on this occasion    ;
 andif    to the British Association be the glory of the first proposal of
 this Expedition, to the Royal Society belongs the praise of perse
 verance in seconding the recommendation,            and of laborious and
 earnest endeavours to aid in rendering       itin every respect as efficient
 as possible.      It
                   is     my duty as your President to return my thanks
 and yours to Lord Melbourne, Lord Minto, Lord Monteagle, Sir
 Hussey Vivian, and Sir Richard Jenkins, the Chairman of the Ho
 nourable Court of Directors of the East India Company, for the
 urbanity and kindness with which they have received and acted on
 the suggestion of your Council, and for the confidence which the
  Government reposed in us, when they asked for our assistance in
  instructing the officers to whom the Expedition has been entrusted.
      In compliance with the request conveyed to us by the First Lord
  of the Admiralty, the Council transmitted to the Government body  a
  of hints and instructions in different branches of science, which      I
  trust are likely to be of material use both to the principal and to the
  subsidiary objects of the Antarctic Expedition.
      These hints and instructions would have been far less extensive
  and efficient
              if      the Council had not been able to have recourse to
  the several Scientific Committees, of whose formation the Society        is
  already aware.        The Expedition has now sailed, amply provided
  with the best scientific instruments and furnished with ample scien
  tific instructions:   it   iscommanded by one well acquainted both

                                      170
 with magnetic inquiry and nautical research.              We may therefore
 hope that, with the blessing    of Providence,   it  will return with a store
 of knowledge valuable     to  the geographer,  to   the geologist, to the me
 teorologist, and  to him  also  who  studies the  marvels   of vegetable and
 animal life. In addition to all this we may hope, that the main ob
ject of the Expedition will be accomplished by additional light
 thrown on the obscure problems which still attend the magnetism
 of the earth, and that by such discoveries Captain James Clark
 Ross may not only add to his own reputation and his country's
 glory, but also give to the adventurous mariner increased facility
 and security in traversing the pathways of the ocean.
    The Antarctic Expedition was not the only measure recommended
 by the Royal Society and the British Association to Her Majesty's
 Government. Another important recommendation, which had pre
 viously been brought forward by Baron Humboldt, was the establish
 ment of fixed magnetic observatories for the purpose of making si
 multaneous observations in different parts of our colonial possessions.
 These recommendations        have been readily acceded to, both by the
 Government and by the Court of Directors of the East India Com
 pany, and probably, ere many months shall have elapsed, the obser
vatories will be in full activity. This ready acquiescence in the
wishes of men of science appears to me highly creditable to our
statesmen ; and I feel confident, that while science belongs to no
party, on the other hand, every party in this country is fully aware
of the importance of science, and of the numerous benefits conferred
by it on the human race.
    I have stated, Gentlemen, that your Council had recourse to the
Scientific Committees for assistance in drawing up instructions for
the Expedition in different branches of knowledge; those com
mittees, who were named only two years ago, were at first appa
rently more a matter of form than substance ; they have now been
found capable of doing excellent service.         Not only has your Coun
cil consulted them on the questions already alluded to, but also,
observing that the several Committees are composed of the most
competent judges of the merits of the memoirs in the respective
departments of science communicated to the Society, they have, in
general, referred the papers to them to report upon, previously to
coming to a decision regarding their publication.
    The Royal Society, from its character of pursuing every branch
of physical science, is evidently in a different position from other
societies professing some one science alone.           It may be reasonably
expected, that in the Botanical or Geological Society, for instance,
the whole Council should possess a certain degree of botanical or
geological knowledge. This, however, cannot be the case with us.
Our Council will comprise a few astronomers, a few zoologists, a
few botanists, and a few persons well acquainted with geology and
medicine ; but no single science can monopolize a large number of
its members.     In difficult questions we have therefore felt that it is
more satisfactory to ourselves, and we think probably more so to
the general body of the society, and to those who have favoured us

                                    171
 with papers, that we should ask the opinion of a larger number of
 men conversant with the immediate sciences in question.          At the
 same time, the Council retains its responsibility for its acts, and the
 chief officers of the society are officially members of each of the
 scientific committees.
    The Council have derived a further assistance from these Com
 mittees in the adjudication of our medals.     In naming these Com
 mittees, the Council has had both a difficult and a delicate task.
 Convinced that bodies, when too numerous, are little adapted for
business, they have also felt that the power of giving their attend
ance might be more important than absolute superiority of scien-         .
tific attainments. Some members have, however, been selected,
though really non-resident, because it was believed that their col
leagues might wish to consult them by letter.       With these objects
and views, the Council have done their best ; but they have little
doubt that some gentlemen have been overlooked and omitted,
whose presence in the Committees might have been very desirable.
The Society must consider this as in some degree a new system, to
be perfected and improved by experience alone.
    Another question has occupied a share of the time of the Coun
cil during the last year.      We have felt that the testimonial of re
commendation for new Fellows has scarcely been sufficiently defi
nite and precise in stating the grounds on which the candidate
was recommended to the body of the Society.         We have therefore
thought it desirable to draw up forms of testimonial, some one of
which may be adopted as most fit for each individual so recom
mended.      We have thought this more fair, at the same time, to the
meritorious candidate and to those electors who are otherwise left
in the dark with respect to his claims for their suffrages.    We hope
and trust that this new regulation will not stand in the way of any
candidate who would be a desirable addition to our number.
    The labours of our tried and valuable officer, Mr. Roberton, ha
ving materially increased, partly in consequence of the establish
ment of Scientific Committees, and partly from other causes, and
those labours having also become more valuable from the length
ened experience of many years spent in our service, it has appeared
to us an act of mere justice to augment his salary from £160 to
£200 per annum.
    The Society are doubtless aware, that, at the time of the last An
niversary, no final settlement had taken place of the pecuniary
claim of Mr. Panizzi, who had commenced the Catalogue of our
Library, though that gentleman had received a considerable sum
on account.     Feeling that it was very desirable to bring this ques
tion to a termination, we agreed to a reference ; and Mr. Drink-
water Bethune having been proposed by Mr. Panizzi, and agreed
to by us, that gentleman has decided that a balance of £328 is still
due by us.
    The vacancies in    the list of our Foreign Members have been
supplied by the    election of M. Savart of Paris, Signor Melloni of
Parma, M. Quetelet of Brussels, M. Hansteen of Christiana, Prof.

                                     172
Agassiz of Neufchatel, and M. von Martius of Munich, as those
 Fellows who were present at their election will remember.
     Ihave to announce to you, Gentlemen, with great regret, the re
tirement of Captain Smyth from the office of Foreign Secretary, in
consequence of his leaving his present residence for one at an in
convenient distance from London.
   I shall not detain you by any observations of the finances of the
Royal Society, as you will shortly hear the report of the Treasurer
on that subject.
     Ihave the honour, Gentlemen, to inform you that the Council
have, by an unanimous decision, awarded the Royal Medals to Dr.
Martin Barry and Mr. Ivory, and the Copley Medal for the year
to Mr. Robert Brown ; and       I
                                shall now beg leave to address myself
to those three Gentlemen.
   Dr. Barry — it gives me sincere pleasure to bestow this medal on
a gentleman who has so well deserved        by researches in
                                             it,               difficult
                                                                   a
and important portion of animal physiology*.         Your merits have
been appreciated by men much more capable of understanding the
subject than can pretend to be — by men selected by the Council
             I
of the Royal Society for their physiological science, who have felt
the great value of the discoveries you have made by accurate and
diligent research, aided by the skilful use of the microscope.     trust
                                                                     I
that the award of this medal will encourage you to persevere in the
same course, and that future discoveries may add to your reputation
and to that of the important profession to which you belong.
   Mr. Ivory—     it  not the first time that you have been addressed
                       is
  * These researches are the subject of Dr. Martin Barry's
                                                           papers "On
Embryology," communicated to the Royal Society in 1838 and 1839.
  In these memoirs the author has brought to light many new and in
teresting facts, and has repeated and confirmed previous observations
regarding the nature, formation, and developement of the ovum in the ver-
tebrata, and especially in the mammalia.
   The importance of the subject and the difficulty of its investigation,
render the establishment of facts previously known extremely acceptable
to physiologists.     But the novel matter contained in Dr. Barry's Me
moirs forms  a   considerable proportion of them.      Without entering into
unnecessary detail, we may mention that the author has determined the
order of formation of the different parts of the ovum, and the nature and
mode of developement of the vesicle (ovisac), in which these processes take
place. He has, in like manner, discovered the nature and traced the de
velopement of the so-called disc of M. Baer, and has detected in        it  the
mechanism which mainly regulates the transit of the ovum into the Fallo
pian tube. The second series of Dr. Barry's observations makes known
the changes which the ovum undergoes in its passage through the Fallo
pian tube the earliest and most interesting stages of developement being
         ;
for the first time described in this memoir.
   The value of his very laborious and extensive series of minute observations
is greatly enhanced by the clearness and method with which the results
are given, and by the comparisons, which the author's intimate acquaint
ance with this branch of physiological       literature has enabled him to
institute, between his own observations and those of his predecessors in
the same branch of inquiry.

                                        173
  from this chair, and it gives me great satisfaction to follow the steps
  of my predecessors, Sir Joseph Banks and Sir H. Davy, by again
  bestowing a medal on one who is an honour to the Royal Society
  and pre-eminently distinguished for his mathematical attainments.
  The labours of your life are too well known to the scientific world
  to require any eulogium from me, and I consider that in this tribute
  to your paper on astronomical refraction, we are rather doing an
  honour to ourselves than to you.
     Mr.' Brown — in conferring the Copley Medal on you for your
 valuable discoveries in vegetable impregnation*, I am quite sure
 that the voice of scientific Europe will respond to the decision of
 the Council of the Royal Society.         The Academie des Sciences
 has already pronounced on your merits, as also on those of Mr.
 Ivory, by electing you as well as that gentleman to a seat among
 their foreign members ; and the University of Oxford has also, by
 an honorary degree, given you a similar testimonial. That you are
 one of our fellows is to myself a circumstance peculiarly agreeable,
 as it must be to the whole body over whom I have the honour to
 preside.    Your discoveries in the particular botanical question, for
 which I have to give you the Copley Medal, are so important, not
 only in a botanical, but also in a general scientific point of view, by
showing the close analogies of animal and vegetable life, that the
 Committee of Zoology have felt it as much their province as that of
the Committee of Botany, to recommend that the Copley Medal
should be bestowed upon you ; and the Council have come to an
unanimous resolution to give      it,
                                   though at the same time other gen
tlemen were recommended by other scientific committees, with whom
even an unsuccessful rivalry would be no mean praise.
I      hope, Mr. Brown, that you may long enjoy life and leisure to
pursue researches so valuable to science and so honourable to the
country of which you are     a native.
    In drawing up the following notice of the losses which the Royal
Society has sustained during the last year, in conformity with the
practice of my predecessors,   I  have availed myself of the assistance
of one of the Fellows, whose acquaintance with the labours of men of
science peculiarly qualified him for the execution of task which
                                                           a             I
could not myself have ventured to undertake.         Itherefore will not
longer occupy your time by any further remarks of my own, but
will conclude by the expression of my present wishes for the pros
perity of the Royal Society, and for its success in furthering the
noble ends for which    it was instituted.
    The Rev. Martin Davy was originally            member of the me
                                                   a
dical profession, which he followed, during a great part of his life,
with no inconsiderable reputation. He became         medical student of
                                                       a
 *  The following are the discoveries referred to: viz., the organization of
the vegetable ovule, immediately before fecundation, (published in 1826);
and the direct action of the pollen, manifested by the contact established be
tween  and that point of the ovulum where the embryo subsequently first
        it
becomesvisible, and published in papers, in the years 1832 and 1833, and
communicated to the Linnean Society.

                                     174
Caius College in 1787, and was elected to a fellowship in 1793 and
to the mastership in 1803, the late illustrious Dr. Wollaston being
one of his competitors.      One of the first acts of his administration
was to open his College to a more large and liberal competition, by
the abolition of some mischievous and unstatutable restrictions,
which had been sanctioned by long custom, and also by making acade
mical merit and honours the sole avenue to college preferment : and
he lived to witness the complete success of this wise and liberal
measure, in the rapid increase of the number of high academical
honours which were gained by members of his College, and by
the subsequent advancement of many of them to the highest pro-                 *
fessional rank and eminence.
     Some years after his accession to the mastership, he took holy
 orders and commuted the degree of Doctor in Medicine for that of
 Theology, and in later life he was collated to some considerable ec
 clesiastical preferments.    Dr. Davy had no great acquaintance with
the details of accurate science, but he was remarkable for the extent
 and variety of his attainments in classical and general literature ;
 his conversation was eminently lively and original, and not less agree
 able from its occasional tendency to somewhat paradoxical, though
 generally harmless speculations.       He died in May last, after a long
 illness, deeply lamented by a large circle of friends, to whom he was
 endeared by his many social and other virtues.
      Dr. Herbert Marsh, Bishop of Peterborough, and one of the
  most acute and learned theologians of his age, became a member of
  St. John's College in the University of Cambridge in the year 1 775 and
 took his B.A. degree in 1779, being second in the list of Wranglers,
 which was headed by his friend and relation Mr. Thomas Jones, a
 man whose intellectual powers were of the highest order, and who
  for many years filled the office of tutor of Trinity College with un
  equalled success and reputation.       Soon after his election to a fellow
  ship,  he  went  to Germany,  where    he devoted himself during many
  years   to theological and general  studies,  and first became known to
  the public as the translator and learned commentator of Michaelis's
  Introduction to the New Testament.           It was during his residence
  abroad that he published in the German language various tracts in
  defence of the policy of his own country in the continental wars, and
  more particularly a very elaborate " History of the Politics of Great
  Britain and France, from the time of the Conference at Pilnitz to the
  Declaration of War," a work which produced a marked impression
  on the state of public opinion in Germany, and for which he re
  ceived a very considerable       pension on the recommendation            of
  Mr. Pitt. In 1807, he was elected Lady Margaret's Professor of
   Divinity in the University of Cambridge, an appointment of great
  value and importance, which he retained for the remainder of his life.
   On the resumption of his residence in the University, he devoted
   himself with great diligence to the preparation of his lectures on
   various important branches of Divinity, interposing a great number
   of occasional publications on the Catholic Question, the Bible So
   ciety, and various other subjects of political and theological contro

                                    175
versy.     In 1816 he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff; and three
years   afterwards  he was translated to the see of Peterborough.    In
the course of a few years from this time, his health, which had been
already undermined by his sedentary habits and severe studies, be
gan rapidly to decline, and he was compelled to abstain from the
active duties of his professorship and from the exciting labours of
controversy ; and though his infirmities continued to increase both
in number and severity, yet his life was prolonged to a mature old
age by the vigilant and anxious care and nursing of one of the most
exemplary and affectionate of wives.
    Dr. Marsh was a man of great learning and very uncommon vigour
of mind, and as a writer, remarkable for the great precision of his
language and his singular clearness in the statement of his argument.
 His lectures on Divinity are a most valuable contribution to the
                                "
theological student, and his Comparative View of the Churches of
 England and Rome" presents one of the most masterly views of the
great principles which distinguish those churches, which has ever
appeared from the pen of a Protestant writer.          His controversial
 writings, though generally full of acuteness and ability, must be ex
pected to share the fate of all productions which are not kept from
perishing by the permanent existence of the interests, of whatever
 nature, which gave rise to them : and we may justly lament that
 learning and powers of reasoning of so extraordinary a character,
 were not more exclusively and steadily devoted to the completion of
 more durable and systematic theological labours.
    The father of the late Professor Rigaud had the care of the
 King's Observatory at Kew, an appointment which probably influ
 enced the early tastes and predilections of his son.       He was ad
 mitted a member of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1791, at the early
 age of sixteen, and continued to reside there as fellow and tutor
 until 1810, when he was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry.
 He afterwards succeeded to the care of the Radcliffe Observatory,
 and the noble suite of instruments by Bird, with which it is fur
 nished, was augmented, on his recommendation, by a new transit
 and circle, so as to fit it for the most refined purposes of modern
 practical astronomy : and we venture to express a hope that it will
 shortly become equally efficient and useful with the similar esta
 blishment which exists in the sister university.
     Professor Rigaud published, in 1831, the miscellaneous works
  and correspondence    of Bradley, to which he afterwards added a very
 interesting supplement on the astronomical papers of Harriott.       In
  1838, he published some curious notices of the first publication of
 the Principia of Newton ; and he had also projected a life of Halley,
  with a view of rescuing the memory of that great man from much
  of the obloquy to which it has been exposed ; he had made exten
 sive collections for a new edition of the mathematical collections of
 Pappus ; and he was the author of many valuable communications
 to the Transactions of the Royal Astronomical Society, and to
 other scientific journals, on various subjects connected with physical
 and astronomical science.      There was probably no other person of

                                     176
  his age who was equally learned on all subjects connected with the
  history and literature of astronomy.
     Professor Rigaud was a man of most amiable character, and of
  singularly pleasing manners and person.         The warmth of his affec
  tions, his modesty, gentleness, and love of truth, as well as the great
  variety of his acquirements and accomplishments,        had secured him
  the love and the respect of a large circle of friends, not merely in
  his own university, but amongst men of science generally. He died
  in London in March last, after a short but painful illness, which
  he bore with a fortitude and resignation which might have been
  expected from his gentle, patient, and truly Christian character.
     Mr. Wilkins, Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy,
  became a member of Caius College, Cambridge, in 1796, and took
 the degree of B.A. in 1800, his name standing sixth on the mathe
  matical Tripos.     He was soon afterwards nominated one of Wort's
  Travelling Bachelors, and also a fellow of his college, and passed four
 years in Greece and Italy, studying the architectural remains and
 monuments of those countries with great diligence, preparatory to the
 practice of his profession as an architect, which his father had followed
 with credit, and for which his great skill as a draftsman particularly
 qualified him. The study of those matchless creations of ancient art
 would appear to have exercised a powerful influence on his taste, and
 to have led him to prefer the purer forms of Grecian architecture
 to the more varied imitations and adaptations         of them which ap
 peared   in the  works  of the Romans   or  in those of the great masters
 of modern Italy and more particularly of Palladio ; — and the influ
 ence of these predilections was sufficiently visible in his designs for
 the East India College at Haileybury, and for Downing College, Cam
 bridge, and is more or less easily traceable in most of his subsequent
 works. In 1807, he published his "Antiquities of Magna Graecia,"
 a magnificent work, containing descriptions, views, measurements,
 and restorations     of the chief remains of Syracuse, Agrigentum,
 TEgesta,   and  Psestum.   At a subsequent period he published " Athe-
 niensia," or Remarks on the Buildings of Athens, in which he ex
pressed opinions unfavourable to those commonly entertained re
specting the rank which the Elgin marbles, which had been only
recently purchased by the nation, should be considered to hold
when viewed as works of art : he was likewise the author of a trans
lation of the Civil Architecture of Vitruvius, including those books
which relate to the public and private edifices of the Ancients,
which was preceded by a learned introduction on the history of the
Rise and Progress of Grecian Architecture, — a work which was
chiefly designed to show that, the precepts of Vitruvius referred to
Grecian and not to Roman buildings.
    The publication of these works and of some essays in the Ar-
chaeologia, which showed a profound knowledge of the principles
both of Grecian and Gothic architecture, led to very extensive
professional engagements, particularly in the University of Cam
bridge, where he rebuilt Corpus Christi and King's colleges, and
made extensive additions to Trinity College : he was likewise the

                                   177
author of the magnificent portico of London University College,
the National Gallery, and of other important edifices in London.
He was latterly compelled by the declining state of his health and
by repeated attacks of the gout, to retire from his professional en
gagements, though he did not abandon those studies which had formed
his delight and occupation from his earliest years.         In 1837, he
                 "
 published his Prolusiones Architectonic*, or Essays on subjects
 connected with Grecian and Roman Architecture," which were
 designed, in some degree, as a substitute for those lectures, which,
 under other circumstances, he would have been called upon to
 deliver, as Professor of Architecture, to the students of the Royal
 Academy.       During the last year of his life, though constantly
 confined to his bed, and extremely weakened and emaciated by dis
ease, he still continued his favourite pursuits until within a few
 days of his death, which took place on the last day of August last.
    The Rev. Archibald Alison, senior Minister of St. Paul's Chapel,
 Edinburgh, was born in 1757, became a member of the University
 of Glasgow in 1 772, and of Baliol College, Oxford, in 1 775, and
 took the degree of B.C.L. in 1784: he soon afterwards took holy
 orders in the English Church, and was presented to several eccle
 siastical preferments    by Sir William Pulteney, Lord Chancellor
 Loughborough, and Bishop Douglas of Salisbury.         In 1784 he mar
 ried the daughter of the celebrated Dr. John Gregory of Edinburgh,
 with whom he lived in uninterrupted happiness for forty years of his
 life. His celebrated Essay " on the Nature and Principles of Taste
                                                                       "
 was first published in 1790, and speedily became incorporated into
 the standard literature of Great Britain.   Towards the close of the
 last century, he became a permanent resident in his native city as
 minister of the Episcopal chapel, Cowgate, and afterwards of St.
 Paul's, where he was connected by congenial tastes and pursuits
 with Dugald Stewart, Playfair, Henry Mackenzie, Dr. Gregory, and
  the many other distinguished men who, during so many years, made
  that beautiful and picturesque city the metropolis of British lite
  rature.   In 1814, he published two volumes of sermons ; and at a
  later period, a very interesting memoir of his accomplished friend
  the Hon. Fraser Tytler Lord Woodhouslee.       Mr. Alison was a man
  of very pleasing and refined manners, of great cheerfulness and
  equanimity of temper, of a clear and temperate judgment, and pos
  sessing a very extensive knowledge of mankind.      He was habitually
  pious and humble-minded, exhibiting, in the whole tenor of his life,
  the blessed influence of that Gospel of which he was the ordained
   minister. All his writings are characterized by that pure and cor
  rect taste, the principles of which he had illustrated with so much
  elegance and beauty.
      Edmund Law Lushington was born in 1766, at the lodge of
   St. Peter's College, Cambridge, of which his grandfather, Bishop
  Law, was master. He became a student, and afterwards a fellow of
  Queen's College in that University, and attained the fourth place on
  the mathematical tripos in 1787.     After practising for some years
  at the bar, he was appointed Chief Justice of Ceylon, a station

                                    178
 which he filled for several years with great advantage to that co
 lony. On his return from the East, he was made Auditor of the
 Exchequer, and also received from his uncle Lord Ellenborough the
 appointment of Master of the Crown Office. He was an intimate
 friend of Wollaston and Tennant; and though withdrawn by his
 pursuits from the active cultivation of science,           he continued
 throughout his life to feel a deep interest in its progress. His
 acquaintance with classical and general literature was unusually
 extensive and varied, and he had the happiness of witnessing in his
 sons the successful   cultivation of those studies which other and
 more absorbing duties had compelled him to abandon. Mr. Lush-
 ington was a man of a cheerful temper, of very courteous and
 pleasing manners, temperate and tolerant in all his opinions, and
 exemplary in the discharge both of his public and private duties :
 few persons have ever been more sincerely beloved either by their
 friends or by the members of their families.
    Mr.George Saunders was formerly architect to the British Mu
 seum, where he built the Townley Gallery : he was also a diligent
 and learned antiquary, and the author of a very interesting and va
luable paper in the twenty-sixth volume of the Archaeologia, con
taining the results of an inquiry concerning the condition and ex
tent of the city of Westminster at various periods of our history.
    The only foreign members whom the Royal Society has lost
 during the last year are the Baron de Prony, one of the most di
stinguished engineers and mathematicians of the age ; and the ve
nerable Pierre Prevost, formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy in
the University of Geneva.
    Gaspard Clair Francois Marie Riche de Prony was born
 in the department of the Rhone in 1755, and became a pupil, at an
 early age, of the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees, where he pursued
 his mathematical and other studies with great application, and with
more than common success.        He was subsequently employed, as an
adjunct of M. Perronet, the chief of that school, in many important
works, and particularly in the restoration of the Port of Dunkirk ;
and in 1786, he drew up the engineering plan for the erection of
the Pont Louis XVI., and was employed in superintending its exe
cution. M. de Prony had already appeared before the public, first
as the translator of General Roy's " Account of the Methods em
ployed for the Measurement of the Base on Hounslow Heath," which
was the basis of the most considerable geodesical operation which
had at that time been undertaken ; and subsequently, as the author
of an essay of considerable merit, " On the Construction of Indeter
minate Equations of the Second Degree."          In 1790 and 1797, ap
peared   his great work,  in two  large volumes,   entitled Nouvelle Ar
chitecture Hydraulique, which is a very complete and systematic
treatise on Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydraulics, and more par
ticularly on the principles of the steam-engine and hydraulical en
gineering. In 1 792 he was appointed to superintend the execution
of the Cadastre, or great territorial and numerical survey of France,
— a gigantic undertaking, the subsequent execution of which, during

                                   179
the revolutionary government, combined with the establishment         of
the bases of the decimal metrical system, gave employment and de-
velopement to so many and such important scientific labours and
discoveries : among many other laborious duties, the formation of
the extensive tables devolved upon M. de Prony, who, in the course
of two years, organized and instructed a numerous body of calcula
tors, and completed the immense Tables du Cadastre, which are
still preserved in MSS. at the library of the Observatory in seven
teen enormous folio volumes.
    M. de Prony became Directeur-General des Ponts et Chaussees in
 1794, and was nominated the first Professor of Mechanics to the
Ecole Polytechnique ; — an appointment, which led to the publication
of many very important memoirs on mechanical and hydraulical
subjects, and on various problems of engineering, which appeared in
the Journal of that celebrated school.       He declined the invitation
of Napoleon to become a member of the Institute of Egypt, — a re
fusal which was never entirely forgotten or pardoned. In the beginning
of the present century he was engaged in the execution of very exten
sive works connected with the embankments towards the embouchure
 of the Po, and in the ports of Genoa, Ancona, Pola, Venice, and the
 Gulf of Spezzia;   and in 1810, he was appointed, in conjunction with
the celebrated Count Fossombroni of Florence, the head of the Com
missions de VAgro Romano, for the more effectual drainage and im
 provement of the Pontine Marshes. The result of his labours in
this very important task, which he prosecuted with extraordinary
zeal and success, was embodied in his Description Hydrographique
et Historique des Marais Pontins, which appeared in 1822, which
 contains a very detailed description of the past, present and pro
spective condition of these pestilential regions, and a very elaborate
scientific discussion of the general principles which should guide us,
in this and all similar cases, in effecting their permanent restoration
to healthiness and fertility.
    After the return of the Bourbons, M. de Prony continued to be
employed in various important works, and more particularly in the
formation of some extensive embankments towards the mouth of the
 Rhone. In 1817, he was made a member of the Bureau des Longi
tudes, and in the following year he was elected one of the fifty fo
reign members of the Royal Society: in 1828, he was created a
Baron by Charles X., and was made a peer of France in 1835. He
died in great tranquillity at Aonieres near Paris, in July last, in the
84th year of his age.
    The Baron de Prony was a man of singularly pleasing manners,
of very lively conversation, and of great evenness of temper. He was
one of the most voluminous writers of his age, generally upon ma
thematical and other subjects connected with his professional pur
suits ; and though we should not be justified in placing him on
the same level with some of the great men with whom he was asso
ciated for so many years of his life, yet he is one of those of whom
his country may justly be proud, whether we consider the extent
and character of his scientific attainments, or the great variety of
important practical and useful labours in which his life was spent.

                                    180
    Pierre Prevost was born in 1751, and was originally destined
to follow the profession of his father, who was one of the pastors of
Geneva : at the age of twenty, however, he abandoned the study of
theology for that of law, the steady pursuit of which, in time, gave
way to his ardent passion for literature and philosophy : at the age
of twenty-two, he became private tutor in a Dutch family, and after
wards accepted a similar situation in the family of M. Delessert,
first at Lyons, and afterwards at Paris. It was in this latter city
that he commenced the publication of his translation of Euripides,
beginning with the tragedy of Orestes ; — a work which made him
advantageously    known to some of the leading men in that great me
tropolis of literature, and led to his appointment, in 1780, to the
professorship of philosophy in the college of Nobles, and also to a
place in the Academy of Berlin, on the invitation of Frederick
the Great.     Being thus established in a position where the cultiva
tion of literature and philosophy became as much a professional
duty as the natural accomplishment of his own wishes and tastes,
he commenced a life of more than ordinary literary activity and
productiveness. In the course of the four years which he passed at
Berlin, he published Observations sur les methodes employees pour
enseigner la morale ; sur la tMorie des gains fortuits ; sur le mouve-
ment progressif du centre de gravite de tout le systeme solaire ; sur
Vorigine des vitesses projectiles ; sur Veconomie des anciens gouverne-
ments ; sur Vetat des finances dAngklerre ; and he also completed
the three first volumes of his translation of Euripides.          There
were, in fact, few departments of literature or philosophy which
were not comprehended       in the extensive range of his studies and
publications.
    In the year 1784,   he returned to Geneva to attend the death-bed
of his father, when     he was induced to accept the chair of belles
lettres  in the University, — an appointment, which he found on trial
little suited to his taste, and which he shortly afterwards resigned.
 For some years after this period, he was compelled more by circum
 stances than by inclination to partake largely in those political dis
 cussions, which, for some years, agitated his native city, and which
 afterwards, resumed upon a wider theatre, shook to its centre the
 whole framework of European society; but he gradually withdrew
 himself from political life on his appointment to the chair of na
 tural philosophy in 1792, and devoted himself from thenceforth,
 with renewed activity and ardour, to pursuits which were most con
 genial to his tastes.
    In 1790 M. Prevost published his Memoire sur Vequilibre du feu,
 and in the following year his Recherches sur la chaleur : these im
 portant memoirs were followed by many others on the same subject
 in various scientific journals ; and the general results of all his re
 searches and discoveries were exhibited, in a systematic form, in
 his well-known work Sur le calorique rayonnant, which was pub
 lished in 1809, and in which he fully developed his Theory of Ex
 changes, and was enabled to give a consistent explanation of the
 principal facts which were at that time known respecting the nature
 and propagation of heat.

                                     181
    It would be impossible, in the very short compass within which
this notice is necessarily confined, to enumerate even a small part
of the publications of an author whose pursuits were so various
and whose labours were so unremitting.               He contributed papers
to our Transactions in 1797 and 1803 ; the first containing an ex
planation of some optical experiments of Lord Brougham, and the
second, some remarks on heat and on the action of bodies which inter
cept it, with reference to  a   paper by Dr. Herschel    ;    and in 806, he
                                                                   1
became one of the foreign members of our body.               In 1799, he ob
tained the first accessit for an essay Sur Vinfluence des sigties rela-
tivement   a  la formation des idees, which was written for         a   prize,
adjudged    to  the celebrated Degerando, proposed by the Institute
of France and he was shortly afterwards elected a corresponding
           ;
member of that body.       His Essais de philosophie, et etudes de Vesprit
humain, appeared in 1804, to which were appended some very re
markable Essays of his friend and ancient preceptor Le Sage, of
whom he published      a   most interesting life in the following year.
He likewise published, in very rapid succession, translations of the
Rhetoric of Blair, the Essays and posthumous works of Adam Smith,
the Elements of Philosophy of Dugald Stewart, the essay on Popu
lation by Malthus, Salt's Travels in Abyssinia, the Conversations on
Political Economy, of his wife's sister-in-law, Mrs. Marcet, and many
other works of less importance and interest.
    In 1823, at the age of 72, though still vigorous and active both
in body and mind, he resigned the professorship of natural philo
sophy, in wise anticipation of the approach of that period of life
when men naturally feel reluctant to acknowledge the decline of
their faculties, or incompetent to perceive it. From this time,
though still consulted by his colleagues and fellow-citizens on every
important subject connected with the Academy or the state, he re
tired into the bosom of his family, which contained within itself, in
a  very uncommon degree, every element of tranquillity, contentment
and happiness.      His own temper was singularly equable and tran
quil and his tastes and pursuits, which rarely left his time unoc
    ;
cupied, saved him from that tcedium vita which sometimes renders
old age querulous and discontented.            Thus happily disposed and
happily  circumstanced,    it   isnot  wonderful    that his life should have
been prolonged beyond       the  ordinary  limits   of humanity. He died
on the 8th of April,    in the  88th  year  of  his  age, surrounded by his
family, and deeply regretted by all who knew him.
    The philosophical character of M. Prevost had been greatly influ
enced by that of his master Le Sage,       a  man of great originality and
profundity     of thought,   but  whose   speculations,    particularly those
which attempted the explanation of the cause of gravity, trespassed
somewhat beyond the proper limits of philosophy. We consequently
find him disposed to explain the laws of the propagation of heat and
light on the most simple mechanical principles, and to trace their
origin and progress much farther than the experiments or facts will
properly warrant thus giving to his conclusions, in many cases,
                   ;                                                       a
much more hypothetical character than would otherwise have at

                                        182
tached to them.         M. Prevost had little acquaintance with the more
refined resources of modern analysis ; and his researches on many
important branches of experimental and philosophical inquiry were
consequently limited to reasonings which could be carried on by
the most simple algebraical or geometrical processes.         But notwith
standing the restrictions which were thus imposed on his progress,
the range of his philosophical researches was unusually extensive
and various, and his discoveries on heat must always be considered
as constituting a most important epoch in a branch of science which
has recently received so extraordinary a developement in the hands
of Fourier, Forbes, Melloni, and other philosophers.
    The Treasurer read the following statement relative to the finances
of the Society :
   The Disbursements            of the Society may be classed under two
heads    :
           1 . Those which are ordinary ; and
           2. Those which are extraordinary, and not     likely to   recur.
    1 . The ordinary disbursements         may be stated  in the following
 manner: —

    The annual expense of printing the Philosophical Transactions has
been,     on an average of the last five years, £850, without including
the charge for stitching and for advertisements ; viz.
               For Printing                                £466*
               For Paper                                    142

                                                           £850
The expenses attending their publication vary, of course, very much
 according to the number of pages, the quantity of Engravings, and
 the nature of the Papers included in each volume.
    2. Besides the ordinary disbursements,        the Society has recently
borne the expenses of the Catalogue, for which Mr. Panizzi has al-
                            Printing.          Paper.          Engraving.

   with £328 awarded by Mr. Drinkwater Bethune, to whom this matter
   was referred, is £803, and the expense of printing the same has
  been £657 : 10.       The legal expenses in the present year have been
   greater than usual, in consequence of the costs in the above reference,
  amounting to £48 : 10 : 6, and those in the matter of the Royal So
  ciety v. Loscombe, amounting to £114 : 12 : 10, which have been
  incurred in prosecuting, under the advice of Counsel, the claim of
  the Society to £1200 3 per cent, consols bequeathed to the Royal
   Society by the late Sir Clifton Wintringham, payable on the death
  of his widow.
      The expenses of defending the suit in respect of the Mablethorpe
  tithes have been considerable ; and in consequence of the decision of
  Lord Abinger in the Court of Exchequer in July last, the income
  which the Society derives from that estate will be materially di
  minished, unless that decision can be reversed by appeal to the
  House of Lords.
      The Society derives Income from the rent of an estate at Mable
  thorpe in Lincolnshire ; from a fee-farm rent issuing out of the Ba
  rony of Lewes, in Sussex ; from the rent of an estate at Acton ; and
  one fifth of the clear rent of an estate at Lambeth Hill, from the
  Royal College of Physicians, in pursuance of Lady Sadleir's Will.
  These rents are as follows :
               Estate at Mablethorpe                    £107    0  0
               Lands at Acton                             60    0  0

     The estate at Mablethorpe consists of 55 a. 2 r. 2 p. of pasture
 land, and is let to Mr. Cross, at £107 per annum, who is tenant at
 will. The lands at Acton appear to consist now of 33 a. 3 r. 36 p.,
 and are let to Mr. Essex, at £60 per annum, who is tenant at will.
     The property at Acton was purchased by the Society, with other
 lands since sold, in August 1732.
     The lands at Mablethorpe were bequeathed to the Society by
 Francis Aston, Esq. in 1713.
     The fee-farm rent in Sussex issuing out of the Barony of Lewes
 was purchased by the Society with £400 bequeathed to the Society
 by the Bishop of Chester in June 1674, and is now payable by the
 Earl of Abergavenny.
     The Society also derives income from
         Dividends in Stock                                  £529 11   2

also whatever may be received for the Admission Fees, or Compo
sition of new members, which is fluctuating.                  The Admissions
have been on an average of the last five years thirty-four, which
would give £340 per annum for Admission Fees of £10 each ; and
the average sums received from members who have compounded for
                           * This sum is on the increase.

annual contributions during the same period is £500, making a total
of £840 per annum for Admission Fees and Compositions*.
    Besides these sources of income, there are other sums invested in
the funds, namely,

of which the dividends are not applicable to the general expenses of
the Society, but must be disposed of according to the intention of
the respective donors.
     The clear annual income, therefore, which may for some time be
 expected, without taking into consideration the sums arising from
 the Fairchild Fund, the Rumford Fund, and the Donation Fund,
 is about £2386, or without the Admission Fees and Compositions
 £1546, and the probable amount of ordinary expenses £1767.

    " On the Nerves of the Gravid Uterus."      By Robert Lee, M.D.,
F.R.S.
    The author, while dissecting a gravid uterus of seven months, on
the 8th of April, 1838, observed the trunk of a large nerve proceed
ing upwards from the cervix to the body of that organ along with
the right uterine vein, and sending off branches to the posterior sur
face of the uterus ; some of which accompanied the vein, and others
appeared to be inserted into the peritoneum.        A broad band, re
sembling a plexus of nerves, was seen extending across the posterior
surface of the uterus, and covering the nerve about midway from
the fundus to the cervix. On the left side, a large plexus of nerves
was seen, surrounding the uterine veins at the place where they were
about to enter the hypogastric vein. From this plexus three large
trunks of nerves were seen accompanying the uterine vein, which
increased in size as they ascended to the fundus uteri.      From the
nerve situated on the posterior surface of the vein, numerous fila
ments passed off towards the mesial line, as on the right side ; some
following the smaller veins on the posterior surface of the uterus,
and others becoming intimately adherent to the peritoneum.         The
largest of the nerves which accompanied the uterine vein was traced
as high as the part where the Fallopian tube enters the uterus ; and
there it divided into numerous filaments, which plunged deep into
the muscular coat of the uterus along with the vein.     A large fasci
culated band, like a plexus of nerves, was also seen on the left side

                                   190
under the peritoneum, crossing the body of the uterus ; and several
branches,    apparently nervous, proceeding from this band, were
distinctly continuous with some of the smaller branches of nerves
accompanying the uterine veins.      The preparation of the parts was
placed in the Museum of St. George's Hospital, on the 1st of Octo
ber, 1838 ; and several anatomists who examined it were of opinion
that they were absorbents accompanying the uterine veins, and ten
dinous fibres spread across the posterior surface.
   Dr. Lee availed himself of another opportunity which presented
itself, on the 18th of December of the same year, of examining a
gravid uterus in the sixth month of pregnancy, which had the
spermatic, hypogastric and sacral nerves remaining connected with
it ; and during the last ten months, he has been diligently occupied
in tracing the nerves of this uterus.    He believes that he has ascer
tained that the principal trunks of the hypogastric nerves accompany,
not the arteries of the uterus, as all anatomists have represented,
but the veins ; that these nerves become greatly enlarged during
pregnancy ; and that their branches are actually incorporated, or
coalesce with the branches of the four great fasciculated bands on
the anterior and posterior surface of the uterus, bearing a striking
resemblance to ganglionic plexuses of nerves, and sending nume
rous branches to the muscular coat of the uterus.
    The author gives the following description of the nerves of the
gravid uterus in the sixth month, and of these fasciculated bands as
displayed in the dissection.
    Behind the uterus, the aortic plexus divides into two portions, to
form the right and left hypogastric plexuses.     These plexuses, after
an intimate union with the nerves accompanying the ureters, descend
to the neck of the uterus, upper part of the vagina, and contiguous
parts of the bladder and rectum, where they are joined by branches
from the third and fourth sacral nerves. The left hypogastric plex
us, about two inches below the aortic plexus, sends off a large
branch, which passes on the inside of the ureter to the superior
uterine vein, where it is about to terminate in the hypogastric vein.
Here the nerve suddenly expands, becomes broad and thin, and
passes into a great plexus of nerves, which completely encircles the
vein. This plexus, surrounding the uterine vein, is joined below by
two large branches, which proceed from the hypogastric plexus
nearer the vagina, and lower down, and from which branches pass
on the outside of the ureter. From the upper part of this plexus,
surrounding the uterine vein near its termination, three large trunks
 of nerves proceed upwards with the vein to the superior part of the
uterus, and enlarge as they ascend.      The posterior branch of these
 hypogastric nerves sends off in its course smaller branches, which
 accompany the ramifications of the uterine vein on the posterior
surface of the uterus.    Passing upwards beyond the junction of the
 spermatic  with the uterine vein, and running between the peritoneum
 and the left posterior fasciculated band, it spreads out into a web of
 thin broad branches and slender nervous filaments, some of which
 are inserted into the peritoneum, and others follow the vein to the

                                    191
   fundus uteri, which they completely surround as the vein passes
   down into the muscular coat of the uterus.
      Some of the branches of this nerve, near the fundus uteri, are
   distributed to the muscular coat, but these are small and few in
   number.
      The middle and anterior branches of the hypogastric nerves ad
  here closely to the uterine vein as they ascend, and form around it
  several plexuses, which completely invest the vessel.        From these
  plexuses branches are sent off to the anterior surface of the uterus,
  some of which, in an arborescent form, follow the trunk and
  branches of the uterine artery.        These two hypogastric nerves
  ascend, and closely unite with the left posterior fasciculated band.
      On the left side of the uterus this band arises near the mesial line,
  on the back of the uterus, midway between the fundus and cervix,
  from a mass of fibres, which adhere so firmly both to the peritoneum
  and muscular coat that it is difficult precisely to determine their ar
  rangement.      From these fibres the band proceeds across the uterus,
  in the form of a thin web, to the point where the spermatic vein is
 leaving the uterus.       After closely uniting with the hypogastric
 nerves, this band proceeds outwards to the round ligament, becoming
 less firmly adherent to the peritoneum, where it unites with the left
 anterior band, and spreads out into a great web, under the perito
 neum. The left posterior band is loosely attached, through its whole
 course, to the subjacent muscular coat by soft cellular membrane.
     The spermatic nerves on the left side pass down to the ovarium
 with the spermatic artery, and first give off several branches to the
 corpus fimbriatum.       A few small branches are then sent into the
 outer end of the ovary. The spermatic nerves afterwards leave the
 artery, and proceed with the veins to the uterus, where they firmly
 unite to the outer extremity of the left posterior band ; and after
 the junction of this band with the prolongations of the anterior
 band under the round ligament, numerous small, delicate filaments,
 apparently nervous, are sent to the base of the ovarium.
     On the right side of the uterus, the author finds that the distribu
tion of the hypogastric and spermatic nerves does not essentially
differ from that now described as seen on the left side. The form and
situation of the right posterior band     is,
                                            he states, much more clearly
seen than on the left side, and presents the appearance of       a   white
pearly fasciculated membrane about quarter
                                       a            of an inch in breadth,
proceeding from the mesial line at right angles to the hypogastric
nerves, across the body of the uterus, to the round ligament, where
it   unites with the anterior band.      Numerous branches, strikingly
resembling     the  branches of nerves, are sent off from the upper and
lower edges of this band, and from its posterior surface to the mus
cular coat of the uterus. An extensive and intimate union at various
points is   distinctly perceptible between these branches sent off from
the band and the branches of the hypogastric nerves.           On the an
terior and upper part of the neck of the uterus, there    is
                                                          a     great mass
of reddish-coloured fibres, firmly interlaced together, resembling      a
ganglion of nerves, into which numerous large branches of the hy

                                   192
pogastric nerves on both sides enter, and to which they firmly ad
here. From the upper part of this fibrous substance there passes up,
over the whole anterior surface of the uterus, a thin band of firm
white fasciculated fibres, prolongations of which extend to the
round ligaments, — into which, and into the posterior band, they are
continued by numerous filaments, like those of nerves.         From the
posterior surface of this great band, numerous branches, also appa
rently nervous, can be traced to a considerable depth through the
muscular coat of the uterus.
    The author concludes his paper with the following remark, and a
short historical account of the progress of discovery on the subject
 of the nerves of the uterus : —
   "From the form, colour and general appearance of these fasciculated
 bands, and the resemblance they bear to ganglionic plexuses of nerves,
 and from their branches actually coalescing with the hypogastric and
 spermatic nerves, I was induced to conclude, on first discovering
 them, that they were nervous plexuses, and constituted the special
 nervous system of the uterus. The recent examination, however, of
 the gravid uterus of some of the lower animals, in which I have found
 a structure similar to those bands in large quantity under the peri
 toneum, has left me in considerable doubt as to the nature of these
 bands, and until further investigations have been made, I shall not
 venture to pronounce a positive opinion respecting them."
    The description of the nerves of the uterus contained in Professor
 Tiedemann's splendid work, the author adds, is usually referred to by
 anatomical writers as the most accurate and complete which has
 ever been given. Professor Tiedemann has represented the sperma
 tic nerves as being distributed chiefly to the ovarium ; and the hypo
 gastric as invariably accompanying the trunk and branches of the
 uterine arteries, along the sides of the uterus, — dividing into smaller
 branches, and quickly disappearing in the muscular coat of the ute
 rus.   He has made no mention of the large nervous trunks on both
 sides of the uterus, which accompany the uterine veins ; nor has he
 noticed fasciculated transverse bands on the anterior and posterior
 surfaces of the uterus, connected with the hypogastric and spermatic
 nerves.
    " Observations   made at the Cape of Good Hope, in the year 1838,
 with Bradley's Zenith Sector, for the verification of the amplitude
 of the Abbe de la Caille's Arc of the Meridian ; by order of the
 Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty." By Thomas Maclear,
 Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c. Communicated by Sir John Barrow, Bart.,
  V.P.R.S., &c.
    The author gives an account of the precautions taken in putting
 together the different parts of the zenith sector, which he received
  on the 9th of December, 1837, in erecting it in the central room of
 the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, and in afterwards
 transferring it to the southern station of La Caille, in Cape Town.
  He then proceeds to describe La Caille's observatory, and the par
 ticular circumstances of its locality, with relation to the object in

                                    193
view, namely to determine the influence of Table Mountain on the
direction of the plumb-line.      He next relates his progress to Klyp
Fonteyn,   where he  arrived on the  24th of March, 1838, and describes
the operations resorted to for erecting the sector at that place.
He then enters into the details of observations made at different sta
tions, and especially with comparative observations at the summit
and foot of the mountain of Pequet Berg.           The instrument was
lastly conveyed back to Cape Town, and again examined, and the ob
servations made with it repeated. The reduction of the observations
occupies the remainder of the paper ; and in conclusion, the author
remarks, that although these labours have not altogether cleared up
the anomaly of La Caille's arc, yet they show that great credit is
due to that distinguished astronomer, who with imperfect means,
and at the period in which he lived, arrived at a result, derived
from sixteen stars, almost identical with that from 1139 observations
on forty stars, made with a celebrated and powerful instrument.

    A                             " An account of experiments made
       paper was read, entitled,
with the view of ascertaining the possibility of obtaining a spark
before the circuit of the Voltaic Battery is completed." By J. P.
 Gassiot, Esq.
    The author of this paper adverts to the fact, of a spark invariably
 appearing when the circuit of the Voltaic Battery is completed ; an
 effect which Dr. Faraday has shown can be easily produced, even
 with a single series.    He then refers to the experiments of Mr.
 Children, Sir Humphry Davy, and Professor Daniell, recorded in
 the Philosophical Transactions ; in which experiments, when more
 powerful and extended series were used, the spark was obtained be
 fore contact took place.
    In order to ascertain, not only the fact of a spark being obtained,
 but also the distance through which it may be passed, the author
 had an instrument prepared, which he denominates a Micrometer
 Electrometer, and by which an appreciable space of one five-thou
 sandth of an inch could be measured with great accuracy.         He de
 scribes this instrument ; and relates several experiments which he
 made with a view to test the correctness of its action.         He first
 prepared 160, and then 320 series of the constant battery, in half-
 pint porcelain cells, excited with solutions of sulphate of copper and
 muriate of soda; but although the effects, after the contact had
 been completed, were exceedingly brilliant, not the slightest spark
  could be obtained. He was equally unsuccessful with a water bat
 tery of 150 series, each series being placed in a quart glass vessel ;

                                   194.
 and also with a water battery belonging to Professor Daniell, con
 sisting of 1020 series ; but when a Leyden battery of nine jars was
 introduced into the circuit of the latter, sparks passed to the extent,
 in one instance, of six five-thousandths of an inch.
     The author mentions his having been present at the experiment
 of Professor Daniell, on the 16th of February, 1839, when that gen
 tleman had 70 series of his large constant battery in action ; and
 having been witness of the powerful effects obtained by this appa
 ratus, he was induced to prepare 100 series of precisely the same
 dimensions, and similarly excited : but although this powerful appa
 ratus was used under every advantage, and the other effects pro
 duced were in every respect in accordance with the extent of the
 elements employed, still no spark could be obtained until the circuit
 was completed ; even a single fold of a silk handkerchief, or a piece
 of dry tissue paper, was sufficient to insulate the power of a battery,
which, after the circuit had been once completed, fused titanium,
and heated 1 6 feet 4 inches of No. 20 platinum wire.
     The author then describes a series of experiments made with in
duced currents. Twelve hundred and twenty iron wires, each insu
lated by resin, were bent into the form of a horse-shoe.      A primary
wire of 115 feet and a secondary of 2268 feet, were wound round
the iron wires.    With this arrangement he obtained a direct spark
 (through the secondary current), sufficient to pierce paper, to charge
a Leyden jar, &c.       Several forms of apparatus employed by the
author are next described, and also a series of 10,000 of Jacubone's
piles. With this arrangement he charged a Leyden battery to a
considerable degree of intensity, and obtained direct sparks of three-
fiftieths of an inch in length. He ultimately succeeded in obtaining
chemical decompositions of a solution of iodine and potassium,
the iodine appearing at the end composed of the black oxide of
manganese.
     The Society then adjourned over the         Christmas Vacation,  to

  Single Achromatic Eye-Pieces, and their superiority to the double
  eye-piece of Huyghens."       By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.
     The author observes, that experience has shown it to be impracti
  cable to make a telescope even approach to achromatism, by employ
 ing the same object-glass with an astronomical, as with a terrestrial
 eye-piece : for if the focus of the blue rays from the object-glass be
 thrown forwards, as it must be in order to make it impinge upon
 the focus of the blue rays of the terrestrial eye-glass, then there will
 be produced a great over-correction for the astronomical eye-glass ;
 and vice versa.   Hence it appears that the application of Huyghen-
 ian eye-pieces to refracting telescopes, is incompatible with the
 conditions of achromatism, throughout the entire range of magni
 fying power ; and that in reflecting telescopes they unavoidably in
 troduce dispersion, because they are not in themselves achromatic.
 These defects the author proposes wholly to obviate, by substituting
 for the Huyghenian eye-pieces, single achromatic lenses of corre
 sponding magnifying power; consisting of the well-known combina
 tion of the crown-lens, and its correcting flint-lens, having their ad
jacent surfaces cemented together ; thus avoiding internal reflections,
 and enabling them to act as a single lens. The achromatic eye-pieces
 which he uses were made by Messrs. Tulley and Ross, and are of
 the description usually termed single cemented triples.

V.P. and Treasurer R.S."          Communicated by J. W. Lubbock,
Esq.
   The effect produced by the late Signor Nobili, of inducing
colours on a steel plate, excited the curiosity of the author, and led
him to the invention of the following method of producing similar
effects.   Two of Professor Daniell's large constant cells were exci-

                                          196
  ted with the usual solutions of sulphate of copper and sulphuric acid.
  A highly-polished steel plate was placed in a porcelain soup-plate,
  and a filtered solution of acetate of lead poured upon it.     A piece
  of card-board, out of which the required figures had been previously
  cut with a sharp knife, was then placed upon a steel-plate.      Over
 the card, and resting on         it,
                                there was fixed  ring of wood, a quarter
                                                        a
  of an inch thick, and the inner circumference of which was of the
 same size as the figure.          convex copper-plate was made so that
                                    A
 its outer edge might rest on the inner part of the wooden ring and            ;
 its centre placed near, but not in actual contact with the card-board.
 Connexion was then made by the positive electrode of the battery
 with the steel-plate   ; the negative being placed in the centre of the
 copper   convex   plate.    The figure was generally obtained in from
 15 to 35 seconds.       If  concave, instead of
                             a                     convex plate be used,
                                                            a
 the same colours are obtained as in the former experiment, but in
 an inverse order.

  Adventitious Bone."       By Alfred Smee, Esq., communicated by P.
  M. Roget, M.D. Sec. R.S.
     On examining, by means of a microscope, very thin sections of
  bone, prepared in a peculiar manner, the author observed a number
  of small, irregularly-shaped, oblong corpuscles, arranged in circular
  layers round the canals of Havers, and also rows of similar bodies
  distributed around both the external and the internal margins of the
  bone.    Each corpuscle is connected by numerous filaments, passing
  in all directions with the Haversian canals and the margins of the
  bone, and also with the adjacent corpuscles.          He finds that the ca
  nals of Havers are vascular tubes containing blood.          The corpuscles
  themselves are hollow, and their cavities occasionally communicate
 with those of the canals ; their length is equal to about two or three
  diameters of the globules of the blood.        They exist in cartilaginous
  as well as osseous structures, and are found in every instance of ad
 ventitious bone, such as callus after fracture, morbid ossific growths
 either from bone or from other tissues ; and the author has also as
 certained their presence in the bony and cartilaginous structures of
 inferior animals, such as birds and fishes.         Measurements relating
 to  these  corpuscles, by   Mr.   Bowerbank,    are  subjoined, from which
 it appears that their diameters vary from about the 10,000th to the
 4000th, and their lengths from the 2300th to the 1400th part of an
 inch.

two Eyes." By T. Wharton Jones, Esq.              Communicated by Ri
chard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author animadverts on the doctrine which Mr. Wheatstone,
in his paper on the Physiology of Binocular vision, published in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1838, p. 371, has advanced, in oppo
sition to the received theory of single vision being dependent on the
images of objects falling on corresponding points of the two retinae.
He maintains that, under these circumstances, the two impressions
are not perceived by the mind at the same instant of time, but some
times the one and sometimes the other.        If one impression be much
stronger than the other, the former predominates over, or even ex
cludes the other ; but still the appearance resulting from the predo
minating image is nevertheless in some manner influenced by that
which is not perceived.     He supposes that there are compartments
of the two retinae, having certain limits, of which any one point or
papilla of the one corresponds with any one point of the other, so
that impressions on them are not perceived separately ; and consi
ders that this hypothesis, combined with the principle above stated,
is required, in order to explain the phenomena in question.

of certain species of the Genus Cervus."            By George Gulliver,
Esq., F.R.S., Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Regiment of Horse
Guards.
   The author has found that the blood of the Muntjac*, the Por
cine f, and the Mexican Deer J, contains, together with corpuscles
of the ordinary circular form, a still larger number of particles of
less regular shape ; some curved and gibbous in the middle, and
acutely pointed at the ends, with a concave and convex margin, like
a crescent ; others approaching more nearly to segments of a circle ;
some shaped like a comma, being obtuse at one end and terminated
by a pointed curve at the other ; others having an acute projection of
the convex part, so as to constitute a triangular, or even quadrangular
outline ; some having the figure of the head of a lance ; while a few
presented a double or sigmoid flexure, as if they had been twisted
half round at the middle. Like the ordinary blood-discs, these pe
culiar corpuscles are deprived of their colouring matter by water ;
but with only a small quantity of water they quickly swell out, and

  rather smaller, but preserve their figure tolerably well.
     In an appendix, the author gives an account of his observations of
 the blood-corpuscles of a new species of Deer inhabiting the mount
 ains of Persia, of which a specimen has been lately received by
 the Zoological Society.      Many of these corpuscles presented the

    The reading of a paper, entitled " Experimental Researches in

 F.R.S., &c, was resumed and concluded. On the source of power
in the Voltaic pile.
    The determination of the real source of electrical power in gal
vanic combinations has become, in the present state of our know
ledge of electricity, a question of considerable importance, and one
which must have great influence on the future progress of that
science.    The various opinions which have been entertained by phi
losophers on this subject may be classed generally under two heads ;
namely, those which assign as the origin of voltaic power the simple
contact of dissimilar substances, and more especially of different
metals ; and secondly, those which ascribe this force to the exertion
of chemical affinities. The first, or the theory of contact, was devised
by Volta, the great discoverer of the Voltaic pile ; and adopted,
since it was promulgated by him, by a host of subsequent philoso
phers, among the most celebrated of whom may be ranked Pfaff,
Marianini, Fichner, Zamboni, Matteucci, Karsten, Bruchardat, and
also Davy ; all of them bright stars in the exalted galaxy of science.

The theory of chemical action was first advanced by Fabroni, Wol-
laston, and Parret ; and has been since farther developed by Oersted,
Becquerel, De la Rive, Ritchie, Pouillet, Schonbein, and others.
The author of the present paper, having examined this question by
the evidence afforded by the results of definite electro-chemical
action, soon acquired the conviction of the truth of the latter of
these theories, and has expressed this opinion in his paper, pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1 834.
     The author, after stating the fundamental doctrine laid down by
 Volta, proceeds to give an account of various modifications in the
 theory introduced by subsequent philosophers ; and also of different
 variations in the views of those who, in the main, have adopted the
 chemical theory. Being desirous of collecting further and more
 decisive evidences on this important subject, he engaged in the series
 of experimental researches which are detailed in the present
 memoir.
     It is assumed, he observes, by the advocates of the contact theory,
 that although the metals exert powerful electromotive forces at their
 points of mutual contact, yet in every complete metallic circuit,
 whatever be the order or arrangement of the metals which compose
it,   these forces are so exactly balanced as to prevent the existence
  of any current but that, on the other hand, fluid conductors, or
                  ;
  electrolytes, either exert no electromotive force at their place of
  contact with the metals, or,     if they do exert such power, the forces
                                                         a
  called into play in the complete circuit are not subject to the same
  law of compensation as obtains with circuits wholly composed of
  metallic bodies.      The author successfully combats this doctrine, by
  bringing forward a great number of instances, where certain fluids,
  which have no chemical action on the metals with which they were
  associated in the circuit, are in themselves such good conductors of
  electricity, as to render evident any current which could have
  arisen from the contact of the metals, either with each other or with
  the fluid the evidence of their possessing this conducting power
          ;
  being their capability of transmitting      a  feeble thermo-electric cur
   rent from  a  pair of plates of antimony and bismuth. The following
   he found to be fluids possessing this property in a high degree            ;
   namely,a    solution of sulphuret of potassium, yellow anhydrous ni
   trous acid mixed with nearly an equal volume of water, very strong
   red nitric acid, and a mixture of one volume of strong acid with two
   volumes of water. By employing the solution of sulphuret of po
   tassium as an electrolyte of good conducting power, but chemically
   inactive with reference to either iron or potassium and associating
                                                           ;
it    with these metals in     a  circuit, formed by two test-glasses con
   taining  the  solution, into  one  of which was immersed    a   plate of pla-
   tina anda    plate of iron,  and  in the other  two  plates of platina;  and
   the circuit being completed by wires of the same metals respectively,
  joining the iron-plate in the first glass with one of the platina-plates
   in the second, while the other two platina-plates were united by
   platina wires, interrupted at one part by       a   short iron wire which
  joined their ends — was found by the test of an interposed galva
                      ;   it

                                    202
 nometer, that, as no chemical action took place, so no electric cur
 rent was produced ; yet the apparatus thus arranged could transmit
a very feeble thermo-electric current, excited by slightly raising the
 temperature of the wires at either of their points of contact. Hence,
the inference may be drawn, that the contact of iron and platinum
is of itself productive of no electromotive force. On the other hand,
the author shows, that the interposition in the circuit of the smallest
 quantity of an electrolyte, which acts chemically on either of the metals,
the arrangement remaining in all other respects the same, is imme
diately attended with the circulation of an electrical current far more
powerful than the thermo-electric current above-mentioned.         A great
number of combinations of other metals were successively tried in
various ways, and they uniformly gave the same results as that of
iron and platina. Similar experiments were then made with various
metallic compounds, and also with other chemical agents ; and in all
cases the same general fact was observed ; namely, that when no
chemical action took place, no electrical current was excited ; thus
furnishing, in the opinion of the author, unanswerable arguments
against the truth of the theory of contact.      The only way in which
it is possible to explain these phenomena on that theory, would be
by assuming, that the same law of compensation as to electro-motive
power is observed by the sulphuret of potassium, and the other fluids
of corresponding properties, as obtains in the case of the metals, al
though that law does not apply to the generality of chemical agents ;
and in like manner, different assumptions must be made in order to
suit the result in each particular combination, and this without any
definite relation to the chemical character of the substances them
selves ; assumptions, which no ingenuity could ever render consistent
with one another. At the conclusion of the paper, the author de
scribes some remarkable alternations in the phenomena which occur,
when pieces of copper and silver, or two pieces of copper, or two of
silver, form a circle with the yellow sulphuretted solution; and
which lead to the same conclusion as the former experiments.             If
the metals be copper and silver, the copper is at first positive, and
the silver remains untarnished ; in a short time the action ceases,
and the silver becomes positive, at the same time combining with
sulphur, and becoming coated with sulphuret of silver ; in the course
of a few minutes, the copper again becomes positive ; and thus the
action changes from one side to the other in succession, and is ac
companied by a corresponding alternation of the electric current.

person, and to offer most humbly to Your Majesty our sincere and
heartfelt congratulations on the present joyful occasion of the mar
riage of Your Majesty with His Royal Highness Prince Albert of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; an event, which, in unison with all loyal
subjects throughout Your Majesty's dominions, we cordially hail as
the auspicious omen of lasting happiness to Your Majesty, and of
permanent blessings to the British Empire.             We venture to hope,
that, amidst the universal felicitations of a free, affectionate, and
grateful people, Your Majesty will condescend favourably to receive
this tribute of the deep respect and devoted attachment of the Mem

                                     204
  nearly two centuries, has exerted itself to extend the boundaries of
  scientific knowledge, and of those arts which augment the power and
  ameliorate the condition of the human race ; objects to which Your
 Majesty, following the steps of Your Illustrious Predecessors, has
 already been graciously pleased to extend Your Royal patronage
 and encouragement.

                     Majesty's reign may
 and that it may be especially distinguished in the annals of history
 as the pacific era in which the greatest advances were made in
 Science, Literature, and the useful Arts, and in which the deep
 foundations of prosperity to this great empire, and of improvement
 in the condition of mankind, were consolidated, is the      earnest wish
 and fervent prayer of the President, Council,        and Fellows   of the

                                          " On  the Chemical Action of
 the Rays of the Solar Spectrum on Preparations of Silver and other
  Substances,   both metallic and non-metallic ; and on some Photo
  graphic Processes;" by Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., V.P.R.S.,
  &c, was resumed and concluded.
     The object which the author has in view in this memoir is to place

                                    206
   on record a number of insulated facts and observations      respecting
   the relations both of white light, and of the differently refrangible
  rays, to various chemical agents which have offered themselves to his
   notice in the course of his photographic experiments, suggested by
   the announcement of M. Daguerre's discovery. After recapitulating
   the heads of his paper on this subject, which was read to the Society
   on the 14th of March, 1839, he remarks, that one of the most im
  portant branches of the inquiry, in point of practical utility, is into
  the best means of obtaining the exact reproduction of indefinitely
  multiplied facsimiles of an original photograph, by which alone the
  publication of originals may be accomplished ; and for which purpose
  the use of paper, or other similar materials, appears to be essentially
  requisite. In order to avoid circumlocution, the author employs the
  terms positive and negative to express, respectively, pictures in which
  the lights and shades are the same as in nature, or as in the original
  model, and in which they are the opposite ; that is, light represent
  ing shade ; and shade, light.   The terms direct and reverse are also
  used to express pictures in which objects appear, as regards right
  and left, the same as in the original, and the contrary.     In respect
  to photographic publication, the employment of a camera picture
  avoids the difficulty of a double transfer, which has been found to
  be a great obstacle to success in the photographic copying of en
  gravings or drawings.
     The principal objects of inquiry to which the author has directed
 his attention in the present paper, are the following. First, the means
 of fixing photographs ; the comparative merits of different chemical
 agents for effecting which, such as hyposulphite of soda, hydriodite
 of potash, ferrocyanate of potash, &c, he discusses at some length ;
 and he notices some remarkable properties, in this respect, of a pe
 culiar agent which he has discovered.
     2. The means of taking photographic copies and transfers.       The
 author lays great stress on the necessity, for this purpose, of pre
 serving, during the operation, the closest contact of the photogra
 phic paper used with the original to be copied.
     3. The preparation of photographic paper.      Various experiments
 are detailed, made with the view of discovering modes of increasing
 the sensitiveness of the paper to the action of light ; and particularly
 of those combinations of chemical substances which, applied either
 in succession or in combination, prepare it for that action. The ope
 ration of the oxide of lead in its saline combinations as a mordent
 is studied ; and the influence which the particular kind of paper
 used has on the result, is also examined, and various practical rules
 are deduced from these experiments.     The author describes a method
 of precipitating on glass a coating possessing photographic proper
 ties, and thereby of accomplishing a new and curious extension of the
art of photography. He observes, that this method of coating glass
with films of precipitated argentine, or other compounds, affords
the only effectual means of studying their habitudes on exposure to
light, and of estimating their degree of sensibility, and other parti
culars of their deportment under the influence of reagents.        After

                                    207
 stating the result of his trials with the iodide, chloride, and bromide
of silver, he suggests that trials should be made with the fluoride,
from which, if it be found to be decomposed by light, the corrosion
 of the glass, and consequently an etching, might possibly be ob
tained, by the liberation of fluorine.
    As it is known that light reduces the salts of gold and of platinum,
as well as those of silver, the author was induced to make many ex
periments on the chlorides of these metals, in reference to the ob
jects of photography ; the details of which experiments are given.
A remarkable property of hydriodic salts, applied, under certain cir
 cumstances, to exalt the deoxidating action of light, and even to
 call into evidence that action, when it did not before exist, or else
was masked, is then described.
    4. The chemical analysis of the solar spectrum forms the subject
of the next section of his paper.     It has long been known that rays
of different colours and refrangibilities exert very different degrees
of energy in effecting chemical changes ; and that those occupying the
violet end of the spectrum possess the greatest deoxidating powers.
But the author finds that these chemical energies are distributed
throughout the whole of the spectrum ; that they are not a mere
function of the refrangibility, but stand in relation to physical quali
ties of another kind, both of the ray and of the analysing medium ;
and that this relation is by no means the same as the one which de
termines the absorptive action of the medium on the colorific rays.
His experiments also show that there is a third set of relations con
cerned in this action, and most materially influencing both the amount
and the character of the chemical action on each point of the spec
trum ; namely, those depending on the physical qualities of the sub
stance on which the rays are received, and whose changes indicate
and measure their action.
    The author endeavoured to detect the existence of inactive spaces
in the chemical spectrum, analogous to the dark lines in the lumi
nous one ; but without any marked success. The attempt, however,
revealed several curious facts. The maximum of action on the most
 ordinary description of photographic paper, namely, that prepared
with common salt, was found to be, not beyond the violet, but about
the confines of the blue and green, near the situation of the ray F in
 Fraunhofer's scale : and the visible termination of the violet rays
nearly bisected the photographic image impressed on the paper : in
the visible violet rays there occurred a sort of minimum of action,
 about one-third of the distance from Fraunhofer's ray H, towards G :
 the whole of the red, up to about Fraunhofer's line C appears to be
 inactive ; and lastly, the orange-red rays communicate to the paper
 a brick-red tint passing into green and dark blue.        Hence are de
 duced, first, the absolute necessity of perfect achromaticity in the
 object-glass of a photographic camera ; and secondly, the possibility
 of the future production of naturally coloured photographs.
    5. The extension of the visible prismatic spectrum beyond the
 space ordinarily assigned to it, is stated as one of the results of these
 researches ; the author having discovered that beyond the extreme.

                                   208
violet rays there exist luminous rays affecting the eyes with a sen
sation, not of violet, or of any other of the recognised prismatic hues,
but of a colour which may be called lavender-grey,        and exerting a
powerful deoxidating action.
    6. Chemical properties of the red end of the spectrum. The rays
occupying this part of the spectrum were found to exert an action of
an opposite nature to that of the blue, violet, and lavender rays.
When the red rays act on prepared paper in conjunction with the
diffused light of the sky, the discolorating influence of the latter is
 suspended, and the paper remains white ; but if the paper has been
already discoloured by ordinary light, the red rays change its actual
 colour to a bright red.
     7. The combined action of rays of different degrees of refrangibi-
 lity is next investigated ; and the author inquires more particularly
 into the effects of the combined action of a red ray with any other
 single ray in the spectrum ; whether any, and what differences exist
 between the joint, and the successive action of rays of any two dif
 ferent and definite refrangibilities ; and whether this action be ca
 pable, or not, of producing effects, which neither of them, acting alone,
 would be competent to produce. The result was that, although the
 previous action of the less refrangible rays does not appear to mo
  dify the subsequent effects produced by the more refrangible ; yet
  the converse of this proposition does not obtain, and the simultaneous
  action of both produces photographic effects very different from those
  which either of them, acting separately, are capable of producing.
     8. In the next section, the chemical action of the solar spectrum
 is traced much beyond the extreme red rays, and the red rays them
  selves are shown to exercise, under certain circumstances, a black
 ening or deoxidating power.
     9 . The author then enters into a speculation suggested by some in
  dications which seem to have been afforded of an absorptive action
  in the sun's atmosphere ; of a difference in the chemical agencies
  of those rays which issue from the central parts of his disc, and those
  which, emanating from its borders, have undergone the absorptive
  action of a much greater depth of his atmosphere ; and consequently
  of the existence of an absorptive solar atmosphere extending beyond
 the luminous one.
     10. An account is next given of the effect of the spectrum on cer
  tain vegetable colours, as determined by a series of experiments,
  which the author has commenced, but in which the unfavourable
  state of the weather has, as yet, prevented him from making much
 progress.
     1 1 . The whitening power of the several rays of the spectrum under
  the influence of hydriodic salts, on paper variously prepared and
  previously darkened by the action of solar light. The singular pro
  perty belonging to the hydriodate of potash of rendering darkened
  photographic paper susceptible of being whitened by further expo
  sure to light is here analysed, and shown to afford a series of new
  relations among the different parts of the spectrum, with respect to
 their chemical actions.

                                     209
     12. The Analysis of the Chemical Rays of the Spectrum by ab
 sorbent media, which forms the subject of the next section, opens a
 singularly wide field of inquiry ; and the author describes a variety
 of remarkable phenomena which have presented themselves in the
 course of his experiments on this subject. They prove that the pho
 tographic properties of coloured media do not conform to their co
 lorific character ; the laws of their absorptive action as exerted on the
 chemical, being different and independent of those on the luminous
 rays : instances are given of the absence of any darkening effect in
 green and other rays of the more refrangible kind, which yet produce
 considerable illumination on the paper that receives them.
     13. The exalting and depressing power exercised by certain media,
 under peculiar circumstances of solar light, on the intensity of its che
mical action. This branch of the inquiry was suggested by the fact,
noticed by the author in his former communication, that the dark
 ening power of the solar rays was considerably increased by the in
terposition of a plate of glass in close contact with the photographic
paper. The influence of various other media, superposed on pre
pared paper, was ascertained by experiment, and the results are re
corded in a tabular form.
    14. The paper concludes with the description of an Actinograph,
 or self-registering Photometer for meteorological purposes : its ob
jects being to obtain a permanent and self-comparable register and
measure, first, of the momentary amount of general illumination in
 the visible hemisphere, which constitutes day-light ; and secondly,
 of the intensity, duration, and interruption of actual sunshine, or,
 when the sun is not visible, of that point in the clouded sky behind
which the sun is situated.
    In a postscript, dated March 3rd, 1 840, the author states that he
 has discovered a process by which the calorific rays in the solar spec
 trum are made to affect a surface properly prepared for that pur
pose, so as to form what may be called a thermograph of the spec
trum ; in which the intensity of the thermic ray of any given refran-
gibility is indicated by the degree of whiteness produced on a black
ground, by the action of the ray at the points where it is received
 at that surface, the most remarkable result of which is the insula
tion of heat-spots or thermic images of the sun quite apart from the
great body of the thermic spectrum.         Thus the whole extent over
which prismatic dispersion scatters the sun's rays, including the
calorific effect of the least, and the chemical agency of the most re
frangible, is considerably more than twice as great as the Newtonian
coloured spectrum.
    In a second note, communicated March 12, 1840, the author de
scribes his process for rendering visible the thermic spectrum, which
 consists in smoking one side of very thin white paper till it is com
pletely blackened, exposing the white surface to the spectrum and
washing it over with alcohol. The thermic rays, by drying the
points on which they impinge more rapidly than the rest of the sur
face, trace out their extent and the law of their distribution by a
whiteness so induced on the general blackness which the whole sur

                                     210
  face   acquires by the absorption of the liquid into the pores of the
  paper.    He also explains a method by which the impression thus
  made, and which is only transient, can be rendered permanent.
      This method of observation is then applied to the further exa
  mination of various points connected with the distribution of the
  thermic rays, the transcalescence of particular media, the polari
  zation of radiant heat (which is easily rendered sensible by this me
  thod), &c. The reality of more or less insulated spots of heat dis
  tributed at very nearly equal intervals along the axis of the spec
  trum (and of which the origin is probably to be sought in the flint
  glass prism used — but possibly in atmospheric absorption) is esta
  blished. Of these spots, two of an oval form, are situated, the one
  nearly at, and the other some distance beyond the extreme red end
  of the spectrum, and are less distinctly insulated ; two, perfectly
 round and well-insulated, at greater distances in the same direction;
  and one, very feeble and less satisfactorily made out, at no less a
 distance beyond the extreme red than 422 parts of a scale in which
 the whole extent of the Newtonian coloured spectrum occupies 539.

    This communication, which is supplementary to the one already
made to the Society by Mr. Maclear, contains reports, supported by
affidavits, of the circumstances attending the fall of a meteoric mass
in a valley near the Cape of Good Hope. The attention of the wit
nesses had been excited by a loud explosion which took place in
the air, previous to the descent of the aerolite, and which was at
tended by a blue stream of smoke, extending from north to west.
Some of the fragments which had been seen to fall, and which had
penetrated into the earth, were picked up by the witnesses.         One
of them falling on grass caused it to smoke ; and was too hot to ad
mit of being touched.      The mass which was sent to England by
H.M.S. Scout, weighed, when first picked up, four pounds. The
paper is accompanied by a map of the district, showing the course

     The author gives citations from several chronicles of the middle
 ages, descriptive of the remarkable appearance of shooting stars which
 occurred on the 4th of April, 1095, on the testimony of independent
 witnesses both in France and England. One of them describes them
 as " falling like a shower of rain from heaven upon the earth :" and in
 another case, a bystander, having noted the spot where the aerolite
 fell, " cast water upon it, which was raised in steam, with a great
 noise of boiling."    The Chronicle of Rheims describes the appear
 ance as if all the stars in heaven were driven, like dust, before the
 wind.     A distinct account of the shooting stars of July 26th, 1293,
 is given by Matthew Paris.

    A  paper was read, entitled " On certain variations of the mean
 height of the Barometer, mean temperature and depth of Rain, con
 nected with the Lunar Phases, in the cycle of years from 1815 to
 1823." By Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S.
    The table given in this paper contains the results of calculations
relating to the objects specified in the title ; cast into periods of six,
seven, or eight days, so as to bring the day of the lunar phase be
longing to it in the middle of the time. The observations were all
made in the neighbourhood of London. It appears from them that in
the period of the last quarter of the moon the barometer is highest,
the temperature a little above the mean, and the depth of rain the
smallest.     In the period of the new moon, both the barometer and
temperature are considerably depressed, and the rain increased in
quantity.      The influence of the first quarter shows itself by the
further depression of the barometer ; but the temperature rises
almost to the point from which it had fallen, and the rain still in
creases, but not in an equal ratio.      Lastly, the full moon again re
duces the temperature ; while the barometer attains its maximum
mean height, and the quantity of rain is the greatest.         Thus it ap
pears, that during this lunar cycle, the approach of the last quarter
is the signal for the clearing up of the air, and the return of sun
shine.

bands formed in the solar spectrum from partial interception by
transparent plates."     By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Sa-
vilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
    This paper contains the mathematical investigation of the pheno
mena of peculiar dark bands crossing the prismatic spectrum, when
half the pupil of the eye, looking through the prism, is covered by
a thin plate of any transparent substance, the edge being turned
from the violet towards the red end of the spectrum ; and which

were first noticed by Mr. Fox Talbot, and were ascribed by Sir Da
vid Brewster to a new property of light, consisting of a peculiar kind
of polarity.
    The author shows, that on the undulatory theory, in all cases, a
difference of retardation between the two halves of each primary
pencil throughout the spectrum may give bands within certain
limits ; and that it affords a complete explanation of the phenomena
in question.

   The MARQUIS of NORTHAMPTON, President, in the Chair.
    A  paper was read, entitled
                                 " Contributions to Terrestrial Mag
 netism."    By Major Edward Sabine, R.A., V.P.R.S.
    An increased activity has recently been given to researches in
terrestrial magnetism, with the definite object of obtaining correct
maps of the magnetic phenomena,         corresponding to the present
epoch, over the whole surface of the globe. To aid these researches,
and to facilitate the comparison of the general theory of M. Gauss
with the facts of observation, maps have been constructed of the
 magnetical lines, both as computed by the theory, and as derived
from observations already obtained. The theoretical and actual lines
 of the declination and intensity have thus been represented in maps
 recently published in Germany and England, as have also the lines
 of the inclination computed by theory ; but the corresponding map
 or the latter element derived from observations is yet wanting. The
 object of the present communication is to supply this desideratum,
 as far as regards the portion of the globe contained between the
parallels of 55° N. and 55° S., and the meridians of 20° E. and 80°
W. ; comprising the Atlantic ocean, and the adjacent coasts of the
continents on either side.
    The observations chiefly employed for this purpose are two series
 made at sea ; one by Mr. Dunlop of the Paramatta observatory, in a
voyage from England to New South Wales, in 1831 ; the other by
Lieut. Sulivan of the Royal Navy, in a voyage from England to the
Falkland Islands, and back, in 1838 and 1839.       The observation of
the magnetic dip at sea, which was commonly practised by the
 distinguished navigators of the last century, was unfortunately not
resumed when the interest in such researches was revived on the re
storation of peace : but it is by such observations only that the lines
of inclination can be independently traced over those large portions
 of the globe which are covered by the ocean.     The difficulties which
 attend the observation, occasioned by the motion and the iron of a
ship, require the adoption of several precautions, which it is particu
larly desirable at this time to make generally known. The series of
 Messrs. Dunlop and Sulivan are discussed in this view ; and the

                                     213
value of results obtained under circumstances of due precaution is
pointed out by their success.
   The position of the lines on the land portion of the map is derived
from 120 determinations in various parts of Europe, Africa, and
America, between the years 1834 and 1839, of which about the
half are now first communicated.
    The series of Messrs. Dunlop and Sulivan contain also observa
tions of the magnetic intensity made at sea ; Mr. Dunlop's by the
method of horizontal vibrations, and Lieut. Sulivan's by the instru
ment and method devised by Mr. Fox.              The degree of precision
which may be obtained by experiments thus conducted, is shown by
the comparison of these observations with each other, and with the
isodynamic lines previously derived from observations             made on
land.
    The first section of this paper concludes with discussions on the
relative positions of the lines of least intensity and of no dip, and
of the secular change which the latter line has undergone in the ten
years preceding 1837.
    In the second section, the observations of Mr. Dunlop are combined
with recent observations on the coasts of Australia, by Captains
Fitz Roy, Bethune, and Wickham, of the Royal Navy, to furnish a
first approximation to the position and direction of the isodynamic
lines over that portion of the Indian ocean which is comprised be
tween the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope and New South
Wales.

 The   MARQUIS of NORTHAMPTON,                   President, in the Chair.
   The reading of       a paper, entitled " Researches      in Electricity,
Seventeenth    Series  :  on the  source  of  power  in the  Voltaic Pile."
By   Michael   Faraday, Esq.,    D.C.L.,   F.R.S., &c,  was   resumed and
concluded.
   In this series, the author continues his experimental investigation
of the origin of electric force in the voltaic pile. Having found
abundant reason, in the experiments already described, to believe
that the electricity of the pile has its origin in the chemical force of
the acting bodies, he proceeds to examine how the circumstances
which can affect the affinity of substances for each other, influence
 their power of roducing electric currents. First, with relation to
heat : — circuits were made of a single metal and a single fluid, and
these were examined with a view to ascertain whether, by applying

                                     214
heat at one of the junctions, only thermo-currents can be produced.
Some peculiar effects of heat are noticed and explained ; and several
very necessary precautions in conducting these experiments are
pointed out ; and it is found, when these are taken, that heat has a
decided and distinct effect over the chemical affinities of the parts
of a circuit subjected to its power, and a corresponding influence
on the electric current produced.        This proceeds to such an extent,
that,  in  some  cases,  either  of two  metals can be made positive or
negative   with respect   to the  other in the same fluid, solely by virtue
of this power of heat.
    The effect of dilution is then examined.      For this purpose, only
one metal and one fluid are used in a circuit ; but the fluid is
rendered more dilute at one point of contact than at the other.
It was ascertained that such dilution produces little or no effect
with metals which are not acted on by the electrolyte employed ;
and the precautions requisite as to other points are then stated.
But when these are observed, still dilution is found to have a most
powerful influence on the results ; and, as the author believes,
solely on account of its influence on the active chemical affinity.
Thus copper in dilute nitric acid is positive with respect to copper
in strong nitric acid ; and the same is the case with lead, silver, and
other metals.     It is not that the piece in the weakest acid is always
positive   with respect to that in the stronger acid ; for, in the first
place,   some  very curious cases are given, in which a piece of metal
in acid of a certain strength is positive with respect to a piece of the
same metal in acid, either stronger or weaker; and, in the next
place, other cases are stated in which the piece in the medium acid
is negative with respect to the other piece in either stronger or
weaker acid. The effect of dilution in nitric acid is such, that when
certain different metals are compared together, either can, at plea
 sure, be made positive or negative with respect to the other ; thus,
 of the five metals, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin, any one of them
 can be made either positive or negative with respect to any other ;
with the sole exception of silver, which is always positive with re
spect to copper.     The inconsistency of these results with any theory
 of contact electromotive force is then strongly insisted on by the
 author.
    The next division of the paper treats of the order of the metallic
elements of voltaic circuits when different electrolytes are used.        It
 is usual to say, that metals are positive or negative with respect to
 each other in a certain order ; but Davy, and afterwards De la Rive,
 showed that, in certain cases, this order is inverted.        The author,
 by using ten metals, and seven different exciting electrolytic solu
 tions, shows that in no two solutions is the order the same ; but that
 changes of the most extreme kind occur in exact conformity with
 the changes in chemical action, which the use of the different
 solutions occasions.
    The next division of the paper considers the very numerous cases
 in which voltaic circuits, often such as are able to effect decompo
sition, are produced without any metallic contact, and by virtue of

                                   215
chemical action alone ; contrasting them with the numerous cases
given in the previous series, where contact without chemical action,
whether it be the contact of metal with metal, or with chemically
inactive electrolytes, can produce no voltaic current.
    The author then considers the sufficiency of chemical action to
account for all the phenomena of the pile. He shows that che
mical action does actually evolve electricity ; that according as
chemical action diminishes or ceases, so the electrical current di
minishes or ceases also ; that where the chemical action changes
from side to side, the direction of the current likewise changes with
it ; that where no chemical action occurs, no current is produced,
but that a current occurs the moment chemical action com
mences ; and that when the chemical action which has, or could
 have produced a current, is, as it were, reversed or undone, the cur
 rent is reversed or undone likewise ; that           is,
                                                      occurs in the oppo
                                                            it
 site direction, in exact correspondence with the direction taken by
 the transferred anions and cathions.         The accordance of the che
 mical theory of excitation with these phenomena             considered by
                                                                 is
 the author as of the strictest kind.
     The phenomena of thermo-electricity are considered by some
 philosophers as affording proofs of the efficacy of mere metallic
 contact in exciting an electric current. The author proceeds, there
 fore, to examine these phenomena in relation to such an action, and
 arrives at the conclusion, that they, in fact, disprove the existence of
 such power. In thermo-electricity, the metals have an order which
      a
is   so different from that belonging to them in any electrolyte, that           it
 appears impossible to consider their succession, in any case, as due
 to any mutual effect of the metals on each other, common to both
 modes of excitation.       Thus, in the thermo-circuit, the electric cur
 rent is,  at the hot place, from silver to antimony, and from bismuth
 to silver  ; but in voltaic series, including dilute sulphuric or nitric
                   a
 acids, or strong nitric acid, or solution of potash, the electric current
is    from silver to both antimony and bismuth                whilst
                                                                 ;        if
                                                                         the
 yellow sulphuret     of  potash  be used,  it   from
                                                 is    both   antimony  and
 bismuth to silver or;    if  the hydro-sulphuret of potash be used,            it   is
  from bismuth to silver, and from silver to antimony and, finally,   ;
if  strong muriatic acid be used, it   isprecisely the reverse, that      is,
                                                                       from
  antimony to silver, and from silver to bismuth. The inconsistency
  of these results with the contact theory           then insisted on and
                                                       is
  farther developed.
      The last section of this series
                                    is   on the improbability of there ex
  isting any such force as the assumed contact force. The author
  contends that it   is  against all natural analogy and probability that
  two particles which, being placed in contact, have by their mutual
  action acquired opposite electrical states, should be able to discharge
  these states one to the other, and yet remain in the same state they
  were in at the first, that is, entirely unchanged in every point by
  what has previously taken place or, that the force which has enabled
                                   ;
  two particles by their mutual action to attain a certain state, should
  not be sufficient to make them keep that state.         To admit such ef

                                      216
fects would be, he thinks, to deny that action and reaction are
equal. The contact theory, according to him, assumes that a force
which is able to overcome powerful resistance, both chemical and
mechanical, can arise out of nothing : that, without any change in
the acting matter, or the consumption of any other force, an electric
current can be produced, which shall go on for ever against a con
stant resistance, or only be stopped, as in the voltaic trough, by the
ruins which its exertion has heaped in its own course ;— this, the
author thinks, would be a creation of power, such as there is no
example of in nature ; and, as there is no difficulty in converting
electrical into mechanical force through the agency of magnetism, it
would, if true, supply us at once with a perpetual motion. Such a
conclusion he considers as a strong and sufficient proof that the
theory of contact is founded in error.
    In a postscript, the author states that he has since found a passage
in Dr. Roget's treatise on Galvanism, in the Library of Useful
Knowledge, published in January 1829, in which the same argu
ment respecting the unphilosophical nature of the contact-theory is
strongly urged*.
   * "  Were any further reasoning necessary to overthrow it, (namely,
the voltaic theory of contact) a forcible argument might be drawn from the
following consideration. If there could exist a power, having the property
ascribed to it by the hypothesis, namely, that of giving continual impulse
to a fluid in one constant direction, without being exhausted by its own
action, it would differ essentially from all the other known powers in na
ture.   All the powers and sources of motion with the operation of which
we are acquainted, when producing their peculiar effects, are expended in
the same proportion as those effects are produced ; and hence arises the
impossibility of obtaining by their agency a perpetual effect, or, in other
words, a perpetual motion. But the electro-motive force ascribed by Volta
to the metals when in contact, is a force which, as long as a free course is
allowed to the electricity it sets in motion, is never expended, and conti
nues to be exerted with undiminished power, in the production of a never-
ceasing effect.   Against the truth of such a supposition the probabilities
are all but infinite."  § 113, p. 32.

    His Grace    the Duke of Richmond and John Gwyn Jefferys, Esq.,
-were  balloted for, and duly elected into the Society.
    The following papers were read, viz.      :
    " Additional     note to the Eleventh Series of Researches on the
Tides." By     the Rev. William Whewell, B.D., F.R.S., &c.
    As an appendix to his former memoir on tide observations, the
author gives in the present paper the results of observations made
at Petropaulofsk, in the bay of Avatcha, in Kamtchatka, lat. 53° 1'
N., long. 15S° 44' E., by the officers and men of the Seuivine,
commanded       by the present Russian Admiral Lutke ; and which
were conducted with great care and perseverance.            The height of
the surface was noted every ten minutes, both day and night, and
when near its maximum every two minutes.
    It appears from these observations that the high water is affected
in its time by a very large diurnal inequality, reaching the enormous
amount of above four hours ; while its height is only slightly
affected by an inequality of that kind ; the greatest alternate ine
qualities of height were something more than a foot. In the low
waters, there appears a much smaller inequality in the times, seldom
amounting to more than one hour ; but with regard to height, the
diurnal inequality is much larger than that for high water, reaching
to three, or even four feet ; and this in a tide of which the whole
rise, from the lowest to the highest, rarely exceeds five feet.        The
theory   of these   phenomena   is then  discussed.
    The results of another series of observations made in July 1827,
at the port of Novo- Arkhangelsk, in the island of Sitkhoe, in Nor
folk Sound (lat. 57° 2' N., long. 135° 18'        W.), are also given, and
their theory considered.

    The reading of a paper, entitled, " On the Nervous System."
 By Sir Charles Bell, F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
    The author adverting to the papers on the nervous system, which
 he presented to the Royal Society nearly twenty years ago, reca
 pitulates the train of reasoning which originally led him to the in
 quiries in which he has been so long engaged, on the different
 functions of different classes of nerves, and adduces various patho
 logical facts in corroboration of the correctness of the views he then
 entertained.    With regard, to the spinal nerves, cases are related
 where, in consequence of disease of the bodies of the vertebrae, the an
 terior columns of the spinal cord, and anterior roots of the nerves
 were affected, and paralysis of the muscles to which those nerves are
 distributed was produced, while the posterior column of the cord was
 uninjured, and the sensibility unimpaired. The author next consi
 ders the respiratory system of nerves, which he regards as being
 both muscular and sensitive, and describes as arising from a tract of
 the spinal cord, on the outside of the corpus olivare, and anterior to
 the processus ad cerebellum ; and which constitute columns having
 no decussations with one another, as is the case with the other
 systems.     The conclusion he originally formed, that both the phre
 nic and the spinal accessory nerves are provided for motion, which
 he had deduced from the anatomical fact of the former taking a di
 rect course to the diaphragm, and the latter a circuitous one for the
 purpose of associating the muscles of the respiratory organs with
 those which act on the chest, is, he thinks, amply confirmed by
 subsequent experiments.      He concludes his paper with some re
 marks on the supply of blood to the respiratory system of nerves,
which supply, being derived from branches of the vertebral arteries,
affords an explanation of several pathological phenomena.
    A paper was also read, entitled,
                                       " On the constitution of the Re
sins.    Part  IV."  By James F. W. Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    This paper contains the account of the continuation of the author's
previous researches into the constitution of the resins, both as they
occur in nature, and as they appear when extracted from the natu
ral products by the agency of alcohol or ether. The great difficulty
in this inquiry is to determine when the resin to be analysed is ob
tained in its normal state ; and the author has endeavoured in each
case to ascertain this point by repeated analyses of the resins pre
pared under different conditions. He thus arrives at the conclusion,
that the resin of scammony extracted from crude scammony by alco
hol, and heated to 260° Fahr., is represented by C40
                                                           H33 O20, con

                                      219
taining the largest amount of oxygen of any resin hitherto ana
lysed. The resin of jalap, obtained by evaporating the alcoholic
extract, and afterwards boiling it in water, is represented by
C40 H34 O18-, and in the amount of oxygen it contains is only
surpassed by the resin of scammony.           It is interesting to remark
that these two resins in their effects on the animal economy are as
nearly related as these formulae show them to be in chemical consti
tution.
    The resin of labdanum, extracted by alcohol from the crude
labdanum and evaporated, gave the formula C4(, H33 O8 ; but this
extract, softened in the air and water, took up from it a bitter sub
stance of a brown colour.         After boiling in water, the pure resin
is represented by C40 H33 O7.
    The Berengela resin, previously analysed by the author before he
was aware of the conditions necessary to be attended to in order to
obtain a resin in its normal state, is expressed by the formula
 C40 H3e 07 ; and the resin of Retin asphalt, also previously analysed
 by the author, by C40 H27 O6.
     The resin of ammonia, extracted by alcohol from the crude gum
resin, is represented by C40 Hi5 O9 ; the resin of opoponax by
C40 Hs5 O14 ; and that of assafoetida by C40 Hs6 O10.
    A striking relation appears between the formulae for the resins of
ammonia and assafoetida, the former being C40 H25 O,,, the latter
C40 H26 O10, as if the latter were merely a hydrate of the former.
The author considers this relation, and concludes that it is only ap
parent, and that probably in neither of the resins does any of the
hydrogen exist in combination with oxygen in the state of water.
     This leads the author to inquire into the general action of a
slightly elevated temperature on the resins, and he concludes that in
all cases when a resin in its normal state is heated a few degrees
above its melting point, it begins to suffer partial decomposition,
accompanied by the solution of water, and always by more or less
of a volatile, generally oily compound, sometimes containing less
and sometimes more oxygen than the resin which has been sub
jected to heat.       In the case of some resins, especially such as
are agreeably fragrant, and are expressed by the second of the
author's general formulae C40 H24 + x O7, benzoic acid is one
 of the products of decomposition at a moderate temperature.
Thus the resin of dragon's blood gives only a trace of benzoic
 acid, with water and a red volatile compound; while the resin
 of benzoin gives much benzoic acid.           Some resins give off vola
 tile matters and diminish in weight long before they reach the
 fusing point ; as is the case with the resin of benzoin, of which
 the melting point is high.         With regard to the special action of
 such temperatures      in altering the atomic constitution of the resins,
 the author finds that each resin undergoes a change, probably pecu
 liar to itself, and probably depending on the nature of the organic
 radical it contains. Thus, the formula for the resin of retin asphalt
 (= C40 H27 O6) by prolonged heating at the melting point becomes
                  Ammonia resin (

                                  2-20
Fahr. approaches to C40 HJ4 0„ ; there being, however, a slight ex
cess of oxygen, and water not being the only volatile compound
driven off.
    The resin of opoponax, when thus heated the hydrogen, as in
that of retin asphalt, remains nearly constant = C40 Ha5 O14, ap
proaching to C40 H25 O12.     The same is the case with the resin of
assafoetida (= C40 Hi6 O10), which by prolonged heating at about
 250° Fahr., becomes C40 Ha6 O,,.      These observations when multi
plied are likely to assist materially in leading to rational formulae,
 expressive of the molecular constitution of the resins.
    In reference to the general questions, with a view to the solution
 of which the author undertook this investigation, he concludes :
     1. That the resins are not to be considered      as different com
 pounds of one and the same radical, but rather as analogous groups
of compounds of analogous radicals.
    2. That as far as our present knowledge extends, all the true re
 sins are capable of being represented by irrational formula?, in which
C40 is a constant quantity.
    3. That the analyses contained in the present paper render ne
 cessary a slight modification in the general formulae previously an
nounced. The formula for the group of which colophony is the
type, being C40 H32 + x Oy ; and that for the group of which gam
boge or dragon's blood is the type, being C40 H24 + x Oy.
    The author announces a further continuation of these researches,
in which the constitution of other resins will be given, and the re
lations of the resins to certain chemical reagents will be explained
and illustrated.
    The Society then adjourned over the Easter Recess, to meet again
on the 30th instant.

  F. W. Herschel, Bart., V.P.R.S.
      The great object aimed at by Captain Kater in the construction of
  the escapement of a chronometer, is to communicate equal impulses

to the pendulum through some principle perfect in itself, and not
dependent for its success on superior execution. In the escapement
invented by him, the pendulum merely raises a weight, and is im
pelled by that weight through an increased space in its descent. It
neither unlocks a detent, nor has anything to do with the train ;
and as the weight raised, and the spaces described, are constant
quantities, this escapement is, in the strict meaning of the term, one
of equal impulse.

   A  paper was read, entitled
                                    " Researches in Embryology, Third
Series : a Contribution to the Physiology of Cells." By Martin
Barry, M.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E., Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians in Edinburgh.
   In the second series of these researches, the author had traced
certain changes in the mammiferous ovum consequent on fecunda
tion. The object of his present communication is to describe their
further appearances obtained by the application of higher magnify
ing powers ; and to make known a remarkable process of develop
ment thus discovered.       In order to obtain more exact results, his
observations were still made on the same animal as before, namely,
the rabbit, in the expectation that, if his labours were success
ful, it would be comparatively easy to trace the changes in
other mammals.        By pursuing the method of obtaining and pre
serving ova from the Fallopian tube which he recommended in his
last paper, he has been enabled to find and examine 137 more of
these delicate objects ; and has thus had ample opportunity of con
firming the principal facts therein stated.       He has now procured in
all 230  ova from   the Fallopian tube.     But being aware that repeated
observations   alone  do not  suffice  in researches  of this nature, unless
extended to the very earliest stages, he again specially directed his
attention to the ovum while it is still within the ovary, with a view
to discover its state at the moment of fecundation, as well as imme
diately before and after that event.
   The almost universal supposition, that the Purkinjian or germinal
vesicle is the essential portion of the ovum, has been realized in
these investigations ; but in a manner not anticipated by any of the
numerous conjectures which have been published. The germinal
vesicle becomes filled with cells, and these again become filled with
the foundations of other cells ; so that the vesicle is thus rendered
almost opake.      The mode in which this change takes place is the

                                      223
following, and it is one which, if confirmed by future observation,
must modify the views recently advanced on the mode of origin, the
nature, the properties, and the destination of the nucleus in the physi
ology of cells. It is known that the germinal spot presents, in some
instances, a dark point in its centre.       The author finds that such a
point   is invariably present   at a certain period ; that it enlarges, and
is then found to contain a cavity filled with fluid, which is exceed
ingly pellucid.     The outer portion of the spot resolves itself into
cells ; and the foundations of other cells come into view in its in
terior, arranged in layers around the central cavity ; the outer layers
being pushed forth by the continual origin of new cells in the in
terior. The latter commence as dark globules in the pellucid fluid of
the central cavity. Every other nucleus met with in these researches
has seemed to be the seat of changes essentially the same.              The
appearance of the central portion of the nucleus is, from the above
process, continually varying ; and the author believes that the
 nature of the nucleolus of Schleiden is to be thus explained. The
 germinal vesicle, enlarged and flattened, becomes filled with the
 objects arising from the changes in its spot ; and the interior of
 each of the objects filling it, into which the eye can penetrate, pre
 sents a repetition of the process above described.            The central
portion of the altered spot, with its pellucid cavity, remains at that
 part of the germinal vesicle which is directed towards the surface
 of the ovum, and towards the surface of the ovary.             At the cor
 responding part,    the  thick  transparent   membrane    of  the ovum in
 some instances appears to have become attenuated, in others also
 cleft. Subsequently, the central portion of the altered spot passes
 to the centre of the germinal vesicle ; the germinal vesicle, regain
 ing its spherical form, returns to the centre of the ovum, and a
 fissure in the thick transparent membrane is no longer seen.          From
 these successive changes it may be inferred that fecundation has
 taken place ; and this by the introduction of some substance into
 the germinal vesicle from the exterior of the ovary.        It may also be
 inferred, that the central portion of the altered germinal spot is the
 point of fecundation.      In further proof that such really is the case,
 there arise at this part two cells, which constitute the foundation
 of the new being. These two cells enlarge, and imbibe the fluid of
 those around them, which are at first pushed further out by the two
 central cells, and subsequently disappear by liquefaction.             The
 contents of the germinal vesicle thus enter into the formation of
 two cells.    The membrane of the germinal vesicle then disappears
 by liquefaction.
     Each of the succeeding twin cells presents a nucleus, which, having
 first passed to the centre of its cell, resolves itself into cells in the
 manner above described.         By this means the twin cells, in their
 turn, become filled with other cells. Only two of these in each
 twin cell being destined to continue, the others, as well as the
 membrane of each parent-cell, disappear by liquefaction, when four
 cells remain. These four produce eight, and so on, until the germ
 consists of a mulberry-like object, the cells of which do not admit

                                        2:24
    of being counted.     Nor does the mode of propagation continue the
    same with reference to number only.         The process inherited from
    the germinal vesicle by its twin offspring, reappears in the progeny
    of these. Every cell, whatever its minuteness, if its interior can
    be discerned, is found filled with the foundations of new cells, into
    which its nucleus has been resolved.       Together with a doubling of
    the number of the cells, there occurs also a diminution of their size.
    The cells are at first elliptical, and become globular.
       The above mode of augmentation, namely the origin of cells in
   cells, appears by no means to be limited to the period in question.
   Thus it is very common to meet with several varieties of epithelium-
   cells in the oviduct, including those which carry cilia, filled with
   cells ; but the whole embryo at a subsequent period is composed
   of cells filled with the foundations of other cells.
       In the second series of these researches, it was shown that the
   mulberry-like object above mentioned, is found to contain a cell
   larger than the rest, elliptical in form, and having in its centre a
   thick-walled hollow sphere, which is the nucleus of this cell. It
  was further shown that this nucleus is the rudimental embryo. From
  what has been just stated, it appears, that the same process, by
  which a nucleus in one instance transforms itself into the embryo,
  is in operation in another instance, where the product does not ex
  tend beyond the interior of a minute and transitory cell.       Making
  allowance, indeed, for a difference in form and size, the description
  given of the one might be applied to the other. It was shown in
 the second series, that in the production of the embryo out of a
  nucleus, layer after layer of cells come into view in the interior,
 while layers previously formed are pushed further out ; each of the
 layers being so distinctly circumscribed as to appear almost mem
 branous at its surface.      The same membranous appearance presents
 itself at the surface of the several layers of a nucleus in many situa
 tions. Farther, in the formation of the embryo, a pellucid centre
 is the point around which new layers of cells continually come into
 view ; a centre corresponding to that giving origin to similar ap
pearances in every nucleus described in the present memoir. It was
shown that in the embryo this mysterious centre is present until it
has assumed the form of the cavity, including the sinus rhomboidalis,
in the central portion of the nervous system.
      The process above described as giving origin to the new being in
the mammiferous ovum, is no doubt universal.            The author thinks
that there is evidence of its occurrence in the ova of batrachian
Reptiles, some osseous Fishes, and certain of the Mollusca ; though
the explanation given of these has been of a very different character.
It has hitherto been usual to regard the round white spot, or cica-
tricula, on the yelk of the bird's laid egg, as an altered state of the
discus vitellinus in the unfecundated ovarian ovum.          So far from
thinking that such is the case, the author believes the whole sub
stance of the cicatricula in the laid egg to have its origin within the
germinal vesicle, in the same manner as in the ovum of Mammalia.
     There is no fixed relation between the degree of development of

                                     225
 ova, and their size, locality, or age.     The variation with regard to
size is referable chiefly to a difference   in the quantity of fluid im>
bibed in different instances by the incipient chorion. Vesicles filled
with transparent fluid are frequently met with in the Fallopian tube,
very much resembling the thick transparent membrane of the ovarian
ovum.     These vesicles are probably unimpregnated ova, in the
course   of  being absorbed.     The so-called " yelk" in the more or
less mature ovarian ovum, consists of nuclei in the transition state
and exhibiting the compound structure above described.         The mass
of these becomes circumscribed by a proper membrane.           They and
their membrane subsequently disappear by liquefaction, and are
succeeded by a new set, arising in the interior, and likewise be
coming circumscribed by a proper membrane, and so on.           This ex
plains  why    some   observers  have  never  seen  a membrane   in this
situation.    After the fecundation of the ovum, the cells of the
tunica granulosa, that is, part of the so-called " disc," are found to
have become club-shaped, greatly elongated, filled in some instances
with cells, and connected with the thick transparent membrane by
their pointed extremities alone.
   That the thin membrane described by the author in his second
series as rising from the thick transparent membrane in the Fallo
pian tube, and imbibing fluid, is really the incipient chorion, was then
shown by tracing it from stage to stage, up to the period when
villi form upon it. There remained, however, two questions unde
cided ; viz., whether the chorion is formed of cells, and if so,
whether the cells are those of the so-called " disc," brought by the
ovum from the ovary.        The author now states that the chorion is
formed of cells, which gradually collect around the thick transparent
membrane, and coalesce ; and that the cells in question are not those
                "
of the " disc brought with the ovum from the ovary. The cells
which give origin to the chorion are intended to be more particularly
described in a future paper.
   The existing view, namely, that a nucleus, when it leaves the
membrane of its cell, simply disappears by liquefaction, is inappli
cable to any nucleus observed in the course of these investigations.
The nucleus resolves itself into incipient cells in the manner above
described.     In tracing this process, it appears that the nucleus, and
especially  its  central pellucid cavity, is the seat of changes which
were not to have been expected from the recently advanced doctrine,
that the disappearing nucleus has performed its entire office by giving
origin at its surface to the membrane of a single cell. It is the
mysterious centre of a nucleus which is the point of fecundation ;
and the place of origin of two cells constituting the foundation of
the new being.        The germinal vesicle, as already stated, is the
parent cell, which, having given origin to two cells, disappears,
each of its successors giving origin to other two, and so on.       Per
petuation, however, at this period, consists, not merely in the origin
of cells in cells, but in the origin of cells in the pellucid central
part of what had been the nucleus of cells.
   The author shows that neither the germinal vesicle, nor the pel

                                    226
lucid object in the epithelium-cell, is a cytoblast. He suggests, that
the cells into which, according to his observations, the nucleus be
comes resolved, may enter into the formation of secondary deposits
— for instance, spiral fibres; and that they may contribute to the thick
ening which takes place, in some instances, in the cell-membrane.
    The germ of certain plants passes through states so much resem
bling those occurring in the germ of mammiferous animals, that it
is not easy to consider them as resulting either from a different
fundamental form, or from a process of development which even in
its details is not the same as what has been above described ; the
fundamental form in question in Mammalia — and therefore it may
be presumed of Man himself — being that which is permanent in the
 simplest plants, — the single isolated cell.
    A  paper   was also read, entitled " On the Odour accompanying
 Electricity, and on the probability of its dependence on the presence
 of a new substance ;" by C. F. Schoenbein, Professor of Chemistry,
 Bale, communicated in a letter to Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L.,
 F.R.S., &c.
    The author's attention having been long directed to the remark
 able fact, that odour, resembling that of phosphorus, is given off
 during the escape of positive electricity from the point of a con
 ductor into air; and is likewise perceptible when lightning has
 struck any object, and also when water is electrolyzed, he has in
 vestigated the circumstances     attending these phenomena ; and the
 results he has obtained will, he expects, afford a clue to the discovery
 of their cause.
    The odour which accompanies the electrolyzation of water, he
 observes, is only disengaged at the positive electrode.     He also finds
 that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in well-closed glass
 bottles for any length of time.      The only metals which yield this
 odour are gold and platina ; but dilute sulphuric, phosphoric, and
 nitric acids, and from aqueous solutions of several of the salts, also
 disengage it.    Raising the temperature of the fluid to the boiling
 point prevents the odour from arising ; and the addition of com
 paratively small quantities of powdered charcoal, iron, zinc, tin, lead,
 antimony, bismuth or arsenic, or of a few drops of mercury, to the
 odorous principle contained in a bottle, immediately destroys the
 smell ; and the same happens when platina or gold, heated red hot,
 is introduced into the vessel containing that volatile substance.

    A  paper was read, entitled,
                                   " Tables of the Variation, through a
 cycle   of nine years,  of the  mean   height of the Barometer, mean
 Temperature,    and  depth  of Rain,  as connected with the prevailing

                                   227
Winds, influenced in their direction by    the occurrence of the Lunar
Apsides, with some concluding       observations on the result."      By
Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    From the Tables here given, the author draws the following con
clusions : —
    1. The barometer   is higher under the lunar apogee, than under
the perigee ; the mean height in the former case being 29'84517,
and in the latter, 29-75542.
    2. The mean temperature is lower under the apogee than under
the perigee; that of the former being 480-7126, and of the latter,
49°0356.      The mean of the whole year was 4S°-7126.
    3. The rain of the weeks following the apsis exceeds that     under
the perigee ; but with two striking exceptions in the annual      result
of nine years, the one in the wettest, and the other in the       driest
year of the cycle.
    With regard to the winds, the author remarks that those         from
the north, north-east, and east, prevailed under the apogee       on 38
days,   under the perigee on 21 days; and those from the south,
south-west, and west, prevailed under the apogee on 20 days,
under the perigee on 38 days.
    It appears, therefore, that in the climate of London, the moon
in her perigee brings over us the southern atmosphere, which
tends to lower the density and raise the temperature         of the air,
occasioning also a larger precipitation of rain.     In the apogee, on
the contrary, there is a freer influx of air from the northward, a
higher barometer, a lower temperature,         and less rain ; subject,
however, to a large addition of rain under this apsis twice in a
cycle of nine years, at the times when also the extremes of wet and
dry take place on the whole amount of the year.
    A paper was   also read entitled,
                                       " Experimental  Researches into
the   strength of Pillars of Cast Iron, and other materials."         By
Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq.        Communicated by Peter Barlow, Esq.,
F.R.S., &c.
    The author finds that in all long pillars of the same dimensions,
 the resistance to crushing by flexure is about three times greater
when the ends of the pillars are flat, than when they are rounded.
 A long uniform cast-iron pillar, with its ends firmly fixed, whether
by means of disks or otherwise, has the same power to resist break
ing as a pillar of the same diameter, and half the length, with the
 ends rounded, or turned so that the force would pass through the axis.
 The strength of a pillar with one end round and the other flat, is
the arithmetical mean between that of a pillar of the same dimen
 sions with both ends round, and one with both ends flat.          Some
 additional strength is given to a pillar by enlarging its diameter in
 the middle part.
    The author next investigated the strength of long cast-iron

                                   228
 pillars with relation to their diameter and length. He concludes
 that the index of the power of the diameter, to which the strength
 is proportional, is 3-736.    He then proceeds to determine, by a
 comparison   of experimental results, the inverse power of the length
to which the strength of the pillar is proportional.      The highest
value of this power is 1-914, the lowest', 1'537, the mean of all the
comparisons, 1-7117. He thus deduces, first, approximate empirical
formulae for the breaking weight of solid pillars, and then proceeds
 to deduce more correct methods of determining their strength.
    Experiments on hollow pillars of cast iron are then described,
and formulae representing the strength of such pillars are deduced
from these experiments.
    After giving some results of experiments still in progress for
determining the power of cast-iron pillars to resist long-continued
pressure, the author proceeds to determine from his experiments
the strength of pillars of wrought iron and timber, as dependent
on their dimensions.     The conclusion for wrought iron is, that the
strength varies inversely as the square of the pillar's length, and
directly as the power 3'75 of its diameter, the latter being nearly
identical with the result obtained for cast iron ; for timber, the
strength varies nearly as the 4th power of the side of the square
forming the section of the pillar.   Experiments for determining the
relation of the strength to the length in pillars of timber, were not
instituted, as, from the great flexure of the material, it was consi
dered that no very satisfactory conclusions on this point could be
derived experimentally.
    In conclusion, the author gives the relative strengths of long
pillars of cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and timber.

    The following  papers were read, viz.  :
    1. " Remarks on  the Meteorological Observations made at Alten,
Finmarken, by Mr. S. H. Thomas in the years 1837, 1838, and
 1839." By Major Sabine, R.A., V.P.R.S., and Lieut .Col. Sykes,
F.R.S. ; being a Report from the Committee of Physics, including
 Meteorology, to the Council, and communicated by the Council to
the Royal Society.
    These observations, made at Alten in lat. 69° 58' 3" N., and
23° 43' 10" east of Paris, would seem to have a claim to the atten
tion of the Royal Society, as they offer the experimentum cruris of
Professor Forbes's empirical formula respecting the gradual diminu
tion of the daily oscillations of the barometer, within certain limit
hours, from the equator to the poles.        Professor Forbes has laid
down an assumed curve, in which the diurnal oscillation amounts
to -1190 at the equator and 0 in lat. 64° 8' N., and beyond that lati
tude the tide should occur with a contrary sign, plus becoming minus.
Now Alten being nearly in lat. 70°, if Professor Forbes's law hold
good, the maxima of the diurnal oscillations should occur at the
hour for the minima at the equator, and a similar inversion should
take place with respect to the minima. Mr. Thomas has himself
however modified the value his observations would otherwise have
had, by adopting 2 p.m., instead of 3 p.m., for the hour of his ob
servations for the fall; and he has adapted his barometrical ob
servations to a mean temperature of 50° Fahr., instead of 32°.
The first year's observations commence on the 1st October, 1837,
and terminate on the 30th September, 1838.        The barometer stood
66 feet 5 inches above low- water mark, and the thermometer hung
at 6 feet above the ground ; but care was not always taken to pre
vent the sun shining on it. The mean height of the barometer
for the year was 29 -771, and the mean of the thermometer al
most coincident with the freezing point, viz., 32o,017.            The

                                         230
_ maximum height of the barometer was 30o,89 in January, and the
  minimum 28°-71 in October.              The mean of the barometer at 9
  a.m. was 29°-764, therm. 33°455 ; at 2 p.m. 29° 765, therm.
  33° 327     ; and at 9 p.m. 29°-784, therm. 29°-270.              The diurnal
  observations would seem to support Professor Forbes's theory ; but
  the 9 p.m. observations are entirely opposed to it, as they appear
  with the same maximum sign as at the equator, whereas the sign
  ought to have been the reverse ; indeed, with respect to the diurnal
  observations, the mean of five months of the year at 9 a.m. gives a
  plus sign, although the mean of the year at 2 p.m. only gives the
  trifling quantity of -001 plus. There is one remarkable feature in
  these observations that cannot fail to strike the meteorologist.            M.
  Arago, from nine years' observations at Paris, reduced to the level
  of the sea, makes the annual mean height 29°-9546 ; twenty-one
  years' observations at Madras make it 290-958 ; and three years'
  observations at Calcutta, by Mr. James Prinsep, make it 29°-764;
  and Mr. Thomas brings out 29°-771. That there should be this
  coincidence between the observations at Calcutta and Alten is
  curious.      Neither Mr. Thomas nor Mr. Prinsep state whether or
  not their means are reduced to the level of the sea. It is to be
  suspected they are not.
      For the next year, that is to say, from Oct. 1838 to Sept. 1839,
  both inclusive, Mr. Thomas uses a French barometer and French
  measurements, with centigrade thermometer attached to the baro
  meter, and Fahrenheit's for the detached thermometer. He changes
  his time of observation from 9 a.m. to 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and 8 p.m.,
  and he reduces his barometrical observations to 0 centigrade.
  The results of the year are as follow : — mean annual pressure
  29°-627 English ; thermometer Fahr. 33°-36 ; greatest pressure
  in April, least in January ! !           The mean of 8 a.m. is 29o-620 ;
  therm. 33°-75.         The mean of 2 p.m. is 29° 631 ; therm. 34°73.
  And at 8 p.m. 29°-631 ; therm. 30°-57.                The diurnal observa
  tions assist to support Professor Forbes's theory ; but as in the pre
  ceding year, the p.m. observation is at fault ; and if the hour had
  been 9 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock, it would probably have been
   more so than it appears.        The low annual mean state of the baro
   meter for the year 1837-38 is even increased in the last year's ob
   servations ; and as fresh instruments* appear to have been used,
   there is ground to believe that the fact is associated with the lo
   cality, and it may be desirable not only to record in the Proceed
   ings of the Royal Society the data already supplied, but to re
   commend to Mr. Thomas more particular inquiry on the subject.
      The phaenomena of the Aurora Borealis appear to have been ob
   served by Mr. Thomas with great assiduity, and recorded with great
   care.     On examining the register, with reference to M. Erman's
   important remark, that " in Siberia two kinds of aurora are distin
   guished, one having its centre in the west, and the other in the east,
   the latter being the more brilliant," it is found that twenty-two
     *  It appears that the barometer was compared before leaving France, and sub
  sequently to its being taken back to that country.

                                       231
. hights occur in the course of the two winters in which the formation
  of arches of the aurora is noticed and their direction recorded ; of
  these, ten are to the west, having their centres rather to the south
  ward of west, the arches extending from N.W. to S.S.E. and
  S.E. ; seven are to the east, or more precisely to the southward of
  east, the arches extending from N.E. to S.E. and S.W.             Of the
  five others, four are said to be from east to west across the zenith,
  and cannot therefore be classed with either of the preceding, and
  one is noticed generally as being to the north.          The facts here
  recorded appear to afford an evidence of the same nature as those
  mentioned by M. Erman, as far as regards there being two centres
  of the phaenomena. In respect to the relative brilliancy of the east
  ern and western aurora, nothing very decided can be inferred from
  the register.      If, as M. Erman supposes, that they may be referred
  respectively    to   " les deux foyers magnutiqucs de l'hemisphere bo
  real," it is proper to notice that the position of Alten is nearly mid
  way between those localities.
       There can be no doubt that the frequent appearance of the
   aurora, and the peculiarities of the phenomena observed there, ren
   der it a most desirable quarter for a magnetical and meteorological
   observatory.

   Frederic Daniell, Esq., For. Sec. R.S., Professor of Chemistry in
   King's College, London.
       The author, in this letter, prosecutes the inquiry he had com
   menced in the former one, into the mode in which the chemical ele
   ments group themselves together to constitute radicles, or proxi
   mate principles.        He considers his experiments as establishing the
   principle that, considered as electrolytes, the inorganic oxy-acid
   salts must be regarded as compounds of metals, or of that extraor
   dinary compound of nitrogen and four equivalents of hydrogen to
   which Berzelius has given the name of ammonium, and compound
   anions, chlorine, iodine, &c, of the Haloide salts ; and as showing
   that this evidence goes far to establish experimentally the hypothe
    sis originally brought forward by Davy, of the general analogy in
   the constitution of all salts, whether derived from oxy-acids or hy
    dro-acids. Some remarks are made on the subject of nomenclature,
    and the rest of the paper is occupied with the details of the experi
    ments, all bearing on the important subject which he has under
    taken to investigate.

     A portion of the blood of the Ornithorhynchus hystrix, mixed
 when fresh with a strong solution of common salt, being examined
 by the author, exhibited a few globules of irregular shape. Another
 portion, preserved in syrup, contained numerous globules, most of
 which had an irregular form, but many were circular ; none, how
 ever, were elliptical, like those of birds.      Hence the author con
 cludes, that in form they accord more with those of Mammalia.

 posed discrepancy between some of them and the atomic weight of
 the same bodies, as deduced from the theory of isomorphism."          By
 Lieut.-Colonel P. Yorke. Communicated by Michael Faraday, Esq.,
 D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
     The author describes various experiments made with a view to
 determine the electro-chemical equivalents of sodium and potassium.
 Three experiments gave, respectively, 22-3, 22-9, and 25, as the
 equivalent of the former ; and two other experiments gave, respec
 tively, 45 and 41-7, as the equivalent of the latter of these sub
 stances.     He then inquires what would be the result of the electro-
 lyzation of the aqueous solutions of soda and potash, on the hypo
 thesis of these bodies being composed of two equivalents, or atoms,
 of metal, and one of oxygen.          To determine this question he em
 ploys a solution of dichloride of copper in muriatic acid, as being a
 substance composed of two atoms of metal and one of an electro
 negative element.      Its electrolysis gave as the equivalent of copper,
  52-8, 59'4, and 61-6, numbers approximating closely to 63-2, or
  double the atomic weight of copper. After a long train of investi
 gation, he concludes that there is no reason deducible from the
 theory of isomorphism for doubting the correctness of the received
  atomic weights of silver, sodium, &c, but that the difficulty, or
 anomaly, if it may be so called, should be considered as attaching
  itself to the di- compounds of copper ; and that Faraday's proposi
  tions on this subject remain unimpeached.

    The inner surfaces of a flue built of siliceous bricks appeared to be
 deeply eroded by the passage over it of steam at a very high tem
 perature, and fragments of siliceous materials laid in the course of
the current were partially consumed.          A siliceous crust was de
posited on several vessels of stone ware, coated with a micaceous
 glaze, placed in the upper part of the furnace, and this crust was
 re-dissolved when the vessels were removed to a hotter situation in
 the same furnace. The author notices the experiments of Dr.
 Turner and others, which failed in showing the solubility of silica
 by steam, in consequence, as he conceives, of the heat having not
 been sufficiently great to effect the solution.

                                   " Contributions to the Chemical Hi
 story of Archil and of Litmus." By Robert Kane, M.D., M.R.I.A.
 Communicated by Francis Baily, Esq., V.P.R.S.
    After a preliminary sketch of the labours of Heeren and of Robi-
 quet in investigating the origin of the beautiful colouring materials
termed Archil and Litmus, obtained from different kinds of colourless
lichens, and their detection of the two proximate principles termed
 erythrine and orceine, the author states the object of the inquiries de
tailed in the present paper to be threefold ; viz. first, to ascertain the
primitive form of the colour-making substance in a given species of
lichen, and trace the stages through which it passes before the co
loured substance is developed ; secondly, to determine the nature of
the various colouring substances which exist in the archil of com
merce ; and thirdly, to examine the colouring materials of ordinary
litmus.     He finds in the lichen Roccella tinctoria the following
bodies, either pre-existing in the plant, or formed during the pro
cesses employed for its analysis : 1. Erythryline ; 2. Erythrine (the
Pseudo-erythrine of Heeren) ; 3. Erythrine bitter; 4. Telerythrine ;
and 5. Roccelline (the Roccellic acid of Heeren).         The properties
and constitution of these substances are then described, and the che
mical formulae given, which are deducible from their respective ana
lyses. The author finds the archil of commerce to consist essen
tially of three ingredients, namely, orceine, erythroleic acid, and
azoery thrine ; of each of the two former there exist two modifications,

                                    234
and there is, in addition, a yellow matter. After comparing his re
sults with those obtained by Heeren, by an examination of the pro
ducts evolved by his erythrine in contact with air and with ammonia,
and stating reasons for some changes in nomenclature, the author
gives the chemical formulae resulting from his own analysis of these
different substances.
   His inquiries into the constitution of ordinary litmus, which form
the last division of his subject, lead him to the conclusion that that
substance contains the principles designated by him as Erythrolein,
Erythrolitmine, Azolitmine, and Spaniolitmine ; and that the colour
ing constituents of litmus are, in their natural condition, red ; the
blue substances being produced by combination with a base, which
bases in that of commerce are lime, potass, and ammonia ; and there
is mixed up in the mass a considerable quantity of chalk and sand.
The details of the analyses of these several substances, and the re
sulting chemical formulae representing their constitution, are then
given.
   The concluding section of the paper is occupied by an inquiry into
the decoloration of the bodies which exist in archil and in litmus.
The latter of these, the author concludes, is reddened by acids, in
consequence of their removing the loosely combined ammonia by
which the blue colour is produced ; and the so-called hydrogen acids
liberate the colouring matter by their combining with the alkali to
form bodies (either chlorides or iodides), with which the colouring
matter has no tendency to unite. Hence it appears that the redden
ing of litmus is no proof that chloride of hydrogen is an acid, and
that the double decomposition which occurs is the same in principle,
whether hydrogen or a fixed metal come into play. After detailing
the blanching effects of other deoxydizing agents on the colouring
matter of litmus, and the action of chlorine on orceine and azolitmine,
the author remarks, that in these actions chlorine is subjected to
conditions different from those which determine the nature of the
results with the generality of organic bodies, and that the displace
ment of hydrogen, so marked in other cases, does not exist in the
class of substances under consideration ; but that, in reality, the
products of the bleaching energy of chlorine resemble in constitution
the compounds of chlorine which possess bleaching powers.
   A paper was   also read, entitled, " On the Corpuscles of the Blood."
By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S.
   The author in the course of his researches in Embryology, detailed
in his " third series," observed that some of the corpuscles of the
blood undergo progressive alterations in their structure.       The cor
puscles so altered he believes to be of the same kind as those de
scribed by Professor Owen ; and having found that the alterations
in question terminate in a separation of the corpuscles into globules,
he thinks this fact confirms the idea of Professor Owen — that the
blood-disc undergoes spontaneous subdivision.       The author farther
observed that the corpuscles of the blood, in certain altered states,
undergo rapid and incessant changes of form, which cannot be traced

                                    235
 to the action of neighbouring cilia.    A corpuscle will sometimes as
 sume the figure of an hour-glass, as if it were preparing to divide
 itself into two parts, but it instantaneously either regains its previ
 ous form, or assumes a new one.      These motions are incessant, and
 so rapid that it is not easy to catch and delineate any of the result
 ing forms ; they are compared to the writhings of an animal in pain.
 The author has seen them in a rabbit, as late as two hours and a half
 after death, and thinks it probable that they may continue for a
 longer time, although, when under the microscope, they gradually
 and in a short time cease ; the rapid changes of form, which are at
 first apparent, passing into gentle undulations, and being succeeded
 by an alternation of rest and motion.
     Should these facts be thought to confirm the opinion of John
 Hunter, that the blood "has life within itself," or "acquires it in
 the act of forming organic bodies," because its corpuscles in certain
states exhibit " vital actions," still his assertion that " the red glo
bules" are the least important part of the blood, will appear to have
no just foundation.
    The author finds that the phenomena attending what is called
 " vital turgescence" of the blood-vessels, depend not merely on an
 accumulation and stagnation of blood, but on changes in the condi
tion of its corpuscles, which assume a more or less globular, or ellip
tical appearance resembling cells. Their interior is dark, from a
great increase of red colouring matter which accumulates around a
pellucid and colourless point, corresponding in situation to that of
the central part of nuclei in other cases ; and so completely do the
corpuscles fill their vessels, that the fluid portion of the blood is ex
cluded, and the corpuscles are compressed into polyhedral forms.
This condition of the blood-corpuscles during vital turgescence of
the vessels, the author thinks deserving of consideration, in connexion
with many of the phenomena attending local accumulations of blood,
both in health and in disease ; and more especially with reference to
increased pulsation, the exudation of colourless fluid, and the heat
and redness of inflamed parts.
    According to the views of the author, the formation and nourish
ment of organs is not effected merely by the fluid portion of the
blood, for he has discovered that the cells which he showed in his
 " Third Series of Researches in
                                   Embryology" form the chorion, are
 altered blood-corpuscles ; and he has farther found that muscular
fibre (that is, the future muscle-cylinder, not the fibril) is formed
by the coalescence of cells, which also are derived from corpuscles
of the blood. He has seen and figured every stage of transition,
from the unaltered blood-corpuscle to the branched cells forming
the chorion, on the one hand, and to the elliptical or oblong mus
cle-cells, on the other. The colour is not changed, except that the
blood-corpuscles, when passing into cells for the formation of mus
cle, become of a much deeper red.        There seems to occur in these
an increase of red colouring matter.
    Valentin, in describing the mode of the formation of muscle, had
stated that globules approach one another and coalesce to form

                                   236
threads,    which in many places have the appearance of a necklace,
but subsequently lose the traces of division, and become cylinders.
Schwann had conjectured that the globules just referred to — as ha
ving been observed by Valentin — are cells, and that these cells coa
lesce to form a secondary cell, that is, the muscle-cylinder.        The
author confirms the observations of Valentin and the conjectures of
 Schwann, with the addition, that the globules coalescing to form the
muscle-cylinder are blood-corpuscles which have become cells. The
fibrils appear to be subsequently formed within the cylinder, which
thus becomes the muscular fasciculus. The medullary portion
of the cylinder appears to be composed of the pellucid objects, one
of which is contained within each altered blood-corpuscle. Some
of these pellucid objects, however, continue to occupy a peripheral
situation.
    The author thinks it is not probable that muscular fibre and the
chorion are the only tissues formed by the corpuscles of the blood ;
he is disposed rather to inquire, how many are the tissues which
they do not form ? Nerves, for instance, are known to arise very
much in the same manner as muscle-cylinders ; and epithelium-cells
 sometimes present appearances which have almost suggested to the
 author the idea that they were altered corpuscles of the blood.
    Schwann had prevously shown that " for all the elementary parts
of organisms there is a common principle of developement," — the
 elementary parts of tissues having a like origin in cells, however
 different the functions of those tissues.     The facts made known in
 the present memoir not only afford evidence of the justness of the
views of Schwann, but they farther show that objects, such as the
 corpuscles of the blood, having all the same appearance, enter im
 mediately into the formation of tissues which physiologically are
 extremely different.     Some of these corpuscles arrange themselves
 into muscle, and others become metamorphosed            into constituent
 parts  of  the  chorion.  But the author  thinks it is not more difficult
 to conceive corpuscles having the same colour, form, and general
 appearance, undergoing transformations for very different purposes,
 than to admit the fact made known by two of his preceding me
 moirs, — namely, that the nucleus of a cell, having a central situa
 tion in the group which constitutes the germ, is developed into the
 whole embryo, while the nuclei of cells occupying less central situa
 tions in the group, form no more than a minute portion of the am
 nion.     It is known that in the bee-hive a grub is taken— for a spe
 cial purpose — from among those born as workers, which it perfectly
 resembles until nourished with peculiar food, when its developement
 takes a different course from that of every other individual in the
hive.
    The Society then adjourned      over the  Whitsun Recess, to     meet
 again on the 18th instant.

                                     237
                              June    18, 1840.
    The MARQUIS of NORTHAMPTON,                    President, in the Chair.
     Jean Baptiste Dumas, was      elected a Foreign    Member of the So
ciety.
    Lieutenant-Colonel John George Bonner, E.I.C.S., and John Nar-
rien, Esq., were balloted for, and duly elected into the Society.
     The President informed the Meeting that the Council had voted
the following Addresses of Congratulation to Her Majesty the Queen,
and His Royal Highness Prince Albert, on the occasion of the late
traitorous attack made upon their lives.
                 "  To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty.
        " The humble Address of the President, Council, and Fellows
            of the Royal Society of London for improving             Natural
             Knowledge.
        " Most Gracious Sovereign,
      " We, Your    Majesty's subjects, the President, Council, and Fel
lows of the Royal Society of London for improving Natural Know

at the treasonable and atrocious attack lately made on Your Majesty's
 sacred person, beg leave to approach your Throne, and to offer our
heartfelt congratulations on Your Majesty's providential escape from
the wicked designs of an assassin.
      "We lift up our hearts in joyful thankfulness to the Almighty
 Disposer of Events for his merciful protection of a life so dear to all
 Your Majesty's subjects, and so important to the welfare and pro
 sperity of these realms ; and we most earnestly pray that the same
 Providence, so signally manifested on the late event, may continue
 to shield Your Majesty from every danger ; and that during a long,
 prosperous and happy reign, Your Majesty may live in the enjoyment
 of the affection and prayers of a grateful and united people."
   " To His Royal Highness Prince Albert
                                                of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

      " We,  the President, Council, and Fellows of the       Royal Society
 of London for improving Natural Knowledge, approach your Royal

 Almighty Disposer of Events for the protection of Her Majesty and
 Your Royal Highness from the traitorous attack of an assassin, and
 to offer our^incere congratulations for the safety of a life so im
 portant to the welfare of this great empire, as well as to the happi

      " In offering these our sentiments, we cannot forget that Your
 Royal Highness, by becoming one of our members, has proclaimed
  to the world Your Royal Highness'a attachment to those sciences

   for the advancement of which our Society was established, and which
  tend at the same time to the glory of the nation that protects them,
  and to the happiness of the whole civilized world."
      These Addresses were unanimously adopted by the Society.
      The following letter was read from G. G. Anson, Esq., addressed
  to the President, enclosing a specimen of a deposit with which nine
  acres of land near Exeter, belonging to Lord Radnor, had been
  covered after the subsidence of a flood, and which was sent by
  H.R.H. Prince Albert, F.R.S. :—
                                     " Buckingham Palace, June      8, 1840.
         " My dear Lord,

              Royal Highness Prince Albert has       commanded me to for
 ward to you the enclosed specimen, which has been sent up to His
 Royal Highness from Lord Radnor's place near Exeter, where nine
 acres of land were covered with this curious substance after a flood
 had subsided.         His Royal Highness thinks it very probable that the
 subject may      already  have been brought before the Royal Society, but
 in case it should not have been, he sends the accompanying packet.
 It is said that a good deal of it has been applied to the purpose of
 making waistcoats for poor people.

     "  The Marquis     of Northampton, President of   the  Royal Society."
     The following description of the specimen referred to in the letter,
 drawn up by John Lindley, Ph. D. F.R.S. , was also read :
     " Description of    the Specimen referred to in the preceding letter."
By John Lindley, Ph. D., F.R.S.
    The plant which overran Lord Radnor's land is the Conferva crispa
of Dillwyn, which is said to be the Conferva fluviatilis of Linnaeus.
The species inhabits fresh water, and multiplies with great rapidity,
forming entangled strata.          The green portion is the Conferva in its
young      state,  the  white portion is the plant old and bleached.      The
whole mass consists of articulated filaments, among which are frag
ments     of grass-leaves.
    The following papers were then read, or their titles announced : —
    1 . An Account of Experiments on the Reflecting Telescope.             By
the Right Hon. Lord Oxmantown, F.R.S.
    This paper enters minutely into the details of the experiments, of
the precautions requisite to ensure success, and of the manipulations
ultimately adopted in forming a speculum three feet in diameter,
subsequently applied to a telescope, mounted in a manner very si
milar to that of Sir John Herschel.           The author states, as the re
sults he arrived at, that specula can be made to act effectively, when
cast of the finest speculum metal, in separate portions, and retained in

                                  239
iheir positions by an alloy of zinc and copper, as easily wrought as
common brass, and that they can be executed in this manner of any
required size ; that castings of the finest speculum metal can be ex
ecuted of large dimensions, perfect, and not very liable to break ;
that machinery can be employed with the greatest advantage in
grinding and polishing specula ; that to obtain the finest polish, it is
not necessary that the speculum should become warm, and that any
temperature may be fixed upon, and preserved uniform during the
whole process ; and that large specula can be polished as accurately
as small ones, and be supported so as to be secured from flexure.
   2. On the theoretical explanation of an apparently new Polarity
in Light. By G. B. Airy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
   The existence of a polarity in the rays of homogeneous light, ha
ving regard only to the sequence of colours in the spectrum, was in
ferred by Sir David Brewster from some experiments, of which he has
given an account, contained in the Report of the seventh meeting of
the British Association.    The author states the results of his own
observations of similar phenomena, and their theoretical explanation
on the undulatory theory, together with the mathematical develop
ment of that explanation.
   3. On the Ferrosesquicyanuret of Potassium. By Alfred Smee,
Esq.    Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
   The author examines, in this paper, the action of chlorine upon
the ferrocyanate of potassa, and the conversion of the latter into
ferrosesquicyanuret ; and proposes methods for obtaining this latter
salt uncontaminated with impurities, and free from the difficulties
and inconvenience attendant on the present mode of preparation.
   4. On the influence of Iodine in rendering several argentine com
pounds, spread on paper, sensitive to light; and on a new Method
of producing, with greater distinctness, the Photogenic Image. By
Mr. Robert Hunt. Communicated by Sir John Herschel, Bart.,
V.P.R.S.
   This paper contains various details of the results of a great num
ber of experiments made with a view of rendering paper capable of
being employed instead of metallic plates, in Daguerre's photogra
phic process.    It is accompanied with 12 papers as specimens.
   5. Hourly Observations of the Barometer and Thermometer at
sea, on the 21st of March, 1840.       By Major-General A. Lindsay,
H.E.I.C.S.      Communicated by Sir John F.       W. Herschel, Bart.,
V.P.R.S.
   These observations were made on board the ship Owen Glendower,
on her voyage from Calcutta to London.
   6. On the Constitution of Pigotite, and on the Mudesous and
Mudesic Acids.      By James F. W. Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
   In this paper the author describes a substance, found by himself

                                     240
and by the Rev. M. Pigot, forming an incrustation on the sides of
certain caves, occurring in the granitic cliffs on the east and west
coast of Cornwall.       This incrustation is in mass of a brown, and in
powder of a yellow colour ; is insoluble in water and alcohol ; when
heated, it gives off much water, blackens, yields empyreumatic pro
ducts, and leaves a black mass, having occasionally the lustre of
graphite.     In the air, at a bright red heat, this mass very slowly
burns, leaving a grey or white ash, which consists of alumina, with
some slight foreign admixtures.
   The organic constituent of this substance (pigotite), the author
considers to be derived from the decay of the various plants which
grow on the moist moorlands above, and which, being carried by the
waters into the fissures of the granite beneath, combines with the
alumina of the decomposed felspar ; and when it reaches the air,
deposits itself on the roof and sides of the caverns, in the form of
layers, varying from a line to two or three inches in thickness. With
reference to its supposed origin, the author has given to the organic
constituent the name of mudesous acid (from fivSiiots, signifying
decay through excess of moisture), and he mentions an observation,
communicated to him by Dr. Bouse, that the roots of the sea pink
(Statice armeria) contain a colouring matter resembling, in appear
ance, the solutions of the mudesous acid.
    From numerous experiments and analyses detailed at length in
his paper, the author derives the following general results :
    1 . That the native pigotite contains a dark-brown        soluble, not
deliquescent    acid  of vegetable origin, which, in  the anhydrous state,
is represented by C12 H5 08.
    2. That this acid, the mudesous, is tribasic, the salt of silver
 (mudesite), being represented by (3A90 + ClsH508), and pre
 cipitates the salts of the metallic oxides of a brown colour.
    3. That the native mudesite of alumina (Pigotite) is repre
 sented as follows   :
    a. Dried   in the air by (4 Al +   C12H5 08   +  27 H O).
    b.  Dried at 212° F. by (4    Al +   C1SH5  0.+ 8H       O), losing 27
per    cent, of water.
    c. Dried at 300° F. by (4 Al + Cl8 H5 08 + 8 H O), losing 32
per cent, of water.
    4. That this native mudesite, however, is more probably a com
 pound of the organic tribasic salt, with a hydrate of alumina, and
 may be rationally represented thus :
    a. Dried   in the air by (Al + C^O8        + „HO) +    3 (Al + 6HO).
    b.  Driedat212°F.by(Al + C12H508 + 4HO) + 3(A1 + 2HO).
    c. Dried at 300°   F. by  (A1 + C12H508 + 2HO) + 3(A1 + 2H0).
    5.   That when treated with nitric acid, the native mudesite, as

                                     241
well as the mudesoas acid itself, are oxidized and converted into a
new brownish-yellow, soluble and deliquescent acid, containing more
oxygen, and in the anhydrous state represented by C12 Hs O10.
    6. That this new acid, the mudesic, combines readily with alu
mina and protoxide of mercury, giving salts of a yellow colour.
Both the acids described in this paper are distinguished for their
tendency to precipitate alumina and the protoxide of mercury.        The
mudesate of mercury dried at 300° F., is represented by (2 H9 O +
Ci2H5010).
    7. That chlorine, when made to act on either of the acids, or
their salts of alumina in contact with water, gradually deprives them
of all colour, while, at the same time, muriatic acid is formed. Col
lected on the filter, boiled in water till the washings cease to pre
cipitate nitrate of silver, and dried, the white gelatinous, apparently
altered mudesite or mudesate, is found on analysis to contain no
atomic proportion of chlorine, but to have sensibly the constitution
of the mudesic acid, or mudesates prepared by the direct action of
nitric acid. The author thinks it not unlikely that a chloro-mudesic
acid exists, and may be formed during this process, represented
probably by C!2 H4 CI O10, but which he has not succeeded in ob
taining in a separate state.
    The mudesous and mudesic acids are distinguished from each
other by giving, the former brown, and the latter yellow precipitates
with the neutral metallic salts — by being the former unaltered, and
 the latter deliquescent in the air. Both form deliquescent salts with
 ammonia, and appear to undergo alteration by the long-continued
 action of hydrosulphuric, or of concentrated sulphuric and hydro
 fluoric acids.
    7. On the Constitution of the Resins, Part V.         By James F. W.
 Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    In this paper the author continues his examination of what are
 called the fetid resins, and from repeated analyses deduces for the
 resin of Sagapenum the formula C40 H29 09, and for that of Galbanum
 C40 H,, 07.      He then compares the formulae for the four resins :
        Opoponax = C40 H25 014, Assafoetida = C40 Hs6 Ol0,
        Galbanum = C40 H„7 0?0, Sagapenum = C40 H2909 ;
 and   considers  it probable that, though no striking analogy among
 the  irrational  formulae for these resins is perceptible, by which their
 analogy    in physical properties can be accounted for, that they may
 possess   an  analogous rational constitution, which future researches
 may    disclose.
    Euphorbium consists of two resins, of which the more soluble,
 A, gave the formula C40H31 06. Elemi also consists of two resins,
 of which the more soluble, A, is represented by C40 H32 04, and the
 less soluble, B, by C40 H32 O 1, as had previously been shown by Hess
 and Rose. The Bdellium of commerce contains much gum, and a
 resin C^H,! Os.
    The resin of Benzoin presented peculiar difficulties when sub
 mitted to investigation, from the ease with which it undergoes de

                                      242
composition, even at temperatures much below that at which it melts.
 With regard to this resin, the author gives the following as the result
 of his numerous analyses : —
    1. That the colourless resin of benzoin is represented approxi
mately by C40 H21i 09.
    2. That by heat and dilute carbonated alkalies it is decomposed
into water, benzoic acid, a little volatile oil, and a resin C40 H„3 Ov,
or C40 H24 O,,.
    3. That by boiling with quicklime, or concentrated carbonated
alkalies, it gives two resins, one in large quantity = C40 H.24 Os ; and
another in small quantity = C40 H30 07.
    4. That by caustic potash the crude resin is resolved into two re
 sins represented respectively by C40 H™ O,,, and C40 H30 07, of which
 the former is precipitated, and the latter remains in solution, when a
saturated aqueous solution of caustic potash is added to an alcoholic
 solution of the crude resin.
    5. And that by oxide of lead two resins are separated, for which
analysis gave respectively the formula: C40H1!,, 09 and C40 H.,<; O10.
    The author concludes by stating that such metamorphoses are by
no means confined to this resin, though the more accurate know
ledge of their nature, obtained by the imperfect study he has made
of the resin of benzoin, has explained many anomalies he had pre
viously observed, with regard to the relations of the resins to the al
kalies and metallic oxides. He considers the group of which dragon's
blood is the type, and which he represents by the expression
 C40 H24 + x O,, to be peculiarly susceptible of modification
                                                                       (or
decomposition ?) by the action of bases ; and he specifies among
other results, with regard to which it is his intention to address the
 Society in a future paper, that dragon's blood, of which the lump
variety = C40 H21 Os, and the drop variety (heated to 300°
 = C40 H,20 08, gives by the action of quicklime and oxide of lead,    F.)
among other products, two resins represented approximately by
C40H20O,n and C40Hj0O12? — that guiacum = C40 Hli3 O10, with
oxide of lead, gives a resin = C40 H„1 O11, the resin of jalap
 = C4o H34 0 , 8 ; by the action of the same oxide, a resin =
                                                              C40 H34 O.^,
and that of assafoetida = C4OHMO10, a new resin = C40H„3O,13.
These metamorphoses lead to the second great branch of inquiry
respecting the nature and constitution of the resins. Certain results
being established, at least approximately, with regard to the irrational
constitution of the resins, and certain general irrational formulae by
which to express it, we are prepared for the study of their rational
constitution.      This part of the subject the author proposes to con
sider farther in subsequent communications.
    8. Researches on the Tides.        Twelfth Series. On the Laws of
the Rise and Fall of the Sea's surface during each tide. By the
Rev. W. Whewell, B.D., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
bridge.
   The materials of the present investigation are five months' tide
observations made at Plymouth ; three months observations made

                                      243
  at Liverpool, under the direction of Captain Denham, R.N. ; and
  twelve months' observations made at Bristol, by Mr. Bunt, by means
  of his tide-gauge.     According to the theory of the tides, the height
  of the surface of the water at a given place will increase as the sine,
  while the time increases as the arc. Hence if the time be made the
  abscissa, and the height the ordinate, the curve representing one
  tide would be the figure of signs. The author on making the com
  parison of the empirical curve of the rise and fall of the water, de
  duced from observation, with this theoretical curve, finds a general
  agreement between them ; subject to certain deviations, consisting
  principally in the empirical curve indicating that both the rise and
  the fall are not symmetrical, like the theoretical curve, in conse
  quence of the fall being generally more rapid than the rise, and thus
  occasioning a displacement of the summit of the curve towards that

     9. Researches in Embryology.         Third Series. — Additional Ob
  servations. By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S.
     Having in the paper to which the present is supplementary made
  known the fact that the germinal spot in the mammiferous ovum re
  solves itself into cells, with which the germinal vesicle becomes filled,
  the author has since directed his attention to the corresponding parts
  in the ova of birds, batrachian reptiles, and osseous fishes, which he
  finds to be the seat of precisely the same changes.       The numerous
  spots in the germinal vesicle of batrachian reptiles and osseous fishes
  are no other than the nuclei of cells.      The cells themselves, from
  their transparency, are at first not easily discerned, and appear to
  have hitherto escaped notice; but after the observer has become
   aware of their presence, they are, in many instances, seen to be ar
  ranged in the same manner, and to present the same interior them
  selves as the corresponding cells in the ovum of mammalia.
     In the representations given by Professor Rudolph Wagner, the
  discoverer of the germinal spot, the author recognizes evidence of
  the same changes in ova throughout the animal kingdom. He con-
i firms and explains the observations of R. Wagner, that in the ova
  of certain animals an originally single spot divides into many, and
  that in the ova of other animals the number of spots increases as
  the ovum ripens. But he expresses also the opinion that in all ova
  there is originally but a single spot, this being the nucleus of the
  germinal vesicle or cell.
     The analogy between the ova of mammalia and the animal above-
  mentioned, extends also to the substance surrounding the germinal
  vesicle, which consists of nucleated cells.
     10. Description of a Calculating Machine invented by Mr. Thomas
  Fowler, of Torrington in Devonshire. By Augustus De Morgan, Esq.
  Communicated by F. Baily, Esq., V.P.R.S.
     The arithmetical operations performed by the machine are those
  of multiplication and division ; the factors and product in the for
  mer case, and the quotient, dividend and divisor in the latter, being

                                     244
 expressed    in digits of the ternary scale of notation, every digit be
 ing either — 1, 0, or + 1. In this system, unity being, in multi
plication, only an index, the rules for multiplication and division
must consist entirely in directions for the management of the signs
of unity ; and it is on this principle that Mr. Fowler's machine is
made to act.       A short account is given of the principal parts of the
machine, and of the mode in which they bring out the final results.
It is necessary, however, in applying it to use, to have recourse to
tables, both for converting the factors and reconverting the result ;
operations which introduce both labour and risk of error.
    1 1.   On the Minute Structure and Movements of Voluntary Mus
cles,    in a letter addressed to R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S., &c. By
William Bowman, Esq., Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's Col
lege, London, and Assistant Surgeon to King's College Hospital.
Communicated by Dr. Todd.
   The objects of the author, in this paper, are the following. — 1st.
To confirm, under some modifications, the view taken of the primi
tive fasciculi of voluntary muscles being composed of a solid bundle
of fibrillae.    2dly. To describe new parts entering into their com
position    : and  3dly. To detail new observations on the mechanism
of voluntary motion.
   He first shows that the primitive fasciculi are not cylindrical, but
polygonal threads ; their sides being more or less flattened where
they are in contact with one another ; he next records, in a tabular
form, the results of his examination of their size in the different di
visions of the animal kingdom.        It appears that the largest are met
with in fish ; they are smaller in reptiles, and their size continues
to diminish in insects, in mammalia, and lastly, in birds, where
they are the smallest of all. In all these instances, however, an
extensive range of size is observable, not only in different species,
but in the same animal, and even in the same muscle. He then
shows that all the fibrillae into which a primitive fasciculus may be
split, are marked by alternate dark and light points, and that fibrillse
of this description exist throughout the whole thickness of the fasci
culus ; that the apposition of the segments of contiguous fibrillae, so
marked, must form transverse striae, and that such transverse striae
do in fact exist throughout the whole interior of the fasciculus. He
next inquires into the form of the segments composing the fibrillae,
and shows that their longitudinal adhesion constitutes fibrillee, and
their lateral adhesion discs, or plates, transverse to the length of the
fasciculus ; each disc being, therefore, composed of a single segment
from every one of the fibrillae.      He shows that these discs always
exist quite as unequivocally as the fibrillae, and gives several exam
ples and figures of a natural cleavage of the fasciculus into such discs.
It follows that the transverse striae are the edges, or focal sections of
these discs. Several varieties in the striae are then detailed, and the
fact noticed that in all animals there is frequently more or less di
versity in the number of striae in a given space, not only on conti
guous fasciculi, but also on the same fasciculus at different parts.

                                  245
   The author then proceeds to describe a tubular membranaceous
sheath, of the most exquisite delicacy and transparency, investing
each fasciculus from end to end, and isolating it from all other parts ;
this sheath he terms Sarcolemma.      Its existence and properties are
shown by several modes of demonstration ; and among others, by a
specimen in which it is seen filled with parasitic worms (Trichinae),
which have removed all the fibrillse. The adhesion of this sarco
lemma to the outermost fibrillae is explained.
   It is also shown that there exist in all voluntary muscles a num
ber of minute corpuscles of definite form, which appear to be identi
cal with, or at least analogous to the nuclei of the cells from which
the development of the fasciculi has originally proceeded.       These
are shown to be analogous to similar bodies in the muscles of or
ganic life, and in other organic structures.
   The author next describes his observations on the mode of union
between tendon and muscle ; that is, on the extremities of the pri
mitive fasciculi.   He shows that in fish and insects the tendinous
fibrilhe become sometimes directly continuous with the extremities
of the fasciculi, which are not taper, but have a perfect terminal
disc.   In other cases the extremities are shown to be obliquely trun
cated, where the fasciculi are attached to surfaces not at right angles
to their direction.
   Lastly. He states his opinion, and gives new facts on which it is
founded, that in muscular contraction the discs of the fasciculi be
come approximated, flattened, and expanded ; the fasciculi, of course,
at the same time becoming shorter and thicker.       He considers that
in all contractions these phenomena occur ; and he adduces argu
ments to show the improbability of the existence of any rugte or
zigzags as a condition of contracting fasciculi in the living body.
The paper is abundantly illustrated by drawings of microscopic ap
pearances.
   The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again
on the 19th of November next.

    A paper  was read, entitled, Supplement to a paper " On the Theo
 retical Explanation of an apparent new Polarity in Light ;" by George
 B. Airy, Esq.,  M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
    In  a  paper published in the second part of the Philosophical
Transactions for 1840, the author explained, on the undulatory
 theory of light, the phenomena observed by Sir David Brewster,
and apparently indicating a new polarity in light.    That explanation
was founded on the assumption that the spectrum was viewed out of
focus ; an assumption which corresponded with the observation of
the author and of other persons.      But the author having, since the
publication of that memoir, been assured by Sir David Brewster that
the phenomenon was most certainly observed with great distinct
ness when the spectrum was viewed so accurately in focus that
many of Frauenhofer's finer lines could be seen, he has continued the
theoretical investigation for that case, which had been omitted in
the former memoir, namely, when the spectrum is viewed in focus ;
and he has arrived at a result, which appears completely to recon
cile the seemingly conflicting statements, and to dispel the obscurity
in which the subject had hitherto been enveloped.

   the Sea. By Captain      J. Norton. Communicated by S. Hunter Chris
   tie, Esq., M.A., Sec. R.S., &c.
       An iron tube, like the barrel of a musket, is screwed into a shell
   of any size, water-tight. A rod of iron, about half a pound in weight
   and a foot in length, is suspended within the tube, by means of a
   split quill passing through a hole in the upper end of the rod, the
   other end being armed with a percussion-cap. The mouth of the
   tube is closed with a screw lid also water-tight.        Tin or brass
   wings being attached to the upper end of the tube will keep it in a
  vertical position during its descent to the bottom of the sea ; and the
  shock on its striking the bottom will cause the bar of iron within
  the tube to fall, and produce the percussion and explosion.
       Should it be found difficult to make the shell water-proof, I am
  satisfied that percussion powder made from silver will explode by
  friction or percussion even when mixed with water.
       2. — Memorandum addressed to the Royal Society. By T. Whar
  ton Jones, F.R.S.
       The following is the memorandum in the words of the author : —
       On the 18th of June, 1835, a memoir, entitled, " On the Ova of
  Man and Mammiferous Animals, as they exist in the Ovaries before
  Impregnation, and on the discovery in them of a Vesicle analogous
 to that described by Professor Purkinje in the Immature Egg of the
 Bird," was laid before the Royal Society.
      At the time I wrote, I believed myself the first who had observed
 the vesicle alluded to ; but by a reference to the manuscript in the
 archives of the Society, it will be seen, from a postscript, that before
 sending it to be communicated,        I had become aware that M. Coste
 of Paris had some time before announced that he had made a similar
 observation,     as far as concerns the rabbit.  Those who are conver
 sant in such matters are doubtless aware that I was anticipated also
 by Professor Valentin ; but of this circumstance I was not informed
till some considerable time after.
      It thus appears that, though I was an independent discoverer of
the germinal vesicle of the mammiferous ovum, all the share in the
discovery I can lay claim to historically is that of being the first who
pointed it out in this country.
     There is one point, however, in the anatomy of the germinal ve
sicle of the mammiferous ovum of which I feel myself entitled to be
recognized,      especially by the Royal Society, as contemporaneous
discoverer, and that is, the spot on the side of the vesicle.    Feeling
this, and having heard at the last meeting of the Royal Society the
discovery of this spot attributed solely to the distinguished German

                                     249
 physiologist, Professor Rudolph Wagner, I consider it due to the
 Royal Society and to myself to call to the Society's remembrance the
 fact, that, in the memoir above referred to as having been laid before
 them in 1835, the spot in question is not only pointed out and par
 ticularly delineated, but its physiological importance hinted at.
    The laying of a paper before a Society is an act of publication.
 With the communication of my paper to the Royal Society in 1835,
 the publication of Professor Wagner's paper in Miiller's Archiv was
 contemporaneous merely.
    It is true, that though Professor Wagner's observations were only
first published in Miiller's Archiv for 1835, there is a note by the
editor, saying that the paper was received by him in 1834 ; but it is
 also true, — and of this, were it necessary, proof could be easily ad
duced,   — that my   paper was written also in 1834.
    In conclusion, I    beg to apologize to the Royal Society for ob
truding on their notice what may appear matter rather of personal
than general interest.
    3. — Description of the Electro-magnetic      Clock.    By C. Wheat-
stone, Esq., F.R.S.
    The object of the apparatus forming the subject of this commu
nication, is stated by the author to be that of enabling a single clock
to indicate exactly the same time in as many different places, distant
from each other, as may be required. Thus, in an astronomical
observatory, every room may be furnished with an instrument, sim
ple in its construction, and therefore little liable to derangement, and
of trifling cost, which shall indicate the time, and beat dead seconds
audibly, with the same precision as the standard astronomical clock
with which it is connected ; thus obviating the necessity of having
several clocks, and diminishing the trouble of winding up and regu
lating them separately.      In like manner, in public offices and large
establishments, one good clock will serve the purpose of indicating
the precise time in every part of the building where it may be re
quired, and an accuracy ensured which it would be difficult to obtain
by independent clocks, even putting the difference of cost out of
consideration.      Other cases in which the invention might be ad
vantageously employed were also mentioned.            In the electro-mag
netic clock, which was exhibited in action in the Apartments of the
Society, all the parts employed in a clock for maintaining and regu
lating the power are entirely dispensed with.        It consists simply of
a face with its second, minute and hour hands, and of a train of
wheels which communicate motion from the arbor of the second's
hand to that of the hour hand, in the same manner as in an ordinary
clock train ; a small electro-magnet is caused to act upon a pecu
liarly constructed wheel (scarcely capable of being described without
a figure) placed on the second's arbor, in such manner that whenever
the temporary magnetism is either produced or destroyed, the wheel,
and consequently the second's hand, advances a sixtieth part of its
revolution. It is obvious, then, that if an electric current can be al
ternately established and arrested, each resumption and cessation
                                    b 2

                                    250
lasting for a second, the instrument now described, although unpro
vided with any internal maintaining or regulating power, would per
form all the usual functions of a perfect clock. The manner in which
this apparatus is applied to the clocks, so that the movements of the
hands of both may be perfectly simultaneous, is the following.       On
the axis which carries the scape-wheel of the primary clock a small
disc of brass is fixed, which is first divided on its circumference into
sixty equal parts ; each alternate division is then cut out and filled
with a piece of wood, so that the circumference consists of thirty
regular alternations of wood and metal.        An extremely light brass
 spring, which is screwed to a block of ivory or hard wood, and which
has no connexion with the metallic parts of the clock, rests by its
free end on the circumference of the disc. A copper wire is fastened
 to the fixed end of the spring, and proceeds to one end of the wire
 of the electro-magnet; while another wire attached to the clock- frame
 is continued until it joins the other end of that of the same electro
 magnet.     A constant voltaic battery, consisting of a few elements
 of very small dimensions, is interposed in any part of the circuit.
 By this arrangement the circuit is periodically made and broken, in
 consequence of the spring resting for one second on a metal division,
 and the next second on a wooden division. The circuit may be ex
 tended to any length ; and any number of electro-magnetic instru
 ments may be thus brought into sympathetic action with the standard
 clock. It is only necessary to observe, that the force of the battery
 and the proportion between the resistances of the electro-magnetic
 coils and those of the other parts of the circuit, must, in order to
produce the maximum effect with the least expenditure of power, be
varied to suit each particular case.
    In the concluding part of the paper the author points out several
 other and very different methods of effecting the same purpose ; and
in particular one in which Faraday's magneto-electric currents are
 employed, instead of the current produced by a voltaic battery : he
 also describes a modification of the sympathetic instrument, calcu
lated to enable it to act at great distances with a weaker electric cur
rent than if it were constructed on the plan first described.
                           November 30, 1840.
    At  the Anniversary   Meeting, the Marquis of Northampton, Pre
 sident, in the Chair,
    Lieut.-Colonel William Henry Sykes, on the part of the Auditors
of the Treasurer's Accounts, reported that the total receipts during
the last year, inclusive of a balance of 1808/. 9s. Id., carried from

that the total payments in the same period amounted to 4787^ 9s. 3d.,
leaving a balance in the hands of the Treasurer of 937/. 19s. Id.
    The Thanks of the Meeting were given to the Auditors for the

    The President then addressed the Meeting       as follows :
       Gentlemen,
    In  addressing you at the termination of this, the second year that
 I  have had the honour of presiding over your Society, my first
 duty is to return my thanks to those gentlemen whom you have
 nominated to be my Council. They have rendered an onerous duty
 comparatively light and easy by their unremitting attendance and
 zeal ; and have, as I trust, prevented your affairs from suffering from
 any incompetency on my part. In making my report of the trans
 actions of the last year, I know of nothing to regret, except the loss
 of some of our valued Associates, who between the end of last No
 vember and the present time have paid the debt of nature.
    Among the new members enrolled in our body, it will perhaps
 be right to mention the name of the Bishop of Norwich, as being
 President of the Linnean Society, one of the oldest branches that
 may be considered as thrown off from our parent stem.          Also that
 of the Duke of Richmond, as President of the two newest Asso
 ciations founded for the promotion of science, the Royal Agricul
 tural and Botanical Societies. We have one new member of still
 higher rank, who has honoured us by becoming one of our Fellows,
 H. R. H. Prince Albert, the consort of our beloved Queen and
 Patroness. As your organ, Gentlemen, I will venture to say that
 you duly appreciate the honour conferred on yourselves ; at the
 same time while His Royal Highness gratifies us by joining our
 body, we entertain no doubt that he does so from the just conviction
 that the patronage and advancement of science are national objects
 of the deepest importance.
    The Antarctic Expedition, to whose departure I adverted in my
 last year's Address is, I trust, now successfully pursuing its career
 of scientific research. Already a portion of the fruits of its labours
 has reached us, and promises an abundant and valuable harvest.
 The fixed Magnetic Observatories on the territories of Her Majesty
 are now also in full operation ; while foreign powers have given us

                                     253
 the assistance of observations made at the same instant of time, and
 on the same system as our own.          I have the satisfaction to state,
 that these observatories exceed forty in number.
    While these researches are being made by our own and other states,
 private enterprise is not idle. Mr. Enderby, to whom geography
 is already indebted, has sent out a vessel for the purposes of discovery
 in the Antarctic seas, with the object of approaching as near as may
 be to the Southern pole.      His ship is navigated by Mr. Mapleton,
 an officer who had been selected by Her Majesty's Government to
 take a part in Captain Ross's expedition ; but he had not returned
 to England before that expedition had sailed.       We may well hope
 that he will merit this double confidence, and that he will, if his life
 be spared, add another wreath to the laurels of England, won by a
 Parry and a Ross, a Cooke and a Vancouver.
    You are aware, Gentlemen, that previously to the departure of the
late expedition, the Council of the Royal Society was requested by the
government to draw up a statement of the most desirable objects in
science to which the attention of the officers employed might be
directed. With this request, as you might also know, the Council
immediately complied ; and in the execution of the duty thus de
volved on us, the assistance of the Scientific Committees was our
principal means of success.       Since that time it has occurred to us,
that the same recommendations, in rather a different shape, might
 be of great use to other scientific travellers.   We have accordingly
taken considerable pains in perfecting these suggestions, which we
have caused to be printed for the public in general.            We have
already furnished copies to the Commander of the Expedition to the
Niger, and    I hope that, in addition to his higher objects, he may be
enabled to promote our acquaintance with the details of the geo
graphy and natural history of those imperfectly known parts of the
globe.
    I have the satisfaction to inform you, that by desire of the Council
Mr. Shuckard has completed a Catalogue of the valuable manuscript
letters in our library, among which are many from Ray, Willoughby,
Newton, Boyle, Hook, and other eminent men, which we trust may
serve as a useful aid to those Fellows who may wish to consult do
cuments of so much interest and value.
    You will also be glad to know that Mr. Halliwell, one of our
Fellows, has undertaken and executed the task of making a cata
logue of the miscellaneous manuscripts in our library ; a labour for
which I am sure you will feel much indebted to the author. In this
collection the Society possesses one most valuable manuscript, the
Principia in the hand-writing of the immortal Newton.
    The Royal Society, Gentlemen, was founded for the advancement
of natural knowledge, not for     any purposes of private advantage or
vain glory.     It must, therefore, always hail the foundation and
prosperity of new bodies of scientific men, brought together by the
same object in particular branches of science, either in the abstract,
or connected with important arts and manufactures. It cannot but
rejoice, therefore, at the continued prosperity of the British Associ

                                    254
ation, and in the formation of new societies for Microscopical Re
search, and for the improvement of Botany and Agriculture.
    With respect to the last of these, we must look with satisfaction
to every effort to carry the torch of science, to light up the intrica
cies and doubts of an art, the first probably in age, and certainly the
first in importance to civilized man. As to the Botanical Society,
we cannot but be glad that the want of a public and national Garden
should be in some measure supplied, and we may indulge a hope
 that the example may, at a future time, lead our Government to pro
 vide an establishment commensurate with the wealth of Great Bri
 tain, with the magnitude of the metropolis, and with the extensive
 colonial empire from which it might be supplied with the produc
 tions of the most varied climates.
     With the continued and increasing prosperity of the British As
 sociation, I may the more boldly call on you to sympathize, as the
 greater part of its most active and talented members are also among
 the most valued of our own Fellows.       It had this year a great addi
 tional merit in the very numerous attendance of the scientific natives
 of other countries, and it gave to those among us who were present
 at Glasgow the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with
 some of our Foreign Members ; with an Encke, and an Agassiz.
 The latter gentleman, having fortunately extended his visit to En
 gland, we have now the pleasure of seeing him at our Anniversary;
 a pleasure that we should have probably lost, had he not been at
 tracted by the meeting of the British Association.
     During the last year we have had more than one occasion of tes
 tifying our grateful and loyal attachment to our Royal Patroness.
 Another now presents itself, which I am sure you will gladly seize,
 to express our joy at the birth of a Princess, our gratitude to Heaven
 for our Sovereign's safety, and our fervent prayers for her long and
 prosperous reign over the hearts as well as persons of her subjects.
     Since we last assembled our room of meeting has been ornamented,
 as you will see, Gentlemen, by the portrait of our late Royal Presi
 dent, from the pencil of Mr. Phillips.      I am sure that you will be
 gratified by this addition to the likenesses of the far greater number
 of my predecessors. Future successors of the present Fellows of the
 Royal Society will look with satisfaction at the striking representa
tion of a Prince, who has added to the many favours received by us
from his illustrious house, that of deigning to preside over our Meet
 ings and our Councils.
     Of the papers that have been read at our Meetings, it is not ne
 cessary for me to speak.     Of their merits you will be enabled to
judge in a considerable degree by the Abstracts contained in our
printed Proceedings; while those that have appeared to the Council,
 assisted by the Scientific Committees, to be of the most importance,
 will be found in the Philosophical Transactions. As a new proof of
 which I cannot, however, refrain from adverting for a moment to one
 topic, — the discovery of Photography, for which we are indebted to
a Neipce, a Daguerre, and a Talbot; and which not only promises
 important results to art, but valuable assistance also, by the applica

                                       255
tion of an Ibbotson and others, to those branches of knowledge
which are connected with organic matter. This                   is,
                                                   however, not all.
Through the interesting observations    of Sir J. Herschel  and Mr.
Hunt, followed up, as they will doubtless be, by other philosophers,
a vista seems to open into hitherto unexplored regions of science.
I    have the honour, Gentlemen, to inform you that the Council
have awarded the Royal Medals for the present year to Sir John
F. W. Herschel and Professor Wheatstone one Copley Medal to
                                                        ;
Professor Liebig, and another to M. Sturm         and the Rumford
                                                            ;
Medal to M. Biot.
       Sir John Lubbock.
   It to me cause of the highest satisfaction that have to pre
       is        a                                                    I
sent through you this Royal Medal to Sir John F. W. Herschel,
being the fourth Medal that has been awarded to him by the de
cision of different Councils.
   It to myself and to the other Members of the Council most
       is                                                                     a
gratifying circumstance, that in an invention of great interest to art,
he has found an instrument capable of making us acquainted with
most curious laws regulating the chemical action of the different
rays of the spectrum on the same substances.       They have an addi
tional interest to us as well as to you, in reminding us of researches
made by the honoured parent whose example of scientific zeal
he so well emulates.     The observations that Sir      Herschel has
                                                                  J.
made in his recent communication, appear likely to lead to new
discoveries in optical as well as chemical science      and we trust  ;
that the papers already before us may be the forerunners of still
more striking and important results.
       Professor Wheatstone.
  It   is   with great pleasure thatI        address    you, and present to you
one of those Medals that our Royal Patroness has placed at the dis
posal of the Council of our Society. Your valuable experiments,
and the ingenious methods by which you have solved the difficult
question of Double Vision, form the immediate, and certainly suffi
cient motive, for their adjudication. It          is,
                                           however, still more satis
factory, as gives me, as their organ, the opportunity to mark their
               it
sense of the value of your other discoveries, of the science and in
genuity by which you have measured Electrical Velocity, and by
which you have also turned your acquaintance with Galvanism to
the most important practical purposes.
       Professor Daniell.
   In confiding to your charge, as our Foreign Secretary, the Rum-
ford Medal which the Council has awarded to M. Biot,         am sure      I
that every cultivator of the higher and more abstruse branches of
science will feel that     bestowed on
                          it   is         philosopher, whose optical
                                                a
researches on the curious and interesting subject of Polarized Light
are of the highest value.   You may, at the same time that you for
ward the Medal, assure M. Biot of the anxious wish of the Royal

                                        25C
     Society that he may be long enabled to carry on inquiries so honour
     able to   himself, and so important to more than one branch of
     science.
        Professor Daniell, I hold in my hand, and deliver to you one of the
     Copley Medals, which has been awarded by us to Professor Liebig.
     My principal difficulty, in the present exercise of this the most
    agreeable part of my official duty, is to know whether to consider
    M. Liebig's inquiries as most important in a chemical or in a phy
    siological light.   However that may be, he has a double claim on
    the scientific world, enhanced by the practical and useful ends to
    which he has turned his discoveries.       I hope that he may long be
    able to follow at the same time the paths of scientific research and
    practical utility.
        Professor Daniell, I have again to call on you, in your official
    capacity,   to transmit a Medal to the Continent.         The gentle
    man to whom we have adjudged it is M. Sturm, for his valu
    able mathematical labours, the fruits of which must be important,
    not only to mathematics, but also to those other high and abstruse
   sciences to whose advancement       algebraical analysis is a necessary
   instrument. In his solution, therefore, of a problem which has
   baffled some of the greatest mathematicians     that the world has pro
   duced, he has well earned the gratitude of every lover of natural
   knowledge.
       You will, Gentlemen, hear read an account of the eminent men
   connected with our Society whom we have had the misfortune to
  lose since last November.      Having confided the task of enumerating
  them to one of your Members, more able than myself to do justice
  to their merits, 1 shall not further touch upon the subject than to
  express my deep regret at the decease of one who had been my
  predecessor in this Chair, and to whose counsel    I might have looked
  for aid in any conjuncture of difficulty, with full reliance on his
 good sense and ability, and also on his zeal in any matter in which
 the interests of the Royal Society were at stake.     I may also be per
 mitted to express the condolence of all the Members of the Royal
 Society with the domestic affliction of our valued Treasurer by the
 decease of his father, who was also one of our Fellows.       I will now
 desire Dr. Roget to read the account of those whom we now miss
 from our ranks.
      The first name in the list of our deceased Fellows, which it is my
 melancholy duty to notice, is one which cannot be mentioned in this
 room, without feelings of deep regret for the loss of his services and
 of affectionate respect for his many virtues : it is hardly necessary
 for me to add that I refer to our late associate and former President,
 Mr. Da vies Gilbert.
     He was the only surviving son of the Rev. Edward Giddy, of St.
Erth in Cornwall, and his mother, whose maiden name was Davies,
was the representative of several ancient and distinguished families
in that county, and the heiress likewise of very considerable pro
perty.     His early education, which was almost entirely domestic, was

                                     257
-chiefly superintended by his father, who was an accomplished clas
 sical scholar; and in 1785 he became a gentleman commoner of
 Pembroke College, Oxford, where he attended the lectures of Dr.
 Beddoes on chemistry, Dr. Sibthorp on botany, and Mr. Hornby
 on geometry and astronomy, and devoted himself with very unu
 sual diligence to the study of mathematics and the natural sciences.
 He used to boast in after life, with very becoming pride, that he was
 the first student of his class in the University of Oxford, who had
ever read the Principia of Newton.
     In 1791, he was elected a Fellow of this Society, and became as
sociated from that time forward with the most eminent men of sci
 ence in the metropolis.        He had, in very early life, appreciated the
 extraordinary combination of poetical and philosophical genius in
 his friend and fellow-countryman Humphry Davy, at that time in
 a very humble capacity ; and by recommending him, first, as an as
 sistant to Dr. Beddoes in his experiments on the medical effects of
 gaseous inspirations, and, secondly, to the Royal Institution, he had
 the merit and good fortune of contributing to rescue from obscurity
  one of the greatest discoverers in modern chemistry.          In the year
  1 804, he became Member of Parliament for Helston, and in 1 806
  for Bodmin, a borough in his own immediate neighbourhood, which
  he continued to represent until the era of Parliamentary Reform in
  1832. He was emphatically the representative of scientific interests
  in the House of Commons, and contributed by his exertions to carry
  many very important projects, including amongst them the great
  breakwater at Plymouth and the bill for the revision of weights and
  measures ; a bill founded upon the report of a commission of which
  he was a member, in conjunction with Captain Kater, Dr. Young
  and Dr. Wollaston.
      Mr. Davies Gilbert was the author of Papers in our Transactions
  " On the Mathematical Theory of Suspension Bridges*," with parti
  cular reference to the Menai bridge, which was at that time in pro
  gress, and the curvature of which was considerably modified in con
                                                     "
  formity with the results of his calculations : — On the Progressive
  Improvements made in the Efficiency of Steam-engines in Cornwall,
  with investigations of the methods best adapted for imparting great
  Angular Velocities-]-," in which he first distinctly defined and made
  known to men of science what is termed the duty of steam-engines,
  from the correct observation of which so many important practical
                                       "
   improvements have followed : — On the Nature of Negative and
  Imaginary Quantities \" which contains many ingenious views, al
   though they have been in a great measure superseded by later
   speculations on this subject.      Mr. Gilbert was a mathematician of
   the old school ; but the papers to which we have just referred are
   very creditable specimens of the clearness with which he appre
   hended the bearing of some simple theoretical truths upon very
   important practical questions.

    He became President of this Society in 1828, on the resigna
tion of Sir Humphry Davy ; a situation from which he retired in
1831. He continued, however, for the remainder of his life, to take
a prominent part in the concerns of the Society ; and there are few
of my brother-Fellows, whom I have now the honour of addressing,
who have not had opportunities of observing and appreciating his
constant zeal for the interests of science, the variety and philoso
phical character of his conversation, the simple and unaffected elo
quence of his public addresses, and, above all, that sweetness of
temper and kindness of heart which beamed forth in the expression
of those truly classical and benevolent features, which one of the
most accomplished of our artists (himself a brother-Fellow) has so
happily perpetuated in the portrait which adorns these walls. The
very absence of that inflexibility of purpose and of opinion which
some might consider essential to the perfection of the character of
a philosopher, seemed, in his case, the proper developement of that
natural benevolence and humanity which made him so justly beloved
in every relation of life, whether as a husband, a father, and a brother,
— as a master, a landlord, and a friend.
    Mr. Gilbert was the author and editor of several antiquarian and
other works relating to his native county, whose interests he always
laboured to promote with more than common zeal and patriotism.
He was President of the Cornish Geological Society from the period
of its first establishment in 1814, and he never omitted attending
its meetings, though on the last occasion he was so weak as to be
compelled to resign the chair to his friend and countryman Sir
 Charles Lemon.      In 1808, he married Miss Gilbert, and assumed
 her name in 1817, on succeeding to a very large property in
 Sussex.    The same simple and unaffected character which distin
guished him in public life was still more conspicuous in his domestic
 relations. He died on the 24th of December last, and his body was
borne to the grave by his own labourers, and followed by his widow
and family in that primitive and unostentatious form which best
suited the simplicity and natural humility of his own character.
    Dr. Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield, was born in 1774, at
 Kenil worth, which was likewise the birth-place of two other contempo
 rary prelates of our church. He was educated at Rugby, and became
afterwards a member of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he
 gained the highest classical honours which the University could
 confer. In 1798 he was made Head Master of Shrewsbury School,
 over which he continued to presideduringaperiod of thirty-eight years.
 His great acquirements as a scholar, his eminent skill as a teacher,
 his active interest in the welfare of his pupils, and the tact and
 knowledge of character which he showed in their management, all
 contributed to raise the school to the highest reputation, and to give
it,  during many years, the pre-eminence over every other school in
 the kingdom in the number and rank of the academical honours
 which were gained by his scholars.       The date of his elevation to
 the Bench was nearly contemporaneous       with the appearance of that
 fatal disease which, after three years of the most depressing suffer

                                   259
ings, borne with most exemplary patience and resignation, brought
him to the grave.      He was a man of great cheerfulness of temper
and disposition, kind, affectionate and generous in every relation of
life, and justly the object of the grateful attachment and love of his
numerous pupils.
    Dr. Butler was the author of an elaborate edition of .(Eschylus,
with the notes and text of Stanly, and of several educational and
other works. He formed a very extensive library ; and his collection
of Aldines, which is unhappily now dispersed, was perhaps the
most complete in Europe.         One of his last works was an interest
ing memoir of Dr. John Johnstone, of Birmingham, with whom he
had long been connected by the bonds of the most affectionate
friendship.
    Mr. James Prinsep, whose brilliant career of research and dis
covery has been closed by a premature death in the flower of his age,
was Principal Assay Master, first of the Mint'at Benares, and secondly
of that of Calcutta, where he succeeded Professor Wilson in 1833; he
was a young man of great energy of character, of the most indefati
gable industry, and of very extraordinary accomplishments ; he was
an excellent assayist and analytical chemist, and well acquainted with
 almost every department of physical science ; a draughtsman, an en
 graver, an architect, and an engineer; a good Oriental scholar, and
 one of the most profound and learned Oriental medallists of his age.
    In 1828 he communicated to our Society a paper " On the Mea
 surement of High Temperatures," in which he described, amongst
 other ingenious contrivances for ascertaining the order, though not
 the degree, of high temperatures, an air-thermometer applicable for
 this purpose, and determined by means of       it, probably much more
 accurately than heretofore, the temperature at which silver enters
 into fusion.
     His activity whilst resident at Benares has more the air of ro
 mance than reality.     He designed and built    a   mint and other edi
 fices
     ;   he repaired the minarets of the great mosque of Aurengzebe,
 which threatened destruction to the neighbouring houses he drain
                                                              ;
 ed the city and made   a   statistical survey of it,and illustrated by his
 own beautiful drawings and lithographs the most remarkable objects
 which the city and its neighbourhood contains he made;         a  series of
 experimental    researches  on  the  depression  of the  wet-bulb   hygro
 meter he determined from his own experiments the values of the
      ;
 principal coins of the East, and formed tables of Indian metrology
 and numismatics, and of the chronology of the Indian systems and
 of the genealogies of Indian dynasties, which possess the highest
 authority and value.
     When transferred to Calcutta, he became the projector and editor
  of the " Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal," very voluminous
                                                          a
 publication, to which he contributed more than one hundred articles
 on a vast variety of subjects, but more particularly on Indian coins
 and Indian Palaeography.        He first succeeded in deciphering the
 legends which appear on the reverses of the Greek Bactrian coins,

                                     2 GO
   on the ancient coins of Surat, and on those of the Hindoo princes
   of Lahore and their Mahomedan successors, and formed alphabets
   of them, by which they can now be readily perused. He traced the
   varieties of the Devanagari alphabet of Sanscrit on the temples
   and columns of Upper India to a date anterior to the third century
   before Christ, and was enabled to read on the rocks of Cuttock
   and Gujarat the names of Antiochus and Ptolemy, and the record
  of the intercourse of an Indian monarch with the neighbouring
  princes of Persia and Egypt ; he ascertained that, at the period of
   Alexander's conquests, India was under the sway of Boudhist sove
  reigns and Boudhist institutions, and that the earliest monarchs of
  India are not associated with a Brahminical creed or dynasty. These
  discoveries, which throw a perfectly new and unexpected light upon
  Indian history and chronology, and which furnish, in fact, a satisfac
  tory outline of the history of India, from the invasion of Alexander
  to that of Mohammed Ghizni, a period of fifteen centuries, are only
  second in interest and importance, and we may add likewise in
  difficulty, to those of Champollion with respect to the succession of
  dynasties in ancient Egypt.
     These severe and incessant labours, in the enervating climate of
  India, though borne for many years with little apparent inconveni
  ence or effect, finally undermined his constitution ; and he was at
 last compelled to relinquish all his occupations, and to seek for the
 restoration of his health in rest and a change of scene.        He ar
 rived in England on the 9th of January last ; but the powers both
 of his body and his mind seemed to have been altogether worn out
 and exhausted ; and after lingering for a few months, he died on the
 22nd of April last, in the forty-first year of his age. The cause of
 literature and archaeology in the East could not have sustained a
 severer loss.
     Sir Anthony     Carlisle  was born at   Stillington, in the county
 of Durham, in the year 1768. After commencing his professional
 education at York, under the care of his uncle, he became a student
 at the Hunterian School of Anatomy, in Windmill Street, under
 Dr. Baillie and Mr. Cruikshank, where he attracted the particular
 notice of John Hunter.      He subsequently became a resident pupil
 of Mr. Henry Watson, one of the most eminent surgeons in the me
 tropolis, whom he succeeded at the Westminster Hospital in 1793.
 In 1800 he communicated to our Transactions a paper " On a Pecu
liarity in the Distribution of the Arteries sent to the Limbs of Slow-
 moving Animals."       This was followed by many others on various
points of comparative and human anatomy, including his papers
" On Muscular Motion," and " On the Arrangement and Mecha
nical Action of the Muscles of Fish," which formed the Croonian Lec
tures for 1804 and 1806.     He was the author likewise of many com
munications in the Transactions of the Linnean and Horticultural
Societies and in other contemporary journals, on different branches
of natural history and physical science.
    " An
            Essay on the Connexion between Anatomy and the Fine

                                     261
Arts,"    led  to his appointment, in 1808, to the Professorship of
Anatomy       to the Royal Academy, a situation which he filled with
great advantage to the students during a period of sixteen years.
    Sir Anthony Carlisle was not less distinguished for his know
ledge of anatomy, physiology, and natural history, than for his
professional merits, and for his patience and skill as an instructor
of medical students.       As a practitioner, he was invariably kind and
attentive to those who were entrusted to his care, and eminently
liberal in devoting his professional services to those who had no
adequate means of repaying them.
    Mr. Nicholas Aylward Vigors was born in 1787, at Old
 Leighlin, in the county of Carlow, where his family had long re
sided. After the usual preparatory education, he proceeded to the
 University of Oxford, where he became a very diligent and success
 ful student. On quitting the University, he purchased a commis
 sion in the Guards, and distinguished himself highly at the battle
 of Barossa, by continuing to bear the colours of his regiment after
  he was severely wounded.         On his return from the Peninsula, he
  was prevailed upon, by the earnest entreaties of his family, to quit
  the army ; and he devoted himself afterwards, with characteristic
 ardour, to scientific and literary pursuits.
    Mr. Vigors was one of the founders and the first Secretary of the
 Zoological Society, to whose museum he gave his very valuable
 collections of ornithology and entomology, which were the two
 branches of natural history he had most carefully studied. He
 was the author of a very elaborate paper in the Linnean Transac
 tions*, " On the Natural Affinities which connect the Orders and
  Families of Birds," in which he attempted to apply in detail the
 same principles of arrangement that Mr. MacLeay had previously
 sketched out in his Horce Entomologicce,        in a more general way,
 as applicable to the whole animal kingdom.          He afterwards pub
 lished, in conjunction with Dr. Horsfield, another very valuable
 memoirf on the Birds of Australia, grounded upon a rich collection
 from that country, in the possession of the Linnean Society, which
 they described and arranged according to their natural affinities.
 He was likewise the principal editor, during several years, of the
 " Zoological Journal," in which he wrote many memoirs,
                                                                chiefly de
 voted to the further exposition of his views with respect to the
 affinities of birds, but some of them descriptive of new or rare
  Mammalia, or new forms of exotic insects or birds.
     Mr. Vigors was a man of very considerable attainments as a
 scholar as well as a naturalist, and made a liberal use of an ample
 private fortune in the promotion of those sciences which he culti
 vated : he was the representative      in Parliament, for some years be
 fore his death, first of the city, and lastly of the county of Carlow.
     Mr. Rick man was born in 1771, and educated at Westminster
 School, from whence he proceeded as a student to Christ Church,
 Oxford.      Early in life he was recommended by Dean Jackson as

 Secretary to Mr. Abbott, the Speaker of the House of Commons,
 and was chosen to examine and digest the Parliamentary returns
 under the first Population Act in 1800, a duty which he continued
 to perform at the three succeeding decennial periods, and was pre
paring to discharge it for the fifth time during the present year,
when he was attacked by the disease which terminated in his death.
 He was appointed second Clerk Assistant to the House of Com
 mons in 1815, and subsequently Clerk Assistant, an office which
 he continued to hold for the remainder of his life.
    The introductions to the " Population Returns," of which he was
 the author, are remarkable for the very able analysis which they
 contain of the general condition, changes and prospects of all classes
 of the population.
    Mr. Hickman was an excellent classical scholar, and was, in ad
dition to many other attainments, extremely well acquainted with
 many branches of engineering and practical mechanics.          He was
the intimate friend, and after his death the executor, of the late
Mr. Telford, whose autobiography he published, with a preface and
an atlas of engravings descriptive of his principal works, which is
in every way worthy of the fame of that great engineer.
    Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, member of the Royal Academy and
a distinguished architect, was a member of a family which has long
been honourably connected with the arts.        He was born in 1766,
and acquired a knowledge of his profession under the instructions
of his father and uncle, and was subsequently employed, during
many years, in the somewhat ambiguous capacity of architect and
builder in the execution of many considerable works. In 1824 he
was selected by George IV., to whom he had been formerly known,
to design and superintend the magnificent alterations and additions
to Windsor Castle, a truly royal and national work, in which he
succeeded in combining uncommon external grandeur and strict
architectural propriety with great convenience and splendour of
internal arrangements.      Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, besides many im
portant original  works,  made   very extensive additions to the princi
pal  mansions  of our nobility, including Chatsworth, Longleat, Wo-
burn, Badminton, and Ashridge.         He was a man of sound judg
ment and great integrity, and was very generally beloved for the
remarkable simplicity and frankness of his manners, his great kind
ness of heart, and cheerful and unaffected good humour.         He died
in February last, and was buried in St. George's Chapel, at Windsor,
in a vault which he had himself prepared for the reception of the
remains of a beloved daughter, who died in the flower of her age.
    Captain Charles Phillipps, of the Royal Navy, was the author
of several inventions of great value in navigation, and in the equip
ment and management of ships : such are his methods of suspending
compasses so as to avoid concussions in time of action ; his improve
ment of the pump-dale of ships, and more particularly the capstan,
which bears his name, and which is in general use in the Navy. He
was an active and enterprising officer, who had seen much service
during the last war, had been eminently successful in rescuing

                                       263
  slaves off the coast of Africa,       and had nearly fallen a victim, in
  common with the greatest part       of  his crew, to that pestilential cli
  mate.
     Sir Robert Seppings received his education as a shipwright under
  the late  Sir John Henslow, Surveyor of the Navy, and continued
  in connexion with the important service of our dock-yards during a
  period of fifty years.      He was the author of many important im
  provements    in our   naval architecture, including his system of dia
  gonal bracing and trussing, which formed the subject of two memo
 rable Papers in our Transactions in the years 1814* and 1818 f, and
 which attracted an unusual amount of public attention. The great
 principle of this method was such an arrangement of the principal
 timbers as would oppose a powerful mechanical action to every
  change of position of the ribs and other timbers in every part of
  the ship ; thus firmly compacting together the entire fabric, and
 preventing that perpetual racking of beams and working of joints,
 which, in the ancient system of ship-building, produced hogging,
 creaking, leakage, and rapid decay ; and filling up likewise every
 vacuity between the timbers, which were occasionally the unavoid
 able receptacles       for foul air, filth, vermin, and various other
 sources   of rottenness and disease.
     These important improvements, though opposed to the inveterate
 prejudices of the older shipwrights, a body of men who have not
 sufficiently valued and understood, in this country at least, the just
 principles of mechanical action, in the practical operation of ship
 building, were universally adopted in the Navy under the enlight
 ened administration of Mr. Charles York, and the powerful advo
                               J
cacy of Sir John Barrow : and the merit of their author was ac
 knowledged by his appointment as Surveyor of the Navy, and by
 the award of the Copley Medal of this Society.
     This was not the only important improvement which Sir Robert
 Seppings introduced into our system of naval architecture. The
 Admiralty presented him with £1000 as a reward for his simple
yet most useful invention of an improved block for supporting ves
sels, by which their keels and lower timbers were much more easily
and promptly examined and repaired.            His plan for lifting masts
out of the steps, which superseded the employment of sheer hulks
for that purpose, has been the means of saving much expense and
labour.     His new mode of framing ships has led to a much more ex
tensive use of short and small timbers, which were formerly of little
value ; but the most valuable of all the reforms of construction for
which the Navy of England is indebted to him, was the substitution
of round for flat sterns, which afford increased strength to the frame
work of the ship, greater protection against pooping in heavy seas,

an almost equal power of anchoring by the stern and by the bow, a
more secure and effective position for the rudder, and a stout platform
for a powerful battery, embracing a sweep of more than 180°. This
capital improvement was strenuously opposed by many distinguished
naval officers, who regretted the loss of those magnificent cabins,
which were better suited for purposes of state than of service ; but
the good sense of less prejudiced judges happily prevailed, and se
cured for our ships of war an additional claim upon the respect of
 our enemies.
     Foreign nations have not been tardy to acknowledge the value of
these important improvements, and their author received many sub
stantial proofs of their sense of his merits ; and we may safely affirm,
that in the national record of the great benefactors of their country,
there are few names which will deserve, and, we trust, continue to
receive, a more grateful commemoration         than that of Sir Robert
 Seppings.
     It has long been the practice of the Royal Society to associate
with its body those persons in our country who are most eminent
 for their high rank or their commanding talents, for their distin
 guished public services, for their accomplishments            in the arts,
 for their attainments in literature, for the important influence which
 their virtues or labours may have exercised upon the character and
prospects of society, or upon the general interests of humanity ;
 wisely judging that science will gain both in the enlargement of its
 objects and in the dignity and estimation of its cultivators, by being
 thus united with whatever is best entitled to command and to re
 ceive the admiration and respect of mankind : it is amongst this
 class of our Members that I have to notice several losses of more
 than ordinary importance.
     The Earl of Mansfield was a nobleman of illustrious family,
 who, in addition to many other accomplishments,           was one of the
 most elegant and effective parliamentary orators of his day.
     Lord Holland was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and a
 nobleman who was remarkable for his profound knowledge of the con
 stitutional history of his country, and for the extent and variety of his
 literary attainments*.    It was the remark of a well-known philoso
 phical author and writer, " that there was something so sweet in the
  blood of the Foxes, that no one could approach them without feeling
                                            "
  the fascination of their social powers :    and there was probably no
  man of his age who was the object of more enthusiastic love and
  admiration of his friends, private and political, than Lord Holland.
      Sir William Sidney Smith was a hero in the most chivalrous
  period of our naval history, the scenes of whose early triumphs have
  so recently been rendered illustrious by others of an equally memo
  rable character.
      Sir John Lubbock was one of those persons engaged in trade
  whose extensive transactions and liberal views give dignity to the

  of Lope de Vega, accompanied by some beautiful translations of his more
   remarkable poems.

operations of commerce : it is not one of the least distinctions of
such a father, that his name and honours have been inherited by one
whose profound acquirements in the most difficult branches of sci
ence have merited and received the highest honours which this So
ciety is able to confer.
    In our foreign list we have to lament the loss of three of our
most illustrious members, Blumenbach, Olbers, and Poisson.
    John Friedhich Blumenbach was born on the 11th of May,
1752, at Gotha, where his father was Prorector of the Gymnasium.
He was accustomed to attribute the formation of his taste for lite
rary history and the study of the natural sciences to the instructions
and encouragement of Menz and Christ, two professors of Leipsig,
who were friends and fellow-townsmen of his father. After study
ing for some time at Jena, he removed to Gottingen, for the pur
pose of completing his medical course, where he was very favour
ably noticed by Heyne and Michaelis, and more particularly by
Biittner, Professor of Natural History, a great linguist, and a man
of very extraordinary acquirements, whose museum of medals and
natural history, when afterwards purchased by the University, he
was employed to arrange.      The skill and diligence which he showed
in this employment, and the reputation of his professional and other
attainments,   secured him the appointment of Extraordinary Pro
fessor of Medicine in 1776, and of Ordinary Professor in 1778, a
situation which he continued to hold for nearly sixty years.
    His lectures comprehended Natural History, Comparative Anato
my, Physiology and Pathology, on all which subjects he published
many valuable memoirs and other works, more particularly his
admirable Manuals, which have long enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity, and which have been translated into nearly every great
 European language.
     The first of this series of publications was the " Handbuch der
 Naturgeschichte," which appeared in 1779.          In his " Institutiones
 Physiologicae," a work equally remarkable for the originality, pre
 cision and clearness of its statements, which was published in 1787,
 he made known his views on the " bildungs trieb," or " Nisus for-
 mativus," which he had before announced in the Gottingen Trans
 actions for 1785, and which he made the subject of a special work
 in 1789*. His " Specimens of the Physiology of Warm- and Cold
 blooded Animals," appeared in 1789.        In 1794, he published in our
 Transactions, " Observations on some Egyptian Mummies opened in
 London in 1792," with especial reference to the three distinct varie
 ties of national physiognomy which appear amongst them.               His
 " Handbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie" appeared in 1805, and
 showed how fully he already appreciated the important views of
  Cuvier, which elevated Comparative Anatomy from a merely de
 scriptive science to one which was capable of the most instructive
 generalizations, and affording the means of distinguishing types and
 laws of formation, as well for different organs as for different classes
  of  animals.

      The term nisus formativus was employed by Blumenbach to denote
that vital power which is innate in all living organized bodies, and in
active operation during the whole period of their vital existence,
by which they are controlled and modified with reference to a speci
fied end ; it is that power by which the organizable matter of every
individual being assumes, at its conception, its allotted form ; which
form is also capable of successive modifications by nutrition, accord
ing to the purpose for which it is destined by the Author of Nature,
as well as of the reparation (within prescribed limits) of the injuries
which it may have received.             The announcement of this principle
was received with extraordinary favour by physiologists, though it
differed in little more than in name from the vis essentialis of the
celebrated Wolff. It will be found to have formed the basis of some
of his important speculations.
      Blumenbach's well-known collection of the crania of the different
 races of mankind was made with a view to their more accurate
classification, and gave rise to some of his more celebrated pub
 lications*.       According to his ultimate views, he would make the
 Caucasian race the primary stem, from which all the others have
 degenerated to the Mongol at one extremity, and the jEthiopic at
 the other, interposing the American variety between the Caucasian
 and the Mongol, and the Malay between the Caucasian and the
 iEthiopic      : it is difficult, however, to arrive at very correct general
 conclusions on this very interesting subject, without reference to
 those which are founded on the analogies of language, as has been
 done by Cuvier and Prichard.
       It is quite impossible, within the short compass to which this
  notice is necessarily confined, to convey more than a very general
  impression of the vast variety of the labours of this distinguished
  philosopher. We find him applying his knowledge of natural his
  tory in illustration of the arts and poetry of antiquity ; he was   f
  also one of the first naturalists who appreciated the importance
  of a knowledge of fossils in determining the relative ages of the
  strata of the earth J.         He had cultivated archaeology and literary
 history § from his earliest years with more than common interest and
  zeal. There were, in fact, few departments of knowledge and litera
  ture, however remotely connected with the natural sciences, which
  he has not illustrated by his writings : it was when thus travelling

own, that he was accustomed to quote the adage of Seneca : " Soleo
et in aliena castra transire, non tanquam transfuga, sed tanquam
explorator."
    Blumenbach had long been considered as the patriarch of the
University of Gottingen, and was allowed the full privileges attached
to his distinguished reputation, to the memory of his long services,
and to the respect due to his venerable old age ; he retained his
usual cheerfulness, his memory, and much of his ancient activity,
until nearly the close of his life. He died on the 22nd of January
last, in the 88th year of his age, a memorable proof that the tran
quil pursuits of science and the gentle stimulus of constant though
not laborious employments are equally favourable to contentment of
mind and length of days.
    The name of the venerable Dr. Olbers, of Bremen, must be for
ever memorable in the annals of astronomy, as the discoverer of two
planets in oursystem. Hewasamemberof that remarkable association
of twenty-four astronomers which the indefatigable Baron de Zach of
 Gotha had formed towards the close of the last century, who under
took the vigilant observation of as many zones of the heavens, with a
general view of discovering new comets and planets, and of recording
any remarkable phenomena       that might occur.     Their zeal in the
prosecution of these researches had been stimulated by the recent
discovery of Herschel, as well as by the revival of a suggestion
made by Kepler of the probable existence of a planet between
 Mars and Jupiter, in conformity with one of those mystical ana
logies, which might have been treated as the visionary dreams
of an enthusiast, if they had not been so intimately connected with
the discovery of the great laws forming the true basis of all cor
rect knowledge of the system of the universe.        The absence like
wise of a planet at the distance from the sun, represented by 28, that
of the earth being 10, interfered with the completeness of an em
pirical law which Bode of Berlin had suggested, and was not with
out its influence in confirming their faith in these extraordinary an
ticipations. The labours of this Association had been hardly organ
 ized, when the remarkable discovery of Ceres by Piazzi on the first
 day of the present century, in almost the precise position which
 Bode's singular law had assigned to    it,seemed at once to convert
their dreams into realities.    Dr. Olbers calculated  a  circular, and
 Gauss an elliptic orbit for the same planet and so wonderful was
                                              ;
the accuracy of the first approximation to the elements which the
latter had made, that they enabled Olbers to re-discover       iton the
 1st of January 1802, exactly one year after       had been first ob
                                                  it
 served.  It  was in consequence of having formed      a  configuration
 of stars in the geocentric route of this planet, with view to its
                                                           a
 being more readily found, that he discovered Pallas on the 2.5th of
 March of the same year*, at nearly the same distance from the sunt,

though moving in an orbit more than three times as much inclined
to the plane   of the ecliptic. The discovery of two planets, in the po
sition where one of them had been so anxiously sought for *, induced
Dr. Olbers to conjecture that they were fragments of a larger planet,
which had been scattered by some great catastrophe, and that
many others probably existed at nearly the same distance from the
sun, and possessing common nodes : he therefore earnestly recom
mended astronomers to observe most carefully those spaces of the
heavens in which the nodes of these planets are placed ; a practice
which he himself observed for many years.               His exemplary dili
 gence was rewarded by the discovery of Vesta on the 29th of March,
  1807, nearly in the precise position in which he had conjectured that
 it was most likely to be found f. This was the last of those remark
 able discoveries whose history illustrates in so striking a manner that
 union of profound, yet somewhat visionary speculation, with uncon
 querable perseverance, which is so characteristic of the German
 nation.
    His well-known method of calculating the orbits of comets, which
 has been so generally used by German astronomers, was published
 at Weimar in 1797J, with a commendatory preface by his zealous
 friend the Baron de Zach. This memoir, independently of its other
 merits, is sufficient to show that its author was a mathematician        of
 very considerable powers, and perfectly acquainted with the works
 of contemporary astronomers.
    Dr. Olbers was a diligent observer of comets ; and there are few
 astronomers who have contributed so much to our knowledge of
 these singular bodies.      He was the discoverer of several comets, in
 cluding the celebrated comet of long period of 1815; and we are
 indebted to him, not merely for very important suggestions and ob
 servations respecting the celebrated comet of Encke, but still more
 for having developed the taste for astronomical calculations and
 observations of that great astronomer, who for many years served
 him in the capacity of assistant in his observatory.
    The Baron de Zach visited this observatory in September, 1800 §,
 and has described the simple apparatus which enabled him to make
 so many important discoveries.        It was placed in the upper part of
 his house in the midst of the town of Bremen, and afforded openings
 or platforms sufficient to afford a command of nearly every point of
 the heavens.     His instruments were an excellent five-foot Dollond
 of Sf inches aperture, with a circular micrometer (which he used in
 the observation of the small planets), a five-foot reflecting telescope
 and that of Pallas 27676 : the difference is less therefore than 19,000
miles.

  of fourteen, under the care of his uncle, M. L'Enfant, surgeon, at
  Fontainebleau, with a view to the study of his profession.     It was
  at the central school of this place that he was introduced to the no
  tice of M. Billy, a mathematician of some eminence, who speedily
  discovered and fostered his extraordinary capacjty for mathematical
  studies.   In 1793 he was elected a pupil of the Ecole Polytechnique,
  which was then at the summit of its reputation, counting amongst
  its professors Laplace, Lagrange, Fourier, Monge, Prony, Berthollet,
  Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Guyton Morveau, and Chaptal. The pro
 gress which he made at this celebrated school surpassed the most
 sanguine expectations of his kind patron, M. Billy, and secured him
 the steady friendship and support of the most distinguished of his
 teachers.
     In the year 1800, he presented to the Institute a memoir " Sur
le nombre d'integrales completes dont les equations aux differences
 finies sont susceptibles," which cleared up a very difficult and ob
 scure point of analysis.     It was printed on the recommendation of
 Laplace and Lagrange in the Memoires des Savans Etrangers, an
 unexampled honour to be conferred on so young a man.
     Stimulated by this first success, we find him presenting a succes
 sion of memoirs to the Institute on the most important points of
 analysis, and rapidly assuming the rank of one of the first geometers
 of his age. He was successively made Repetiteur and then Professor
 of the Polytechnic School, Professor at the College de France and
 the Faculte des Sciences, Member of the Bureau des Longitudes,
 and finally, in 1812, Member of the Institute.
     His celebrated memoir on the invariability of the major axes of
 the planetary orbits, which received the emphatic approbation of
 Laplace, and secured him throughout his life the zealous patronage
 of that great philosopher, was presented to the Institute in the year
 1808.      Laplace had shown that the periodicity of the changes
 of the other elements, such as the eccentricity and inclina
 tion, depends on the periodicity of the changes of the major
 axis ; a condition, therefore, which constitutes       the true basis
 of the proof of the stability and permanence of the system of
 the universe.     Lagrange had considered this great problem in the
 Berlin Memoirs for 1776, and had shown that, by neglecting certain
 quantities which might possibly modify the result, the expression
  for the major axis involved periodical inequalities only, and that
  they were consequently incapable of indefinite increase or dimi

                                     270
nution. It was reserved to Poisson to demonstrate a priori that the
non-periodic terms of the order which he considered would mu
tually destroy each other ; a most important conclusion, which re
moved the principal objection that existed to the validity of the
demonstration of Lagrange*.
    This brilliant success of Poisson in one of the most difficult pro
blems of physical astronomy, would appear to have influenced him in
devoting himself thenceforward almost exclusively to the application
of mathematics to physical science ; and the vast number of memoirs
and works (amounting to more than 300 in number) which he pub
lished during the last thirty years of his life, made this department
of mathematical science, and more particularly whatever related to
the action of molecular forces, pre-eminently his own. They compre
hend the theory of waves and of the vibrations of elastic substances,
the laws of the distribution of electricity and magnetism, the pro
pagation of heat, the theory of capillary attraction, the attraction
of spheroids, the local magnetic attraction of ships, important pro
blems on chances, and a multitude of other subjects, which the
time allowed for this notice will not permit me to mention.                   His
well-known treatise on Mechanics is incomparably superior to every
similar publication in the clear and decided exposition of principles
and methods, and in the happy and luminous combination of the
most general theories with their particular and most instructive ap
plications.
    Poisson was not a philosopher who courted the credit of propound
ing original views which did not arise naturally out of the immediate
subjects of his researches ; and he was more disposed to extend and
perfect the application of known methods of analysis to important
physical problems, than to indulge in speculations on the inven
 tion or transformation of formulae, which, however new and elegant,
 appeared to give him no obvious increase of mathematical power in
 the prosecution of his inquiries.        His delight was to grapple with
 difficulties which had embarrassed the greatest of his predecessors,
 and to bring to bear upon them those vast resources of analysis, and
 those clear views of mechanical and physical principles in their most
 refined and difficult applications, which have secured him the most
 brilliant triumphs in nearly every department of physical science.
    The confidence which he was accustomed to feel in the results of
 his analysis — the natural result of his own clear perception of the
 necessary dependence of the several steps by which they were de
 duced — led him sometimes to accept conclusions of a somewhat
    * The
            publication of this memoir recalled the attention of this illustrious
 mathematician to a subject which he had long neglected, and gave rise to
 three of his noblest memoirs.     Poisson, in his " Memoire sur le Mouve-
 nient de la Lune autour de la Terre," has not satisfactorily shown that
 the major axis of the moon's orbit contains no argument of long period
 amongst the terms which involve lower powers of a certain quantity m,
 which denotes the ratio of the sun's mean motion to that of the moon,
 than the fourth ; a demonstration of this most important proposition has
 been given by Sir John Lubbock in the Philosophical Magazine for the
 present year.

                                  271
startling character *. such were his views of the constitution and finite
extent of the earth's atmosphere, which some distinguished philoso
phers have ventured to defend.        It is not in mathematical reason
ings only that we are sometimes disposed to forget that the conclu
sions which we make general are not dependent upon our assumed
premises alone, but are modified by concurrent or collateral causes,
which neither our analysis nor our reasonings are competent to
comprehend.
    The habits of life of this great mathematician          were of the
most simple and laborious kind ; though he never missed a meet
ing of the Institute, or a lecture, or an examination, or any other
public engagement, yet on all other occasions, at least in his later
years, he denied access to all visitors, and remained in his study
from an early hour in the morning until six o'clock at night, when
he joined his family at dinner, and spent the evening in social con
verse, or in amusements of the lightest and least absorbing charac
ter, carefully avoiding every topic which might recall the severity of
his morning occupations.       The wear and tear, however, of a life
devoted to such constant study, and the total neglect of exercise and
healthy recreations, finally undermined his naturally vigorous con
stitution, and in the autumn of 1838 the alarming discovery was
made that he was labouring under the fatal disease of water in the
chest. The efforts of his physicians contributed for a time to mitigate
the more serious symptoms of his malady ; but every relaxation of
his sufferings led to the resumption of his labours ; and to the
earnest remonstrances of his friends, and the entreaties of his family,
 he was accustomed to reply, that to him la vie citait le travail; ,nay,
 he even undertook to conduct the usual examinations of the Ecole
 Polytechnique, which occupied him for nearly ten hours a day for
 the greatest part of a month. This last imprudent effort ended in an
 attack of paralysis, attended by loss of memory and the rapid ob
 scuration of all his faculties; he continued to struggle, amidst alter
 nations of hope and despondency, for a considerable period, and died
 on the 25th of April last, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.
     Poisson was eminently a deductive philosopher, and one of the
 most illustrious of his class ; his profound knowledge of the labours
 of his predecessors, his perfect command of analysis, and his extra
 ordinary sagacity and tact in applying   it, his clearness and precision
 in the enunciation of his problems, and the general elegance of
 form which pervaded his investigations,         must long continue to
 give to his works that classical character, which has hitherto been
 almost exclusively appropriated to the productions of Lagrange,
 Laplace, and Euler.     If  he was inferior to Fourier or to Fresnel in
  the largeness and pregnancy of his philosophical views, he was in
  comparably superior to them in mathematical power      : if some of his
 contemporaries rivalled or surpassed him in particular departments
 of his own favourite studies, he has left no one to equal him, either
 in France or in Europe at large, in the extent, variety, and intrinsic
 value of his labours.
    The last work on which he was engaged was          atreatise on the
 theory of light, with particular reference to the recent  researches of

                                        272
   Cauchy : nearly two hundred pages of this work'are printed, which
   are altogether     confined to generalities,    whose applications were
   destined to form the subject of a second and concluding section :
   those who are acquainted with the other works of Poisson will be
   best able to appreciate the irreparable loss which optical science
   has sustained in the non-completion of such a work from the hands
   of such a master.

  SIR JOHN W. LUBBOCK, Bart., V.P.                and Treas., in the Chair.
     A Memorandum,      addressed to the Royal Society, November 28th,
  1840, by Martin Barry,     M.D., F.R.S., L. & Ed., was read.
     Dr. Barry, in reference to the memorandum       of Mr. Wharton Jones,
  claiming for himself the contemporaneous        discovery of the germinal
  spot in the mammiferous ovum, states that, after having bestowed
  considerable pains to ascertain who was the original observer of a
  structure which has proved to be of great importance, he had men
 tioned incidentally in his paper the result of his inquiry, namely, that
 the merit of the discovery was due to Professor Rudolph Wagner ; but
 observes that the inquiry may be resumed by all who will take the
 trouble to examine the works, both in German and English, on this
 subject ; and that he will ever be open to conviction, and ready to de
 clare his change of opinion, on the production of sufficient evidence.
     A communication     was also read, entitled " Supplementary Note
 to a Paper, entitled ' Researches in Embryology. Third Series:
                                                "
 a Contribution to the Physiology of Cells.'       By Martin Barry, M.D.,
 F.R.S..L.&     Ed.
    In the paper referred to, the author had shown, that after the ovum
 of the Rabbit has entered the Fallopian tube, cells are found col
lected around its thick transparent membrane or
                                                         " zona pellucida";
which cells, by coalescing,    form  a  thinner membrane — the incipient
chorion. He    now    adds, that the formation   of this thinner membrane
does not exhaust the whole layer of these cells ; but that a stratum
of them is found remaining on, and entirely surrounding the " zona",
after the thinner membrane has risen from it. The fluid space also,
between the
               " zona" and the thinner membrane, presents a
                                                                      large
number of cells or discoid objects, each of which contains a bril
liantly pellucid and highly refracting globule. In some parts, several
of these discs, closely joined together, have the appearance of shreds
of membrane ; in others, there are found pellucid globules, some of
which are exceedingly minute.           The discs now mentioned collect
at the periphery, for the thickening of the chorion. They seem to
                                      B

                                      280
           from the region of the
                                      " zona" ; and probably have their
proceed
origin in the cells by which the latter is surrounded.       If so, the au
thor thinks we cannot suppose them to arise in any other way than
that which, according to his observations, appears to be the universal
mode of reproduction ; namely, by division of the nuclei of the pa
rent cells.     Nor can we suppose that minuteness is any hinderance
to their subsequent increase by the same means.

        " Present  state of the Diamond Mines of Golconda." By T. J.
Newbold, Esq., of the Madras Army, A.D.C. to Major-General
Wilson, K.B.         Communicated      by S. H. Christie, Esq., M.A.,
Sec.   R.S.
    The author gives an account of the tract of country in which the
diamond mines of Golconda are situated, and of the processes by
which the diamonds are obtained.            The latter consist merely in
digging out the rolled pebbles and gravel, and carrying them to small
square reservoirs, raised on mounds, having their bottom paved with

 Joule, Esq.      Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The inquiries of the author are directed to the investigation of the
 cause of the different degrees of facility with which various kinds of
 metal, of different sizes, are heated by the passage of voltaic elec
 tricity.   The apparatus he employed for this purpose consisted of a
 coil of the wire, which was to be subjected to trial, placed in a jar
 of water, of which the change of temperature was measured by a very
 sensible thermometer immersed in it : and a galvanometer, to indicate
 the quantity of electricity sent through the wire, which was estimated
 by the quantity of water decomposed by that electricity. The con
 clusion he draws from the results of his experiments is, that the ca
 lorific effects of equal quantities of transmitted electricity are pro

                                    281
portional to the resistances opposed to its passage, whatever may be
the length, thickness, shape, or kind of metal which closes the cir
cuit : and also that, ceteris paribus, these effects are in the duplicate
ratio of the quantities of transmitted electricity ; and consequently
also in the duplicate ratio of the velocity of transmission.     He also
infers from his researches that the heat produced by the combustion
of zinc in oxygen is likewise the consequence of resistance to electric
conduction.                           •

 Martin Barry,    M.D.,  F.R.S.S. L. & E.
   The author of this communication, after pointing out the similarity
in appearance between an object noticed by him in the mammiferous
ovum, and the incipient chorda dorsalis described by preceding ob
servers in the ova of other Vertebrata, mentions some essential dif
ferences between his own observations and those of others as to the
nature and mode of origin of these objects, and their relation to sur
rounding parts.     Von Baer, the discoverer of the chorda dorsalis,
describes this structure as
                               " the axis around which the first
                                                                  parts of
the foetus form."     Reichert supposes it to be that embryonic struc
ture which serves as
                         " a support and stay " for parts
                                                             developed in
two halves.    The author's observations induce him to believe that,
instead of being
                   " the axis around which the first parts of the foetus
form," the incipient chorda is the last-formed row of cells, which
have pushed previously-formed cells farther out, and that, instead of
                 " a support and stay " for
being merely                                    parts developed in two
halves, the incipient chorda occupies the centre out of which the
" two halves " originally proceeded as a single structure, and is it
self in the course of being enlarged by the continued origin of fresh
substance in its most internal part.
   The author enters into a minute comparison of the objects in ques
tion ; from which it appears that the incipient chorda is not, as Baer
supposed, developed into a globular form at the fore end, but that
the linear part is a process from the globular ; and that the pellucid
cavity contained within the latter — a part of prime importance, being
the main centre for the origin of new substance — is not mentioned

                                   283

                         "                         " of
of this naturalist (the central nervous system          Reichert) is not
simultaneous with, but anterior to, that of the chorda.
   The author then reviews the observations of Rathke and Reichert
on the chorda dorsalis, which contain internal evidence, he thinks,
of a process in the development of Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds, the
same as that which he has observed in Mammalia ; namely, the ori
gin of the embryo out of the nucleus of a cell.
   And it is his opinion that this observation may assist to solve a
question on which physiologists are not agreed ; for it shows, that if
the nucleus of a cell is a single object, the first rudiments of the
embryo are not two halves.      The author thinks that unless the very
earliest periods are investigated, it is in vain that we attempt to
learn what that is, of which the rudiments of the embryo are com
posed.   From not attending to this, physiologists have supposed
their " primitive trace" to arise in the substance of a membrane,
which the author, in his second series on the embryo, showed could not
be the case. To the same cause he thinks is referable an opinion re
cently advanced by Reichert, that the first traces of the new being
are derived from cells of the yelk.

   A  paper was read, entitled,
                                  " On  the Corpuscles of the Blood."
 Part II. By Martin Barry, M.D., F.RS.S. L. and E.
   The observations recorded in this memoir are founded on an ex
amination of the blood in every class of vertebrated animals, in some
of the Invertebrata, and in the embryo of Mammalia and Birds. The
nucleus of the blood-corpuscle, usually considered as a single object,
is here represented as composed, in some instances, of two, three,
or even many parts ; these parts having a constant and determinate
form. In the substance surrounding the nucleus, the author has
frequently been able to discern, not merely " red colouring matter,"
but cell-like objects ; and he points out an orifice as existing at cer
tain periods in the delicate membrane by which this substance is
 surrounded.    In  a former memoir   he had differed no less from pre
vious observers regarding " cells."      He had shown, for instance,
 that the nucleus of the cell, instead of being " cast off as useless,
and absorbed," is a centre for the origin, not only of the transitory
contents of its own cell, but also of the two or three principal and
last-formed cells, destined to succeed that cell; and that a separation
of the nucleus into two or three parts, is not, as Dr. Henle had sup
posed in the case of the Pus and Mucus-globule (the only instances

                                   284
 in which the separation in question had been observed), the effect
of acetic acid, used in the examination, — but that such separation is
natural, apparently common to nuclei in general, and forming part
of the process by which cells are reproduced.        The author had far
ther shown the so-called nucleolus to be not a distinct object ex
isting before the nucleus, but merely one of a series of appearances
arising in succession, the one within the other, at a certain part of
the nucleus, and continuing to arise even after the formation of the
 cell. These views he now confirms ; and in the present paper shows
 that they admit of being extended to the corpuscles of the blood.
    He then compares appearances observed in the latter with those
he had traced in the ovum.       These relate to the number of parts of
which the nucleus is at different periods composed, — the nature of
the nucleolus, — the communication between the nucleolus and the
exterior of the cell, — the formation of the contents of the cell out of
the nucleus, — the final division of the nucleus into the foundations
of a limited number of young cells, destined to succeed the parent
cell, — and the escape of the young cells for this purpose.     It follows
from these investigations, that the corpuscles of the blood are gene
rated by a process essentially the same as that giving origin to those
cells which are the immediate successors of the germinal vesicle, or
original parent cell ; it being also by a continuation of the same
process that the corpuscle of the blood divides itself into the minuter
objects figured by the author in his former paper on the blood.
    He adds, that in its form and internal state, the blood-corpuscle
found in the adult of certain animals, very much resembles that ex
isting only in the foetal life of others.   It is incidentally remarked,
that the foetal brain, at certain periods, appears to consist almost
entirely of objects very much resembling those which, in some stages,
form the nuclei in the foetal corpuscles of the blood.
    The author concludes, by expressing his opinion, that the mode
 of evolution of the minute mammiferous ovum is deserving of close
attention, in connexion with some of the processes by which nourish
ment is communicated, and the growth of the body effected, at all
future periods of life.

The MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                       President, in the Chair.
     The reading of a paper entitled, " On the action of certain Inor
ganic Compounds when introduced directly into the Blood."               By
James Blake, Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Sec. R.S., was resumed and concluded.
     The present paper is a continuation of a memoir read at the Aca
demic des Sciences of Paris, in 1839, and entitled, " EfFets de di
verses substances salines, injectees dans le systeme circulatoire *.
     After some preliminary remarks on the mode in which the ex
periments were conducted, and on the assistance derived from the
 hemadynamometer of Poiseuille (or instrument for measuring the
 pressure of the blood circulating in the vessels), the author gives a
 list of the various saline substances of which he noted the effects
 when they were severally injected either into the venous or the
 arterial systems, arranged according to the nature of those effects.
 He finds, in general, that all the salts having the same base exert
 similar actions when introduced directly into the blood.               He
 carefully inquires into the phenomena apparently arising from the
 direct contact of each of the substances above enumerated with the
 animal tissues ; and more particularly into the effects produced on
 the heart, on the muscular and the nervous tissues, and on the pul
  monary and systemic capillaries.
     The first series of experiments related are those on the action of
 the salts of magnesia : these are found, when introduced in any
  quantities into the blood, to arrest altogether the action of the heart ;
  but a still more remarkable effect which results, is the complete pro
  stration of muscular power.      The salts of zinc have a similar opera
  tion under the same circumstances, but produce the same effects in
  smaller quantities.     The action of the salts of copper, of lime, of
  strontia, of baryta, and of lead, are considered successively in the
  order in which they are more closely related by their physiological
  actions.   The author particularly notices the peculiar action which
  the salts of the three last-named substances exercise on the muscular
  tissues, occasioning contractions in them during many minutes after
  death produced by their introduction into the blood. These mus
  cular movements were, in some cases, observed forty-five minutes
  after the cessation of the heart's action. Experiments with the salts
  of silver and of soda are then detailed ; substances, which exhibit a
  remarkable    similarity in their actions on the pulmonary tissue, on
  the heart, and on the systemic capillaries : for while, in the case of
  all the other salts already mentioned, death seems to be produced
  by the destruction of the irritability of the heart, the fatal result
  with the salts of silver and of soda is the consequence of their action
  on the tissue of the lungs. The physiological actions of the salts of
      * Published in the "Archives Generates de Medecine   ; Nov. 1839."

                                      2SC
  ammonia and of potass were found by the author not to correspond
  with any of the preceding.      Although agreeing perfectly with one
  another in their action upon the heart and systemic capillaries, they
 differ extremely in their effects on the nervous tissue ; ammonia
 being particularly distinguished from all inorganic compounds in
 this respect, and being very analogous to poisons derived from or
 ganic products, which it also resembles in its chemical properties.
     The general conclusion which the author is led to draw from these
 researches is, that there exists a close relation between the chemical
 properties of the substances experimented upon, and their physiolo
 gical effects ; his experiments tending to prove, that, when introduced
 into the blood, substances which are isomorphous exert similar ac
 tions on the living tissues.      He notices, however, two exceptions
 to this law ; namely, the similarity of the actions exerted on the pul
 monary tissue by the salts of lead with those of silver, although these
 salts are not isomorphous ; and also the action on the nervous tissue
 of the salts of ammonia being different from that of the salts of potass.
 But he remarks that the oxide of lead bears a close analogy to the
 oxide of silver in its relation to organic compounds.      The general
 fact previously announced by the author in his memoir read to the
 Academy of Sciences at Paris, namely, that salts with the same base
 have analogous actions, may be considered as a corollary of the
 above law.

into the Society.
    A                             " On someElectro-Nitrogurets."
       paper was read, entitled,                                       By
Wm. Robert Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    The author states that he has made many attempts to render per
manent     the ammoniacal amalgam, and that he has succeeded in
freezing it by means of solid carbonic acid, during which solidification,
and also while in its solid state, it underwent no chemical change.
He subsequently attempted to procure a permanent compound by
electrolyzing a solution of hydrochlorate of ammonia with an ex
tremely fusible alloy at the cathode ; but this attempt was unsuc
cessful.    It then occurred to him, that by using an oxidable metal
at the   anode,  which could be revived in conjunction with nascent
hydrogen and nitrogen at the cathode, one or both of these elements
might be combined with the solid metal, and so form permanent
compounds.
   The experiment made in this manner with the metals zinc, cad
mium,    and copper, was perfectly successful.     A spongy mass col-

                                   287
 lected at the cathode, which floated upon the liquid, and which,
 when washed and dried, was analysed by heating in a tube retort ;
 five grains of the zinc compound gave 0-73 of a cubic inch of perma
 nent gas, which on examination proved to be nitrogen with one-
 fourth hydrogen. The same quantity of the cadmium compound
 gave 0-207 cubic inch of nitrogen with no admixture of hydrogen.
A like weight of the copper compound gave 0'107 of nitrogen.
No ammonia was evolved from either ; and the author is inclined to
think that the hydrogen yielded by the zinc compound resulted from
the reaction of the metal upon combined water.        The specific gra
vity of specimens of these substances which the author tried were
respectively 4, 6, 4, 8, and 5, 9. A mixed solution of chloride of
gold and hydrochlorate of ammonia, electrolyzed with platinum elec
trodes, gave a black powder of the specific gravity 10-3 ; five grains
of which, being heated, gave only 0-05 cubic inch of gas.           The
author proceeds to observe, that the similarity in appearance and
mode of formation of these compounds and of the mercurio-ammo-
niacal amalgam, is strong evidence of identity of constitution, and that
the non-permanence of the latter substance is due to the mobility of
the mercury ; for if we place the compounds in similar circumstances,
that is, solidify the mercurial one, or liquefy those of the other me
tals, the phaenomena are perfectly analogous.         The experiments
also bear immediately upon those of Thenard, Savart, and others,
where ammonia, passed over heated metals, was found to be decom
posed more completely by the oxidable than by the inoxidable me
tals, and to alter their physical characters without materially in
creasing their weight.     On examining papers connected with this
subject, the author found that Mr. Daniell had cursorily noticed a
deposit somewhat analogous to those here treated of, which was
formed upon the negative plate of his constant battery when this
was charged on the zinc side with hydrochlorate of ammonia, and
the nature of which that gentleman observed was worthy of further
examination, but had not had time to investigate.

netism, No. 2."      By Major Edward Sabine, R.A., V.P.R.S.
    This paper is the second of a series, in which the author purposes
to communicate to the Royal Society the results of magnetic ob
servations in different parts of the globe, having for their object to
                                   c

                                      288
  supply the requisite data for deducing the numerical elements corre
  sponding to the present epoch of the general theory of terrestrial mag
  netism.     It consists of two sections ; the first comprises the obser
  vations of Captain Belcher, R.N., and the officers of H. M. S. Sul
  phur, at twenty-nine stations on the west coast of America, and the
  adjacent islands, between the latitudes of 60° 21' N. and 18° 05' S.
  The second contains a new determination, by the same officers, of the
  magnetic elements at Otaheite, made in consequence of the discre
  pancies in the results obtained by previous observers, and of a note
  in M. Gauss's Allgemeine Theorie, in which Otaheite is spoken of
  as a highly important station for the future improvement of the cal
  culations of the theory. Abstracts are given of the original obser
  vations which are deposited in the Hydrographic Office of the Ad
  miralty, as well as a full detail of the processes of reduction by which
  their results have been computed.       The values of the horizontal and
  total intensities are expressed in terms by which the results of ob
  servation are immediately comparable with the maps of MM. Gauss
  and Weber in the " Atlas des Erdmagnetismus."

      By an investigation into the " probable error of a single inde
  pendent determination of the magnetic intensity with Hansteen's
  apparatus, derived from the data furnished by Captain Belcher's ob
  servations, the author shows the extreme improbability that the
  differences in the results obtained at Otaheite by Messrs. Erman,
 FitzRoy and Belcher, should be occasioned by instrumental or ob
 servational error. They are also far greater than can, with any de
 gree of probability, be ascribed to periodical or accidental variations
 in the magnetic force from its mean value.         The only known cause
 adequate to their explanation is what may with propriety be termed
 Station error ; that is, local disturbing influences, in an island com
 posed chiefly of volcanic rocks, and where the spot of observation
 selected by the different observers may not have been precisely the
 same.
     By a reference to the magnetic survey of the British Islands, the
 occurrence of station error is shown to be frequent in countries of
 far less decided igneous character than Otaheite ; and that its exist
 ence may always be apprehended where rocks of that nature approach
 to, or rise through, the superficial soil.   The absolute determinations
 of fixed observatories are as liable to station error as those of the mag
 netic traveller, since no continuance or repetition of the observations
 can lead to an elimination of the error ; it consequently presents a
practical difficulty to the proposed determination of the elements
of the theory from exact observation at only a few selected positions
on the globe.        The remedy is to be found in the combination of
fixed observatories      and magnetic surveys : the observations of the
survey,    being  made   in concert with, and based on those of the fixed
observatory,     will be  furnished thereby with corrections for the se
cular, periodical, and accidental variations of the elements, and will
consequently      determine mean values : and a proper combination of

    A paper was also read, entitled, " On the Calculation of Attrac
tions, and the Figure of the Earth." By C. J, Hargreave, B.A.,
of University College. Communicated by John T. Graves, M.A.,
F.R.S., Professor of Jurisprudence, University College, London.
    The principal object of the calculations contained in this paper
is to investigate the figure which a fluid, consisting of portions,
varying in density according to any given law, would assume, when
every particle is acted upon by the attraction of every other, and by
a centrifugal force arising from rotatory motion.        That such has
been the original condition of the earth has been assumed as the
foundation of most of the mathematical calculations connected with
this inquiry ; although the hypothesis itself may admit of doubt.
The principal difficulty of this problem consists in the computation
of the attraction of a body of any given figure, and composed of
strata varying in their densities according to any given law.      In sol
ving it, the author follows the steps of Laplace as far as the point
where the equation, known by his name, first appears.             It has,
however, since been discovered by Mr. Ivory, that the theorem of
Laplace is true only of spheroids of a particular kind, and conse
 quently it is to this kind that Laplace's solution of the problem is re
stricted. The method given in the present paper is not confined in
 its operation to any particular class of spheroids ; the coefficients of
 the series into which the required function is developed being deter
 mined absolutely, and without reference to the form of the spheroid
 to which they are to be applied.     The principal change consists in
 the different manner of treating the partial differential equation ;
 and its integration, effected by the author, renders the analysis more
direct, the operations more simple, and the theory complete.

   The reading of a paper, entitled, " Memoir on a portion of the
Lower Jaw of    an Iguanodon, and other Saurian Remains discovered
in the strata of Tilgate Forest, in Sussex." By Gideon Algernon
Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   When the author communicated to the Royal Society, in the year
1825, a notice on the teeth of an unknown herbivorous reptile,
found in the limestone of Tilgate Forest, in Sussex, he was in hopes
of discovering the jaws, with the teeth attached to     of the same
                                                            it,
fossil animal, which might either confirm or modify the inferences
he had been led to deduce from an examination of the detached
teeth.   He was, however, disappointed in the object of his search
until lately, when he has been fortunate enough to discover a por
tion of the lower jaw of    young individual, in which the fangs of
                            a
 many teeth, and the germs of several of the supplementary teeth,
 are preserved.    The present paper  is  occupied with     aminute and
 circumstantial description of these specimens, and an elaborate in
quiry into the osteological characters and relations presented by the
 extinct animals to which they belonged, as compared with existing
 species of Saurian reptiles ; the whole being illustrated by numerous
 drawings. The comparison here instituted furnishes apparently con
 clusive proof that the fossil thus discovered       portion of the lower
                                                is
                                                a
jaw of reptile of the Lacertine family, belonging to genus nearly
           a                                                a
 allied to the Iguana. From the peculiar structure and condition of
 the teeth    appears evident that the Iguanodon was herbivorous
               it                                                        ;
 and from the form of the bones of the extremities     itmay be inferred
 that it was enabled, by its long, slender, prehensile fore-feet, armed
 with hooked claws, and supported by its enormous hinder limbs, to
 pull down and feed on the foliage and trunks of the arborescent
 ferns, constituting the flora of that country, of which this colossal
 reptile appears to have been the principal inhabitant.
     Some particulars are added respecting various other fossil bones
  found in Tilgate Forest, and in particular those of the Hylaosaurus,
 or Wealden Lizard (of which genus the author discovered the re
 mains of three individuals), and of several other reptiles, as the
 Megalosaurus, Plesiosaurus, and several species of Steneosaurus,
Pterodactylus, and other Chelonia, as also one or more species of        a
bird allied to the Heron. All these specimens are now deposited in
the British Museum.

                                 " Miscellaneous Observations    on the
 Torpedo."   By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.
   The experiments described in this paper were made on a single
fish, of middle size, recently taken out of the water. Portions of
the electrical organs, cut transversely in thin slices, exhibited under
the microscope     many elliptical particles,    apparently blood-cor
puscles, the long diameter of which was about 1 -800th, and the
short about l-1000th of an inch, and a few filaments, apparently
nervous, irregularly scattered ; some of them tortuous, and all about
the 2000th of an inch in diameter.      The latter bore no resemblance
to muscular fibres.    The blood contained some globular particles,
having a diameter of the 4000th of an inch, mixed with the elliptical.
The mucus for lubricating the surface was found to contain globules
apparently homogeneous in substance, but of irregular outline, and
in size varying from the 2000th to the 270th of an inch.
   A  paper was also read, entitled,

the   Diamond."    By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S.L.,
V.P.R.S. Ed.
   On re-examining the phenomena of parallel bands of light
and shade exhibited by reflexion at the plane surface of a diamond,
which the author had noticed some years ago, he concludes that
they result from the reflexions of the edges of veins or laminae, of
which the visible terminations are inclined at different angles, not
exceeding two or three seconds, to the general surface.        He gives
 an account of several analogous facts observable in other crystals,
more especially those of carbonate of lime, artificially polished in
surfaces inclined to the natural planes of cleavage.

Sir   JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK,                Bart., V.P.   and Treasurer,
                              in the Chair.
    The following papers were read :
    1.
       " On a Cycle of Eighteen Years in the Mean Annual Height of
the Barometer in the Climate of London ; and on a Constant Varia
tion of the Barometrical Mean, according to the Moon's Declina
tion."    By Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S.
    For obtaining the general results communicated in the present
paper, the author has followed the same method as that he had
adopted in the two former papers laid before the Society on the con
nexion of the barometrical variation with the lunar phases and apsides.
Tables are given of the barometrical averages on successive solar
years, from 1815 to 1832, so constructed as to exhibit the variation
of the moon's influence according to her declination ; and also of
 these averages on successive cycles of nine solar years, classed
 according to the moon's place in declination, on either side of the
 equator.    The results deduced from these comparisons are, first,
 that the barometrical mean in this climate is depressed by the moon's
 declination being to the south of the equator ; and, secondly, that
 this depression takes place gradually, commencing with the moon's
 being in full north declination, and proceeding through her remain
 ing positions to the time when she crosses the equator to resume the
 northern declination ; at which season, the whole pressure that had
 been withdrawn from the atmosphere is suddenly restored.            The
 author thinks there is evidence of a great tidal wave, or swell in the
 atmosphere, caused by the moon's attraction, preceding her in her
 approach to, and following her slowly as she recedes from these la
 titudes ; so that were the atmosphere a calm fluid ocean of air, of
  uniform temperature, this tide would be manifested with as great re
 gularity as those of the ocean of waters.   But the currents uniformly
  kept up by the sun's varying influence effectually prevent this from
  taking place, and involve the problem in complexity. He finds that
  there is also manifested in the lunar influence a gradation of effect,
 which operates through a cycle of eighteen years.       The mean pres
  sure of the atmosphere during the first part of this period increases ;
  and then, after preserving for a year its maximum amount, again
  decreases through the remaining years of the cycle, but exhibits,
 towards its minimum, some fluctuations before it again regularly
 increases.
     2. " On a remarkable depression of the Barometer in November
  1840, agreeing very closely in its movements and results with that
  of December 1821." By Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S.
     The object of the author in the present paper  is to show the close
  correspondence of the extraordinary depression    of the barometer in
  the months of October and November of last        year (1840), and of
  the remarkably stormy weather which prevailed      at the same period,

                                    293
 with similar phenomena occurring in December 1821, when the
 moon's place in declination underwent the same changes during
 those two periods, at an interval of nineteen years.

The    MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON, President, in                   the Chair.
    The following communications were read, viz. —
    1. The reading of a paper entitled, " On the Localities affected
by Hoar-frost, the peculiar currents of Air excited by it, and the
Temperature during its occurrence at High and Low Stations." By
James Farquharson, LL.D., F.R.S., Minister of the Parish of Alford,
was resumed and concluded.
    The author states that he has been accustomed, for the last forty
years, to make observations on the occurrence of hoar-frost, and the
 circumstances under which it takes place, with a view of obtaining
 a correct explanation of the causes of that phenomenon.        It is well-
 known, he observes, that the localities chiefly affected with hoar
 frost are the bottoms of valleys, and land-locked places of all kinds,
 whether natural or artificial. The altitude to which its effects reach
 on the sides of the valleys is dependent on the mean temperature of
 the day and night at the time of its occurrence : when that tempe
 rature is high, the lower places only are affected by the frost ; but
 when low, the frost extends to much higher grounds. Hoar-frost occurs
 only during a calm state of the air, and when the sky is clear ; but
the stillness of the air in the bottoms of the valley is invariably ac
companied by downward currents of air along all the sloping sides
 of the valley ; and it is to this fact, first noticed by the author, that
he wishes more particularly to direct the attention of the Society, as
affording a decisive proof of the correctness of the views he entertains,
being in accordance with the theory of Dr. Wells. He finds that
 after sunset, in all seasons of the year, and at all mean temperatures
 of the air, and whether or not the ground be covered with snow,
whenever the sky is clear, although there may be a dead calm at the
bottoms of the valleys, currents of air, more or less strong and steady,
run downwards on the inclined lands, whatever may be their aspect
with reference to the points of the compass. These currents are the
result of the sudden depression of temperature sustained by the sur
face of the earth in consequence of rapid radiation, by which the
stratum of air in immediate contact with that surface, becoming spe
cifically heavier by condensation, descends into the valley, and is
replaced by air which has not been thus cooled, and which therefore
prevents the formation of hoar-frost on the surface of these declivi
ties.

 at   the bottom of running water."     By James Farquharson, LL.D.>
  F.R.S., Minister of the Parish of Alford.
     The author brings forward in this paper several recent observa
 tions on the formation of ice at the bottom of rivers, the conditions
 of which corroborate the views regarding the cause of that pheno
 menon, which he presented in a paper on this subject, published in
 the Philosophical Transactions for 1835 (p. 329), namely, that it
 occurs in consequence of the loss of heat by radiation from the bot
 tom of the water, in a manner precisely analogous to the formation
 of hoar-frost on the surface of dry land, as first explained by Dr.
 Wells. He then answers some of the objections to that theory pro
 pounded in an article, under the title of Gbound-Gru, in the Penny
 Cyclopaedia, and shows that those objections are founded in error,
 and possess no validity.

    8.  " Note  on an irregularity in the Height of the Barometer, of
 which the argument is the Declination of the Moon." By Sir John
William Lubbock, Bart., V.P. and Treas. R.S.
    In the Companion to the British Almanac for 1839, the author
inserted some results which were obtained with a view of ascertain
ing the influence of the moon on the barometer and on the dew-
point. Mr. Luke Howard's researches on this subject having re
called his attention to that paper, he found that some of the results
he had given appeared to indicate that the moon's position in decli
nation influences the barometer.     In order to render this more ma
nifest, he combines in the present paper all the observations he gave
in the Companion to the British Almanac in three categories. These
observations correspond to different angular distances of the moon
from the sun, or times of transit ; but as the inequality of the ocean,
of which the argument is the moon's declination, is independent, or
very nearly so, of the time of the moon's transit, it is probable that so
also is that in the height of the barometer.       In this case we may
with propriety combine in the same category observations which
correspond to similar declinations, although to different times of
transit. The results stated by the author seem to indicate an ele
vation of nearly one-tenth of an inch for 17 degrees of declination.

                                   296
The inequality has a contrary sign to the inequality of the same ar
gument in the tides of the ocean.

    " My Lord, — I   have the honour of transmitting to Your Lordship
for presentation to the Royal Society, an original portrait of Sir
Isaac Newton by Vanderbank, a Dutch painter of some note in that
age.
    " This picture has now been many years in my possession, and the
tenure by which     I have kept it (as a collateral descendant of so
illustrious a man) was too flattering not to have been a source of
great personal gratification.
    " But I consider such a portrait to belong of right to the scientific
world in general, and more especially to that eminently distinguished
Society of which Newton was once the head, and which is now so
ably presided over by Your Lordship.
    " I have, therefore, to request Your Lordship will do me the
honour to present this original portrait of Sir Isaac Newton to the
Royal Society in my humble name.
    " Accident having destroyed some of the papers of my family, I
am unable of myself to trace the entire history of this portrait, but I
believe more than one member of the Royal Society is competent to
do so, and it is well known to collectors ; and a small mezzotinto
engraving of it was published about forty years ago. It was painted
the year before Newton died, and came into the family of the cele
brated Lord Stanhope, who left it by his will to my grandfather,
the late Dr. Charles Hutton, a distinguished member of the Royal
Society, expressly on the well-authenticated account of that eminent
mathematician having been remotely descended from Sir Isaac New
ton, in the following way, as I find on a family manuscript ; viz.
'
  that the mother of the well-known James Hutton and the mother
of Dr. Charles Hutton were sisters ; and the grandmother of James
Hutton and the mother of Sir Isaac Newton were also sisters.'
    " I have ever considered this very distant connexion with so great
a man should not be an inducement to lead me into any but casual
mention of the circumstance, that I might avoid the imputation of
a vain boast ; nor would it have been brought forward now, except

                                        297

Rev. W. Walton, F.R.S.
    The author shows that if the mouth of a rain-gauge be placed in
any plane which is not perfectly horizontal, the results will be liable
to inaccuracy, whatever may be the direction in which the rain falls.
He thinks that, on many occasions, the drops of rain diminish in
their size during their descent on entering warmer regions of the
atmosphere, so as finally to disappear.

 Communicated by S. H. Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
    The Kin, which is the stringed instrument here described, was
 the one played upon by Confucius and the sages of antiquity, and is
 therefore held sacred by men of letters. It is made of the Woo-tung,
 or Dryandria cordifolia.        It is convex above and plane below, and is
 wider at one end than at the other ; it has two quadrangular aper
 tures in the plane surface, which open into as many hollows within
 the body of the instrument : and it is furnished with seven silken
 strings of different diameters, which pass over the smaller end, and
are distributed between two immovable pegs below.                 A bridge
 within a short distance of the wider extremity gives these strings
 the necessary elevation and a passage to the under surface, where, by
 means of a row of pegs, they are tightened or relaxed at pleasure.
 The length of the sounding-board is divided by thirteen studs of
 nacre, or mother-of-pearl, as a guide for the performer; and they
 are placed so that the length of each string is bisected, trisected, &c,
 that is, divided into aliquot parts as far as the eighth subdivision, with
 the omission of the seventh, the number of sections being repre
 sented by the arithmetical series
                              2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 8.
 Thus the intervals, or magnitudes of the different tones sounded by
 this instrument, do not accord with those produced on our violin,
 but agree more with the old Scotch music. The study of this in
 strument, and the art of playing upon it, are rendered extremely
 difficult by the complexity of the Chinese notation of written music,
 which leads to frequent omissions and blunders. Thus every air
 which a Chinese plays has cost him the labour of many months to
 learn; and so tiresome is this acquisition, that the author has heard

                                     29S
  some extemporize very prettily without being able to play a single
  air. Their performance, however, is very graceful ; and though the
  melody be simple, every scope is given to variety by the mode of
  touching the strings. The author enters into an examination of the
  musical theory of the sounds produced by this instrument.

    The birds usually met with by the author in this island were
petrels and penguins ; and besides these, he found two species of
gull, a duck, a shag, a fern, a small albatros, and a species of Chionis ;
and also a remarkable nocturnal bird allied to the Procellaria.     Brief
notices are given of the forms and habits of these birds.

the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
   The northern extremity of the island is described as being entirely
of volcanic origin. The trap rocks, of which the headlands are com
posed, form a succession of terraces nearly horizontal. Basalt is the
prevailing rock : it assumes the prismatic form, and passes into
greenstone, and the various modifications of amygdaloid and por
phyry. The general direction of the mountain-ranges inclines to
the south-west and north-east, and they vary in height from 500 to
2500 feet. Many of the hills are intersected by trap dykes, usually
of basalt.    Several conical hills, with crater-shaped   summits, are
found, evidently the remains of volcanic vents.     Three or four very
singular isolated hills, composed of an igneous slaty sandstone, occur
in Cumberland Bay, presenting very smooth outlines, and consisting
of piles of broken fragments, through which the mass protrudes, in
places, in prismatic columns.      Vast quantities of debris are accu
mulated at the base of the hills, in many places to the height of 200
or 300 feet or more, affording strong evidence of the rapid disinte
gration this land is undergoing, from the sudden atmospheric vicis
situdes to which it is exposed.
    The whole island is deeply indented by bays and inlets, and its
surface intersected    by numerous small lakes and water courses.
These, becoming swollen by the heavy rains, which alternate with
frost and snow, rush down the sides of the mountains and along the
ravines in countless impetuous torrents, forming, in many places,
beautiful foaming cascades, wearing away the rocks, and strewing
the platforms and valleys below with vast fragments of rocks and
slopes of rich alluvium, the result of their decomposition.
    The most remarkable geological feature in the island is the occur
 rence of fossil wood and coal, and what is still more extraordinary,
these are imbedded in the igneous rocks.        The wood, which is for
the most part highly silicified, is found enclosed in the basalt ;
whilst the coal crops out in ravines, in close contact with the over
lying porphyritic and amygdaloidal greenstone.
    A few outline sketches of the rocks and scenery, in various parts
of the island, accompany this paper.

  through a cycle of eighteen years, or periods of the Moon's Declina
  tion." By Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
     In this paper the author investigates the periodical variations of
  the winds, rain and temperature, corresponding to the conditions of
  the moon's declination, in a manner similar to that he has already
  followed in the case of the barometrical variations, on a period of
  years extending from 1815 to 1832 inclusive. In each case he gives
 tables of the average quantities for each week, at the middle of which
 the moon is in the equator, or else has either attained its maximum
 north or south declination. He thus finds that a north-east wind is
 most promoted by the constant solar influence which causes           it,
                                                                   when
 the moon    is about the equator, going from north to south      that a
                                                                   ;
 south-east wind, in like manner, prevails most when the moon               is
 proceeding to acquire    asouthern declination    that winds from the
                                                        ;
 south and west blow more when the moon            in her mean degrees
                                                        is
 of declination, going either way, than with a full north or south
 declination ;  and that a north-west wind, the common summer and
 fair weather wind of the climate, affects, in like manner, the mean
 declination, in either direction, in preference to the north or south,
 and most when the moon         coming north.
                               is
    He finds the average annual depth of rain, falling in the neigh
 bourhood of London,      is
                           25-17 inches.
    From his observations on the temperature, he deduces the follow
ing conclusions: —   1.  That the pressure of an atmospheric tide,
which attends the approach of the moon to these latitudes, raises
the mean temperature 0-35 of         degree.
                                      a        2. That the rarefaction
under the moon in north declination lowers the temperature 0-13
of a degree.      3. That the northerly swell following the moon
as she recedes to the south further cools the air 0-18 of       degree.
                                                                  a
4. That this cold continues while the moon        away south, reducing
                                                      a is
the mean temperature yet lower by 0-04 of        degree.

        " A new Method of solving Numerical Equations."               By Mr.
Thomas Weddle, of Stamfordham. Communicated           S. H. Christie,

Esq., M.A., Sec. R.S.
   The object of this paper     to develope
                                is             new and remarkably
                                                      a
simple method of approximating to the real roots of numerical equa
tions, which possesses several important advantages.      After de
scribing the nature of the  transformations which  are subsequently

                                            301
employed,    the author proceeds to develope the process he uses for
obtaining   one  of the roots of a numerical equation.       Passing over
the difficult question of determining the limits of the roots, he sup
poses the first significant figure (R) of a root to have been ascertained,
and transforms the proposed equation into one whose roots are the
roots of the original, divided by this figure                    one root of this
                                                      ^or

decimal part   isobtained, and the equation transformed into another
whose roots are those of the former, divided by             1  this decimal
                                                                 +

transformations being readily effected by the methods first given.
Proceeding thus, the root of the original equation          obtained in the

form of  a continued product. After applying this method to finding
a root of an equation of the 4th, and likewise one of the 5th degree,
the author applies      to
                         it  class of equations to which he considers

   3. " Additional Note on the Contraction of Voluntary Muscles in
the living body." By William Bowman, Esq., F.R.S., Demonstrator
of Anatomy in King's College, London, and Assistant Surgeon to
King's College Hospital.
  This communication contains              short account of some recent ex
                                            a
aminations made by the author on the human muscular fibre affected
by tetanus.      The effect of the violent contractions which character
ize this disease,      to produce, in many parts of the muscles, con
                        is
 siderable ecchymosis, which gives the contiguous portions               a pale
and gray aspect.       In other places the muscles lose, in great mea
                                                                   a
sure, their fine fibrous character, and exhibit       a  soft mottled surface,
which   is easily torn.     The primitive fasciculi, when microscopically
examined,     present indications of strong contraction, appearing
swollen into a fusiform shape, and having their transverse striae in
some parts much more closely approximated, and in others separated
to much greater distances than in the natural state, or even altogether
obliterated, in consequence of the whole texture being broken up
into those primitive elements of which the discs are constructed and      ;
frequently they are broken across without         a    corresponding rupture
of the sarcolemma.
    The author      led from his observations to the conclusions, — 1st,
                   is
that the contraction of muscle     a       the essential cause of its rupture
                                            is                                 ,
2ndly, that there        no
                         is  repellent   force   between the contractile ele
ments of   muscular    fibre    and,
                                   ;  lastly,  that the contraction of volun
tary  muscle  is  not a  sustained   act  of the  whole  congeries of contrac
tile elements composing it, but a„rapid series of partial acts, in which
all duly share, becoming by turns contracted and relaxed.
    The paper  is  accompanied by drawings cf the microscopic appear
ances therein described.

      L " Investigation of a New and Simple Series, by which the
 Ratio of the Diameter of a Circle to its Circumference may easily
 be computed to any required degree of accuracy."               By William
 Rutherford, Esq., of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
  Communicated by Samuel Hunter Christie, Esq., M.A., Sec. R.S.
      Among various formulae for the rectification of the circle discovered
 by the author, he has found the one given in this paper to be that
 best fitted for computation : and he has been enabled by means of
 it, with comparatively little labour, to extend the number, express
 ing the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, to 208 places of
  decimals, a degree of accuracy hitherto unattainable, without a great
  amount of labour, by means of any of the series which have yet been
  employed.
      The celebrated series of Mr. John Machin, for the rectification of
  the circle, is derived from the formula
                          =4  tan     —.—tan           ,
                        4             5           239
  which converges with considerable rapidity, but gives rise to tedious
  computations, in consequence of the divisor 239 being a prime num
  ber.     But by converting the above formula into the following,
                    —  =4 tan           tan    — +tan      —  ,

  a series is obtained by which the extended       computation   above men
   tioned was readily effected.
       The methods of computation are then        stated in detail, and the
  resulting value of n- is given to 208 places    of decimals, which is pre
   sumed to be accurate to the last figure,       the computations    having
   been actually carried as far as 210 figures.

   stances exposed to polarised light."      By Sir David Brewster, K.H.,
   D.C.L., F.R.S., & V.P.R.S. Ed.
       From a theoretical investigation of the phenomena described in
   this paper, the author deduces the important law, that when two
   polarized pencils, reflected from the surface of a thin plate, lying on
    a reflecting surface of a different refractive power, interfere, half an
    undulation is not lost, and white-centred rings are produced. When
    the inclination is exactly 90°, the pencils do not interfere, and no
    rings are produced.

M.D., M.R.C.S.        Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart.,
F.R.S.
   The young gentleman who is the subject of this memoir had been
affected from birth with strabismus of both eyes ; the right eye was
amaurotic, and the left deprived of sight by the opacity both of the
crystalline lens and of its capsule. At the age of seventeen, an ope
ration for the removal of the cataract of the left eye was performed
by the author with complete success.        On opening the eye for the
first time, on the third day after the operation, the patient described

                                    304
his visual perception as being that of an extensive field of light,    in
which everything appeared dull, confused, and in motion, and           in
which no object was distinguishable.      On repeating the experiment
two days afterwards, he described what he saw as a number of opake
watery spheres, which moved with the movements of the eye, but
when the eye was at rest remained stationary, and their margins
partially covering one another.      Two days after this the same phe
nomena were observed, but the spheres were less opake and some
what transparent ; their movements were more steady, and they ap
peared to cover each other more than before.         He was now for the
first time capable, as he said, of looking through these spheres, and
of perceiving a difference, but merely a difference, in the surround
ing objects.     The appearance of spheres diminished daily ; they be
came smaller, clearer, and more pellucid, allowed objects to be seen
more distinctly, and disappeared entirely after two weeks.        As soon
as the sensibility of the retina had so far diminished as to allow the
patient to view objects deliberately without pain, ribands differently
coloured were presented to his eye. These different colours he could
recognize, with the exception of yellow and green, which he fre
quently confounded when apart, but could distinguish when both
were before him at the same time.         Of all colours, gray produced
the most grateful sensation : red, orange and yellow, though they
excited pain, were not in themselves disagreeable ; while the effect of
violet and of brown was exactly the reverse, being very disagreeable,
though not painful. Brown he called an ugly colour : black pro
duced subjective colours ; and white gave rise to a profusion of musca
volitantes.    When geometrical figures of different kinds were offered
 to his view, he succeeded in pointing them out correctly, although
he never moved his hand directly and decidedly, but always as if
feeling with the greatest caution. When a cube and a sphere were
 presented to him, after examining these bodies with great attention,
 he said that he saw a quadrangular and a circular figure, and after
 further consideration described the one as being a square, and the
 other a disc, but confessed that he had not been able to form these
 ideas until he perceived a sensation of what he saw in the points of
 his fingers, as if he really touched the objects.    Subsequent experi
 ments showed that he could not discriminate a solid body from a
 plane surface of similar shape ; thus a pyramid placed before him,
 with one of its sides towards his eye, appeared as a plane triangle.
     Two months after the above-mentioned operation, another was
 performed on both eyes, for the cure of the congenital strabismus,
 by the division of the tendons of the recti interni muscles, which pro
  duced a very beneficial effect on the vision of the left eye ; and even
 the right eye, which had been amaurotic, gained some power of per
  ceiving light, and, from being atrophied, became more prominent.
  Still it was only by slow degrees that the power of recognizing the
  true forms, magnitudes, and situations of external objects was ac
  quired.    In course of time, the eye gained greater power of con
  verging the rays of light, as was shown by the continually increasing
  capacity of distinct vision by the aid of spectacles of given powers.

    4. " On   the Fossil Remains of Turtles discovered in the Chalk
Formation of the South-East of England."            By Gideon Algernon
 Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.
    In this paper the author gives a description, accompanied with
 drawings, of a remarkable fossil Turtle, referable to the genus Emys,
 and named from its discoverer, Mr. Bensted, the Emys Benstedi,
which has been lately found in a quarry of the lower chalk of Kent,
at Burham, which is situated near the banks of the Medway, between
 Chatham and Maidstone.         The specimen discovered consists of the
 carapace or dorsal shell, six inches in length and nearly four inches
in breadth, with some of the sternal plates, vertebrae, eight ribs on
each side of the dorsal ridge, a border of marginal plates, and one
of the coracoid bones.      It is adherent to a block of chalk by the
external surface of the sternal plates.         The marginal plates are
joined to each other by finely indented sutures, and bear the impress
of the horny scales or tortoise-shell, with which they were originally
covered.    The expanded ribs are united together throughout the
proximal half of their length, and gradually taper to their marginal
extremities, which are protected by the plates of the osseous border.
Mr. Bell considers the species to which it belonged as being closely
allied in form to the common European Emys, and as possessing a
truly fluviatile or lacustrine character.     The plates of the plastron,
however, as also the coracoid bone, resemble more the corresponding
bones of marine than of freshwater turtles.

    The following papers were read, viz. —
         " On the Compensations of Polarized Light, with the
     1.                                                          descrip
 tion of a Polarimeter for Measuring Degrees of Polarization."         By
 Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., and V.P.R.S. Ed.
     In four papers published in the Philosophical Transactions for
 1830, the author maintained, in opposition to the prevailing theory,
 that light either reflected or refracted at angles different from that
 at which it is completely polarized, does not consist of two portions,
 one completely polarized, and the other completely unpolarized,
 but that every portion of it has the same physical property, having
 approximated in an equal degree to the state of complete polarization.
 This conclusion, which had been derived from reasoning on the hy
 pothesis that a pencil of light, composed of two pencils polarized
 respectively at angles of + and — 45° with the plane of reflexion,
 was equivalent to a pencil of common light, is confirmed in this
 paper by experiment, made with common light itself, reflected from
 different parts of the atmosphere, and from which the uniaxal or
 biaxal systems of rings were obtained.      On placing such a system
 between light partially polarized in an opposite plane, the author
 found that the rings disappeared, the direct system being seen on one
 side of the plane of disappearance, and the complementary system
 on the other side.     In this experiment the polarization of the light
 in one plane was compensated by the polarization of the same light
 in the opposite plane ; and, consequently, both the pencils, which
 had undergone the two successive polarizing actions, had received
  the same degree of polarization in opposite planes ; and in virtue of
  these two equal and opposite polarizations, the light at the point of
  compensation, where the system of rings disappeared, had been re
  stored from partially polarized to common light ; and the light on
  each side of this point of compensation was in opposite states of
 partial polarization.
      In order to give a distinct view of the nature of this experiment,
  the author details the phenomena observed at particular angles of
  incidence on glass.    From the results at an angle of incidence of
  24°, the ray suffering one refraction at 80°, and a second reflexion

                                      307
at 835°,  he concludes that the compensation which takes place is
produced neither by an equality of oppositely polarized rays, nor by
a proportional admixture of common fight, hut by equal and oppo
site physical states of the whole pencil, whether reflected or re
fracted.
   The remarkable phenomena produced at an angle of incidence on
glass of 82° 44' (at which angle cos (i +      = cos4
                                                    i')  + i')), led the
                                                               (i

respectively, when the index of refraction      is
                                               1-525.   When ray of     a
light  is incident upon the first surface at an angle of 82° 44', ex
actly one-half of      reflected
                       it   is    and the other half, after refraction,
                                  ;
is reflected at the second surface, and emerges perpendicularly to
the adjacent surface, without suffering refraction; each portion
having, in the first instance, the same quantity of polarized light.
The second portion         found, on examination, to be in the state of
                             is
common light, although the ray at the second incidence consisted of
more than one -half of polarized light.         Hence     the pencil, pre
                                                              if
viously to reflexion at the second surface, consist of 145 rays of
polarized light, and 188 of common light, the effect of          single re
                                                                    a
flexion must be to depolarize polarized light, and to produce no
change whatever upon common light,              aproperty of     reflecting
                                                                    a
surface never yet recognized,     and   incompatible with all our present
knowledge on the subject of the polarization of light.
   The author then describes an instrument which he has invented
for the purpose of accurately measuring the degrees of polarization,
and which he therefore terms          aPolarimeter.    It consists of two
parts ;  one  of which     intended
                             is       to  produce    ray of compensation
                                                          a
having physical
           a         character  susceptible  of numerical  expression, and
the other to produce polarized bands, or rectilineal isochromatic
lines, the extinction of which indicates that the compensation              is
effected.    The construction and mode of operation of this instru
ment are, by the aid of figures, described and explained.
   The following       the general law established by these researches
                       is                                                   ;
namely, that the compensations of polarized light are produced by
equal and opposite rotations of the planes of polarization.          Thus,
when   a  ray of common light     is   incident, at any angle, upon the
polished surface of transparent body, the whole of the reflected pencil
                       a
suffers    physical change, bringing
           a                              it more or less into a state of
complete polarization, in virtue of which change its planes of polari
zation are more or less turned into the plane of reflexion            while
                                                                        ;
the whole of the refracted pencil has suffered a similar, but opposite
change, in virtue of which its planes of polarization are turned more
or less into   a plane perpendicular to the plane of reflexion.
   The author then enters into a theoretical investigation of the sub
ject, and concludes by pointing out few of the numerous applica
                                            a

                                   308
at the last Meeting, and entitled, " Researches tending to prove the
Non- vascularity of certain Animal Tissues, and to demonstrate the
peculiar uniform mode of their Organization and Nutrition."            By
Joseph Toynbee, Esq. Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie,
Bart., F.R.S.
     In the introduction to this paper, the author first speaks of the
process    of nutrition in the animal tissues which are pervaded by
ramifications of blood-vessels ; pointing out the circumstance, that
 even in them there is a considerable extent of tissue which is nou
rished without being in contact with blood-vessels.       The knowledge
 of this fact leads us to the study of the process of nutrition in the
 non-vascular tissues ; which tissues he divides into the three fol
 lowing classes ; namely, first, those comprehending articular carti
 lage, and the cartilage of the different classes of fibro-cartilage.
 Under the second head he comprises the cornea, the crystalline
 lens, and the vitreous humour ; and, under the third, he arranges
 the epidermoid appendages ; viz. the epithelium, the epidermis, nails
 and claws, hoofs, hair and bristles, feathers, horn and teeth.
     The author then proceeds to show that the due action of the
organs, into the composition of which these tissues enter, is incom
 patible with their vascularity.      In proof of the non-existence of
 blood-vessels in these tissues, he states that he has demonstrated, by
 means of injections, that the arteries, which previous anatomists had
 supposed to penetrate into their substance, either as serous vessels,
or as red-blood vessels too minute for injection, actually terminate in
 veins before reaching them ; he also shows that around these non
 vascular tissues there are numerous vascular convolutions, large
 dilatations and intricate plexuses of blood-vessels, the object of which
 he believes to be to arrest the progress of the blood, and to allow a
 large quantity of it to circulate slowly around these tissues, so that
 its nutrient liquor may penetrate into and be diffused through them.
 The author states that all the non-vascular tissues have an analo
 gous structure, and that they are composed of corpuscles, to which
 he is induced to ascribe the performance of the very important func
 tions in the process of their nutrition, of circulating throughout, and
 perhaps of changing the nature of the nutrient fluid which is brought
 by blood-vessels to their circumference.       The author then brings
 forward facts in proof of the active and vital properties of these cor
 puscles, and concludes his Introduction by stating, that it appears
 to him, that the only difference in the mode of nutrition between
 the vascular and the non-vascular tissues is, that in the former, the
 fluid which nourishes them is derived from the blood that circulates
 throughout the capillaries contained in their substance ; whilst, in
 the latter, the nutrient fluid exudes into them from the large and
  dilated vessels that are distributed around them : and that in both
  classes, the particles of which the tissues are composed derive from
  this fluid the elements which nourish them.
     The author then enters on an examination of the structure and
  mode of nutrition of the several tissues of each of these three classes.

                                    *
                                        309
    In considering the first class, he commences with articular cartilage,
    which he describes at great length in the various stages of its de
   velopement, and at the different periods of life.      He gives in detail
   the account of numerous dissections of the ovum and foetus illustrating
   the first stage, during which he shows that no blood-vessels enter
   into the substance of any of the textures composing a joint ; but
   that the changes its component parts undergo, are effected by the
   nutrient fluid from the large blood-vessels, by which, at this stage,
   each articulation is surrounded.     In the second stage of the develope-
   ment of articular cartilage, the author shows, by numerous dissec
   tions, the process by which the blood-vessels are extended into the
  substance of the epiphysal cartilage, and converge towards the at
   tached surface of articular cartilage, and how, at the same time,
   blood-vessels are equally prolonged over a certain portion of its free
   surface.   He shows that none of these blood-vessels enter the sub
   stance of the articular cartilage, and he points out that in them the
  arteries become continuous with the veins ; first, by their terminating
  in a single vessel, from which the veins arise ; secondly, by their
  forming large dilatations from which the veins originate ; and, lastly,
  they become directly continuous with the veins in the formation of
  loops of various characters.      In the third stage, that which is exhi
  bited in adult life, the epiphysal cartilage is converted into osseous
  cancelli. These contain large blood-vessels, which are separated
 from the articular cartilage by a layer of bone composed of corpus
 cles, and the author believes that the principal source of nutrition to
 this tissue is the nutrient fluid which exudes into it from these
 vessels, by passing through the articular lamella just noticed.        The
 free surface of adult articular cartilage is nourished by vessels which
 pass to a slight extent over it.      The author points out the presence
 of fine tubes which pervade the attached portion of adult articular
 cartilage, to which he ascribes the function of transmitting through
 its substance the nutritive fluid derived from the vessels of the can
 celli. He also advances the opinion that the articular cartilage be
 comes thinner during the whole of life, by being gradually converted
into bone.
     Fibro-cartilage constitutes the second tissue of the first class.
The author first enters upon an examination of its structure ; and in
order to arrive at some definite conclusions on this subject, whereon
anatomists of all ages have so much differed, he made numerous
dissections of fibro-cartilages in the different classes of animals at
various periods of their developement, the results of which he details.
He arrives at the conclusion that this tissue is composed of carti
laginous corpuscles and of fibres ; the latter preponderating in adult
life, the former in infancy ; and that during life the corpuscles are
gradually converted into fibres.       He enters at length into the ques
tion of the vascularity of these cartilages ; and from a careful study
of many injected specimens of man and animals at various periods
of their developement, the particular results of which he relates,
he believes that blood-vessels        are contained only in their fibrous
portion, and have the function of nourishing that which is cartila

                                          1
                                    310
ginous, and which, on account of its being subject to compression
and concussion, does not contain any.
    Among the second class of extra-vascular tissues, the cornea is
first treated of ; and its structure is described as being very lax, and
as containing corpuscles only in a small quantity.       The opinions in
favour of its vascularity are combated ; and it is shown that the
blood-vessels which converge to its attached margin, and which are
the principal source of the fluid that nourishes it, are large and nu
merous, and that at the circumference of this tissue the arteries,
without any diminution of their calibre, return in their course, and
become continuous with the veins. A second set of vessels, devoted
 to the nutrition of the cornea, is also described ; they extend to a
 short distance over the surface of the tissue, but do not penetrate
into its substance.
    The crystalline lens is described as being composed of corpuscles,
 of which the radiating fibres are constituted. The arteria centralis
retinae is described as ramifying over the posterior surface of the
capsule, where it forms large branches ; these pass round the cir
 cumference of the lens, and reach its anterior surface, at the peri
phery of which they become straight : the arteries terminate in loops
frequently dilated, and become continuous with the veins.          With
respect to the vascularity of the vitreous humour, the author states
that although many anatomists have, in general terms, represented
the arteria centralis retinae as giving off, in its course through this
organ, minute branches into its substance, still those who have paid
especial attention to the subject, have not been able to find such
vessels.    He believes that the nutrition of this structure is accom
plished by the fluid brought to its surface by the ciliary processes of
the choroid, which fluid is diffused with facility through its entire
substance by means of the corpuscles of which its membrane is com
posed, assisted by the semifluid character of the humour.
    The third class of extra-vascular tissues comprehends the epider
moid appendages.       The author describes them all as composed of
corpuscles,  which   are round and soft where they are in contact with
the vascular chorion, compressed and flattened where they are farther
removed from it.       He points out, in the substance of the hoof of
the Horse, the existence of fine canals, which he supposes to conduct
fluid through its mass ; and he states that the perspiratory ducts of
the human subject possess a structure analogous to the spiral vessels
of plants. The author describes each of the tissues of this class at
length, and shows that the various modifications presented by the
vascular system with which each is in contact, have the sole object
of enabling a large quantity of blood to approach and circulate
slowly around them. He also points out, in connexion with this
subject, the remarkable vital properties which are possessed by these
non-vascular tissues.
   In concluding this paper, the author states that his object has been
to establish as a law in animal physiology, that tissues are capable
of being nourished, and of increasing in size, without the presence
of blood-vessels    within their substance.      He shows the analogy

                                    311
which is presented between the extra- vascular animal and the extra-
vascular vegetable tissues.    He expresses a hope that the application
to surgery of the above law, with reference to the prolongation of
blood-vessels into the extra-vascular tissues during disease, and to
pathology in the investigation of the nature of morbid structures,
particularly of those classes which contain no blood-vessels, will be
not devoid of interest, and will be productive of some advantage.

    4. " On the Anatomy and Physiology of certain structures in the
 Orbit, not previously described." By J. M. Ferrall, Esq., M.R.I.A.
 Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
    The author describes a distinct fibrous tunic, which he terms the
 tunica vaginalis oculi, continuous with the tarsal cartilages     and
ligaments in front, and extending backwards to the bottom, or apex
of the orbit ; thus completely insulating the globe of the eye, and
keeping it apart from the muscles which move it. The eye-ball is
 connected with this fibrous investment by a cellular tissue, so lax
and delicate as to permit an easy and gliding motion between them.
The use which the author assigns to this tunic is that of protecting
 the eye-ball from the pressure of its muscles while they are in ac
 tion. This tunic is perforated at its circumference, and a few lines
posterior to its anterior margin, by six openings, through which the
tendons of the muscles emerge in passing to their insertions, and
 over which, as overpullies, they play in their course. A consequence
 of this structure is that the recti muscles become capable of giving
rotatory motions to the eye without occasioning its retraction within
 the orbit, and without exerting injurious pressure on that organ. In
 those animals which are provided with a proper retractor muscle,

                                     312
 the recti muscles are, by means of this peculiar mechanism, enabled
 to act as antagonists to that muscle.

         " An account of some recent improvements in Photography."
 By H. F. Talbot, Esq. F.R.S.
     The author had originally intended, in giving an account of his
 recent experiments in photography, to have entered into numerous
 details with respect to the phenomena observed ; but finding that
  to follow out this plan would occupy a considerable time, he has
  thought that it would be best to put the Society, in the first place,
 in possession of the principal facts, and by so doing perhaps invite
  new observers into the field during the present favourable season for
 making experiments.       He has, therefore, confined himself at present
 to a description of the improved photographic method, to which he
 has given the name of Calotype, and reserves for another occasion
  all remarks on the theory of the process.
     The following is the method of obtaining the Calotype pictures.

 paper, having a smooth surface, and a close and even texture.
     The watermark, if any, should be cut off, lest it should injure
 the appearance of the picture.      Dissolve 100 grains of crystallized
 nitrate of silver in six ounces of distilled water. Wash the paper
  with this solution, with a soft brush, on one side, and put a mark on
 that side whereby to know it again. Dry the paper cautiously
  at a distant fire, or else let it dry spontaneously in a dark room.
 When dry, or nearly so, dip it into a solution of iodide of po
 tassium containing 500 grains of that salt dissolved in one pint of
 water, and let it stay two or three minutes in this solution. Then
 dip it into a vessel of water, dry it lightly with blotting-paper, and
 finish drying it at a fire, which will not injure it even if held pretty
 near : or else it may be left to dry spontaneously.
     All this is best done in the evening by candlelight. The paper
 so far prepared the author calls iodized paper, because it has a uni
 form pale yellow coating of iodide of silver. It is scarcely sensitive
 to light, but, nevertheless, it ought to be kept in a portfolio or a
 drawer, until wanted for use.       It may be kept for any length of
 time without spoiling or undergoing any change, if protected from
 the light.    This is the first part of the preparation of Calotype
 paper, and may be performed at any time.            The remaining part
 is best deferred until shortly before the paper is wanted for use.
 When that time is arrived, take a sheet of the iodized paper and
wash it with a liquid prepared in the following manner: —
     Dissolve 100 grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in two ounces
 of distilled water ; add to this solution one-sixth of its volume of
 strong acetic acid.    Let this mixture be called A.
     Make   a saturated  solution of crystallized gallic acid in cold di
 stilled water.   The  quantity dissolved is very small.   Call this solu
tion    B.
     When a sheet of paper is wanted for use, mix together the liquids
 A and B in equal volumes, but only mix a small quantity of them at
 a time, because the mixture does not keep long without spoiling. I
 shall call this mixture the Gallo-nitrate of silver.

                                       313
     Then take a sheet of iodized paper and wash it over with this gallo-
nitrate    of silver, with a soft brush, taking care to wash it on the side
which has been previously marked.           This operation should be per
formed by candlelight.          Let the paper rest half a minute, and then
dip it into water.         Then dry it lightly with blotting-paper, and
finally dry it cautiously at a fire, holding it at a considerable distance
therefrom.        When dry, the paper is fit for use. The author has
named the paper thus prepared Calotype paper, on account of its
great utility in obtaining the pictures of objects with the camera
obscura.        If this paper be kept in a press it will often retain its
qualities    in  perfection for three months or more, being ready for use
at any moment ; but this is not uniformly the case, and the author
therefore recommends that it should be used in a few hours after it
has been prepared.            If it is used immediately, the last drying
may     be  dispensed   with,  and the paper may be used moist.      Instead
of employing a solution of crystallized gallic acid for the liquid B,
the tincture of galls diluted with water may be used, but he does not
think the results are altogether so satisfactory.
      Use of the Paper. — The Calotype paper is sensitive to light in an ex
traordinary degree, which transcends a hundred times or more that of
any kind of photographic paper hitherto described. This may be made
manifest by the following experiment : — Take a piece of this paper,
 and having covered half of it, expose the other half to daylight for
 the space of one second in dark cloudy weather in winter.              This
 brief moment suffices to produce a strong impression upon the paper.
 But the impression is latent and invisible, and its existence would
 not be suspected by any one who was not forewarned of it by pre
 vious experiments.
      The method of causing the impression to become visible is ex
 tremely simple.        It consists in washing the paper once more with
 the gallo-nitrate of silver, prepared in the way before described, and
 then warming it gently before the fire.         In a few seconds the part
 of the paper upon which the light has acted begins to darken, and
  finally grows entirely black, while the other part of the paper re
 tains its whiteness.       Even a weaker impression than this may be
 brought     out  by repeating   the wash of gallo-nitrate of silver, and
 again warming the paper.           On the other hand, a stronger impres
 sion does not require the warming of the paper, for a wash of the
 gallo-nitrate suffices to make it visible, without heat, in the course
 of a minute or two.
      A very remarkable proof of the sensitiveness of the Calotype paper
 is afforded by the fact stated by the author, that it will take an im
 pression from simple moonlight, not concentrated by a lens.             If a
 leaf is laid upon a sheet of thejpaper, an image of it may be obtained
  in this way in from a quarter to half an hour.
      This paper being possessed of so high a degree of sensitiveness,
  is therefore well suited to receive images in the camera obscura.
  If the aperture of the object-lens is one inch, and the focal length
  fifteen inches, the author finds that one minute is amply sufficient in
  summer to impress a strong image upon the paper of any building

                                     314
 upon which the sun is shining.         When the aperture amounts to
 one-third of the focal length, and the object is very white, as a
plaster bust, &c, it appears to him that one second is sufficient to
 obtain a pretty good image of it.
    The images thus received upon the Calotype paper are for the
 most part invisible impressions.      They may be made visible by the
process already related, namely, by washing them with the gallo-
 nitrate of silver, and then warming the paper.       When the paper is
 quite blank, as is generally the case, it is a highly curious and
 beautiful phenomenon to see the spontaneous commencement              of
 the picture, first tracing out the stronger outlines, and then gra
 dually filling up all the numerous and complicated details. The
 artist should watch the picture as it developes itself, and when in
 his judgment it has attained the greatest degree of strength and
 clearness, he should stop further progress by washing it with the
 fixing liquid.
    The fixing process. — To fix the picture, it should be first washed
 with water, then lightly dried with blotting paper, and then
 washed with a solution of bromide of potassium, containing 100
grains of that salt dissolved in eight or ten ounces of water. After
 a minute or two it should be again dipped in water and then finally
 dried. The picture is in this manner very strongly fixed, and with
 this great advantage, that it remains transparent, and that, there
 fore, there is no difficulty in obtaining a copy from it.      The Ca
 lotype picture   is a negative  one,  in which the lights of nature  are
 represented by shades ; but the copies are positive, having the lights
 conformable to nature.       They also represent the objects in their
 natural position with respect to right and left. The copies may
 be made upon Calotype paper in a very short time, the invisible
 impressions being brought out in the way already described.         But
 the author prefers to make the copies upon photographic paper pre
pared in the way which he originally described in a memoir read
to the Royal Society in February 1839, and which is made by
washing the best writing paper, first with a weak solution of com
mon salt, and next with a solution of nitrate of silver. Although it
takes a much longer time to obtain a copy upon this paper, yet
when obtained, the tints appear more harmonious and pleasing to
the eye ; it requires in general from 3 minutes to 30 minutes of
sunshine, according to circumstances, to obtain a good copy on
this sort of photographic paper.        The copy should be washed and
dried, and the fixing process (which may be deferred to a subse
quent day) is the same as that already mentioned.        The copies are
made by placing the picture upon the photographic paper, with a
board below and a sheet of glass above, and pressing the papers
into close contact by means of screws or otherwise.
    After a Calotype picture has furnished several copies, it some
times grows faint, and no more good copies can then be made from
it. But these pictures possess the beautiful and extraordinary pro
perty of being susceptible of revival. In order to revive them and
restore their original appearance, it is only necessary to wash them

                                       316
again by candlelight with gallo-nitrate of silver, and warm them :
this causes all the shades of the picture to darken greatly, while
the white parts remain unaffected.     The shaded parts of the paper
thus acquire an opacity which gives a renewed spirit and life to the
copies, of which a second series may now be taken, extending often
to a very considerable number.      In reviving the picture it some
times happens that various details make their appearance which
had not before been seen, having been latent all the time, yet ne
vertheless not destroyed by their long exposure to sunshine.
    The author terminates these observations by stating a few expe
 riments calculated to render the mode of action of the sensitive
paper more familiar.
    1 . Wash a piece of the iodized paper with the gallo-nitrate ; ex
pose it to daylight for a second or two, and then withdraw it. The
paper will soon begin to darken spontaneously, and will grow quite
black.
    2. The same as before, but let the paper be warmed.                The
blackening will be more rapid in consequence of the warmth.
    3. Put a large drop of the gallo-nitrate on one part of the paper
and moisten another part of it more sparingly, then leave it ;ex- »
posed to a very faint daylight; it will be found that the lesser
quantity produces the greater effect in darkening the paper ; and
in general, it will be seen that the most rapid darkening takes
place at the moment when the paper becomes nearly dry ; also, if
only a portion of the paper is moistened, it will be observed that
the edges or boundaries of the moistened part are more acted on by
light than any other part of the surface.
    4. If the paper, after being moistened with the gallo-nitrate, is
washed with water and dried, a slight exposure to daylight no
longer suffices to produce so much discoloration ; indeed it often
produces none at all.      But by subsequently washing it again with
the gallo-nitrate and warming          it,
                                       the same degree of discoloration
is  developed  as in the  other  case (experiments    and 2).
                                                      1          The dry
paper appears,    therefore,  to be  equal, or superior in  sensitiveness
to the moist only with this difference, that
              ;                                       receives
                                                      it        a   virtual
 instead of an actual impression from the light, which     it  requires a
 subsequent   process to develope.
    5. " New mode of preparation of the Daguerreotype plates, by
 which portraits can be taken in the short space of time of from five
 to fifteen seconds, according to the power of light, discovered by A.
 Claudet in the beginning of May 1841."           Communicated by the
 Marquis of Northampton, Pres. R.S.
    " My improvement," says the author, " consists in using for the
 preparation of the plates,   a combination of chlorine with iodine, in
 the state of chloride of iodine. I follow the preparation recommended
 by Daguerre.     After having put the plate in the iodine box for      a
 short time, and before  it  has acquired any appearance of yellow co
 lour,
     I    takeit out, and pass    for about two seconds over the open
                                  it
 ing of bottle containing chloride of iodine and immediately put
       a                                          ;                 I
it  again in the iodine box, where        acquires very soon the yellow
                                             it
                                                      -

                                 316
colour, which shows that the plate is ready to be placed into the
camera obscura.      I have substituted to the chloride of iodine,
chloride of bromine, and have found nearly the same result ; but I
prefer chloride of iodine as producing a better effect ; and besides,
on account of the noxious smell of bromine.
   " The result of
                   my preparation is such, that I have operated in ten
seconds with the same apparatus, which, without any chlorine, re
quired four or five minutes ; when using only the original prepara
tion of Daguerre, I have obtained an image of clouds in four
seconds."

    1. "Experiments     on the electric conditions of the Rocks and
 Metalliferous Veins (Lodes) of Longclose and Rosewall Hill Mines
in Cornwall."      By William Jory Henwood, Esq., F.R.S., &c. Se
cretary of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall.
   The experiments, of which the results are given in this paper, were
undertaken with the view of determining whether it was in conse
quence of the imperfections of the galvanometers, or other apparatus,
employed, that Mr. R. W. Fox, and other experimenters, had been
unable to detect the presence of electricity in the tin veins of Corn
wall. The mode of experimenting was in principle the same as that
pursued by Mr. Fox, namely, that of placing plates of metal in con
tact with the points to be examined, carrying wires from the one to
the other, and interposing a galvanometer in the circuit. The plates
employed were of sheet-copper and sheet-zinc, and they were about
six inches long, and three inches and a half wide.       The wires were
of copper, one twentieth of an inch in diameter, and the same that
had been used by Mr. Fox.
   The tabular results of these experiments show that both the gra
nite and the tin vein at Rosewall Hill mine, and also the greenstone
and the copper vein in that of Longclose, present unequivocal traces
of electric currents, whether different parts of the same veins or va
rious portions of the same rocks were examined.
   It also appears, from these experiments, that the nature and posi
tions of the small metallic plates employed materially affect, not only
the intensity, but in some cases also the directions of the currents ;
and also that there is a considerable difference in the results when the
same plates of metal are placed on different ingredients in the veins,
even though these may be in immediate contact with each other.

    2.   "
         Researches in the Theory of Machines."        By the Rev. H.
Moseley, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astro
nomy in King's College, London.
   Of the various names, such as " useful effect," " dynamical effect,"
" efficiency," " work done," " labouring force," " work," which have
been given to that operation of force in machinery which consists in
the union of a continued pressure with a continued motion, the au
thor gives the preference to the term work, as being that which con
veys, under its most intelligible form, this idea of the operation of
force, and as being the literal translation of the word
                                                            " travail,"
which among French writers on mechanics has taken the place of
every other.
   The single unit, in terms of which this operation of force is with
us measured, viz. the work of overcoming a pressure of one pound
through one foot, he considers to be distinguished sufficiently, and
expressed concisely enough, by the term unit of work, rejecting as
unnecessary, and as less likely to pass into general use, the terms
" dynamical    unit," and " dynam," which it has been proposed to
apply to it.
   Having thus defined the terms work and unit of work, and paid a
tribute of respect to the valuable labours of M. Poncelet in the theory
of machines, and expressed admiration of the skill with which he has
applied to it the well-known principle of vis viva under a new and
more general form, the author proceeds to remark, that the inter
pretation which M. Poncelet has given to that function of the velo
city of a moving body which is taken as the measure of its vis viva,
associates with it the definitive idea of a force opposed to all change
in the state of the bodies' rest or motion, and known as its "vis in
ertia," " vis insita," &c. The author conceives that the introduction
of the definitive idea of such a force into questions of elementary and
practical mechanics is liable to many and grave objections ; and he
proposes a new interpretation of   it,  viz. " that one half of this func
tion represents the number of units of work accumulated in the moving
body, and which   it   is  capable of reproducing upon any resistance
opposed to its progress."      This interpretation he establishes by me
chanical considerations of an elementary kind.         Taking, then, this
new interpretation of the function representing one half the vis viva,
and dividing the parts of   a    machine into those which receive the
operation of the moving power (the moving points) and those which
apply     (the working points), he presents the principle of vis viva in
         it
its application to machines under the following form — "The number
                                                         :
of units of work done by the moving power upon the moving points
of the machine   is equal to the number yielded at the working points,
plus the number expended upon the prejudicial resistances, plus the
number accumulated in the various parts of the machine which are
in motion."      So that the whole number of units of work done by
the moving power, or upon the moving points,        is  expended, partly
in that work done at the working points, whence results immediately
the useful product of the machine, and partly upon the prejudicial
resistances of friction, &c. opposed to the motion of the machine in

                                     319
its transmission from the moving to the working points ; and all the
rest is accumulated or treasured up in the moving parts of the ma
chine, and is reproducible whenever the work of the moving power
from exceeding shall fall short of that which must be expended upon
the useful and the prejudicial resistances to carry on the machine.
    He then proceeds to observe, that in every machine there thus
exists a direct relation between these four elements, — the work done
upon the moving points, that expended at the working points, that
expended on the prejudicial resistances, and that accumulated in the
moving elements.       This relation, which is always the same for the
same machine, and different for different machines, he proposes to
call, in respect to each particular machine, its modulus ; and he states
the principal object of this paper (and of another which he proposes
subsequently to submit to the Society) to be, first, the general de
termination of the modulus of a simple machine ; secondly, that of
a compound machine, from a knowledge of the moduli of its compo
nent elements ; and, thirdly, the application of these general methods
of determination to some of the principal elements of machinery, and
to the machines which are in common use.
    The author then states, that the velocities of the different parts, or
elements of every machine are connected with one another by certain
invariable relations, capable of being expressed by mathematical for
mulae ; so that, though these relations are different for different ma
chines, they are the same for the same machine.            Thus it becomes
possible   to  express the velocity  of  any  element  of a machine, at any
period   of  its motion, in terms   of  the  corresponding velocity of any
other element.       Whence it results that the whole vis viva of the
machine may at any time be expressed in terms of the corresponding
velocity of its moving point (that is, the point where the moving
power is applied to it), and made to present itself under the form V'2
2 ti>k1, where V represents the velocity of the moving point of the
machine, w the weight of any element, and            \ a factor determining
the velocity of that element in terms of the velocity V of the moving
point. Substituting this expression for the vis viva or accumulated
work in the modulus and solving in respect to V, an expression is
obtained, whence it becomes apparent that the variation of the velo
city  V of   the moving point, produced by any given irregularity in
the work done upon the moving or working points, will be less, as
the factor S w X2 is greater.     This factor, determinable in every ma
chine, and upon which the uniformity of its action under given
variations of the power which impels it depends, he proposes to in
troduce into the general discussion of the theory of machines as the
coefficient of equable motion.
    He then proceeds to investigate general methods for the determina
tion of the modulus of a machine, deducing them from those general
relations which are established by the principles of statics, between
the pressures applied to the machine, in its state bordering upon
 motion.
    That he may escape that complication of formulae which results
 from the introduction of friction, by the ordinary methods, into the

                                     320
  consideration of questions of equilibrium, the author calls to his aid
  a principle, first published by himself in a paper on the Theory of
                                                              '
 the Equilibrium of Bodies in contact,' printed in the fifth volume of
 the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, viz.
                                                        " that when the
 surfaces of two bodies are in contact under any given pressures, and
  are in the state bordering upon motion, on those surfaces, then the
  common direction of the mutual resistances of the surfaces is inclined
 to their normal at the point of contact at a certain angle, given in
 terms of the friction of the surfaces by the condition that its tangent
 is equal to the coefficient of friction."    This angle the author has
 called "the limiting angle of resistance :" it has since been used by
 other writers under the designation of the "slipping angle."
     He next proceeds to determine the modulus of a simple machine,
 moveable about a cylindrical axis of given dimensions, and acted
 upon by any number of pressures in the same plane.            He applies
 the principle last stated to determine the general conditions of the
 equilibrium of these pressures, in the state bordering upon motion
 by the preponderance of one of them; and, solving the resulting
 equation in respect to that one pressure by the aid of Lagrange's
 theorem, he deduces immediately the modulus from this solution by
 principles before laid down. The modulus, thus determined, he then
 verifies by an independent discussion of that particular case in which
 three pressures only are applied to the machine, one of which has its
 direction through the centre of the axis.
    This solution he next considers more particularly with reference
 to a machine moveable about a fixed axis under one moving and one
 working pressure (their directions being any whatever) and its own
 weight ; which last is supposed to act through the centre of the
 axis.    He shows that it is a general condition of the greatest eco
 nomy in the working of such a machine, that the moving and work
ing pressures should have their directions, one of them upwards, and
 the other downwards, and that both should therefore be applied on
 the same side of the axis of the machine.      He moreover shows that
if the direction of one of these pressures be given, there is then a
 certain perpendicular distance of the other from the centre of the
axis, and a certain inclination of its direction to the vertical, at
which perpendicular distance, and which inclination, this pressure
being applied, the machine will yield a greater amount of work, by
the expenditure of a given amount of power, than it will yield under
any other circumstances      of its application : so that this particular
distance and inclination are those whence results the most economi
cal working of the machine.
    Professor Moseley then commences his application of these general
principles to elementary machines with the pulley. He establishes
the modulus of the pulley under any given inclination of the parts
of the cord passing over it, taking into account the friction of the
axis, the weight of the pulley and the rigidity of the cord, and adopt
ing, with respect to the last element, the experiments of Coulomb.
This general form of the modulus of the pulley he applies, first, to
the case in which both strings are parallel, and inclined to the vertical

                                  321
at any angle ; secondly, to the case in which they are equally inclined
on either side of the vertical ; thirdly, to the case in which one is
horizontal and the other vertical ; and, fourthly, to that in which
both are horizontal.     He concludes his paper by a deduction from
this last case of the modulus of a system of any number of pulleys or
sheaves, sustaining among them the weight of any given length of
rope horizontally.

    The author, in a paper which was read to the Royal Society on
the 12th of December, 1839, had described four great plexuses under
the peritoneum of the gravid uterus, having an extensive connexion
with the hypogastric and spermatic nerves.       From their form, co
lour, general distribution, and resemblance to ganglionic plexuses of
nerves, and from their branches actually coalescing with those of the
hypogastric and spermatic nerves, he was induced to believe, on first
discovering them, that they were ganglionic nervous plexuses, and
that they constituted the special nervous system of the uterus.      He
states in the present paper, that subsequent dissections of the unim-
pregnated uterus, and of the gravid uterus in the third, fourth, sixth,
seventh, and ninth months of pregnancy, have enabled him not only
to confirm the accuracy of his former observations, but also to dis
cover the important fact, that there are many large ganglia on the
uterine nerves, and on those of the vagina and bladder, which enlarge
with the coats, blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents of the uterus
during pregnancy, and which return, after parturition, to their ori
ginal condition before conception took place.    The author next pro
ceeds to describe the two great ganglia situated on the sides of the
neck of the uterus, in which the hypogastric and several of the sa
cral nerves terminate, and which he calls the hypogastric, or utero-
cervical ganglia.    In the unimpregnated state, they are of an irre
gular, triangular, or oblong shape, about half an inch in the long
diameter, and always consist of grey and white matter, like other
ganglia. They are covered by the trunks of the vaginal and vesical
arteries and veins ; and each ganglion has an artery of considerable
size, which enters it near the centre and divides into branches, ac
companying the nerves given off from its anterior and inferior borders.
From the inner and posterior surface of each of these ganglia, nerves
pass off, which anastomose with the hemorrhoidal nerves, and ramify
on the sides of the vagina, and between the vagina and rectum.
From the inferior border of each hypogastric ganglion several fasci
culi of nerves are given off, which pass down on the sides of the
vagina, and enter some large flat ganglia, midway between the os
uteri and ostium vagina.      From these vaginal ganglia innumerable
filaments of nerves, on which small flat ganglia are formed, extend
to the sphincter, where they are lost in a white dense membranous
expansion.     From this great web of ganglia and nerves numerous
branches are sent to the sides of the bladder, and enter it around the
ureter.    All these nerves of the vagina are accompanied with arte

                                   322
ries ; and they often form complete rings of nerve around the trunks
of the great veins.
   The author then describes the nerves which are given off from the
anterior margin of each hypogastric ganglion, some of which pass on
the outside of the ureter, and others on the inside, and meet in front
of the ureter in a ganglion, which he calls the middle vesical ganglion.
There are other two ganglia, he states, formed on these nerves ; one
between the uterus and ureter, and the other between the ureter
and vagina.    These he calls the internal and external vesical ganglia.
Not only is the ureter inclosed within a great ring of nervous mat
ter, which, he says, resembles the oesophageal ganglia in some of the
invertebrata ; but the trunks of the uterine artery and vein are like
wise encircled by a great collar of nervous matter, between which
and the hypogastric ganglion several large and some small branches
pass.
   The author gives the following description of the vesical ganglia.
The internal vesical ganglion, which usually has a flattened or long
bulbous shape, is formed entirely upon the nerves which pass from
the hypogastric ganglion, and run between the uterus and the ureter.
It has an artery which passes through its centre. It first gives off a
large branch to the ring of nerve or ganglion which surrounds the
uterine blood-vessels ; it then sends branches to the anterior part of
the cervix uteri, and afterwards a great number of small filaments to
the muscular coat of the bladder behind, where it is in contact with
the uterus ; and it then sends forwards a large branch, which termi
nates in the middle vesical ganglion. This ganglion sends off a great
number of large nerves to the bladder.      Some of these accompany
the arteries, and can be seen ramifying with them upon the whole
of the superior part of the organ, even to the fundus. Filaments of
these nerves, scarcely visible to the naked eye, are seen in one of the
preparations ramifying upon the bundles of muscular fibres, occa
sionally forming loops and inclosing them, or passing down between
them to the strata of fibres below. Some of the smaller branches of
the middle vesical ganglion do not accompany the arteries, but are
distributed at once to the parts of the bladder around the ureter.
   The external vesical ganglion is formed entirely upon the nerves
which proceed from the hypogastric ganglion, and pass on the out
side of the ureter.    This is a small thin ganglion, the branches of
which are sent immediately into the muscular coat of the bladder.
It usually sends down a long branch to anastomose with the nerves
issuing from one of the vaginal ganglia.
   From the inner surface of each hypogastric ganglion numerous
small white, soft, nerves pass to the uterus, some of which ramify
upon the muscular coat about the cervix, and others spread out
under the peritoneum to coalesce with the great ganglia and plexuses
situated on the posterior and anterior surfaces of that organ.    Large
branches also go off from the inner surface of the ganglion to the
nerves surrounding the blood-vessels of the uterus, which they ac
company in all their ramifications throughout its muscular coat.
    This paper is illustrated by two drawings, in which the hypogas

                                     323
trie, vaginal, vesical and uterine ganglia are delineated in the fourth
month of pregnancy, and also the plexuses of nerves on the anterior
 surface of the uterus.
    From an examination with the microscope of portions of the
plexuses under the peritoneum of a gravid uterus in the ninth month,
 which had long been immersed in rectified spirit, Professor Owen
 and Mr. Kiernan inferred that they were not nervous plexuses, but
 bands of elastic tissue, gelatinous tissue, or cellular membrane.
    The author concludes his paper with a letter from John Dalrym-
ple, Esq., containing the results of the observations he had made
with the microscope on the uterine nerves in the recent state. Fila
ments of the nerves which surrounded the ureter, and which were
 situated upon the body of the uterus, were submitted to the micro
 scope.    The instrument employed was a very powerful object-glass,
 whose focus was the eighth of an inch, made by Ross.           Mr. Dal-
 rymplefound that it was impossible, even with the most careful dissec
 tion, to detach any filament of nerve without including a quantity of
 cellular and elastic tissue ; so that although the tubular portion indi
 cating the nerve was distinct, yet it was surrounded by innumerable
 extremely minute threads coiled and contorted, such as those which
 constitute the component of elastic tissue, and the ultimate element
 of cellular membrane.     Under slight pressure, however, the tube was
 plainly discernible, and was found to contain granular matter, not
 uniformly distributed, but collected in minute masses at intervals.
 Small blood-vessels were also here and there seen, with blood-discs
within them, which served to indicate the difference between the
nervous and vascular tubes, and thus to avoid the possibility of error.
Being, however, aware that some of the most distinguished foreign
 microscopical anatomists had differed as to what was the real cha
racteristic of the nerves of the sympathetic system, and feeling, from
this discordance of opinion, that there was no absolute test, or at
least none which was not open to cavil, Mr. Dalrymple thought of
making a comparison of the uterine nerves with those that undenia
bly belonged to the ganglionic system.        He therefore traced some
nerves on the surface of the stomach up to the great ganglion that
gave them origin ; and he selected some also from the small intestine.
These he submitted to the same microscopical power, and under the
same circumstances      of light, and pressure, and medium.     In all of
these he observed the tubular part filled with granular matter, and
similarly collected in minute masses.       He also observed that each
tube was surrounded by the minute serpentine threads before de
scribed.    In fact, so closely did they agree in every particular with
the appearances presented by the uterine nerves, that it would have
been impossible to distinguish the one from the other.
    4.  " On  the Corpuscles of the Blood."       Part III. By Martin
Barry, M.D., F.R.SS. L. and E.
    After remarking that no clear conception has hitherto existed of the
mode in which the floating corpuscles of the blood conduce to nou
rishment, the author states that he has found every structure he has

                                    324
examined to arise out of corpuscles having the same appearance as
the corpuscles of the blood.     The following are the tissues which he
has submitted    to actual observation, and which have given the above
result, namely, the cellular, the nervous, and the muscular ; besides
cartilage, the coats of blood-vessels, several membranes, the tables
and cells of the epithelium, the pigmentum nigrum, the ciliary pro
cesses, the crystalline lens itself, and even the spermatozoon and the
ovum.
   The author then traces the nucleus of the blood-corpuscle into
the pus-globule ; showing that every stage in the transition presents
a definite figure. The formation of the pus-globule out of the nucleus
of the blood-corpuscle is referable to the same process, essentially, as
that by means of which the germinal spot comes to fill the germinal
vesicle in the ovum.     This process, which, in a former memoir, he
had traced in the corpuscles of the blood, he now shows to be uni
versal, and nowhere more obvious than in the reproduction of the
tables of the epithelium.    The epithelium-cylinder seems to be con
stituted, not by coalescence of two objects previously single, as has
been supposed, but by division of a previously single object.    Certain
objects, called by the author primitive discs, exhibit an inherent con
tractile power, both when isolated, and when forming parts of a
larger object ; an incipient epithelium-cylinder having been observed
by him to revolve by this means. Molecular motions are sometimes
discernible within corpuscles of the blood. The author has no
ticed young blood-corpuscles exhibiting motions, comparable to the
molecular, and moving through a considerable space ; and he has
met with the nuclei of blood- corpuscles endowed with cilia, revol
ving, and performing locomotion. In his first paper on the Corpuscles
of the Blood, he described certain instantaneous changes in form
which he had observed in blood-corpuscles, and afterwards expressed
his belief, that these changes were referable to contiguous cilia,
although he had not been able to discern any such cilia. He now
states that subsequent observation inclines him to think that these
changes in form arise from some inherent power, distinct from the
motions occasioned by cilia. The primitive disc, just mentioned,
seems to correspond,      in some instances, with the " cytoblast" of
Schleiden. Thus the very young corpuscle of the blood is a mere
disc ; but the older corpuscle is a cell. The author minutely de
scribes the mode of origin of the pigmentum nigrum ; showing that
it arises in a similar manner in the tail of the tadpole, and in the
choroid coat of the eye. He had before described the Graafian vesicle
as formed by the addition of a covering to the previously-existing
ovisac : this covering, he afterwards stated, becomes the corpus
luteum. He now confirms these observations, with the addition,
that it is the blood-corpuscles entering into the formation of the
covering of the ovisac, which give origin to the corpus luteum.
The spermatozoon appears to be composed of a few coalesced discs.
The fibres of the crystalline lens are not elongated cells, as supposed
by Schwann ; but coalesced cells, at first arranged in the same man
 ner as beads in a necklace.

                                      325
    The author concludes with the following recapitulation : — 1. The
 nucleus of the corpuscle of the blood admits of being traced into the
 pus-globule. 2. The various structures arise out of corpuscles ha
 ving the same appearance, form, and size as corpuscles of the blood.
 3. The corpuscles having this appearance,         and giving origin to
 structures, are propagated by division of their nuclei. 4. The cor
 puscles of the blood, also, are propagated by division of their nuclei.
 5. The minuteness of the young blood-corpuscles is sometimes
 extreme ; and they are to be found in parts usually considered as
 not being permeable by red blood.
    In a postscript, the author adds, that blood found in the heart
 immediately after death by bleeding, presents incessant alterations
 in the position of its corpuscles. Among these, when a single corpus
 cle is examined very attentively, it is seen to change its form ; and
 the author is disposed to think it is this change of form that produces
 the alterations in position. The changes in form are slight, compared
 with those previously described by him as observed in blood else
 where, and are not seen without close attention.        The motions re
 semble those called molecular ; and in the minutest corpuscles, which
 are mere points, nothing besides molecular motion can be discerned.
 It may be a question, the author thinks, whether molecular motion
differs in its nature from the motion of the larger corpuscles just
referred to. The division of the blood-corpuscles into corpuscles of
minuter size, though apparent in blood from either side of the heart,
has seemed more general in that from the left side ; which, it is
suggested, is perhaps deserving of notice in connexion with the sub
ject of respiration.
    5. " A new Theory of Physics, with its application to important
phenomena hitherto considered as ultimate facts."            By Thomas
Exley, Esq., A.M.
    The theory of the author is founded on the two following pro
positions, namely, that
    1. Every atom of matter consists of an immense sphere of force,
varying inversely as the square of the distance from the centre ; this
force being attractive at all distances, except in a small concentric
sphere, in which it is repulsive.
    2. Atoms differ from each other in their absolute forces, or in the
extent of their spheres of repulsion, or in both these respects.
    The author assumes that there are four classes of atoms, the
tenacious, the electric, the ethereal, and the aromatic.   The existence
of the last-named class of atoms he infers from the phenomena of
vegetation, the miasmata of marshes, the aroma of plants, various
noxious effluvia, the disinfecting property of some bodies, and facts
relating to animalcules, and their ova, &c. He regards the two pro
positions which constitute the great principles of his theory, as pre
senting, at once, a complete explication of the general attributes of
matter and body, with the Newtonian laws of motion, not otherwise
theoretically explicable.
    After pursuing at some length his theoretical speculations, founded

                                   32fi
on the above-mentioned propositions, the author concludes his paper
with the following sentence : —
    " The several partial theories of philosophers, as far as concerns
the leading facts on which they are based, are contained in the sim
ple principles here developed : thus, the theory of universal gravity
is here carried out to its ultimatum ; Newton and Boscovich's theo
ries of alternate attractions and repulsions are derived from facts
which depend on the alternate atmospheres, and neutral spaces of
tenacious atoms ; Sir Humphry Davy's theory of electrical energies.
Dr. Dalton's atomic theory, and the theory of the diffusion of gases,
Dr. Black's theory of latent heat, Gay-Lussac's theory of volumes,
Newton's theory of light, or the theory of the emission of light, the
undulatory theory, and very many others are here united in the
most simple principles, which are, therefore, strongly recommended
to the notice of philosophers."
    6. " On the Organs of Reproduction, and on the Developement
of the Myriapoda."      By George Newport, Esq. Communicated by
P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author commences his paper by stating that great interest
attaches   to the study of the Myriapoda, from the already known fact
that their mode of developement, by an increase in the number of
segments, is directly the reverse of that of true insects in which
the developement of the perfect individual is accompanied by an ap
parent diminution in the number of these parts. He remarks, that
although the developement of the Myriapoda has already been ex
amined by several eminent naturalists, such as Degeer, Savi, Gervais,
and Waga, some of the most important facts relating to it have,
nevertheless, escaped their notice, and he proposes, therefore, to lay
before the Society the result of his own investigations on this sub
ject, and also his examinations of the organs of reproduction.
    The paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the author
describes the organs of reproduction, and shows that the parts de
scribed by Treviranus, both in the male and female Julus, are only
 the efferential ducts in the male, and the oviduct in the female ;
that in the former there are developed, from the sides of the efferen
tial ducts, a large number of sacs, the structure of which he de
 scribes, and states his opinion that these are the proper secretory
 organs in the male, but remarks that he has not been able to follow
out the organs to their fullest extent. In the female, he shows that
 the oviduct described by Treviranus is covered by an immense num
ber of ovisacs, each secreting only a single ovum ; that many hun
 dreds of these exist around the duct, a large proportion of which
never reach maturity, being retarded in their growth by the deve
lopement of others immediately around them ; and that the ova, when
 matured, are passed from the ovisacs into the duct, and are then all
deposited at one time. He adverts especially to the remarkable condi
tion of the female oviduct being a single organ, throughout the
greater part of its extent, but having a double outlet ; and shows its
analogy in the internal portion of the organs to those of some in

                                  327
sects, and in its double outlet to the Crustacea and Arachnida.       He
also institutes a comparison between the structure of the male and
female organs in this Myriapod, which, from their simplicity, admir
ably illustrate the uniformity of origin of these structures ; more espe
cially the analogy between the ovisacs in the female and the caeca in
the male, and also their conformity in the absence, in the latter, of se
parate vesiculae seminales, and, in the former, of spermatheca.
   The second section is occupied by a short account of the structure
of the ovum, in which the author observes the germinal vesicle and
macula. He notices especially the presence of the yelk in the ear
liest stages of developement, together with the vesicle and the mem
branes of the ovum at a later period, as showing in this low form of
animal the conformity of structure and laws with those which pre
vail in the higher forms.
    In the third section, the author speaks of the deposition of the
ova, and of the habits of the species, as observed in specimens col
lected and preserved by him for that purpose.      These habits he re
gards as particularly curious.     The female excavates for herself a
burrow, by digging with her mandibles in the soil, which she has
previously moistened with a fluid, supplied, as the author believes, by
her immense salivary glands. With this she forms a soft pellet, which
she removes from the burrow with her mandibles and anterior legs ;
and thence, after being brought to the top of the hole, it is passed
on to the next pair, and by these on to the next in succession, until
it is entirely removed out of the way ; after which, she deposits her
eggs and closes the burrow with moistened clay. Great difficulty was
experienced in preserving the eggs during the observations, from
the circumstance that their shell is soft, and dries quickly when ex
posed to the air. To avoid this, the author had recourse to the plan
of inclosing the eggs in a glass tube, filled with clay, and closed
with a cork ; the eggs being placed in a cell next to the glass.
    The fourth section, which constitutes the most important part of
the paper, gives the history of the evolution of the embryo.        The
process is divided by the author into different periods.    After a few
observations on the earlier changes of the egg, and the proof that they
consist in an alteration in the size and appearance of the cells out of
which the embryo is formed, he states his having observed that the
egg bursts at the end of twenty-five days, by means of a fissure along
the dorsal surface, as described by Savi and Waga ; and that, in oppo
sition to the remarks of Degeer, the young Julus, as first stated by
Savi, is perfectly apodal. The author has also discovered a singular
fact, entirely overlooked by all who have attended to the developement
of these animals, namely, that the young Julus at this time is still an
embryo, and is completely inclosed in a shut sac, which terminates
in a distinct funis at the extremity of the body, and in the proper
amnion, or foetal envelope of the animal. He finds, also, that the funis
enters at the posterior penultimate segment of the dorsal surface of
the body, and not at the dorsal surface of the thoracic region, as
seen by Rathke in the Crustacea. The embryo, he says, is retained
in connexion with the shell, between the two halves of    it, for seven

                                     328
 teen days, by means of the funis, which is continuous with a second,
 or external membrane, the chorion, which lines the interior of the
 shell.  He states that the liberation of the embryo from the shell is
 not effected by any effort of its own, but by the expansive force of
 the growth of its body.      He describes, also, another important fact
 which had been overlooked by previous observers, relating to the mode
 and place of origin of the new segment of the body in the Julidae.
The new segments are always produced in a germinal membrane im
mediately before the penultimate segment, which segment, with the
 anal one, remains permanent throughout the life of the animal. The
production of the first set of new segments is commenced even be
fore the animal has burst from the amnion.        After leaving the am
nion, the young Julus possesses six pair of legs, as stated by Savi
 and Waga ; but the author remarks, in addition, that, notwithstand
ing this, it is still inclosed in another tunic, the proper skin of the
 embryo, beneath which new segments are being formed, and which
begins to be detached before the embryo has left the amnion. He
 suggests whether this may not be the representative of the proper
tunic of the germinal vesicle.       After minutely describing the em
bryo, and showing that its body is still formed of cells, he states
 that four pairs of new legs are forming beneath this tunic, and that,
 on the twenty-sixth day, the young animal throws off this cover
 ing, and the legs are developed, and also the six new segments, to a
further extent. The animal then takes food, the segments become
 developed to the same extent as the original ones, until the forty-
seventh day, when it again changes its skin, new segments are again
produced, and new legs to those segments last formed. In this way
it passes through several changes, developing first segments and then
legs.
    One remarkable circumstance stated is, that the production of
 segments is sextuple in the Julidae ; but this does not hold in other
genera, in some of which it is quadruple, and in others double ; but
these peculiarities appear in all cases to be characteristic of each
distinct genus.      In conclusion, he confirms the observation already
made by M. Gervais, that the number of eyes is increased as the
animal advances in its transformations.       The author concludes by
stating that he proposes continuing these observations on the My-
riapoda at some future period.
    The paper is accompanied by drawings of the parts described,
and of the successive changes which take place during the deve-
lopement of the animal.
   The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again
on the 18th of November next.

    2. " On   the Laws of the rise and fall of the Tides in the River
 Thames." By George Biddell Airy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer
Royal.
    The conclusions arrived at by the author, and stated in this paper,
were derived from an extensive series of observations of the tides,
made, on his suggestion, at the Royal Victualling Yard at Deptford,
under the superintendence of Captain Shireff, R.N.         The object of
the first series of observations was simply to ascertain the times of
high and low water, for the purpose of ascertaining the duration of
the rise and fall of the tide : the height of the water was observed at
every quarter of an hour, night and day, during half a lunation. The
curves representing the law of rise and fall of the water were found
to be different for high tides and for low tides ; and both are sensibly
different from the line of sines.      The author then investigates ma
thematically the motion of a very long wave, such as a tide-wave, in
a rectangular canal, whose section is everywhere the same, on the
supposition that the extent of vertical oscillation bears a sensible
proportion to the mean depth of the water; and deduces an expres
sion for the vertical elevation of a particle at the surface. This ex
pression supposes the canal unlimited at the end farthest from the
sea.    If the canal be stopped by a barrier, the expression changes its
form.     The formulae obtained by the author enable him to explain
a circumstance, hitherto perplexing, namely, that the age of the tide
is different as inferred from the height of the high water, or from
the time of high water ; being always greater in the former mode of
estimation.

    SIR JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK, Bart., V.P. and Treas.,
                             in the Chair.
   Francis Baily, Esq., on the part of the Auditors of the Treasurer's
Accounts, reported, that the total receipts during the last year, in
clusive of a balance of 937/. 19*. T'A, carried from the account of
the preceding year, amounted to 3874/. 1 \s.\)<l.; and that the total
payments in the same period amounted to 3'2<>5/. l'2,v. \ i/„ leaving a
balance in the hands of the Treasurer of (>()<)/. '2s. Hrf.
   The thanks of the Meeting were given to the Auditors, for the
trouble they have taken in examining t he Treasurer's accounts.
   The thanks of the Meeting were also voted to the Treasurer, for
his services to the Society.
   The following Letter from the President       addressed   to the So
ciety, was read : —
       Gentlemen,
   I  regret extremely that my absence from England will prevent my
having the honour and pleasure of meeting you at the Anniversary
of the Royal Society. The Council will therefore perform the duty,
which would otherwise have fallen on me, of adverting to the con
tinued prosperity of our Society, to the losses v Inch it has, however,
undergone in the course of nature, and to the adjudication of our
Medals.     This duty I am sure that they will perform better than I
could do, so that, in that point of view, you will be no losers ; the
loss of a great pleasure in meeting so many scientific friends will
fall on myself; but I look forward to the spring, when I hope again
to meet you, both in my own house and at our ordinary weekly
Meetings.     Meanwhile the Royal Society has, as it ever will have,
my most earnest wishes for its prosperity and its success, in carrying
forward the great object for which it was established — the increase
of human knowledge in every department of physical science.
    The Vice-President in the Chair informed the Meeting that the
 Council had voted the following Address to Her Majesty the
 Queen : —
                " To the Queens most Excellent Majesty.
    " The humble Address of the President, Council, and Fellows of
 the Royal Society of London for improving Natural Knowledge.
       " Most Gracious Sovereign,
    " We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Presi
 dent, Council, and Fellows of the Royal Society of London for un
                                   it '2

                                    332
 proving Natural Knowledge, approach Your Majesty to offer our
 humble and heartfelt congratulations on the birth of the Heir to
 the Throne of the British Empire.          The Almighty Disposer of
 events has vouchsafed to Your Majesty His protection in a season
 of much pain and peril ; and we pray that a life so dear to Your
 Majesty's subjects may long be preserved, through the same Divine
 Grace.
    " We ardently hope that Your Majesty's Son may be endowed
 with health and strength ; that he may be adorned with every virtue
 which can dignify his station ; and we pray that Your Majesty may
                                            "
 continue to be blest with all prosperity.
    The Vice-President in the Chair also stated to the Meeting that
 the Council had adopted the following Address to His Royal High
 ness Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha : —
    " To His Royal Highness Prince Albert
                                                 of Saxe-Coburg and
                         Gotha,   K.G.,F.R.S.
    " The humble Address of the President, Council,         and Fellows
 of the Royal Society of London for improving Natural Knowledge.
       " May it please Your Royal Highness,
    " We, the President, Council, and Fellows of the Royal Society
 of London for improving Natural Knowledge, beg leave to approach
 Your Royal Highness with our most sincere congratulations on the
 safety of Your Royal Highness's Consort, our beloved Sovereign,
and on the birth of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall.          It
is our most earnest wish that Your Royal Highness may enjoy every
domestic blessing, and may witness the maturity of Your Son in
every manly virtue."
    The Secretary then read    the following
                  Report  of the Council  to the Society.
    The Council have the satisfaction of being able to report to the
 Society, that the system of Magnetical and Meteorological Obser
vations proposed by the Royal Society, and carried on at various
stations on the globe, at the fixed observatories established by the
governments of this and of other countries, is at present in full and
active operation ; and that an immense mass of documents, relating
to terrestrial magnetism and meteorology, is in progress of col
lection, from which it may reasonably be expected that, after they
shall have been properly arranged and digested, the most valuable
results, advantageous both to physical science and to practical navi
gation, will be derived. It may also be noticed, in connexion with
this subject, that the series of instructions to the officers of the ex
pedition lately sent out to Africa, for conducting magnetic observa
tions, prepared by Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, has been adopted by the
Council, and communicated to the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty.
   The Council    have received   with gratitude the intimation, com-

                                     333
_ municated by the Baron de Brunow, of the earnest desire of the
   Russian Government to co-operate in the magnetical inquiries now
   carrying on in various parts of the world.        A paper, containing
  supplemental instructions for the use of the Magnetical Observato
  ries, drawn up by Professor Lloyd, has also, with the sanction of the
   Council, been recently printed and circulated.
     The Astronomer Royal having suggested, that observations on
   Atmospheric Electricity might with advantage be made at the Me
  teorological Observatory at Greenwich, the Council, on the advice
  of the Committee of Physics, have concurred in these views, and
  have ordered that the requisite instruments should be procured for
  the purpose of carrying them into effect.
     Reference was made to the Council, on the 10th of December
  last, by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for their opinion,
  both of the absolute and the relative merits of certain improvements
  in the construction of Chronometers, for which rewards were claimed
  by the inventors.     In compliance with this request, the Council
  appointed a Committee, consisting of the Astronomer Royal, Mr.
  Wheatstone, and the Rev. R. Willis, to conduct the inquiry and
  communicate the result to the Council. This task they have accom
  plished, and have made an able report, which was laid before the
  Council, and adopted by them on the 10th of June.
     A large number of boxes and casts, containing specimens of
  natural history, received by the Lords of the Admiralty from the
  Antarctic Expedition, having been sent by them to the Royal So
  ciety, with a view to their being placed, or caused to be placed, in
  such hands as were most likely to secure their present safe custody,
  and accompanied with the condition that they should not be alien
  ated, nor described in publications before the return of the expe
  dition, the Council, in conformity with this request, have transmitted
  them to the British Museum, together with the intimation of the
  wishes of the Lords of the Admiralty relative to their preservation.
     The Council have to express their especial thanks for two presents
  made to the Society : the first, from Charles Vignolles, Esq., of an
  original portrait of Sir Isaac Newton, painted by Vanderbank ; the
  second, of a portrait of Dr. Dalton, painted by B. R. Faulkner, Esq.,
  which was presented by a Committee appointed at Manchester for
  procuring a memorial of the distinguished merits of that phi
  losopher.
                Report on the state of the Society's Library.
     The alterations in the Library of the Society, occasioned by the
  erection of the gallery, by the removal of the presses from the fire
  place, and by the dislocation and re-union of the tracts, having ne
  cessarily created much irregularity and confusion, the Council, being
  desirous of rendering the Library as available as possible to the
  Members of the Society, have turned their attention, during the last
  session, to provide greater facilities for reference and consultation,
  by adopting a new collocation of the books. With this view, after
  having expended the sum appropriated by the Council for the bind

                                            334
ing of all the books that required         the Library Committee pro
                                                  it,
ceeded to consider, first, the means of gaining greater space on the
shelves, by collecting together, as far as    was practicable, books of
                                                        it
a  similar  size ;and  secondly, by adopting  a classed arrangement, so
that the places occupied by the books should correspond, as nearly
as their sizes would admit, with their order in the Catalogue.      The
Council have the satisfaction of reporting, that this useful and labo
rious work has, by the great exertions of the Librarian during the
summer recess, been effectually performed and they congratulate
                                                             ;
the Society on the greater advantages which they will derive from
the possession of their extensive collection of books in every depart
ment of mathematical and physical science, by the increased facili
ties now afforded of finding readily any book that may be wanted.
    The Council have also to announce that          Catalogue has been
                                                                 a
made of the books relating to Miscellaneous Literature in the Soci
ety's Library.     Copies of this Catalogue are now ready for distri
bution to the Fellows.
    The Society      probably aware that, during the preceding year,
                     is                                                                a
Catalogue     has been  made, in conformity with the directions of the
Council, by James Orchard Halliwell, Esq., F.R.S., of the Miscella
neous Manuscripts, comprising highly interesting correspondence of
many learned men with the Society, from its first formation to nearly
the middle of the eighteenth century.
    The re-arrangement of the Library being now completed,          will          it
probably be satisfactory to the Society to know its contents and con
dition.    The Librarian has accordingly been requested to draw up
a summary, of which the following        an abstract —
                                              is                     :
    The total number of bound volumes contained in the
      Library amounts to                                         19,045
    Besides which, there are contained in    unbound Reports
                                                        it
      of the House of Commons, in number                            823

                                                                   5049
                                                                   2076

                           Journals                                3616
   Although this      an exact enumeration of the volumes contained
                      is
in the Library,      it scarcely just appreciation of their number,
                           is           a
from the circumstance of there being, in       multitude of instances,
                                                             a
two or three volumes bound in one. The Librarian        not sufficiently is
prepared, at the present moment, to give satisfactorily the exact num
ber of these, or of the distinct works, throughout the Library and
in the different classes for the precise numbers of volumes
                                                                              is in
                                ;                                  these
classes cannot as yet be ascertained.   But that the Library       much
richer than    would seem from the above enumeration, appears from
                it
the circumstance, that, in the Scientific division, 592 volumes con

                                    335
 tain  3883 distinct tracts; and, in the Miscellaneous portion, 173
 volumes contain 11-02 tracts.    Thus 765 volumes of the above total
 of 20,018 volumes, comprise as many as 5285 separate works.
     The Library contains, besides, a valuable collection of Oriental
 Manuscripts, especially Sanscrit, formed by Sir William Jones during
 his residence in the East, and presented to the Society, after his de
 cease, by Lady Jones.      Many of these are unique in Europe ; and
their value is attested by learned foreigners coming to this country
for the express purpose of consulting them.        Of the Miscellaneous
 Manuscripts, the autograph of the Principia, presented by Sir Isaac
 Newton to the Society, and from which the first edition was printed,
must be considered invaluable.        An unpublished MS. of Aubrey's
is also in the Library, and contains curious researches frequently re
ferred to by antiquaries. The collection likewise contains MSS. of
Pappus Alexandrinus, Statius, Jordanus, Nemorarius, Malpighius,
John Robins, &c. The Catalogue of Miscellaneous Literature is
peculiarly valuable, as containing autograph letters of the majority
of distinguished individuals throughout Europe since the first forma
tion of the Society ; for instance, of Newton, Leibnitz, Wren, Heve-
lius, Huygens, Lister, Hay, VVilloughby, &c. &c.
    The Library possesses, besides, a large collection of Maps and
Charts, and many Engravings ; but of these no catalogue is as yet
published.
    In almost every department of Science, the Library contains all
the most valuable works, especially in the mathematical sciences.
    In the Miscellaneous division of the Library, the largest propor
tion of which was acquired by the bequest of the Earl of Arundel,
the Library possesses some very interesting books, especially some
of the early works of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and many
Editiones principes of the Classics. The majority of these came into
the possession of the Earl of Arundel by the purchase of the library
of the celebrated Bilibaldus Pyrckheimer; particularly the jurists
and the early reformers.     Of these, the first editions of many of Lu
ther's tracts are interesting.   There are, besides, some curious col
lections of Italian and Spanish poetry.
    The earliest printed book in the Library is a splendid copy upon
vellum of the Decretals, printed by Fust in 1465, and Tully's Offices,
also on vellum, by Fust in 1466; and there are specimens of many
of the early German and Italian presses. Of our own, there are
copies of Caxton's second edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales,
and Pynson's first edition of the same works, the first half of which
was revised by Caxton. Neither have dates ; but the former is sup
posed by Tyrwhit to have been printed about 1482, and the latter
about 1493.      With these exceptions, the Library contains but few
early English books ; for the second folio edition of Shakspeare can
not be so called, as there are scientific books of an earlier date than
this in the Library. There are also the majority of the books printed
by the Record Commission and by the Oriental Translation fund.

                             Awards of Medals.
    The Council has awarded the Copley Medal for the present year
to Dr. G. S. Ohm, of Nuremberg, for his researches into the laws
of Electric Currents, contained in various memoirs published in
Schweigger's Journal *, PoggendorfTs Annalen, and also in a sepa
rate work, entitled Die Galvanisc/te Kette Mathematisch Bear-
bitet, published at Berlin in the year 1827.             In these works, Dr.
Ohm has established, for the first time, the laws of the electric cir
cuit ; a subject of vast importance, and hitherto involved in the
greatest uncertainty. He has shown that the usual vague distinc
tions of intensity and quantity have no foundation, and that all the
 explanations derived from these considerations are utterly errone
 ous. He has demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally,
that the action of a circuit is equal to the sum of the electro-motive
 forces divided by the sum of the resistances ; and that whatever be
 the nature of the current, whether voltaic or thermo-electric, if this
 quotient be equal, the effect is the same.           He has also shown the
 means of determining with accuracy the values of the separate re
 sistances and electro-motive forces in the circuit.          The light which
 these investigations has thrown on the theory of current electricity
 is very considerable ; and although the labours of Ohm were, for
more than ten years, neglected, (Fischner being the only author who,
 within that time, admitted and confirmed his views,) within the last
five years, Gauss, Leng, Jacobi, Poggendorff, Henry, and many
 other eminent philosophers, have acknowledged the great value of
 his researches, and their obligations to him in conducting their own
 investigations.     Had the works of Ohm been earlier known, and
 their value recognised, the industry of experimentalists would have
 been better rewarded.        In this country those who have had most
 experience in researches in which voltaic agency is concerned, have
 borne the strongest testimony to the assistance they have derived
 from this source, and to the invariable accuracy with which the ob
served phenomena have corresponded with the theory of Ohm.                This
 accordance, it may be observed, is altogether independent of the
particular hypothesis which may be adopted as to the origin of elec
tro-motive force ; and obtains equally, whether that force is regarded
as being derived from the contact of dissimilar metals, or as refer
able to chemical agency.

      The Council have awarded one of the Royal Medals for this year,
  which had been proposed for the subject of Chemistry, to Robert
  Kane, M.D., M.R.I.A., Professor to the Royal Dublin Society, for
  his paper " On the Chemical History of Archil and Litmus," pub
  lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840.
      It has been found that various lichens, which communicate no
  colour to pure water, strike a fine blue with solution of ammonia.
  The valuable colouring matters archil, litmus and cudbear, are com
  mercial preparations of these lichens. Some progress had already
  been made in the investigation of their colouring principles by the
  labours of Robiquet, Heeren, and Dumas ; of which the most im
  portant step was the discovery of Orcine, and also of Orceine, into
  which the former is converted by ammonia ; but the observations
  were isolated, and the whole subject was in the greatest obscurity.
  The present memoir by Dr. Kane records the first attempt to sketch
  a general history of the class : and, considering the great and pecu
  liar difficulties attending inquiries into organic colouring matters,
  the attempt may be esteemed eminently successful.           It proved an
  investigation of considerable intricacy and great extent, involving
  several hundred organic analyses ; and it has been conducted in a
  manner highly creditable to the author's skill as an analyst. The
  paper contains an account of the discovery of a large number of
   new compounds, not less than twelve, derived from archil and litmus,
   together with the more exact discrimination of several others, already
   known, but imperfectly described. The distinction made of two
    Orceines, which have hitherto been confounded as one, is a striking
   result contained in the paper : while the observations on the action
   of chlorine and of nascent hydrogen upon several of the bodies
   described, open new branches of inquiry.
       The objects which the author had in view in these inquiries were
   the three following : namely, first, to ascertain the primitive form
   of the colour-making substance in a given species of lichen, and
   trace the stages through which it passes before the coloured sub
   stance is developed ; secondly, to determine the nature of the various
   colouring substances which exist in the archil of commerce ; and
   thirdly, to examine the colouring materials of ordinary litmus. He
   finds in the lichen Roccella tinctoria the following bodies, either pre
   existing in the plant, or formed during the processes employed for
   its analysis: 1. Erythryline ; 2. Erythrine (the Pseudo-erythrine of
   Heeren); 3. Erythrine bitter ; 4. Telerythrine ; and 5. Roccelline
   (the Roccellic acid of Heeren).      The properties and constitution of
   these substances are then described, and the chemical formulae given,
   which are deducible from their respective analyses.          The author
   finds the   archil  of commerce   to consist essentially of three ingre
   dients, namely,    orceme, erythroleic acid, and  azoerythrine ; of each
   of the two former there exist two modifications, and there     is,in ad
   dition,
         a   yellow matter. After comparing his results with those ob
   tained by Heeren, by an examination of the products evolved by his
   erythrine in contact with air and with ammonia, and stating rea
   sons for some changes in nomenclature, the author gives the chemi

                                     338
 cal formulae resulting from his own analysis of these different sub
  stances.
     His inquiries into the constitution of ordinary litmus, which form
 the last division of his subject, lead him to the conclusion that that
 substance contains the principles designated by him as Erythrolein,
  Erythrolitmine, Azolitmine, and Spaniolitmine; and that the colour
 ing constituents of litmus are, in their natural condition, red ; the
 blue substances being produced by combination with a base, the
 bases in that of commerce being lime, potass, and ammonia ; and there
 is mixed up in the mass a considerable quantity of chalk and sand.
  The details of the analyses of these several substances, and the re
 sulting chemical formulae representing their constitution, are then
 given.
     The concluding section of the paper is occupied by an inquiry
 into the decoloration of the bodies which exist in archil and in lit
 mus. The latter of these, the author concludes, is reddened by acids,
 in consequence of their removing the loosely combined ammonia by
 which the blue colour is produced ; and the so-called hydrogen-acids
 liberate the colouring matter by their combining with the alkali to
 form bodies (either chlorides or iodides), with which the colouring
 matter has no tendency to unite. Hence it appears that the redden
 ing of litmus is no proof that chloride of hydrogen is an acid, and
 that the double decomposition which occurs is the same in principle,
whether hydrogen or a fixed metal come into play. After detailing
the blanching effects of other deoxydizing agents on the colouring
matter of litmus, and the action of chlorine on orceine and azolitmine,
the author remarks, that in these actions chlorine is subjected to con
ditions different from those which determine the nature of the results
with the generality of organic bodies, and that the displacement of
hydrogen, so marked in other cases, does not exist in the class of
substances under consideration ; but that, in reality, the products of
the bleaching energy of chlorine resemble in constitution the com
pounds of chlorine which possess bleaching powers.
    This paper may be viewed as a very important contribution to
organic chemistry, and as highly deserving of the Royal Medal ; an
award which will, doubtless, be hailed by chemists as a just encou
ragement to perseverance in skilful analytical research.
    There being no paper on Mathematics coming within the stipu
lations regulating the awards of the Royal Medals, which has been
deemed worthy of that for Mathematics in the present year, the
Council have, in virtue of the power given to them, under these cir
cumstances, by the regulations prescribed by Her Majesty, awarded
the other Royal Medal to Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq., for his paper,
which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840, and
is entitled " Experimental Researches into the Strength of Pillars of
Cast Iron, and other materials."
    This paper has been esteemed by the Council to be peculiarly va
luable in a practical as well as theoretical point of view, and there
fore to deserve, in an eminent degree, the honour of a Royal Medal.
It contains the results of an immense series of experiments, conducted

                                     339
\vith great patience and admirable skill, and at a very considerable
cost.     Mr. Hodgkinson's position among the manufactories of Man
chester, together with the unlimited command over the resources of
one of the largest engineering establishments, which he obtained
through the liberality of its proprietor Mr. Fairbairn, enabled him
to direct his inquiries to the forms of pillars which are found most
useful in practice. The results of his labours he has reduced to em
pirical formulae, peculiarly adapted for application to the purposes
of mechanical art.
     Among the most useful of the practical conclusions to which he
 has arrived, the following are more particularly deserving of notice.
     Mr. Hodgkinson has found, that in all long pillars of the same di
 mensions, the resistance to crushing by flexure is about three times
 greater when the ends of the pillars are flat, than when they are
 rounded.       A long uniform cast-iron pillar, with its ends firmly fixed,
 whether by means of discs or otherwise, has the same power to re
 sist breaking as a pillar of the same diameter, and half the length,
 with the ends rounded, or turned so that the force would pass through
 the axis. The strength of a pillar with one end round and the other
 flat, is the arithmetical mean between that of a pillar of the same
 dimensions with both ends round, and one with both ends flat. Some
 additional strength is given to a pillar by enlarging its diameter in
 the middle part.
      The strength of long cast-iron pillars with relation to their dia
 meter and length is also made the subject of Mr. Hodgkinson's in
  vestigations ; and the result he deduces from them      is,that the index
  of the power of the diameter, to which the strength      is proportional,
is    3-736.   He has also determined, by comparison of experimental
                                           a
  results, the inverse power of the length to which the strength of the
  pillar
       is    proportional.   The highest value of this power he finds to be
  1-914, the lowest 1-537, and the mean of all the comparisons 1-7117.
  He thus deduces, first, approximate empirical formulae for the break
  ing weight of solid pillars, and afterwards, more correct methods of
  determining their strength. From experiments on hollow pillars of
  cast-iron, formulae representing the strength of such pillars are, in
  like manner, deduced.
      The strength of pillars of wrought iron and of timber, in relation
  to their dimensions,  is   made the subject of another series of experi
  ments.      The result for wrought iron is, that the strength varies in
  versely as the square of the length of the pillar, and directly as the
   power 3-75 of its diameter, the latter being nearly identical with the
   result obtained for cast iron while in timber, the strength varies
                                 ;
   nearly as the fourth power of the side of the square forming the sec
   tion of the pillar.    In like manner, the power of cast-iron pillars to
   resist long-continued pressure, and the relative strengths of long pil
   lars of cast iron, wrought iron, steel and timber, are determined.
       The inquiry which constitutes the subject of this paper       is  not,
   however, the first of the kind in which Mr. Hodgkinson has been
   engaged several series of experiments and papers on the strength
            ;
   of iron, in various forms, have been published by him at different

                                   340
times; and their accuracy has established his claim to our confi
dence on the present occasion.
    The several medals, thus awarded, were then delivered, with ap
propriate addresses, by the Vice-President in the Chair.
    The Copley Medal, adjudicated to Dr. Ohm, was, in the absence
of Professor Daniell, the Foreign Secretary, delivered to Dr. Roget,
in order that it may be forwarded to its destination.
    The Royal Medal, adjudicated to Dr. Kane, was delivered to
Francis Baily, Esq., whom Dr. Kane had deputed to receive it for
him.
    The other Royal Medal, adjudicated to Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq.,
was delivered to himself.

    The Vice-President in the Chair having called upon Dr. Roget,
the senior Secretary, to read to the Meeting the biographical me
moirs which he had written of some of the Fellows lately deceased,
    Dr. Roget begged leave to observe, that, for many years past, it
has been customary for the President, in his anniversary addresses
to the Society, to give narratives of the leading incidents in the
lives, and an account of the scientific labours of the more distin
guished associates of whom death had deprived us during the pre
ceding year. The utility of such a retrospect, he remarked, is suf
ficiently obvious.   Consolation may be afforded to the survivors by
the just tribute thus publicly paid to the memory of those they
mourn. In marking the several steps of their ascent to eminence, in
retracing the services they have rendered to science and to man
kind, and in establishing their respective claims to our respect, our
admiration and our gratitude, fresh motives of emulation are pre
sented to those who are following in the same arduous paths, and
aspiring to the same honourable distinctions. The Society can never
forget how well these objects have been fulfilled by the excellent bio
graphical notices we have been accustomed to hear from our Presi
dents on each returning anniversary, and must feel how much reason
they have to regret the omission of the usual discourse from the
Chair on the present occasion. It is with a view to prevent this
interruption of the series being drawn into a precedent, that Dr.
Roget has now been induced, by the desire of the President, to at
tempt supplying, however imperfectly, the omission he has alluded
to.   Having but little leisure to perform this task, he wished to
claim the indulgence of the Meeting for the many imperfections they
will discover in the mode of its execution.
    Of the deceased members on the home list, Dr. Roget has been
able to notice only two, namely, Mr. Bauer and Sir Astley Cooper,
not having received, with regard to the rest, any authentic informa
tion which was deserving of record in this place. It is impossible
for him, however, to pass over in complete silence the honoured name
of one, whose loss within these few days we all so deeply deplore —
the late Sir Francis Chantrey*.          But the calamity is too recent
    * He was born in 1782, and expired quite suddenly on the 25th of the
present month (Nov. 1841) ; only five days before the present meeting.

                                     342
and too sudden to afford the opportunity, if indeed the effort could,
under these painful circumstances, have been made, of collecting
the materials for a narrative which might render adequate justice to
his superior merits as an artist, and to his exemplary character as a
man. This tribute to his memory must be reserved for a period
when his biographer will be able to review the subject more exten
sively, and with more calm deliberation.
   Francis Bauer        was born at Feldsberg, in Austria, on the 4th
of October,    1758.   While yet a boy he lost his father, who held an
appointment as painter to Prince Lichtenstein ; so that the care of
his education devolved upon his mother. He manifested very early
a talent for botanical drawing ; and the first published production of
his pencil, at the age of thirteen, was a figure of the Anemone pratensis
appended to a work of Stocrck.          lie eamo to England in the year
1788,   and  was  about to proceed    to  Paris ; when, on the eve of his
intended departure, he was offered by Sir Joseph Banks the appoint
ment of draughtsman at the Royal Gardens at Kew, a proposal
which induced him to relinquish his intentions of leaving England.
He took up his residence near those Gardens, and he continued to
dwell, during the remainder of his life, in their neighbourhood.
The salary of the new office which Mr. Bauer held was defrayed by
Sir Joseph Banks during his own life, and its continuance after his
decease was provided for by his will.
   Mr. Bauer, in fulfilment of his engagement, made numerous
drawings and sketches of the plants in the Garden ; and these are
now preserved in the British Museum.           A selection from his draw
ings was published in 1796, under the title of" Delineations of Ex
otic Plants cultivated in the Royal Gardens at Kew," containing in
all thirty plates of different kinds of Heaths.        His drawings have
also illustrated several papers published in the Linnaean Transac
tions, and particularly those of Mr. Brown.           The 13th volume of
that work contains a paper by Mr. Bauer on the Ergot of Rye,
drawn up from materials collected between the years 1805 and
1809; and the plate which illustrates it is derived from drawings
forming part of an extensive series in the British Museum, illus
trating the structure of the grain, the germination, growth and
developement of wheat, and the diseases of that and other Cerealia.
This admirable series of drawings constitutes perhaps the most
splendid and important monument of Mr. Bauer's extraordinary
talents as an artist, and of his skill in microscopic investigation.
The subject was suggested to him by Sir Joseph Banks, who was
engaged in an inquiry into the disease of corn known by the name
of blight; the part of Mr. Bauer's drawings which relates to that
disease was published in illustration of Sir Joseph's memoir on the
subject, and has been several times reprinted with it. Mr. Bauer
himself gave, in the volume of the Philosophical Transactions for
 1823, an account of his observations on the              Vibrio tritici of
Gleichen, with the figures relating to them ; and another small por
tion of his illustrations of the diseases of corn has since been pub

                                       343

    lished by him in the ' Penny Magazine for 1833. His figures of a
    somewhat analogous subject, the apple-blight, and the insect pro
    ducing      it,
                  accompany Sir Joseph Banks's memoir on the introduc
    tion of that disease into England, in the second volume of the
    Transactions of the Horticultural Society.
         Mr. Bauer had commenced, before the close of the last century,
a       series of drawings of Orchideoe, and of the details of their re
    markable structure, to which he made additions from time to time,
    as opportunities offered, nearly to the termination of his life.         A
    selection from these, which form one of the most beautiful and ex
    tensive series of his botanical drawings, was lithographed and pub
    lished by Professor Lindley, between the years 1830 and 1838, under
    the title of " Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants."
      A      paper by Mr. Bauer, entitled " Some Experiments on the
    Fungi which constitute the colouring matter of the Red Snow dis
    covered in Baffin's Bay," was published in the Philosophical Trans
    actions for 1820.      By mixing the snow containing these fungi with
    water, he found that they could be made to vegetate, but that they
    produced new fungi of     a    green instead of a red colour.       By ex
    posure to excessive cold the primitive fungi are killed, but their
    seed still retains vitality, and,
                                    if    immersed in snow, which appears
     to be their native soil, they reproduce new fungi, which are gene
    rally of a red colour.
         The Philosophical Transactions for 1823 contains the paper by
     Mr. Bauer already alluded to, entitled " Microscopical Observations
     on the Suspension of the Muscular Motions of the Vibrio tritici,"
     which forms the Croonian Lecture for that year. This minute
     worm, which infests wheat, and      is the immediate cause of that de
     structive disease called the Ear Cockle or Purples, congregates in
     immense numbers in the substance of the grains thus diseased,
     forming masses of a white and apparently glairy mucus, which,
     when immersed in water, separate and exhibit, under the micro
     scope, the worms in lively motion.         After they have become per
     fectly dry, and apparently lifeless, they may be readily revived by
     being moistened with a drop of water, when they become as lively
     as before.     Mr. Bauer determined, by series of experiments, that
                                               a
     the ova of these worms are conveyed into the cavities of the ger-
     mens by the circulating sap.      On inserting some of the worms into
     sound grains of wheat, and allowing them to germinate, he found
     the worms, in different stages of their growth, in the stalk, and ulti
     mately in the germens of the new plant.
         In the year 1816 he commenced lending the assistance of his
     pencil to Sir Everard Home, in the various anatomical and physio
     logical investigations in which the latter was engaged      ;  and in the
      course   of ten or twelve  years furnished,  in illustration of  Sir Eve-
      rard's numerous papers in the Philosophical Transactions, more
     than      hundred and twenty plates, which were afterwards reprinted
          ' a
      in his Lectures on Comparative Anatomy.'             These plates, which
     form together the most extensive series of Mr. Bauer's published
     works, embraced    a    great variety of important subjects, chiefly    in
-

                                     344
microscopic anatomy, and afford abundant evidence of his powers
of observation and skill in depicting the most difficult objects. It
is this rare and previously almost unexampled union of the observer
and the artist that has placed Mr. Bauer in the first rank of scientific
draughtsmen.      His paintings, as the more finished of his produc
tions may well be termed, are no less perfect as models of artistic
skill and effect, than as representations of natural objects.
    He died at his residence on Kew Green, on the 1 1th of December
last, in the 83rd year of his age*.
    Sir Astley Paston Cooper,          Bart., was the fourth son of the
Rev. Dr. Samuel Cooper, of        Yarmouth     in Norfolk.     His mother
was a daughter     of James   Bransby, Esq.,     of  Shottisham,  and was
                                                        ' The
known     as  the  authoress  of   a  novel   entitled          Exemplary
Mother.'     Sir Astley was born at Brooke, in the same county, on
the 23rd of August, 1768.        Even in his boyhood he was noted for
his bold and enterprising spirit, the sociability and kindness of his
disposition, and for the animation with which he entered into all
the sports of his juvenile companions.         After receiving from the
village schoolmaster, and from his father, who was a good scholar,
some portion of classical instruction, he was placed, at the age of
fifteen, with Mr. Turner, a surgeon and apothecary at Yarmouth.
Here he remained but a few months, and was then sent to London,
and bound apprentice to his uncle, Mr. William Cooper, one of the
surgeons of Guy's Hospital, but was soon after transferred, by his
own desire, to Mr. Cline, who had already attained great eminence,
and was surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital.              This connexion af
forded him ample opportunities of acquiring professional know
ledge, under the guidance of a master distinguished by a truly
philosophical mind, and for whom his pupil always felt the most
profound regard and veneration.          Young Cooper's labours in the
wide field of observation thus open to him, both in the hospital and
dissecting-room, were unremitting; and the practical information he
there acquired formed the solid basis of his future fame.         He made
a short visit to Edinburgh in the year 1787, and, although only in
his nineteenth year, was a distinguished member of the Royal Medi
cal Society of that place. On his return to London, Mr. Cline, who
was the teacher of anatomy, physiology and surgery at St. Thomas's
Hospital, appointed him his demonstrator of anatomy, and soon after
gave up to him a part of the anatomical lectures.           Sir Astley also
gained the consent of Mr. Cline and the other surgeons of the hospi
tals of Guy and St. Thomas, to give a course of lectures on the prin
ciples and practice of surgery, a subject which had previously only
formed a part of the anatomical course. He had now full scope for
the display of those talents which afterwards shone forth on the wider
theatre of the world, in a profession of which he became the bright
est ornament.     At first he was attended only by fifty students ; but
   * The above account it chiefly an abridgement of that contained in the
Proceedings of the Linnean Society for 1841, p. 101.

                                     345
his class soon increased to four hundred, which was by far the largest
that had been known in London.         His popularity as a teacher rapidly
increased : he made no attempts at displays of oratory, but always
studied to render the subject which he treated as plain and intelli
gible as possible to his hearers, wisely avoiding distracting their atten
tion by entering on controversial topics connected with physiology.
   On the close of 1791, the year he commenced as a lecturer, he
married the daughter of Thomas Cock, Esq., of Tottenham, who was
a distant relation of Mr. Cline : but as a proof of his constant soli
citude never to neglect the performance of any public professional
duty, it is remembered that on the evening of the day on which the
marriage ceremony was performed he delivered as usual his lecture,
without the slightest intimation to his class of what had happened
in the morning ; and even at the time when he was most fully en
gaged in this exceedingly laborious practice, he never omitted to
deliver his regular lectures at the hospital.
   In 1792, after spending some months at Paris and attending the
lectures of Dessault at the Hotel Dieu, and also those of Chopart,
he commenced practice in London, taking up his residence in the
city, where he dwelt for many years before he removed to the west
end of the town.      The popularity he enjoyed as a surgeon, and the
extent of his practice, have probably surpassed that of any of his
predecessors: and the large fortune which he acquired was the just
and honourable reward of distinguished merit and the most unre
mitting application.
   Sir Astley Cooper was elected a Fellow of this Society on Febru
ary the 18th, 1802.      He had previously contributed to the Philoso
                                                          "
phical Transactions two papers : the first entitled Observations on
the Effects which take place from the Destruction of the Membrana
Tympani of the Ear*," and the second containing "Further Ob
servations on the same subject, together with an Account of an
Operation for the removal of a particular kind of Deafness f." The
operation of puncturing the membrana tympani for the relief of that
species of deafness which arises from an obstruction of the Eusta
chian tube, suggested itself from observing that, in several cases, an
aperture in the membrane did not essentially diminish the powers of
the ear, and that even its total destruction by disease is not followed
by total deafness.     Several cases are described in which the opera
tion proved successful ; but of course, when deafness proceeds from
any other cause, the operation is not likely to be of the least benefit.
   The other professional publications of Sir Astley are exceedingly
numerous ; they all bear the stamp of the peculiar character of his
mind : simple and unaffected in point of style, and without preten
sion to elegance, they contain a plain relation of facts, unbiassed by
preconceived theories, the fruits of a long and extended experience,
and leading to sound practical conclusions.            He never sought pe
cuniary advantage by his publications;       and   while   he spared no ex-

pense in the execution of such engravings as were best calculated to
afford instruction, he invariably published them at a low price.
    His publications relate chiefly to the following subjects, namely,
the anatomy and treatment        of the various kinds of hernia ; of aneu
rism ; of spina bifida ; of dislocations and fractures ; of exostoses ;
of encysted tumors ; the extraction of calculi from the bladder ; the
structure and diseases of the breast and of the testis.         Among the
last subjects to   which  he  had particularly   turned  his  attention was
the structure and functions of the thymus gland.
    The splendid anatomical and pathological museum which he had
 collected and created entirely by his own industry and labour, and
 chiefly within the few last years of his life, at a period when the ar
 dour of most men for scientific pursuits begins to flag, consists of
 nearly three thousand preparations, each most exquisitely worked
 out, and the whole admirably arranged. The injected preparations
 are of unrivalled beauty, and show that he had acquired a facility
and perfection in the art of anatomical injection quite peculiar to
himself.
    He was latterly engaged in an experimental investigation on the
functions of the different parts of the brains of the lower animals.
His health had suddenly declined a short time before his death, which
happened on the 12th of February, 1841.
    Sir Astley was left a widower in June 1 827 ; the year following,
he married the daughter of John Jones, Esq., of Deny Ormond, in
 Cardiganshire.     He has left no children, and has bequeathed by his
will the whole of his museum to his nephew, Mr. Bransby Cooper,
and he has also left some property in the funds (namely, £4000 three
per cent, consols), of which the interest is to be given as a triennial
prize for the best original Essay or Treatise on given subjects in
Anatomy, Physiology or Surgery, to be awarded by the Physicians
and Surgeons of Guy's Hospital *.
    Augustin Pvhamus De Candolle,                one of the most distin
guished botanists of the present age, was born at Geneva on the 4th
of February, 1778.       The same year is also memorable by the death
of Linnaeus, the father of modern botany, which took place about
three weeks before the birth of one, who was destined to emulate
his fame in the same department of natural history.            When seven
years of age, De Candolle sustained a serious attack of hydrocepha
lus, a disease generally so fatal in its tendency, that the present af
fords a remarkable instance of complete recovery, after life had
been, for many days, despaired of.
    Possessing a remarkable facility of writing verses both in French
and Latin, and having at the same time a keen relish for the study
of history, young De Candolle at first resolved to make literature
his profession ; aspiring, as the summit of his ambition, to the fame
   * The greater part of this memoir of Sir
                                               Astley Cooper, and especially
the account of his early life, has been extracted from Pettigrew's 'Medical
Portrait Gallery.'

   of being  a great historian.    But this dream of his youth was effaced
   by  a new  taste, imbibed during a residence in the country, where
   he amused himself with examining the plants of the neighbourhood,
   and with writing their descriptions, before he had even opened a
   single book on botany.      The few pages he there read of the volume
   of nature were sufficient to captivate his affections for the pursuit
   which henceforth became the dominant passion of his life.           The
   botanical lectures of Professor Vaucher, which he attended in 1794,
   increased his ardour, and confirmed him in the resolution he had
   formed, of devoting himself to the cultivation of botany as his pri
  mary object, to which all other sciences, as well as branches of lite
   rature, were hereafter to be deemed subordinate, and to be followed
   merely as recreations from severer study.
      A visit to Paris, which he made in 1795, gave him the opportu
  nity of attending the lectures of Cuvier, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and
  other distinguished Professors of that period, and of forming friend
  ships with Desfontaines and Lamarck.          He always prided himself
  in having been the pupil of Desfontaines, in particular, towards
  whom he continued through life to feel the warmest gratitude and
  affection.
      The establishment of the Society of Physics and Natural History
  at Geneva, which took place, after his return, under the auspices of
  the celebrated De Saussure, gave a fresh and powerful impulse to
  his exertions ; as was evinced by the numerous memoirs which he
  presented to that Society.
      The state of Geneva being, soon after this period, absorbed into
  the French empire, De Candolle was induced to quit that city and
  attend the medical lectures in Paris ; a course of study which, tend
  ing to enlarge his views of the physiology of organized beings, con
  tributed greatly to the success with which he afterwards cultivated
 tho Philosophy of Botany. While at Paris, he founded, in conjunc
  tion with his friend M. Benjamin Delessert, the Society Philantro-
pique. One of the first advantages resulting to the public from this
 institution was the distribution of economical soups throughout the
  different quarters of the city.    Of this institution he was the active
 secretary   for  ten years  ; during which period another society was
 also formed under his direction and management for the Encourage
 ment    of National Industry.
     In  1804 he gave lectures on Vegetable Physiology at the "Col
 lege de France," and published an outline of his course in 1805, in
 the Principes de Botanique prefixed to the Flore Francaise.
     In 1806 he was commissioned by the French Government to col
 lect information on Botany and the state of Agriculture through the
 whole of the French empire, the limits of which, at that time, ex
 tended beyond Hamburgh to the north, and beyond Rome to the
 south.     Every year, during the following six years, he took a long
journey in the fulfilment of the task assigned him, and drew up a
 report of his observations for the minister. In these annual reports,
 however, he did not confine himself to the special objects of his com
 mission, but made known his views with regard to the internal ad-

                                   348
ministrations of the countries he visited, suggesting at the same time
measures for their amelioration and for the correction of existing
abuses.     He had projected a great work on the agricultural state of
the empire, and had even executed considerable portions of        it, com
prehending     the  French   Flora arranged   according   to modern  views
of classification, when the political events of 1814 put an entire stop
to the work.
     In 1807 he was appointed Professor of Medicine at Montpellier           ;
and in 1810,  a    chair of Botany was instituted in the same Academy,
which he was invited to occupy. Under his superintendence, the
Botanical Garden of that city was more than doubled in extent, and
 the study of Botany assumed     a     degree of importance it  had never
 before possessed.      De Candolle quitted Montpellier in 1816, very
 much to the regret of the students and of his colleagues, who em
 ployed every means in their power to induce him to remain among
 them but his country had been restored to liberty, and he was firm
     :
 in his determination to fix himself in his native city, and devote to
 its services the remainder of his days.
      Soon after his return to Geneva he was appointed to the chair of
 Natural History, an office which had been created expressly that he
 might occupy it. Among the first of the public benefits which he
  conferred upon his countrymen was the establishment of         a  Botanic
  Garden. The government of Geneva willingly lent their aid in form
  ing so laudable an institution, in which he was also assisted by great
                                                                     a
  number of voluntary subscribers.          The enthusiasm which he in
  spired for his favourite science was remarkably displayed on one
  particular occasion, when, being desirous of procuring for Geneva
                                                                             a a
  copy of Flora of Mexico which had been deposited with him for
         a
  few days, an appeal which he made to the public was responded to
  with such alacrity, that in the course of eight days, one thousand
   drawings had been finished by amateurs, who volunteered their ser
   vices on the occasion.
      The activity and powers of De Candolle's mind were displayed in
a     multitude of objects of public utility, the furtherance of which
   ever called forth in him the most lively interest — whether
                                                       ;                 was
                                                                        it
   the improvement of agriculture, the cultivation of the fine arts, the
   advancement of public instruction, the diffusion of education, or the
   amelioration of the legislative code.      Feeling deeply of what vast
   importance to the welfare of mankind    it   is  that sound principles of
   political economy should be extensively promulgated and well un
   derstood by all ranks of men, De Candolle never failed to develope
   and enforce those principles in his lectures and popular discourses,
   as well as in his official agricultural reports. On these subjects, and
   especially with respect to the immense advantages which would ac
    crue to the community from the unrestricted freedom of commerce,
   his views were those of the most enlightened policy, and exhibited        a
    sagacity in advance of the times in which he lived.
       As lecturer, he possessed in an eminent degree the power of im
         a
    parting to his auditors the enthusiasm which glowed within his own
    breast for the pursuits of natural history.    Complete master of the

                                          349
subject of his discourse, his ample stores of knowledge never failed
to supply him with illustrations ; and even in his extempore effusions,
all his ideas were developed in the clearest order, and explained with
singular perspicuity *. His chief delight was to afford assistance of
every kind to such students as needed        and in whom he perceived
                                                    it,
   desire of improvement.     His great aim was to inspire and diffuse
a ataste for the study of botany by rendering       popular among all
                                                              it
ranks. His library, which contained the richest collection of works
on that subject, and the volumes of his /tortus siccus, were always
open to those who wished to consult them. Often has he been known
to discontinue researches which he had commenced, on finding that
a similar design was entertained by another person and he hastened,    ;
on these occasions, to communicate to this inquirer his own views
on the subject, to place in his bands the materials he had collected,
and to put him in possession of the fruits of his own experience. His
sole object was the advance of knowledge         and whether this was
                                                          ;
effected by himself or by others was to him       matter of total indif
                                                              a
ference.
    De Candolle had been visibly declining in health for some years
before his end.     The sudden death of Cuvier had impressed him
with the apprehension that      similar fate might be impending and
                                 a                                             ;
that he himself might, in like manner, be cut off before he had ac
complished the great works in which he was then engaged.         He, in
consequence, resolved to set aside all other occupations, and con
centrate all his efforts in completing those more important designs.
During the last year of his life he undertook, with the vain hope of
improving his strength, long journey, in the course of which he at
                            a
tended the scientific meeting held at Turin, where, as might be ex
pected, he met with the most flattering and cordial reception.      His
death took place on the 9th of September, 1841, in the 64th year of
his agef.

   Simon L'Huillier, for many years Professor of Mathematics at
Geneva, was born in that city on the 24-th of April, 1750. The rapid
                                                                               with so
progress which he made in his collegiate studies was viewed
much interest by one of his           relations,   a  minister    of   the   reformed
church of Geneva, that he bequeathed him a large portion of his
fortune, on the express condition that he would embrace the cleri
cal profession : but young l'Huillier, feeling no inclination to the
studies which this condition would have imposed upon him, resisted
the temptation, and preferred devoting himself to the pursuits of
abstract science. The spirit of independence evinced by this sacri
fice, together with the extraordinary aptitude he displayed for mathe
matical acquirements, excited the interest and conciliated the affec
tion of another of his relations, the celebrated Le Sage, by whose
instructions and counsels the most salutary influence was exercised
over the studies of his pupil.            Bertrand, who then occupied the
 chair of Mathematics in the same college, was also one of those who
discerned in l'Huillier the dawn of genius ; and even at that early
period he regarded him as destined to be his successor in that pro
fessorship.
    As l'Huillier advanced to manhood, it             became necessary for him
to engage in some active employment,                in  which he could turn to
account his academical         attainments.      He    had  the good fortune, at
this critical time of his life, to be chosen tutor to Prince Czarto-
rynski, with whom he remained for a period of thirteen or fourteen
years ; ever honoured with the friendship and respect of all the mem
bers of the Prince's family.         He dedicated to the father of his pupil
his first work, which was published at Warsaw in 1782, under the
title of De relatione tuutud capacitatis et termitwrum Jigurarum,

    De Candolle was also the author of an essay on Geographical Botany,
prefixed to the second volume of the 'Flore Franchise' (ISOj).
                                                                              — Of the

geometrice consideratd ; seu de Maximis et Minimis pars prior cle-
mentaris, and in which he treats geometrically, and with singular
elegance and vigour of demonstration, all the elementary problems
relating to isoperimetric figures and solids. About the same time
he presented to the Academy of Berlin a memoir, which was after
wards published in its Transactions, on the minima relating to the
figure of the cells of bees, a subject which he appears, in that paper,
to have exhausted.
     The prize proposed by the same Academy in 1786, was adjudi
cated to him for a memoir, which was since published under the
title of Exposition elementaire des priticipes des calculs superieurs.
In this masterly essay the differential calculus is derived from a prin
ciple which D'Alembert had, in the first edition of the Encyclo
pedic, so happily illustrated, and which is now so generally recog
nised as the basis of that calculus ; namely, the doctrine of limits.
     On his return to Geneva in 1789, l'Huillier published an opus-
 cle, which acquired great celebrity, entitled La Polygonometrie ;
ou de la mesure des figures rectilignes, et abrege d'isoperimetrie ele-
mentaire, ou de la dependance mutuelle des grandeurs et des limites
des figures ; at the conclusion of which he gives a masterly sum
 mary of his former researches on elementary isoperimetry.            In this
work are given several formulae        of great generality,  and  which,   at
that time, were entirely    new,   and  were  calculated  to  facilitate the
study of numerous relations arising from the perimeters and areas of
polygons.      About the same period, indeed, Mascheroni published
 formulae very analogous to those of l'Huillier ; but the latter after
 wards succeeded in showing that he had arrived at the same results
 by original processes.
     During the tempestuous years of the revolution, l'Huillier sought
 in Germany the retirement so necessary to his pursuits ; and chose
 Tubingen as his residence.        The fruit of his labours during this
 seclusion was a work almost wholly new, which appeared at Tubin
 gen, in 1795, under the title Principiorum calculi differentialis et

     He was invited, about this time, to the chair of the Higher Ma
 thematics in the University of Leyden ; but his attachment to his
 native country was too deeply rooted to admit of his accepting this
 flattering offer: and eventually, in June of the same year (1795),
 he attained the object of his highest ambition, by receiving, after
 a successful public competition, the appointment of Professor
                                                                           of
 Mathematics     in the Academy     of Geneva.
     At a subsequent period he was associated with his friend and col
 league Professor Prevost in the composition of several
                                                                memoirs on
 the calculation of probabilities, which appeared under
                                                                 their joint
 names in the memoirs of the Berlin Academy.                The    questions
 treated of in these memoirs, although they do not reach the higher
                                                 mathematics, are yet re
  problems belonging to this department of
  solved by methods remarkable for their perspicuity and elegance.
  L'Huillier published, in 1 804, his Elemens raisonnes tfAlgebre, pu
  blics a V usage des etudians ; in 2 vols. 8vo, a work of considerable

                                       352
merit, as developing with clearness the true principles by which the
understanding advances from that which is known to that which is
unknown.
    His last work, the Elemens d'Analyse Geometriqiie el Algibrique,
appliquees d la recherche des lieux giometriquet, in 4to, appeared in
the year 1809.       It was dedicated to his former pupil, Prince Czar-
torynski, who was, at that time, minister of public instruction in the
vast empire of Russia, but who has since become better known to
 Europe as the most illustrious of the exiled Poles.
    The declining health of l'Huillier obliged him at length to resign
a professorship which he had held during five-and-twenty years, and
the duties of which he had ever discharged with the most unde
 rrating regularity, and the most scrupulous exactness.             Even while
 suffering acutely   from   a  painful   attack  of  sciatica,  he   insisted on
 being   carried  to  his  class, lest  any  detriment    should   arise   to his
pupils   from  an  interruption   to  his lectures.   Many     of  these   pupils
 have subsequently distinguished themselves in their scientific career ;
 among these may be cited one of our illustrious foreign members,
 Professor Sturm.
    For the simplicity of his manners and the strict integrity of his
 character, l'Huillier was no less remarkable than for the vigour
 and extent of his mathematical powers : by these qualities he was
endeared to his friends, and esteemed and respected by all, during
a life protracted beyond the ordinary duration. His death occurred
on the 28th of March, 1840, when he had nearly completed his 90th
year, with a constitution, however, which had some time previously
been shattered and broken down by the infirmities incident to so
advanced an age*.
    Felix Savart, a philosopher distinguished more especially for
 his researches in the science of Acoustics, was born on the 30th of
June, 1791, at Mezieres, the capital of the Department of the Ar
dennes, in France.        He very early exhibited a decided turn for me
chanical invention, and his greatest delight was to contrive and con
struct with his own hands musical instruments and apparatus il
lustrative of Natural Philosophy, a study of which he was passion
ately fond.      His parents had been connected with the school of
engineers at Mezieres ; and several of his relations having been di
stinguished as artists, he was himself educated with a view to the
same destination.       But the family afterwards removing to Metz, the
path which had at first been marked out for him was abandoned,
and he prepared himself for another profession, by directing his
whole attention to medicine. In course of time he obtained the
appointment of Assistant Surgeon in the Military Hospital.                   Not
satisfied with this probation, he, in 1814, repaired to Strasburg for
the purpose of prosecuting his medical studies in the Military
   * The above account is derived from a
                                              biographical notice by Professor
De La Rive, which forms part of the Compte rendu de telat de (instruction
publique de Geneve pendant tannic scolairc, 1839-1840.

Hospital of that town ; and he subsequently, in 1816, took a degree
in medicine in the University.          He then returned to his paternal
roof at Metz, with the intention of settling, and of applying himself
diligently to the practice of his profession.        But on being restored
to the scene of his youthful occupations, the renewed sight of those
philosophical instruments to which so many delightful associations
were attached, rekindled in full force the innate predilection for the
physical sciences, which, during so long an interval, had lain dor
mant in his breast.      The charms of science, arrayed in her most
attractive colours, glittered before his imagination, and were con
trasted, in his ardent mind, with the cares, the toils, and the anxie
ties of the profession in which he was embarking.              He yielded to
the powerful fascination, and disregarding all considerations of
prudence, took the irrevocable step of abandoning the prospects
which were opening in a career to which his youth had been
 devoted, and by which alone it had, till then, been his ambition to
 earn fortune, reputation and independence. Confiding in his know
ledge of Acoustics, which was ever his favourite study, and in which
 he conceived he had made discoveries, he quitted his provincial do
 micile and repaired to the metropolis, as to the mart where his ac
 quisitions would be best valued. He arrived in Paris with but scanty
 means of immediate support, without a friend, and unprovided with
 a single letter of recommendation. But Fortune took him by the hand,
 and favoured his first endeavour to obtain notice. He presented
 himself to Biot, and communicated to him his views, and the results
 of his researches in Acoustics. He met with the kindest reception
 from that philosopher, who had himself been occupied with similar
 inquiries, and was well qualified to appreciate the merits of Savart.
 Biot was ever after his friend and patron, and it was chiefly through
 his influence that Savart was, in the year 1820, appointed Professor
 of Natural Philosophy in one of the Institutions at Paris ; an office
 which he continued to hold till the year 1827, when he was nomi
 nated a Member of the Academy of Sciences.               Soon after this he
 was associated with Thenard, as Conservator of the Cabinet of Phy-
 sies of the College of France.         Thus raised to a state of independ
 ence, he had full leisure to devote himself to the science he had ever
 particularly cherished, and of which his labours have greatly ex
 tended the boundaries.        His admirable researches on the laws of
 the vibrations of solid     bodies   of different forms and kinds, and in
 particular, of  cords, of membranes,      of rods, whether straight, or bent,
 or of an annular shape    ; of flat discs, and of solids of revolution, both
 solid and hollow, have furnished results of great value and import
  ance.   His investigation of the structure and functions of the seve
 ral parts of the vocal organs, and his theory of the voice, both in
 man and in the lower animals, show great originality of research,
 and have thrown considerable light on a very difficult department
 of Physiology.
     Savart was elected, in the year 1839, a Foreign Member of the
  Royal Society, an honour which his unconquerable prejudice against
 the English, and everything emanating from England, prevented

                                        :sô4
his ever acknowledging. His premature death, on the 16th of March, .-
1810, has, unfortunately for science, arrested the brilliant career of
discovery, which he was pursuing with so much ardour and success,
and will, it is to be feared, deprive the world of the fruits of many of
his unfinished labours*.

tion on Savart pronounced before the Royal Academy of Sciences of the
Institute of France, by M. Becquerel, on the 18th of March, 1841.

LIEUT-COLONEL WM. HENRY SYKES, V.P.,                     in the Chair.
   Lieut. Thomas John Newbold was balloted for, and duly elected
a  Fellow of the Society.
    The reading of a paper entitled, " On Fibre," by Martin Barry,
 M.D., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edin., was resumed and concluded.
    The author observes, that, in the mature blood-corpuscle, there is

                                     363
often seen a flat filament, already formed within the corpuscle.          In
Mammalia, including Man, this filament is frequently annular ; some
times the ring is divided at a certain part, and sometimes one ex
tremity overlaps the other.      This is still more the case in Birds, Am
phibia, and Fishes, in which the filament is of such length as to con
stitute a coil.   This filament is formed of the discs contained within
the blood-corpuscle.     In Mammals, the discs entering into its forma
tion are so few as to form a single ring ; and hence the biconcave
form of the corpuscle in this class, and the frequent annular form of
the filament it produces.     In the other Vertebrata, the discs contain
ed within the blood-corpuscle are too numerous for a single ring ;
and they consequently form a coil.        At the outer part of this coil,
the filament, already stated to be flat, often presents its edge ; whence
there arises a greater thickness of the corpuscle, and an appearance
of being cut off abruptly at this part ; while in the centre there is
generally found the unappropriated portion of a nucleus ; and hence
the central eminence, surrounded by a depression, in those corpuscles
which, from the above-mentioned cause, have the edge thickened.
The nucleus of the blood-corpuscle in some instances resembles a ball
of twine ; being actually composed, at its outer part, of a coiled fila
ment.      In such of the invertebrata as the author has examined, the
blood- corpuscle is likewise seen passing into a coil.
    The filament, thus formed within the blood-corpuscle, has a re
markable structure ; for it is not only flat, but deeply grooved on both
surfaces, and consequently thinner in the middle than at the edges,
which are rounded ; so that the filament, when seen edgewise, appears
at first sight to consist of segments.      The line separating the appa
rent segments from one another is, however, not directly transverse,
but oblique.
    Portions of the clot in blood sometimes consist of filaments having
a structure identical with that of the filament formed within the
blood-corpuscle.     The ring formed in the blood-corpuscle of Man,
and the coil formed in that of Birds and Reptiles, have been seen by
the author unwinding themselves into the straight and often parallel
filaments of the clot ; changes which may be also seen occurring in
blood placed under the microscope before its coagulation ; and simi
lar coils may be perceived scattered over the field of view, the coils
here also appearing to be altered blood-corpuscles, in the act of un
winding themselves ; filaments, having the same structure as the fore
 going, are to be met with apparently in every tissue of the body.
 The author enumerates a great variety of organs in which he has ob
 served the same kind of filaments.
    Among vegetable structures, he subjected to microscopic examina
 tion the root, stem, leaf-stalk, and leaf, besides the several parts of the
 flower : and in no instance of phanerogamous plants, where a fibrous
 tissue exists, did he fail to find filaments of the same kind.          On
 subsequently examining portions indiscriminately taken from ferns,
 mosses, fungi, lichens, and several of the marine algae, he met with
 an equally general distribution of the same kind of filaments.         The
 flat filament seen by the author in all these structures, of both ani

                                      364
mals and plants, he states to be that usually denominated a fibre.
Its appearance is precisely such as that of the filament formed within
the corpuscle of the blood.         It is known, he remarks, that discoid
corpuscles circulate in plants ; and it remains to be seen whether or
not filaments are formed also in these.
    By gradually tracing the fibre or filament above-mentioned into
similar objects of larger size, the author endeavours to show that it
is not possible to draw a line of separation between the minutest fila
ment, and an object being to all appearance composed of two spirals
running in opposite directions, and interlacing at certain regular in
tervals ; an arrangement which produces in the entire object a flat
tened form, and gives it a grooved appearance.            It is, in fact, the
structure which, for want of a better term, he has called a flat fila
ment. The edge of this filament presents what, at first sight, seem
like segments, but which, in reality, are the consecutive curves of a
 spiral thread. A transverse section of such an object is rudely re
presented by the figure 8.      This is also precisely the appearance pre
 sented   by the minutest filament, generally termed Fibre : and the
 author particularly refers to the oblique direction of the line sepa
 rating the apparent segments in the smaller filament, in connexion
 with the oblique direction of the spaces between the curves of the
 spiral threads in the larger one.
    The spiral form, which has heretofore seemed wanting, or nearly
 so, in animal tissues, is then shown to be as general in animals as in
 plants. Nervous tissue, muscle, minute blood-vessels, and the cry
 stalline lens, afford instances in proof of this.     And if the author's
 view of identity in structure between the larger and the smaller fila
 ments be correct, it follows that spirals are much more general in
 plants themselves than has been hitherto supposed; spirals would thus
 appear, in fact, to be as universal as a fibrous structure.
    The tendency to the spiral form manifests itself very early. Of
 this the most important instance is afforded by the corpuscle of the
 blood, as above described. The author has also obtained an interesting
 proof of it in cartilage from the ear of a rabbit ; where the nucleus,
 lying loose in its cell, resembled a ball of twine, being composed at
 its outer part of a coiled filament, which it was giving off to weave
 the cell-wall ; — this cell- wall being no other than the last-formed por
 tion of what is termed the intercellular substance — the essential part
 of cartilage.    These nuclei in cartilage, as well as those in other tis
 sues, there is ground for believing to be descended, by fissiparous ge
 neration, from the nuclei of blood-corpuscles.
    The author then describes the mode of origin of the flat filament
 or fibre, and its reproduction in various animal and vegetable tissues,
 which he enumerates.         He conceives that each filament is a com
 pound body which enlarges, and, from analogy, may contain the ele
 ments of future structures, formed by division and subdivision, to
 which no limits can be assigned.
    He then traces the formation of muscle out of cells, which, ac
 cording to his observations, are derived from corpuscles of the blood,
 to the state where there exists what is denominated the fibril.            In

                                     365
this process, there are to be observed the formation of a second order
of tubes within the original tube ; a peculiarly regular arrangement
of discs within these second tubes ; the formation, first of rings and
then of spirals, out of discs so arranged ; the interlacing of the spirals ;
and the origin, in the space circumscribed by these, of spirals having
a minuter size ; which in their turn surround others still more mi
nute ; and so on.      The outer spirals enter for the most part into the
formation of the investing membrane discovered by Schwann, but
for the only complete description of which, in a formed state, we are
indebted to Mr. Bowman.          The inner spirals constitute what are de
nominated the fibrillee.     The fibril appears to the author to be no other
than a state of the object which he designates a fiat filament ; and
which, as he shows, is a compound structure.           The fibril he finds to
be, not round and beaded, as it has been supposed, but a flat and
grooved filament ; the description above given of the structure of the
filament being especially applicable here.         This flat filament is so
 situated in the fasciculus of voluntary muscle, as to present its edge
 to the observer.      It seems to have been the appearance presented
 by the edge of this filament, that is to say, by the curves of a spiral
 thread, that suggested the idea of longitudinal bead-like enlarge
 ments of the fibril, as producing striae in the fasciculus of volun
 tary muscle.      In the author's opinion, the dark longitudinal striae
 are spaces (probably occupied by a lubricating fluid) between the
 edges of flat filaments, each filament being composed of two spiral
 threads, and the dark transverse striae, rows of spaces between the
 curves of these spiral threads.       The filament now mentioned, or its
 edge, seems to correspond to the primitive marked thread or cylinder
 of Fontana — to the primitive fibre of Valentin and Schwann — to the
 marked filament of Skey — to the elementary fibre of Mandl — to the
 beaded fibril of Schwann, Miiller, Lauth, and Bowman — and to the
 granular fibre of Gerber.      The changes known to be produced by the
 alternate shortening and lengthening of a single spiral are exhibited
 in the microscope by a fasciculus of spirals, not only in its length
 and thickness, but in the width of the spaces (stria) between the
 curves of the spirals.    And a muscle being no other than a vast bundle
 of spirals, it is in contraction short and thick ; while in relaxation it
 is long and thin ; and thus there occurs no flattening of bead-like
 segments in contraction.        The author has found no segments that
 could undergo this change.        These observations on the form of the
 ultimate threads in voluntary muscle, were first made on the larva
 of a Batrachian reptile ; and have been confirmed by an examination
 of this structure in each class of vertebrated animals, as well as in
 the Crustacea, Mollusca, Annelida, and Insects.
     He finds that the toothed fibre, discovered by Sir David Brewster
 in the crystalline lens, is formed out of an enlarged filament ; the
 projecting portions of the spiral threads in the filament, that is, the
 apparent segments, becoming the teeth of that fibre.
     The compound filaments are seen with peculiar distinctness in the
 blood-vessels of the arachnoid membrane.           In connexion with the
 spiral direction of the outer filament in these vessels, the author refers

                                   366
to the rouleaux in which the red blood-discs are seen to arrange them
selves, in the microscope, as probably indicating a tendency to pro
duce spiral filaments.    To form rouleaux, corpuscle joins itself to
corpuscle, that is to say, ring to ring ; and rings pass into coils.
The union of such coils, end to end, would form a spiral. But the
formation by the blood-corpuscles of these rouleaux is interesting in
connexion with some facts recorded by the author in a former me
moir; namely, that many structures, including blood-vessels, havetheir
origin in rows of cells derived from corpuscles of the blood. The hu
man spermatozoon presented a disc with a pellucid depression, each
of the two sides of the peripheral portion of which was extended into
a thread ; these two threads forming by being twisted the part
usually designated as the tail. The occurrence of two tails, observed
by Wagner, is accounted for by the author by the untwisting of these
threads.
    The author has noticed very curious resemblances in mould, arising
from the decay of organic matter, to early stages in the formation of
the most elaborate animal tissues, more particularly nerve and muscle.
Flax has afforded satisfactory evidence of identity, not only in struc
ture, but in the mode of reproduction, between animal and vegetable
fibre.
    Valentin had previously stated that in plants all secondary deposits
take place in spiral lines. In the internal structure of animals, spirals
have herotofore seemed to be wanting, or very nearly so.         Should
the facts recorded in this memoir, however, be established by the re
searches of other investigators, the author thinks the question in fu
ture may perhaps be, where is the " secondary deposit" in animal
structure, which is not connected with the spiral form ? The spiral
in animals, as he conceives he has shown, is in strictness not a se
condary formation, but the most primary of all ; and the question
now is, whether it is not precisely so in plants.
    In a postscript the author observes, that there are states of volun
tary muscle in which the longitudinal filaments (" fibrillae") have no
concern in the production of the transverse striae ; these striae being
occasioned by the windings of spirals, within which very minute
bundles of longitudinal filaments are contained and have their origin.
The spirals are interlaced. When mature, they are flat and grooved
filaments, having the compound structure above described.          With
the shortening of the longitudinal filaments (" fibrillar") in muscular
contraction, the surrounding spirals, and of course the striae, be
come elongated and narrow ; while in relaxation these changes are
reversed.

     SIR JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK, Bart., V.P.                  and Treas.,
                               in the Chair.
    His Majesty the King of Prussia was balloted for, and duly
elected a Fellow of the Society.
    John Tricker Conquest, M.D., and Francis Henry Ramsbotham,
M.D., were severally balloted for, but not elected into the Society.
    1.  The reading of a paper, entitled, " Researches in Physical
Geology:" Third Series. By William Hopkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
was resumed and concluded.
    In a paper formerly read to the Society, the author had investi
gated an analytical expression for the precession of the pole of the
earth, on the hypothesis of the earth's being composed of a hetero
geneous solid shell inclosing a heterogeneous fluid ; and showed that
its amount, deduced from that hypothesis, could not agree with its
actual observed amount, unless the ellipticity of the interior surface
of the shell were less by a certain quantity than that of the exterior
surface.    As the ellipticity of the inner surface (assuming always
that the earth was originally fluid) depends on the thickness of the
shell, the author, in the present paper, determines the least thickness
which can be deemed compatible with the observed amount of pre
cession.
    In his former communication, the author had contemplated only
the case in which the transition from the solidity of the shell to the
fluidity of the mass contained in it was immediate ; but in the case
of the earth it must be gradual and continuous.            It is remarked,
however, that if in the actual case we were to consider all that por
tion of the mass as solid which is not perfectly fluid, we should take
the thickness of the shell too great ; and, on the other hand, if we
were to consider the whole of that as perfectly fluid which is not
perfectly solid, we should take the thickness of the shell too small.
 There must, consequently, be some surface of equal fluidity, (or, if
we please, of equal solidity,) such that if all above it were perfectly
 solid, and all beneath it perfectly fluid, the precession would be the
 same as in the case in which the transition from the solidity of the
 shell to the fluidity of the interior mass is continuous.    This surface
 is termed by the author the effective inner surface ; and the distance

                                          368
between       this surface and the outer one, the effective thickness of the
shell.
   The degree of solidity or fluidity at any point in the interior of
the earth must depend partly on the temperature at that point, and
may also depend partly on the pressure there. Both causes are
here assumed to be effective : if the latter be not so, it will easily be
seen that the conclusion arrived at will, a fortiori, be true.
   If through any point in the interior of the earth, (as, for instance,
a point in the axis of rotation,) we take a surface of equal tempera
ture, and through the same point, a surface of equal pressure, it is
evident that the surface of equal fluidity (or solidity) through that
point must be intermediate to these two surfaces. Its exact posi
tion cannot be determined without an experimental knowledge,
which we do not possess, of the relative effects of temperature in
opposing, and of pressure in promoting the process of solidification.
It is sufficient, however, for the purpose now in view, to know that
it must necessarily lie between the surfaces of equal temperature and
of equal pressure as its extreme limits ; and of these the author pro
ceeds to determine the position.
   The forms of the isothermal surfaces within a spheroid have never
been completely determined.       The determination given by the au
thor is an extremely approximate one when the ellipticity is small,
and the time during which the process of cooling has been going on
is very great, as it is presumed to be in the case of the earth.
   The author then enters into the analytical investigation of this
problem ; and deduces the conclusion that we must descend to a
depth greater than about one-fifth of the earth's radius before we
arrive at a surface of equal fluidity (or solidity) having an ellipticity
of the requisite value : that       is,
                                    the effective thickness of the crust
must be at least equal to one-fourth or one-fifth of the earth's ra
dius, in order that the precession may have its observed value               :   a
conclusion, the author observes, which entirely removes the founda
tion of certain vague and somewhat fanciful speculations in geology,
proceeding on the hypothesis of the thickness of the earth's crust not
being greater than twenty or thirty miles. It has been imagined
that in active volcanos, the volcanic vent may communicate directly
with the central fluid nucleus, whence the ejected fluid mass has
been supposed to be derived.        This notion, the author conceives,           is
rendered totally inadmissible, when          proved that the thickness of
                                                 is
                                                it
the solid portion of the globe cannot be less than 800 or 1000 miles.
It also remarked, that
   is                           follows from the great thickness of the
                               it
crust, that the present interior temperature of the earth cannot be
due to its original heat unless pressure be effective in promoting so
lidification,    a fact not yet established by experiment      for, if the
                                                                    :
present temperature be due to that cause,            certain that
                                                          it   is    must
                                                                        it
be sufficient at the depth of probably less than fifty miles to reduce
the matter composing the crust of the globe to        state of fusion un

the enormous pressure to which, at considerable depths, the mass is
subjected.   The author then offers an explanation of the phenomena
of volcanos on the supposition that a portion of matter more fusible
than the general mass of the globe exists in a state of fusion in sub
terranean reservoirs, forming so many subterranean lakes of deter
minate extent ; in some cases originally distinct ; in others, commu
nicating with adjoining lakes, by more or less obstructed channels ;
a theory which will also account for all the obscure geological ele
vations, except perhaps the earliest, as being produced by a simul
taneous action of a fluid pressure on every portion of the lower part
of a solid mass of definite extent. The author considers this har
mony in his general views with the results of analytical investigation
as constituting for them a strong claim to the attention of geo
logists.
   Another important conclusion which the author deduced from his
researches is, that if the interior temperature of the earth be due to
its primitive heat, pressure must be effective in promoting solidifica
tion of masses at high temperatures.
   2. The following paper was read : — " Contributions to Terre
strial Magnetism," No. III. By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A.,
F.R.S.
   In this  memoir, the author gives a detailed account of the obser
vations on the magnetic intensity made at sea by the officers of the
 Erebus and the Terror on their passage from England to Kergue-
len's Land ; the unreduced observations transmitted to the Admiralty
by the Commanders of these ships, Captain James Ross and Captain
Crozier, having been placed in his hands for that purpose.
   The first part of the paper relates to the observations made be
tween England and the Cape of Good Hope ; and the second, to
those made between the Cape and Kerguelen's Land.            These ob
servations, made at various stations, are given in the form of tables ;
and their accordance with the isodynamic lines drawn from Mr. Dun-
lop's observations, contained in the first number of the author's con
tributions on this subject, is pointed out.

   2. " On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Decidua."           By Ro
bert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
   In this paper, the author describes some appearances which he
 has observed in the structure of the human decidua, and which ap
 parently prove that the circulation of the maternal blood in the
ovum is carried on during the early months of gestation, chiefly by
the different layers of this membrane, and the cells of the chorion.
He has been led by his observations to the belief, that the veins of
the uterine decidua convey blood from the decidual cavity into the
veins of the uterus ; and that, in all probability, a current of ma
ternal blood is constantly flowing from the cells of the chorion,
through the decidua reflexa, into the decidual cavity.

ton the President of this Society will participate in, that, being in a
distant country, he is unable to be present upon this auspicious oc
casion, so interesting to the members, and which will long be grate

the Society will see the august name of Your Majesty, who is vene
rated as the encourager of art, of literature, and of science, enrolled
in our Charter book in the same page with those of our most gra
cious and beloved Sovereign and her illustrious Consort ; and we beg
leave accordingly to present the Charter book to Your Majesty for

   His Majesty then signed his name in the Charter book, and was
duly admitted a Fellow of the Society.
   His Majesty expressed his gratification at having his name en

    8. " On the Steam-wave."      By the Rev. Thomas Boys. Com
municated by Charles Babbage, Esq , F.R.S.
    The term steam-wave is employed by the author to denote that
peculiar kind of wave which is generated during the motion of steam
vessels on the water ; and which he shows results from the combina
tion of two separate sets of waves ; namely, those occasioned simply
by the progressive advance of the vessel, and which consequently
recede from it on each side, nearly at right angles to its course ; and
those arising from the impulses given to the water by the action of
the paddles, and proceeding in the same direction as the vessel
itself.   He ascribes to the cumulative force acquired by these waves
at the parts where they cross one another, the extraordinary vio
lence of effect with which they strike against all obstacles opposed
to their progress, and which renders them so formidable to boats
and other small vessels exposed to the encounter.
   The Vice-President in the Chair stated, that he was directed by
the    Council to call the attention of the Members present, and
through them of any philosophical inquirer who might at present
be engaged in the prosecution of experimental      research, to the ex
istence of a fund at the disposal of the President and Council of the
Society, denominated the Donation Fund, of which the dividends
are to be applied, " from time to time, in promoting Experimental
Researches, or in rewarding those by whom such researches may
have been made, or in such other manner as shall appear to the
President and Council for the time being most conducive to the in
                                                                 "

    The following papers were read, viz. —
    1. " Magnetic-term    Observations of the Declination, Inclination,

Duct in the Human Subject."         By George Owen Rees, M.D., Phy
sician to the Northern Dispensary. Communicated by P. M. Roget,
M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author, availing himself of a favourable opportunity which
presented itself of examining the contents of the thoracic duct in a
human subject, procured an hour and a quarter after death by hang
ing, to the amount of six fluid drachms, obtained by analysis the fol
lowing result : —
          Water, per cent                                90-48
          Albumen, with traces of fibrinous matter ... 7-08
          Aqueous extractive, or Zomodine                  2-56
          Alcoholic extractive, or Osmazome                0-52
          Alkaline chloride, carbonate and sulphate,
             with traces of phosphate, and oxide of
             iron                                          0-44

                                                        100-
   The fatty matters   possessed  the same general characters as those
of the blood, except that they did not contain phosphorus, as ap
peared from their yielding an alkaline, instead of an acid ash by in
cineration.     The aqueous extractive differed from that of the blood
by giving a ferruginous ash. The salts obtained by incineration
from the alcoholic extractive yielded a larger proportion of alkaline
carbonate than those of the blood.      The author is confirmed, by the
experiments he made on the present occasion, in his former views
concerning the cause of the white colour of the chyle, which he
ascribes to the presence of opake white salivary matter as one of its
constituents.     The author then gives the results of his microscopi
cal examination of the globules of the chyle, which he finds differ
totally from those of the blood.     He points out as being remarkable
the large quantity of fatty matter existing in the chyle, and consti
tuting an hydrocarbonaccous ingredient, which is constantly being
added to the mass of blood, and is very rapidly consumed ; as ap
pears from the small quantity of this matter discoverable in the
blood itself.    The proportional quantity of osmazome in the chyle
he finds greatly to exceed that contained in the blood.

   5. The reading of a paper, entitled,
                                          " On the Structure and Use of
the Malpighian bodies of the Kidney, with Observations on the Cir
culation through that Gland."       By William Bowman, Esq., F.R.S.,
Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's College, London, and Assistant
Surgeon to the King's College Hospital, was resumed and con
cluded.
   The author describes the results of his examination of the struc
ture and connexions of the Malpighian bodies of the kidney in dif
ferent tribes of Vertebrata, and shows that they consist essentially of
a small mass of vessels, contained within dilated extremities of the
convoluted uriniferous tubes.      The tubes themselves consist of an
outer transparent membrane (termed by the author the basement
membrane) lined by epithelium.       This basement membrane, where
it is expanded over the tuft of vessels, constitutes the capsule de
scribed by Miiller.     The epithelium lining the uriniferous tube is
altered in its character where the tube is continuous with the cap
sule, being there more transparent, and furnished with cilia, which,
in the frog, may be seen, for many hours after death, in very active
motion, directing a current down the tube. Farther within the cap
sule the epithelium is excessively delicate, and even, in many cases,
absent.   The renal artery, with the exception of a few branches given
off to the capsule, surrounding fat, and coats of the larger blood
vessels, divides itself into minute twigs, which are the afferent ves
sels of the Malpighian tufts.     After it has pierced the capsule, the
twig dilates, and suddenly divides and subdivides itself into several
minute branches, terminating in convoluted capillaries, which are
collected in the form of a ball ; and from the interior of the ball the
solitary efferent vessel emerges, passing out of the capsule by the
side of the single afferent vessel.     This ball lies loose and bare in
the capsule, being attached to it only by its afferent and efferent ves
sel ; and is divided into as many lobes as there are primary subdivi
sions of the afferent vessel ; and every vessel composing it is bare and
uncovered, an arrangement of which the economy presents no other
example.     The efferent vessels, on leaving the Malpighian bodies,
enter separately the plexus of capillaries surrounding the uriniferous
tubes, and supply that plexus with blood.        The blood of the vasa
vasorum also probably enters this plexus. The plexus itself lies on
the outside of the tubes, on the deep surface of the membrane which
furnishes the secretion ; and from it the renal vein arises by nume
rous radicles.
   Thus the blood, in its course through the kidney, passes through
two distinct systems of capillary vessels ; first, through that within
the extremities of the uriniferous tubes; and secondly, through that
on the exterior of these tubes.     The author points out striking dif
ferences between these two systems.       He also describes collectively

                                    376
 under the name of Portal System of the Kidney, all the solitary ef
 ferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies, and compares them with
 the portal system of the liver ; both serving to convey blood between
two capillary systems. In the latter, a trunk is formed merely for the
 convenience of transport, the two systems it connects being far apart.
 But a portion even of this has no venous trunk, viz. that furnished
by the capillaries of the hepatic artery throughout the liver, which
pour themselves either into the terminal branches of the portal vein,
or else directly into the portal-hepatic capillary plexus.   On the other
 hand, in the kidney, the efferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies,
situated near the medullary cones, having to supply the plexus of
the cones, which is at some little distance, are often large, and divide
themselves after the manner of an artery.        They are portal veins in
miniature. In further confirmation of his view of the existence of a
true portal system in the kidney of the higher orders of animals,
where it has never hitherto been suspected, the author describes his
observations on the circulation through the kidney of the Boa Con
strictor, an animal which affords a good example of those in which
 portal blood derived from the hinder part of the body traverses
 the kidney.     He shows that here the Malpighian bodies are sup
plied, as elsewhere, by the artery, and that their efferent vessels are
radicles of the vena portae within the organ, and join its branches as
they are dividing to form the plexus surrounding the tubes ; thus
corresponding with the hepatic origin of the great vena portae. In
 other words, the vena portae is an appendage to the efferent vessels
of the Malpighian bodies, and aids them in supplying blood to the
plexus of the tubes.      Thus in this variety of the kidney, as in the
liver, there is an internal as well as an external origin of the portal
system; while in the kidney of the higher animals, this system has only
an internal or renal origin, viz. that from the Malpighian bodies.
    A detail of the results of injection by the arteries, veins and ducts
 is then given, and they are shown to accord with the preceding de
scription. Many varieties in the Malpighian bodies in different ani
mals are also pointed out, especially as regards their size.
    The author then proceeds to found on his previous observations,
and on other grounds, a theory of a double function of the kidney.
 He conceives that the aqueous portion of the secretion is furnished
by the Malpighian bodies, and its characteristic proximate princi
ples by the walls of the tubes.       After giving in detail his reasons
for entertaining this view, he concludes by referring to the striking
analogy between the liver and kidney both in structure and func
tion, and by expressing his belief, first, that diuretic medicines act
specially on the Malpighian bodies, and that many substances, espe
cially salts, which when taken into the system have a tendency to
pass off by the kidneys with rapidity, in reality escape through the
Malpighian bodies; secondly, that certain morbid products occa
sionally found in the urine, such as sugar, albumen, and the red par
ticles of the blood, also, in all probability, pass off through this bare
system of capillaries.

    A paper was read, entitled,
                                 " On the Diurnal Temperature of the
 Earth's  Surface,  and the discussion of a simple Formula for ascer
taining  the  same."   By S. A. Drach, Esq. Communicated by John
Lee, Esq.,   LL.D., F.R.S.
    The author observes, in his introductory remarks, that during a
period of twenty-four hours the quantity of calorific rays emitted from
the sun, and falling on the exposed atmosphere of the earth, is pro
portional to one day's area as swept by the radius vector divided by
the square of that radius ; or is proportional to the true angular mo
tion for that day ; which is equivalent to substituting the declinations
resulting from the true longitudes for those deduced from the mean
ones at mean noons.     On the arrival of the rays at the superior limit
of our atmosphere, they undergo refraction, absorption, and difficulty
of conduction ; and when arrived at the surface of the earth, they
suffer radiation and reflection ; the absorption alone, at a vertical di
stance, amounting to upwards of one-fourth. The maximum sensible
heat, he proceeds to observe, appears to follow the sun in its diurnal
revolution, being similar, in this respect, to the point of maximum
tidal height of the ocean; 'hence he applies the term thermal esta
blishment to the retardation of the effects caused by atmospherical
conduction and localities, in the same manner that the term tidal
establishment has been employed to denote the local constant by
which the astronomical effects on the tides are delayed.
   The tables annexed to the paper assume that the degree of the
thermometer is proportional to the cosine of the sun's meridian alti
tude, commencing with that on the day of observation,        and ending
with the altitude thirty days previously. After explaining the for
mation of these tables, and detailing the conclusions derivable from
them, the author gives a sketch of the perturbing causes, such as
oceanic evaporation, mountain ranges, and other local influences ; he
then enters into a discussion of the mathematical expression for the
daily heat ; and he concludes with some observations on the theories
of temperature and isothermal lines, as affected by the electrical and
magnetical conditions of the earth, dependent on its rotation on its
axis.

   SIR JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK, Bart., V.P.                  and Treas.,

   The reading of a paper, entitled " Contributions to the Chemical
History of the Compounds of Palladium and Platinum." By Robert
Kane, M.D., M.R.I.A., communicated by Francis Baily, Esq.,
V.P.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   The author states it to be his object, in this and in some subse
quent papers, to examine specially the composition and properties
of the compounds of palladium, platinum, and gold ; and to ascertain
how far they agree, and ia what they differ, as to the laws of com
bination to which these compounds are subjected. He commences
with the investigation of the compounds of palladium, employing for
that purpose a portion of that metal with which he was furnished by
the Royal Society out of the quantity bequeathed to the Society by
the late Dr. Wollaston.     He describes the mode of obtaining the
protoxide of palladium, and enters into the analysis of the hydrated
oxide, the black suboxide, and the true basic carbonate of that metal ;
detailing their properties and the formulae which express their mode
of composition. The chlorides of palladium form the next subject of
inquiry ; and the author concludes from his experiments that the loss
of chlorine which the protochloride undergoes, when kept for some
time in a state of fusion at a red heat, is perfectly definite ; and also
that the loss represents one half of the chlorine which the salt con
tains.   But in the double salts formed by the protochloride of pal
ladium with the chlorides of the alkaline metals, he finds that the
similarity of constitution usually occurring between the compounds
of ammonium and potassium is violated. From his analysis of the
oxychloride of palladium the author concludes that it is quite ana
logous to the ordinary oxychloride of copper. He then examines a
variety of products derived from the action of a solution of caustic
potash on solutions of ammonia-chlorides of potassium.             Their
properties he finds to indicate analogies between palladium and
other metals, whose laws of combination are better known. The
sulphate, the ammonia-sulphates,    the nitrates, and the ammonia-ni

                                   380
trates of palladium, and lastly, the double oxalate of palladium and
ammonium, are, in like manner, subjected to examination in a de
tailed series of experiments.
    The second section of the paper relates to the compounds of pla
tinum, and comprehends researches on the composition of the proto-
chloride of platinum ; on the action of ammonia on biniodide of pla
tinum ; and on the action of ammonia on the perchloride of plati
num; in which the properties of these substances are detailed and
the formulae expressing   their composition deduced.

       " Of the ultimate distribution of the Air-passages, and of the

son, Esq., F.L.S., Surgeon, Great Malvern.          Communicated by
R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S.
    After reciting the various opinions which    have prevailed among
anatomists regarding the manner in which the bronchial tubes ter
minate, whether, as some suppose, by cells having free communica
tion with one another, or, as others maintain, by distinct and sepa
rate cells having no such intercommunication, the author states that
having been engaged in investigating, with the aid of the micro
scope, the seat and nature of pulmonary tubercles, he could never
discover, in the course of his inquiry, any tubes ending in a cul-de-
tac ; but, on the contrary, always saw, in every section that he made,
air-cells communicating with each other. He concludes from his
experiments and observations, that the bronchial tubes, after dividing
dichotomously into a multitude of minute branches, which pursue
their course in the cellular interstices of the lobules, terminate, in
their interior, in branched air-passages, and in air-cells which freely
communicate with one another, and have a closed termination at the
boundary of the lobule. The apertures by which these air-cells open
into one another are termed by the author lobular passages: but he
states that the air-cells have not an indiscriminate or general inter
communication throughout the interior of a lobule, and that no ana
stomoses occur between the interlobular ramifications of the bron-
chiae themselves ; each branch pursuing its own independent course
to its termination in a closed extremity.     Several drawings of the
microscopical appearances of injected portions of the lungs accom
pany this paper.

Temperature in the sun's rays at Hull, during the years 1823 and
1833." By G. H. Fielding, M.D. Communicated by the Rev. Wm.
Buckland, D.D., F.R.S.
   The meteorological causes to which the author ascribes the sudden
accession of the influenza at Hull, and its continuance from the 26th
of April to the 28th of May 1833, are, first, the unusually cold

                                     382
weather during March, and also the cold and wet which prevailed
during April in the same year : secondly, the sudden rise of tem
perature, amounting to 21 of Fahr., which occurred in a few hours
on the 26th of April: and thirdly, the continuance, through May,
of extreme vicissitudes of temperature between the day and the
night ; the burning heat of the days and the cold thick fogs, with
easterly winds, commencing generally about sunset, and prevailing
during the night.
    A   paper was also read, entitled, " Report of a remarkable appear
ance of the Aurora Borealis below the Clouds."         By the Rev. James
Farquharson, LL.D., F.R.S., Minister of Alford.
    The phenomenon recorded in this paper occurred on the night of
the 24th of February 1 842, when a remarkable aurora borealis was
seen by the author apparently situated between himself and lofty
stratus clouds, which extended in long parallel belts with narrow
intervals of clear sky in a direction from north-west to south-east.

   A  paper, entitled,
                       " On  the Organic Tissues in the bony structure
of the Corallidae."     By J. S. Bowerbank, Esq., F.G.S., communi
cated by Thomas Bell, Esq. F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
    The author submitted small portions of nearly seventy species of
bony corals to the action of diluted nitric acid, and thus obtained
their animal tissue, freed from calcareous matter, and floating on
the surface of the fluid in the form of a delicate flocculent mass.
By the aid of the microscope, this mass was found to be pervaded
by a complex reticulated vascular tissue, presenting numerous rami
fications and anastomoses, with lateral branches terminating in
closed extremities.     There were also found, interspersed among
these, another set of tubes, of larger diameter than the former, and
provided, in many places, with valves ; the branches from these
larger vessels occasionally terminate in ovoid bodies, having the
appearance    of gemmules or incipient polypes. In other cases,
masses of still larger size, of a more spherical shape, and of a
brown colour, were observed attached to the membrane, and con
nected with each other by a beautiful network of moniliform fibres.
 Numerous siliceous spicula, pointed at both extremities and exceed
ingly minute, were discovered in the membranous structure of se
veral corals ; and also other spicula of larger size, terminated at
one extremity in a point, and at the other in a spherical head ; a
form bearing a striking resemblance to that of a common brass pin.
    Besides these spicula, the author noticed in these membranous
tissues a vast number of minute bodies, which he regards as identi
cal with the nuclei of Mr. Robert Brown, or the cytoblasts of
 Schleiden.

   The reading of a paper, entitled, " Sixth Letter on Voltaic Com

Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great
Britain, &c, by John Frederic Daniell, Esq., Foreign Sec. R.S.,
Professor of Chemistry in King's College, London, was resumed
and concluded.
   The purport of this letter is to follow the consequences of the law
of Ohm, and the expressions which result from            it,
                                                        relative to the
electromotive force, and to the resistances in the course of voltaic   a
circuit   to apply this theory to the verification of the conclusions
          ;
which the author had formerly deduced from his experiments          and    ;
to suggest additional experiments tending to remove some obscu
rities and ambiguities which existed in his former communications.
In following out these principles, the author      led to offer various
                                                   is
practical remarks on the different forms of voltaic batteries which
have been proposed with view either to the advancement of our theo
                             a
retical knowledge of the science, or to the service of the arts.   The
author enters more particularly into an explanation of the principles
on which the cylindric arrangement of the battery he has intro
duced      founded, which appear to him to have been greatly misun
          is
derstood.    The formulae and the calculations which form the body
of this paper are not of nature to admit of being reported in the
                             a
present abstract.
     A   paper was also read, entitled,
                                       " On Fibre   :"   additional observa
tions.        By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S., Lond.   and Ed.
   On examining coagulating blood, the author finds that      contains
                                                                   it
discs  of two different kinds the one comparatively pale the other,
                                 ;                                 ;
very red.         in the latter discs that a filament
                 It   is                               formed and
                                                         is            ;       it
is these discs which enter into the formation of the clot the former,
                                                               ;
or the pale discs, being merely entangled in the clot, or else remain
ing in the serum.    He thinks that the filament escaped the notice of
former observers, from their having directed their attention almost
exclusively to the undeveloped discs which remained in the serum,
and thus conceived that the blood-discs are of subordinate import
ance, and are not concerned in the evolution of fibrin.
   To render the filament distinctly visible, Dr. Barry adds    chemi  a
cal reagent capable of removing a portion of the red colouring
matter, without altogether dissolving the filament.    He employs for

                                   385
this purpose chiefly a solution of one part of nitrate of silver in 120
parts of distilled water ; and sometimes also the chromic acid.      He
admits    that the use of  these reagents  would,  on account   of their
destructive tendency when concentrated, be objectionable as proofs
of the absence of any visible structure ; but as the point to be
proved is that a certain specific structure does exist, he contends
that the same appearance would not equally result from the chemi
cal actions of reagents so different as are those of chrome and the
salts of mercury and of silver.      After the appearance of the fila
 ment, thus brought to light, has become familiar to the eye, it may
 be discerned in the blood-discs, when coagulation has commenced,
 without any addition whatever.        Those blood-discs of the newt,
 which contain filaments, often assume the form of flask-like vesicles,
 the membranes of which exhibit folds, converging towards the neck,
 where, on careful examination, a minute body may be seen pro
 truding.    This body is the extremity of the filament in question, its
 protrusion being occasionally such as admit of its remarkable struc
 ture being recognised.
     The author proceeds to describe various appearances which he
 has observed in the coagulum of the blood, and which strongly re
 semble those met with in the tissues of the body, and are obviously
 referable to a similar process of formation.    He bears testimony to
 the accuracy of the delineations of coagulated blood given by Mr.
 Gulliver.     One of the most remarkable phenomena discovered by
 the author in the coagulation of the blood is the evolution of red
 colouring matter ; a change corresponding to that which he had
 previously observed to take place in the formation of the various
 structures of the body out of the corpuscles of the blood. He con
 siders the production of filaments as constituting the essential cir
 cumstance in coagulation.
     He conjectures that the notched or granulated fibres noticed in
 the blood by Professor Mayer, may have been of the same kind as
 the flat, grooved, and compound filaments described by himself ; but
 he thinks that, in that case, Mayer's explanation of their mode of
 origin must be erroneous ; for they may be seen to be produced by
 a portion of the blood not mentioned by him, namely, the corpus
 cles.
     Mr. Addison's discovery of globules in the uppermost stratum of
 inflammatory blood, and of their influence in the formation of the
 bufly coat, is confirmed by Dr. Barry, who remarks that these glo
 bules are altered red blood-discs.     That the blood corpuscles are
 reproduced by means of parent-cells, as suggested by Mr. Owen
 and by the author, is confirmed by the observations of Dr. Remak ;
 but the author had long ago indicated a division of the nucleus as
  being more particularly the mode of reproduction, not only of those
  corpuscles, but of cells in general.  With this conjecture the obser
  vations of Remak on the blood-corpuscles of the fatal chick fully
  accord. Whether the author's further speculation, namely, that
 the parent-cells are altered red blood-discs, is correct, still remains
  to be seen.

                                    386
    The phenomenon of the " breaking off short," or notching of the
 fasciculus of a voluntary muscle in a transverse cleavage of the
 fibre, is regarded by Dr. Barry as a natural consequence of the in
 terlacing of the larger spirals, which he has described in a former
 paper ; the fracture, in proceeding directly across the fasciculus,
 taking the direction in which there is least resistance.
    The position of the filament in the blood-corpuscle is represented
 as bearing a striking resemblance to that of the young in the ovum
 of certain intestinal worms, the filaments of which are reproduced
 by spontaneous division.     The author subjoins the following quaere,
 " Is the blood-corpuscle to be regarded as an ovum ?"

 The   MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                 President, in the Chair.
    The following papers were read, viz. —
    1. " Barometrical Observations, showing the effect of the Direc
tion of the Wind on the Difference between distant Barometers."
By Lieut-Colonel Philip Yorke, S. F. Guards. Communicated by
Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, R.A., F.R.S., &c.
    The author institutes a comparison between the barometric heights
as observed at the Apartments of the Royal Society, and at his house
in Herefordshire, in the neighbourhood of Ross, with a view to as
certain the influence of prevailing winds on the atmospheric pressure.
The barometers thus compared together were of the same construc
tion, and by Ihe same maker; and the times of observation, namely
nine o'clock a.m. and three o'clock p.m., were the same at both places,
the distance between which is 1 10 miles in longitude, and about 20 in
latitude. The degree of accordance in the march of the two barome
ters is exhibited by that of curves traced on three sheets accom
panying the paper.     The results are given in eight tables.  The au
thor agrees with Schubler in ascribing the currents prevailing in the
atmosphere to the variable relations of heating and cooling which
obtains between the Atlantic Ocean and the continent of Europe at
different seasons ; the facts ascertained by the series of observations
here presented being in accordance with that hypothesis.         If the
northerly and westerly winds in England be partly the effect of the
expansion of the air on the continent, then the barometer which is
nearest to the continent, or in this instance that at London, ought
to be relatively more depressed than the one more distant; or if
the southerly and easterly winds be regarded as proceeding to the
ocean, then, for a similar reason, the barometer nearest to the ocean
ought to be relatively depressed ; and that both these effects are
produced, is shown by the tables.       This view of the subject also,
the author remarks, is corroborated by Raymond's observations,
detailed in his memoir on the determination of the height of Cler
mont Ferrand, from which it appears that with the north winds, the

                                   387
southern barometer was most depressed      ; while the reverse occurred
with the southerly winds.
    " On   the Rectification and Quadrature of the Spherical Ellipse."
By   James    Booth, Esq., M.A., Principal of Bristol College. Commu
nicated by John T. Graves, of the Inner Temple, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    The author, at the commencement of this paper, adverts to a
rather complex discussion of a portion of the subject of his inquiry
by M. Catalan, published in the Journal de Mathe'matiques, edited
by M. Lionville.
    He then proceeds to establish two fundamental theorems, appli
cable to, — 1st, the quadrature, and 2nd, the rectification of the sphe
rical ellipse.
    1st. The quadrature of the spherical ellipse is reduced to the
calculation of a complete elliptic function of the third order, whose
parameter and modulus are quantities essentially         related to the
cone ; its parameter being the square of the eccentricity of the
ellipse, whose plane is at right angles to the axis of the cone, and
its modulus being the sine of the semi-angle between the focals.
    2nd. The rectification of the spherical ellipse is made to depend
on a complete elliptic function of the third order, whose parameter
is the same as in the preceding case, but whose modulus is the sine
of the angle between the planes of the elliptic base and of one of
the circular sections.
    The author then proceeds to establish a remarkable relation be
tween the area of a given spherical ellipse and the length of the
spherical ellipse generated by the intersection of the supplemental
cone with the same sphere.
    He shows that if there are two concentric supplemental cones cut
by the surface of a concentric sphere, — 1st, the sum of their spherical
bases, together with twice their lateral surfaces, is equal to the sur
face of the sphere ; 2nd, the difference of their spherical bases is
equal to twice the difference of their lateral surfaces.
    Hence, also, he deduces a remarkable theorem, viz. the sum of
the spherical bases of any cone whose principal angles are supple
mental, cut by a sphere, together with twice the lateral surface of
the cone comprised within the sphere, is equal to the surface of the
sphere.
    The author then, alluding to some researches of Professor
MacCullagh and of the Rev. Charles Graves, Fellow of Trinity Col
lege, Dublin, proceeds to give a simple elementary proof of a well-
 known formula of rectification, and thence deduces some remark
 able properties of the tangent at that point of the ellipse, which is
termed by him the point of rational section.
    Assuming the properties of the plane ellipse, he proceeds to show
 that a similar formula of rectification holds for any curve generated
 by the intersection of a spherical surface with a concentric cone of
 any order.     He goes on to develope a series of properties of the
 spherical ellipse, bearing a striking analogy, as indeed might have
 been expected, to those of the plane curve. Thus he establishes a

point of rational section as in the plane ellipse, shows that the tan
gent arc is at this point a minimum, and developes some other cu
rious analogies.    It is a simple consequence of his formula that the
spherical elliptic quadrant may be divided into two arcs whose dif
ference shall be represented by an arc of a great circle.         This
theorem, previously obtained by M. Catalan, is analogous to that of
Fagnani, which shows that the difference of two plane elliptic arcs
may be represented by a straight line.
   The author concludes by reducing the quadrature of the surface
of a cone of the second degree, bounded by a plane perpendicular
to the axis, to the determination of a complete elliptic function of
the second order.
   The Society then adjourned       over the Whitsun Recess, to meet
again on the 26th instant.

      A paper  was in part read, entitled, " On the Transparency of the
  Atmosphere, and the Law of Extinction of the Solar Rays in passing
  through it."    By James D. Forbes, Esq., F.R.S., Sec. R.S. Edinb.,
  Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh.
                               June  2, 1842.
  The   MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                  President, in the Chair.
     The reading of a paper, entitled, " On the Transparency of the
  Atmosphere, and the Law of Extinction of the Solar Rays in passing
 through it."    By James D. Forbes, Esq., F.R.S., &c, was resumed
 and concluded.
     This paper is divided into seven sections.    In the first, the qua
 lities of heat and light are considered in as far as they modify the
 comparability and absolute nature of our measures of the influence
 of the solar rays. All instruments, whether called Thermometers,
 Photometers, or Actinometers, measure but the peculiar effect to which
 their construction renders them sensible, but are incompetent to
give absolute measures of either heat or light.
     The second section treats of the history of the problem of the law
and measure of extinction of the solar rays in passing through the
atmosphere of the earth in clear weather. The labours of Bouguer,
Lambert, De Saussure, Leslie, Herschel, Kamtz and Pouillet are
successively passed under review, and their instrumental methods
considered.
    In the third section, a mathematical problem of considerable dif
ficulty and interest is investigated ; principally after the manner of

                                    390
 Laplace.   It consists in the determination of the length of the path
 and the mass of air which a ray of light must traverse in passing
through the earth's atmosphere at every different angle of obliquity.
 The author determines the numerical value of these quantities for
 all angles of incidence from 0° to 90°.
    The fourth section contains an account of the observations made
by the author in conjunction with Professor Kamtz in 1832. These
were conducted in 1832 at the top and bottom of the Faulhorn, a
mountain of the canton of Berne in Switzerland. The lower station
 was Brientz, and the intercepted stratum of air had 6800 English
feet of thickness, corresponding in its weight to about one-fourth of
 the entire atmosphere.      Frequent observations were simultaneously
 made with the actinometer and other meteorological instruments at
both stations, and the loss of solar heat in passing through the in
 tervening mass of air was thus directly determined.
    In the fifth section, the observations made from sunrise to sunset,
 on one peculiarly favourable day (the 25th September, 1832), are
 carefully analysed ; and from the absorption at various obliquities,
the law of extinction in the atmosphere, within the limits of obser
 vation, is attempted to be deduced.
    The sixth and seventh sections include the results of similar, but
less perfect observations in 1832 and in 1841.
    From the facts and reasonings of this paper, the author deduces,
 on the whole, the following conclusions : —
    1 . The absorption of the solar rays by the strata of air to which
we have immediate access is considerable in amount for even mo
derate thicknesses.
    2. The diurnal curve of solar intensity has, even in its most nor
mal state, several inflections ; and its character depends materially
on the elevation of the point of observation.
    3. The approximations to the value of extra- atmospheric radia
tion, on the hypothesis of a geometrical diminution of intensity, are
inaccurate.
    4. The tendency to absorption through increasing thicknesses of
air is a diminishing one ; and in point of fact, the absorption almost
certainly reaches a limit beyond which no further loss will take
place by an increased thickness of similar atmospheric ingredients.
The residual heat, tested by the absorption into a blue liquor, may
amount to between half and a third of that which reaches the sur
face of the earth after a vertical transmission through a clear at
mosphere.
    5. The law of absorption in a clear and dry atmosphere, equiva
lent to between one and four thicknesses of the mass of air traversed
vertically, may be represented, within those limits, by an intensity
diminishing in a geometrical progression, having for its limit the
value already mentioned.        Hence the amount of vertical transmis
sion has always, hitherto, been greatly overrated ; or the value of
extra-atmospheric solar radiation greatly underrated.
    6. The value of extra-atmospheric solar radiation, on the hypo
thesis of the above law being generally true, is 73° of the actino

                                     391
 meter   marked B 2. The limiting value of the solar radiation, after
 passing through an indefinite atmospheric thickness, is 15° 2'.
    7. The absorption, in passing through a vertical atmosphere of
 760 millimeters of mercury, is such as to reduce the incident heat
 from 1 to 0-534.
    8. The physical cause of this law of absorption appears to be
the non-homogeneity of the incident rays of heat, which, parting
with their more absorbable elements, become continually more per
sistent in their character ; as Lambert and others have shown to
take place, when plates of glass are interposed between a source of
heat and a thermometer.
    9. Treating the observations on Bouguer's hypothesis of a uniform
rate of extinction to the intensity of the incident rays, the author
obtains for the value of the vertically transmitted shares of solar
heat in the entire atmosphere, —
    By the relative intensities at Brientz and the Faulhorn... 0-6842
    By  the observations at the Faulhorn alone,    —
                            First method                        0-6848
                            Second method                       0-7544
    By the observations at Brientz alone, —
                            First method                        0-7602

    A paper   was read, entitled, " On    the  Specific Inductive Capaci
ties  of certain Electric Substances." By William Snow Harris, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    The author, pursuing the experimental inquiry suggested by the
theory of Mr. Faraday relative to the differences in specific induc
tive capacity exhibited by different dialectric substances, instituted
a series of experiments for determining with precision their compa
rative powers of insulation, and of sustaining by induction charges of
electricity. The substances to be examined were cast into the form
of circular plates and furnished on both their surfaces with circular
coatings of tinfoil of a diameter equal to one-half that of the plate,
and the electric intensities were measured by electrometers           of the
same construction as those which he used in his former experiments,
and which he has described in his papers already published in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1839.         The results are stated in ta
bles ; from the last of which it appears that the inductive capacities
of the dialectric bodies tried, that of air being expressed by unity,
are proportional to the following numbers :—
                 Substances.                  Relative capacities.

 SIR JOHN W. LUBBOCK, Bart., V.P. and Treas., in                 the Chair.
    The following papers were read, viz. —
    1.
       " On the Action of the Rays of the Solar Spectrum on Vegetable
Colours."      By Sir John Frederick William Herschel, Bart., K.H.,
F.R.S.
    The author, having prosecuted the inquiry, the first steps of which
he communicated in a paper read to the Royal Society in February
 1 840, relating to the effects of the solar spectrum on the colouring
matter of the Viola tricolor, and on the resin of guaiacum, re
lates, in the present paper, the results of an extensive series of simi
lar experiments, both on those substances, and also on a great number
of vegetable colours, derived from the petals of flowers, and the leaves
of various plants. In the case of the destruction of colour of the pre
parations of guaiacum, which takes place by the action of heat, as
well as by the more refrangible rays of light, he ascertained that
although the non-luminous thermic rays produce an effect, in as far
as they communicate heat, they are yet incapable of effecting that
peculiar chemical change which other rays, much less copiously en
dowed with heating power, produce in the same experiment. He
also found that the discoloration produced by the less refrangible
rays is much accelerated       by the application of artificial terrestrial
heat, whether communicated by conduction or by radiation ; while,
on the other hand, it is in no degree promoted by the purely ther
mic rays beyond the spectrum, acting under precisely similar cir
cumstances, and in an equal degree of condensation.            The author
proceeds    to describe,  in great detail, the  photographic   effects pro
duced on papers coloured by various vegetable juices, and after
wards washed with solutions of particular salts ; and gives a minute
account of the manipulations he employed for the purpose of im
parting to paper the greatest degree of sensitiveness to the action of
solar light. This action he found to be exceedingly various, both as
regards its total intensity and the distribution of the active rays over
the spectrum.      He observed, however, that the following peculiar
ities obtain almost universally in the species of action exerted.
    First, the action is positive ; that is to say, light destroys colour,
either totally, or leaving a residual tint, on which it has no further,
or a very much slower action ; thus effecting a sort of chromatic ana
lysis, in which two distinct elements of colour are separated, by de
stroying the one and leaving the other outstanding.         The older the
paper, or the tincture with which it is stained, the greater is the
amount of this residual tint.

                                    394
    Secondly, the action of the spectrum is confined, or nearly so, to
the region  of it occupied by the luminous rays, as contra-distinguished
both from the so-called chemical rays beyond the violet, (which act
with chief energy on argentine compounds, but are here for the
 most part ineffective,) on the one hand, and on the other, from the
 thermic rays beyond the red, which appear to be totally ineffective.
Indeed, the author has not hitherto met with any instance of the
extension of this description of photographic action on vegetable
colours beyond, or even quite up to the extreme red.
    Besides these, the author also observed that the rays which are
effective in destroying a given tint, are, in a great many cases, those
whose union produces a colour complementary to the tint destroyed,
or at least one belonging to that class of colours to which such com
plementary tint may be referred. Yellows tending towards orange,
for example, are destroyed with more energy by the blue rays ; blues
by the red, orange and yellow rays ; purples and pinks by yellow
and green rays.     These phenomena may be regarded as separating
the luminous rays by a broadly defined line of chemical distinction
from the non-luminous ; but whether they act as such, or in virtue
of some peculiar chemical quality of the heat which accompanies
them as heat, is a point which the author considers his experiments
on guaiacum as leaving rather equivocal.       In the latter alternative,
he observes, chemists must henceforward recognise, in heat from
different sources, differences not simply of intensity, but also of
quality ; that is to say, not merely as regards the strictly chemical
changes it is capable of effecting in ingredients subjected to its in
fluence.
   One of the most remarkable results of this inquiry has been the
discovery of a process, circumstantially described by the author, by
which paper washed over with a solution of ammonio-citrate of iron,
dried, and then washed over with a solution of ferro-sesquicyanuret
of potassium, is rendered capable of receiving with great rapidity a
photographic image, which, from being originally faint and some
times scarcely perceptible, is immediately called forth on being
washed over with a neutral solution of gold.       The picture does not
at once acquire its full intensity, but darkens with great rapidity up
to a certain point, when the resulting photograph attains a sharpness
and perfection of detail which nothing can surpass.        To this pro
cess the author applies the name of Chrysotype, to recall to mind its
analogy with the Calotype process of Mr. Talbot, to which in its
general effect it affords so close a parallel.
   2.  " Experimental    Researches on the Elliptic Polarization of
Light." By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Pro
fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
   This paper contains an experimental investigation of the pheno
mena of elliptic polarization resulting from the reflexion of polarized
light from metallic surfaces, and the theory on which they are ex
plicable ; the analytical results being given in a tabular form, and
applied to the cases of the experiments themselves.

    3.  " On  the Influence of the Moon on the Atmospheric Pressure,
as deduced from the Observations of the Barometer made at the
 Magnetic Observatory at St. Helena."          By Lieutenant    J. H. Le-
 froy,  R.A.,  late Director of that Observatory.     Communicated by
 Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., F.R.S.
    In order to determine the dependence of     the barometric pressure
 on lunar influence, the author arranges all the two-hourly observa
 tions in each lunar month with relation to the time of the moon's
 passing the meridian; entering in one column the observation of each
 day nearest to the meridian passage, whether before or after ; and en
 tering in separate columns those corresponding to two hours, four
 hours, six hours, &c, before and also after that observation.       The
 monthly means at every two hours from the meridian passage are
 then taken ; and again, the means at the same intervals, for each
 three months from September 1840 to December 1841.             From the
 results thus obtained the author states that it appears that the moon's
 passage over both the inferior and superior meridian produces a
 slight increase of pressure ; a maximum in the curve occurring at
 both (that of the latter being slightly the greater), while the minima
 correspond to the moon's rising or setting.
    It appears also, that the rise of the tides will not account for the
whole amount of the increase of pressure, even admitting that it has
 a tendency to produce an effect of that nature. The times of max
 ima do not correspond ; and there appears to be no atmospheric
establishment. The pressure is greater about the period of new
 moon than at full moon ; and greater in the third and fourth than
 in the first and second quarters ; a result which agrees with that
given by Mr. Howard for the climate of London. The observations
of both years agree in making the pressure greater under the Peri
gee than under the Apogee. Mr. Howard had found that the mean
pressure in Great Britain, which is in the opposite hemisphere from
 St. Helena, is greater under the Apogee than under the Perigee.

log-book."      By Captain James Clark Ross, R.N., F.R.S.
    5. "An Appendix to a paper on the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus,
with a further Account of the Nervous Structures of that Organ."
By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
    After premising a short history of the opinions of Galen, Dr.
 William Hunter, Mr. John Hunter, Professor Tiedemann, Professor
Lobstein, and Professor Osiander, relative to the existence, course,
and enlargement of the nerves of the uterus, the author adverts to
his own researches on this subject, which commenced with his dis
covery, in April 1838, of the trunk of a large nerve accompanying
the uterine vein, and of the great nervous plexus with which it was
continuous. Of this discovery he gave an account to the Royal
Society in a paper read on the 12th of December of the same year.
In a subsequent paper, he described some large nervous ganglia

                                   396
situated at the neck of the uterus ; and in the present appendix he
describes other nervous structures of still greater size which pre
sented themselves to him, on a still more complete dissection which
he made of a gravid uterus at the full period of gestation.     It ap
pears from the results of these dissections that the human uterus
possesses a great and extensive system of nerves, which enlarge du
ring pregnancy, along with the coats, blood-vessels, and absorbents
of that organ, and which after parturition resume their original con
dition. It is chiefly through the influence conveyed by these nerves
that the uterus is rendered capable of performing its various func
tions, and by which sympathies are established between it and other
parts  of the system.

   An account is here given of some additional facts illustrative of
the singular properties of iron as a photographic ingredient, and also
of some highly interesting photographic processes dependent on
those properties, which the favourable weather of the summer has
enabled him to discover. The author also describes a better method
of fixing the picture, in the process which he has denominated the
 Chrysotype, than that which he had specified in the latter part of
his paper. In this new method the hydriodate is substituted for the
hydrobromate of potass ; and the author finds it perfectly effectual ;
pictures fixed by it not having suffered in the smallest degree, either
from long exposure to sunshine or from keeping.
   He next considers the class of processes in which cyanogen, in its
combinations with iron, performs a leading part, and in which the
resulting pictures are blue ; processes which he designates by the
generic term Cyanotype. Their varieties appear to be innumerable,
but one is particularly noticed, namely, that of simply passing over
the ammonio-citrated paper, on which a latent picture has been im
pressed, very sparingly and evenly, a wash of the solution of the
common yellow ferrocyanate of potass.       As soon as the liquid is
applied the negative picture vanishes, and is replaced, by very slow
degrees, by a positive one, of a violet-blue colour on a greenish-
yellow ground, which, at a certain moment, possesses a high degree

                                     398
of  sharpness, and singular beauty and delicacy of tint.          From his
further researches on this subject he deduces the following conclu
sions : first, that it is the heat of the rays, not their light, which ope
rates the change ; secondly, that this heat possesses a peculiar che
mical quality, which is not possessed by the purely calorific rays
outside of the visible spectrum, though far more intense ; and thirdly,
that the heat radiated from obscurely hot iron abounds especially in
rays analogous to th jse of the region of the spectrum above de
 scribed.
    The author then describes the photographic properties he has
 discovered to belong to mercury, a metal which he finds to possess,
in an eminent degree, direct photographic susceptibility.

    A letter  was also read from    Sir John F. W. Herschel on the sub
ject of Photography,      addressed  to S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.

    The following papers were read, viz : —
    1. " On certain improvements on Photographic Processes described
 in a former communication."        By Sir John Frederick William Her
 schel, Bart, K.H., F.R.S., &c, in a letter to Samuel Hunter Christie,
 Esq., Sec. R.S. Communicated by Mr. Christie.
    The present memoir, which is a sequel to the last by the same
 author, is accompanied by a series of photographic impressions illus
 trative of the chrysotype, cyanotype, and other processes formerly
 described by him.       Some improvements which he has introduced
 into these processes are given, together with a few remarks on some
 other points treated of in the former paper, in relation to the influ
 ence of thermic rays as distinct from calorific rays ; the former being
 rays, which in the spectrum accompany the red and orange rays,
 which are also copiously emitted by heated bodies short of redness,
 and which are distinguished from those of light by being invisible.
 The author thinks they may be regarded as bearing the same rela
 tion to the calorific spectrum which the photographic rays do to the
 luminous one, and would propose to designate them by the term
parathermic rays.       He conceives that these may be the rays which
 are active in producing those singular molecular affections determi
 ning the precipitation of vapours in the experiments of Messrs.
 Draper, Moser, and Hunt, and which will probably lead to import
 ant discoveries as to the intimate nature of those forces, resident on

                                      399
 the surfaces   of bodies, to which    M. Dutrochet    has given the name
 of epipolic forces.

    The President then    addressed  the meeting   as follows  :
       Gentlemen,
I  must commence my address to you by the expression of my re
gret that my absence from England at this period of the last year
prevented my being then able to meet you at your Anniversary.
The gratitude which it has behoved me to intimate to my Council
on former occasions for their assistance in the discharge of my pre
sidential duties, it is more than ever necessary for me now to feel, as
it was that assistance that rendered my absence no real detriment
to the Society.
    During that absence, an event took place to which       I am bound to
refer, — I allude to the visit to this city of the sovereign of another
country at the time of the auspicious baptism of His Royal High
ness the Prince of Wales.         His Prussian Majesty was pleased to
join our Society.      At this I heartily rejoice, as I believe it to be a
happy omen for mankind when those who are placed in exalted
situations show their sympathy with scientific pursuits.         I congra
tulate the Prussian nation, that her sovereign has taken so early an
opportunity of countenancing science, and of declaring his opinion
that the natural philosopher is a friend to good government, to
order, and to civilization.

                                     401
     The pleasure experienced by you on this occasion was enhanced
by the presence within these walls of Baron Humboldt, who ac
 companied his Majesty.        It is very seldom that we can expect to
 see among us any of our Foreign Associates. It was therefore doubly
 gratifying to receive, together with his sovereign, the distinguished
philosopher who had travelled over so large a portion of the globe
in the pursuit of every branch of knowledge.
     Since I last addressed you, two years ago, a great degree of suc
 cess has attended the expedition of Captain Ross to the Antarctic
 Region. I congratulate you, Gentlemen, on the results already de
 rived from an expedition which originated in a joint application to
 Government from your Council and the British Association.          I  re
joice that a British officer has had the honour, not only of making
 most important scientific researches, but also of approaching much
 nearer to the Southern Pole than any one had done before him, and
 of discovering a new Iceland and a new Hecla, more gigantic than
 the arctic volcano.
     With respect to the magnetic observatories, I have the gratifica
 tion of informing you that they are to be continued for three more
 years, in hopes of making the information to be obtained from them
 more extensive and more accurate. The consent to this continu
 ance was granted by Sir Robert Peel : a continuance of the scien
 tific measure of one minister by the statesman who had superseded
 and succeeded him.        This is a gratifying circumstance, as proving
 that, as we hope and believe that British patriotism belongs to all
 parties, so the love of science also belongs to all, or rather that in
 scientific pursuits there is no party feeling and no party jealousy.
 I must add, that on the present occasion, the application of the
 Council of the Royal Society was seconded by M. Brunow, the am
 bassador of the Emperor of Russia; thus showing that nations are
 ready to testify that any great acquisition of physical knowledge is
 a common object to the whole human race.
     The hopes that the Expedition to the Niger might be productive
 of important additions to our stores of science, as well as great re
 sults to the highest interests of humanity, have been unhappily in a
 great measure disappointed.        At the same time the hopes of the
 scientific naturalist have not been entirely vain, for I am informed
by Mr. Gray that many new species of birds and other animals have
been brought to England from Fernando Po and the mouth of the
Niger.
     Your Council, Gentlemen,     have taken into their consideration the
great importance that microscopical researches have always pos
sessed, and the still greater influence upon science that they are
now beginning to exercise, in the hands of Mr. Owen and others,
as well as the extraordinary perfection to which the instrument itself
is now brought.      They have come to the conclusion that it is highly
expedient that we should ourselves possess the means of repeating
and verifying the experiments brought before our notice, as well as
instituting new branches of inquiry.        We have therefore thought it
expedient, by summoning competition to our aid, to endeavour to

                                  402
obtain one of the best microscopes that can be constructed. Indeed
we feel sure, that, independently of the liberal price that we have
offered, there is no optician who would not feel highly gratified on
seeing within these walls an instrument constructed by him.
    The room, Gentlemen, in which we are met, has had some changes
 made in the pictures which adorn its walls. In consequence of these
changes you will see, in addition to those portraits to which you
are accustomed, the likeness of one of the most distinguished of our
 body ; of one who was equally eminent in natural philosophy and
 in archaeology.   Our posterity, Gentlemen, will probably hereafter
 be at a loss whether to admire Dr. Young most in his pursuits of
 natural knowledge, or in his discovery of the key to the greatest
 mystery of bygone ages, — the hieroglyphical writing of the Egyp
 tians.
    You will not be less pleased to see another portrait of a venerable
 philosopher still spared to us — of that great and original chemist,
 Dr. Dalton.
    I have to congratulate you also on the possession of the bust of a
lady whose acquirements are an honour to her sex and to her coun
            I
 try; and feel sure that the likeness of Mrs. Somerville, from the
 hand of our lamented Chantrey, will ever be highly prized by the
 Royal Society.
    In addition to these ornaments to our Apartments, since ad    I
 dressed you in our Anniversary Meeting of 1840, I must not pass
 over the portrait of Mr. Dollond, to whom the astronomer is so
 much indebted for his improvement in the art of constructing tele
scopes ; and I should be wholly inexcusable if I omitted the valua
ble picture given to us by Mr. Vignolles, and representing the prince
of English science, the immortal Sir Isaac Newton.
    I am happy to state that the Royal Society has not, during the
past year, had to lament the death of any one of her Foreign Mem
bers.    We could not reasonably hope that such should be the case
among her British Fellows.      I shall now, Gentlemen, conclude, as
usual, by a short account of some of the more remarkable men, whe
ther for scientific research, or for public services, whom the Royal
Society has had the misfortune to lose since last November.
    Among the deceased Fellows of the present year, we have to
lament the loss of one of the most eminent surgeons and physiolo
gists of our times — one whose investigations and discoveries have
shed a new light on that most intricate part of the human organiza
tion — the Nervous System.
    Sir Charles Bell, K.H., F.R.S. L.       and E., &c, the youngest
son   of the Rev. W. Bell, of the episcopal church of Scotland, was
born at Edinburgh in the year 1778.       While a mere youth, he was
instructed in the elements of anatomical science by his brother Mr.
John Bell (himself a distinguished surgeon and anatomist), and at
a very early period he published the first part of " Plates of Dissec
tions;" a work alike remarkable for the fidelity of the anatomical

                                    403
  details, and the spirited style of the illustrations from the pencil of
  the author.
     In 1799, Mr. Charles Bell was admitted a member of the Royal
  College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and soon afterwards was ap
 pointed one of the surgeons of the Royal Infirmary in that city,
 where he acquired a high reputation as a skilful and dexterous
 operator.
     In 1806, he removed to London ; and by his own unaided exer
 tions, established himself as a lecturer on Anatomy and Surgery.
 He was subsequently associated with Mr. Wilson in the celebrated
 anatomical school of Great Windmill Street, and speedily became
 one of the most popular and effective lecturers in the surgical
 schools of London ; although at that period, Cline, Cooper, Aber-
 nethy, and other eminent men, were in the zenith of their fame as
 professional teachers.
    He was elected Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital in 1812.
     A few years afterwards he was appointed Professor of Anatomy
 and Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons of London, in which
 capacity he delivered a series of lectures, which excited in an extra
 ordinary degree the interest and attention of the profession, the
 theatre of the College being crowded to the conclusion of the course.
    Immediately after the battle of Waterloo, Mr. Charles Bell, with
 that humanity and zeal for the pursuit of professional knowledge
 which marked his character, proceeded to Brussels, and tendered
 his assistance to the wounded soldiers in the hospitals of that city ;
 and after his arrival he was incessantly engaged for three successive
days and nights in the operations and dressings of upwards of 300
cases.
    In  1826,  Mr. Charles Bell  wa3 admitted a     Fellow of the Royal
Society.
    On the institution of the London University College, in 1828, Mr.
Charles Bell was chosen Principal of the Medical School ; and he
delivered the opening lecture in that department of the College, and
also a course of lectures on Physiology.
    On the accession of William IV. to the throne, Mr. Charles
Bell, together with a limited number of other men of distinguished
scientific attainments, received the honour of knighthood.
    A "Treatise on Animal Mechanics," composed by Sir Charles
Bell for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, being
the substance of some of the lectures which he had delivered before
the College of Surgeons, contained so powerful and lucid an expo
sition of the proofs of creative design, as exemplified in the struc
ture of the human frame, that our late President, Mr. Davies Gilbert,
was led to select the author as one of the Bridgewater Essayists. "An
Essay on the Hand, its mechanism and its vital endowments as
evincing design," is the title of the admirable volume which Sir
Charles Bell, in accordance with the provisions of the appointment,
contributed to those celebrated essays.
    Sir Charles Bell, in conjunction with Lord Chancellor Brougham,

                                    404
 also published   " Illustrations of Dr. Paley's Evidences of Natural
  Theology."
     In 1836, he accepted the Chair of Surgery in the University of
 Edinburgh, to which he was invited by the unsolicited and unani
 mous vote of the patrons of that institution ; and he left London to
 place himself at the head of the profession in his native city.      In
 this new sphere of usefulness he continued to pursue with undimi
 nished ardour the cultivation of surgery and physiology until his
 death, which took place on the 29th of April, 1842, at Hallow Park,
 in Worcestershire.
     With this brief sketch of the professional career of Sir Charles
        I
 Bell, proceed to notice those original and important investigations
 into the nature and functions of the nervous system, upon which
 his high reputation as a physiologist is based, which entitle him to
 be ranked among the most distinguished Fellows of this Society, and
 for which he was deservedly awarded the first Royal Medal we had
 to bestow.
     The earliest contribution of Sir Charles Bell to our Transactions
 was in 1821, "On the Nerves, giving an account of some experi
 ments on their structure and functions, which lead to a new ar
 rangement of the system."       This was followed by other essays on
 the same subject, which were severally published in the Philoso
 phical Transactions for 1822, 1823, 1826, 1829, 1832, 1834, 1835,
 and 1840.
     In the last communication, entitled " On the Nervous System,"
 the author gives a condensed view of his investigations and disco
 veries, the result of more than thirty years of indefatigable labour
 and research.
     As long since as 1806, in the first edition of his beautiful work
 " On the Anatomy of Expression in Painting," we perceive the
 germ of those original views of the nervous system, which it was
 the labour of his life to elucidate and establish. " If," he observes,
 " we had but a perfect knowledge of the functions of the nerves,
 they would on all occasions inform us of the cause of those actions
 which now appear to us so inexplicable."      And here I may observe,
that the drawings which illustrate this work are in the first style of
art, and show, that had the author chosen painting as a profession,
 he would have attained a distinguished rank as an artist.
    In 1811, in a small work entitled " An Idea of a new Anatomy of
the Brain, submitted for the observation of his friends, by Charles
BelLF.R.S.E," he distinctly enunciates those original opinions, which,
modified and extended by subsequent investigations and discoveries,
have led to those enlarged and philosophical views of the pheno
mena of the nervous system, which have so largely contributed to
the advancement of physiological science.
    In short, whatever we may owe to the genius and labours of other
men in this field of research, the discovery of the grand fundamental
principle upon which a correct knowledge of the functions of the
nervous system depends, is unquestionably due to Sir Charles Bell.

                                      405
 He was the first to ascertain, not by accident, but by careful and
 laborious dissections and experiments, and by a cautious induction
 from the phenomena which his talents and unwearying industry en
 abled him to develope, that " the nerves which we trace in the body
 are not single nerves possessing different powers, but are bundles
  of different nerves whose filaments are enclosed in one common
 sheath, but which are as distinct in function as they are in origin ;
 that they depend for their specific attributes on the nervous masses
 to which they are severally attached ; that the spinal nerves arising
 from the lateral and anterior columns of the medulla spinalis convey
 the power of motion, while the nerves arising from the posterior
 strands communicate the faculty of sensation to the several parts of
 the body to which they are distributed."         The nerves which arise
 from the middle and upper columns of the spinal marrow, Sir
 Charles conceived to be designed for the act of respiration ; and
 these he termed the "system of respiratory nerves."
     Having thus established the principle by anatomy and experi
 ment, that the nerves possess distinct functions in correspondence
 with their origin from different parts of the brain and spinal mar
 row, Sir Charles Bell followed up his inquiries by collecting such
 pathological facts as served to illustrate and confirm the opinions
 he had advanced ; and our Transactions are enriched by numerous
 memoirs relating to this most important subject. His essays on the
nerves of the face in health and disease are of the deepest interest,
and their practical value cannot be too highly estimated.            In fact,
the great advancement which has been made of late years in our
knowledge of the nature and treatment of the diseases of the nervous
system, is mainly attributable to the labours and discoveries of Sir
Charles Bell*.

    Mr. James Ivory was the son of Mr. James Ivory, watchmaker
in Dundee, and was born in that town in the year 1765.              He re
ceived his elementary education at the public schools of Dundee,
and in the year 1779, was sent to the University of St. Andrews,
where, in the period of four years, he went through a course of
Languages, Science and Philosophy, entitling him to the Degree of
Master of Arts, which was afterwards conferred on him. While at
this University he was distinguished for his attainments in Mathe
matics, to the study of which branch of science he had, even at this
early period of his life, particularly applied himself, under the able
instruction of the Rev. John West, at that time assistant to the Pro
fessor in the University.       It reflects equal credit upon the pupil
and the instructor, that for this gentleman Mr. Ivory ever after en
tertained the highest regard.
     Being intended for the Church of Scotland, he now commenced
his studies in theology, and in the prosecution of them remained
two years at St. Andrews, after the completion of his course of Phi
losophy.     He then removed to the University of Edinburgh ; and it
 is not a little remarkable that he should have done so with Leslie,
 who had been his fellow-student at St. Andrews.          At Edinburgh, he
 received his third year's theological instruction, necessary, by the
 regulations of the Scottish church, to qualify him for admission as
 a clergyman. His studies in divinity were not, however, prosecuted
 farther ; for immediately on leaving the University of Edinburgh,
 he was, in 1786, appointed assistant-teacher          in an academy then
 instituted in his native town of Dundee, for the purpose of instruc
 tion in mathematics and natural philosophy.          Having remained in
 this situation three years, he entered upon a totally different career,
  becoming a partner in, and the manager of a Flax-spinning Com
 pany, which had its mills at Douglastown in Forfarshire, and which
 assumed the name of James Ivory and Company.
     Though now engaged in commercial and manufacturing pursuits,
  Mr. Ivory still devoted every moment of leisure to his favourite ob
 ject, the prosecution of mathematical investigations. Living in a
  secluded part of the country, he was debarred from the advantages
  of access to libraries and the society of men of science, which a
  more favoured locality might have afforded him ; but this obstacle
  to the enlargement of his knowledge was overcome by the force of
  his genius and his powers of application. With a sound knowledge
  of the geometry of the ancient and of the modern mathematics of
  his own country, he had already possessed himself of the methods
  and discoveries of the continental mathematicians, at that time almost
  wholly unknown in Britain ; and he early led the way in that path
  which he afterwards followed with unrivalled success.

                                   407
    His earliest memoir, read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
on the 7th of November 1796, and published in its Transactions,
shows, not only that at this time he was well acquainted with the
works, and possessed the methods of the most celebrated of the
continental writers, but that he could advance independently in the
track which they had discovered and so successfully pursued. This
memoir, entitled " A New Series for the Rectification of the Ellipse,
together with some Observations on the Evolution of the Formula
(a- + 62 — 2 a b cos <p)n," besides displaying considerable analytical
skill in the accomplishment of its immediate object, shows that the
solution of the highest class of physical problems had already en
gaged the author's attention.
    Two other memoirs, communicated by Mr. Ivory to the same So
ciety, one in 1799, " A New Method of resolving Cubic Equa
tions," and the other in 1802,    "A   New and Universal Solution of
Kepler's Problem," both indicate great originality of thought and
powers of investigation.    The approximation which he gives in the
latter memoir for the determination of the excentric anomaly is re
markable for its simplicity, universality, and accuracy.
    At this period, Mr. Ivory was in correspondence with Professor
Playfair, Mr. Leslie (afterwards Sir John Leslie), Mr. Wallace and
 Mr. Brougham (now Lord Brougham), and with these eminent
persons his intercourse was ever after continued until interrupted
by the death of one of the parties. To the well-founded recom
 mendation of Lord Brougham he was indebted for the grant of a
 pension of £300 per annum, in 1831, by King William IV.
     Released from the anxieties of mercantile speculations by the
 dissolution of the company of which he had been the manager, he,
 in 1804, applied for, and immediately obtained, one of the Mathe
 matical Professorships in the Royal Military College at Marlow
 (afterwards removed to Sandhurst).       During the time that he was
 connected with this institution, he acquired the esteem and regard
 of the authorities of the College, of his colleagues, and of his pupils.
 In the discharge of his public duty he appears to have been alto
 gether exemplary ; and he was universally considered to be one of
 the best and most successful instructors that had ever been con
 nected with the College.
     He now became better known in the scientific world, and while
 he discharged the important duties of his Professorship to the ad
 vantage of the College and the advancement of its character, he com
 municated to the public many important memoirs on various scien
 tific subjects, which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions, in
  Leybourn's Mathematical Repository, Maseres's Scriptores Logarith-
  mici, and the Supplement to the sixth edition of the Encyclopaedia
  Britannica.
     About the year 1816, his health began to give way under the
  confinement consequent upon close application to his professorial
  duties, and devoted attachment to scientific inquiry ; and he was
  compelled by bad health to resign his Professorship.      The estima
 tion in which he was held by the authorities of the College cannot

                                   408
be more conclusively shown than by the fact, that, when disabled by
ill health from performing his arduous duties, the Governor and
the Commissioners of the College recommended and procured the
  retiring pension to be given to him, some years before he had com
  pleted the period of service which the regulations of the War Office
  at that time required.     He now took up his residence in London,
  and in this metropolis or its environs he spent the remainder of his
  days, living always in great retirement.
     Disengaged from professional duties, though still suffering in
  health, he now devoted his whole time and all the energies of his
  powerful mind to the investigation and elucidation of various ma
  thematical problems of the highest order; and the result of his in
  quiries were given to the world in numerous elaborate memoirs,
  many of the most important of which, it is gratifying to reflect,
  adorn the volumes of our Transactions.       It is no less gratifying to
  feel that this Society was at the time fully alive to the value of these
  communications, by awarding to their author, on successive occa
  sions, the highest honours in its power to bestow.        In 1814, Mr.
  Ivory received the Copley Medal " for his various Mathematical
  communications printed in the Philosophical Transactions."
     In 1826, one of the Royal Medals was awarded to him "for his
  Paper on Astronomical Refractions, published in the Philosophical
  Transactions for the year 1823, and his other valuable papers on
  Mathematical subjects." And again in 1839, he received one of the
  Royal Medals " for his Paper on the Theory of Astronomical Re
 fractions, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1838,"
 which paper was the Bakerian Lecture for the year.
     If Mr. Ivory's rank among the mathematicians of his age could
 be assigned independently of his communications to the Royal So
  ciety, he must still occupy a distinguished place, not only among
 those of his own country, but of Europe.       It was, however, by the
 communications with which he has enriched our Transactions, that
 he gained the great scientific reputation which he enjoyed, and it is
 with them also that we are more immediately concerned.
     These papers may be classed under eight different heads ; for
 although several of them are closely related in regard to their phy
 sical objects, yet the nature of the mathematics employed in them
 is so different, that we should do injustice to his reputation if we
 arranged them under one head.
     The first of these is the investigation of the attraction of homo
geneous ellipsoids of the second order upon points situated within
or without them, printed in the Transactions for 1809.        This paper
contained the celebrated theorem by which the attraction of an
ellipsoid on a point exterior to   it,   ismade to depend upon the at
traction of another ellipsoid upon another point interior to     it;   the
latter investigation being, as    is   well known, comparatively easy.
The solution of the more difficult case had been reduced to a form
nearly equivalent to this by Laplace, but his process was trouble
some ;    that by Mr. Ivory is    remarkably simple and elegant. Al
though this transformation constitutes the most valuable part of the

                                     409
paper,  it would be wrong to omit to state that the developments
which it contains, on the investigation of the attraction in the
simpler case, are highly ingenious, and exhibit a perfect command
of analysis.
   The second subject is the criticism upon the method used by La
place in the third book of the ' Mecanique Celeste,' for the compu
tation of the attraction of spheroids of any form differing little from
spheres, and the substitution of a method purely analytical for some
of Laplace's operations which are founded on a geometrical consi
deration. The papers which contain Mr. Ivory's remarks on these
subjects are two papers and an appendix in the volume for 1812,
and one in that for 1822.       The remarks on Laplace's theory ad
verted to two points. One of these was the faultiness of his reason
ing as relates to the evanescence of the attraction of the particles
included between the spheroidal and a spherical surface when the
attracted particle was brought very near to the surface. The other
was a limitation of the generality of Laplace's assumption        for the
form of the function expressing the distance between the sphere and
the spheroid, to a rational function of the coordinates of each point.
With regard to the first of these subjects, it seems impossible to deny
that Laplace had, in the greater part of his investigation, left the
interpretation of his suppositions in some obscurity ; and Mr. Ivory
has, with remarkable acuteness and analytical skill, exposed the de
fects of Laplace's investigation on his interpretation of the suppo
sitions. Yet we must observe that the limitation expressed by La
place ("supposons de plus que la sphere touche le spheroide, &c")
appears to be entirely overlooked by Mr. Ivory, and that this limi
tation, when its effects are fairly examined, completely removes the
objection.     As to the second subject, it   is, we believe, allowed by
Mr. Ivory himself, that there no failure in the investigation
                                is                                if  the
function for the distance between the sphere and the spheroid, though
not explicitly rational, admits of being expanded in      a   converging
series whose terms are rational the only case undoubtedly that can
                                 ;
ever occur in physical application.        The analytical process which
Mr. Ivory substituted for a part of Laplace's        extremely beautiful.
                                                    is
    To show the estimation in which Mr. Ivory's talents and labours
were held by Laplace himself, we may here quote a remark from
 Sir Humphry Davy's Address in 1826, on the award of the Royal
Medal to Mr. Ivory. "    I     cannot pretend," says our, then, distin
guished    President, " to give any idea of the mathematical resources
displayed    in the  problems, and which even the most accomplished
geometer     could  not render intelligible by words alone ;   but
                                                                I     can
speak of the testimony given by M. de Laplace himself in their fa
 vour. That illustrious person, in    a   conversation which
                                                           I     had with
him some time ago on Mr. Ivory's first four communications, spoke
 in the highest terms of the manner in which he had treated his sub
ject; one, he said, of the greatest delicacy and difficulty, requiring
 no ordinary share of profound mathematical knowledge, and no
 common degree of industry and sagacity in the application of it."
    The investigations to which we have just alluded are those upon

                                     410
which Mr. Ivory's European reputation as a consummate mathema
tician was principally founded ; and deservedly so. It is no small
praise, even at the present time, to assert of any mathematician, that
he thoroughly understands the remarkable investigations of Laplace
applying to the attractions of spheroids ; and it would be still greater
to assert that he is able to substitute a new, clear, and elegant pro
cess, in place of one portion which seems doubtful and indirect.       But
at the time when these papers were written (1808 and 1811) the
merit was vastly greater than it would be now. Very few English
mathematicians could then read with ease an investigation written
 in the notation of the differential calculus ; scarcely any could un
derstand a process of partial differentials ; and probably not another
person in the kingdom besides Mr. Ivory had read that part of the
 Mecanique Celeste. In acknowledging that Mr. Ivory most justly
 earned the reputation which he acquired (and our remarks above,
detracting from the necessity of his criticism, do not in the least
 detract from its singular skill and command of mathematics), we
must not omit also to acknowledge, that to his example we owe, in
no inconsiderable degree, that direction of mathematical study which
 has enabled England, at last, to compete in the field of mathematical
science with the other nations of Europe, to which she was during
a long interval inferior.
    The third subject is the investigation of the orbits of comets.
Mr. Ivory's method, printed in the Transactions for 1814, is founded
on the supposition that the orbit is a parabola, and it tests the trial-
assumption of the distance of the comet by the well-known expres
sion for the time depending on two radii vectores and the chord
joining them. Although the analysis is elegant, there is not much
 of originality in this process.                                           \
    The fourth subject is the investigation of atmospheric refraction.
 The papers relating to this are contained in the volumes for 1823
 and 1838.     The former of these proceeds solely on the supposition
 that the temperature of the air (as entering into the factor which
 connects the density with the elasticity) decreases uniformly for
 uniform increase of elevation. The investigation is not remarkably
 different from those of other writers on the theory of astronomical
 refractions.   The latter contains the effects of adding to the ex
 pression for the density of the air resulting from the first supposition,
 a series of terms following a peculiar law which make the expression
perfectly general for all laws of temperature, and which at the same
 time offer great facilities for mathematical treatment.        The whole
 investigation  deserves  particular   notice as a beautiful   instance of
 mathematical skill.     Considerable labour was also bestowed by Mr.
Ivory, in these papers, on the ascertaining, from the best accredited
experiments, of the values of the constants which enter into different
 parts of the formulas.
    A fifth subject was treated by Mr. Ivory in elaborate papers in
our Transactions for 1824, 1831, 1834, and in a portion of a paper
 in the Transactions for 1839.      The object, in these papers, was to
 show that the method in which the equilibrium of fluid bodies has

                                    411
been treated by mathematicians is defective, one additional equation
being, in Mr. Ivory's views, logically necessary, although he allows
that its introduction produces no change of results in the case which
he has investigated at great length, namely, that of a homogeneous
fluid.    The Royal Society have conceived that the acknowledged
uncommon abilities of Mr. Ivory, and the great attention which he
had given to this particular subject, made it almost imperative on
them to afford every facility which their Transactions could give to
the elucidation of his views, more especially as the logical foundation
of the theory had scarcely been canvassed to the same extent as that
of many other physico-mathematical theories.         At the same time
they think it necessary, in adverting to this particular theory, to re
mark, that no other mathematician has agreed with Mr. Ivory in the
necessity   of his new equation.
    While Mr. Ivory still had the subject of   the equilibrium of fluids
in his consideration, the very remarkable discovery was announced,
by MM. Jacobi and Liousville, that it is theoretically possible that
a homogeneous ellipsoid with three unequal axes, revolving about
 one of these axes, may be in equilibrium.     In a paper in the Trans
 actions for 1838, Mr. Ivory has with great elegance demonstrated
 this theorem, and has given, with greater detail than its authors had
 entered on, several statements regarding the limitations of the pro
 portions of the axes.    This may be regarded as the sixth subject.
     A seventh subject, the Theory of Perturbations, was treated in
 papers in the Transactions for 1832 and 1833.        The first of these
 is a treatment of the theory of the variation of the elements, giving
 no new result, but simplified, in the author's opinion, by the intro
 duction of the area described upon the planet's moving orbit.      The
 second relates merely to the expansion of the perturbing function,
 in which, by departing in some degree from the usual process, Mr.
 Ivory conceived that he had given greater facilities for the develop
 ments to the higher order of excentricities and inclinations.
     An eighth subject, which we have reserved for the last, as con
 taining nothing of a physical character, is the Theory of Elliptic
  Transcendents, treated in the Transactions for 1831.       We are not
  aware that anything important is added to the theory in this paper,
  although a new form is given to some of the demonstrations.
     The great scientific reputation which Mr. Ivory had established
  by these and other memoirs not communicated to the Royal Society
  ensured his election into this Society in 1815, and into many of the
  other Scientific Societies of this country and of the Continent.    He
  was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,           an
  Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy, and of the Cam
  bridge Philosophical Society; Corresponding Member of the Royal
  Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France, of the Royal Aca
  demy of Sciences of Berlin, and of the Royal Society of Gottingen.
     In 1831, the Hanoverian Guelphie Order of Knighthood was con
  ferred on him by King William IV., and it was intimated that he
  might also receive the British Knighthood, but this he declined, as
  the title would have been inconsistent with his circumstances.      He

                                      412
had, however, as has already been stated, a pension of £300 per
annum subsequently conferred on him by His Majesty.                 In 1839,
the University of St. Andrews conferred on him the Degree of Doc
tor of Laws.
    Although his health had been early impaired by his close appli
cation to scientific investigation, he never allowed himself to be un
occupied, but was constantly engaged in his researches to the period
of his last illness.      In the end of last year his health became seri
ously impaired, and after an illness of several months, but retaining
his faculties to the last, he died on the 21st of September of the
present year, aged 77.        He was never married*.
    Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq.,             was born at Bath on the 2nd
of February,    1761.      He was the son of Edmund Lambert, Esq., of
Boyton House, near Heytesbury, and inherited the name of Bourke
from his mother, who was the daughter of Viscount Mayo.                   He

died at Kew on the 10th of January of the present year, having
nearly completed his 81st year.         His name appears among the
original members of the Linnean Society, and for nearly fifty years
he was one of its Vice-Presidents.        He became a Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1791, and consequently had belonged to it for
more than half a century. He was an eminent botanist, and formed
a very extensive herbarium, and was at all times anxious to give in
formation to those attached to the same pursuit.     He was the author
of many papers in the Linnean Transactions, but his most consider
able works were two separate publications. One on the genus Cin
chona was given to the world in 1 797. The other was a description
of the genus Pinus, — a truly magnificent work, which originally came
before the public in two vols, folio in the year 1803, to which a
third vol. was added in 1834.
    He married Catherine, daughter of Richard Bowater, Esq., whom
he survived some years, and by whom he left no family.          He did
not furnish any papers to the Transactions of the Royal Society.
    Sir Alexander Burnes          is undoubtedly one of those whose
death   will  be most lamented by a country that was proud of his
eminent qualities, and grateful for his zealous services.
    The name of Burnes was already distinguished in the northern
portion of our island. It has received a new lustre from one well
worthy of his descent from the same family as Scotland's celebrated
poet.    Sir Alexander was born at Montrose on the 16th of May,
1805. The same town had the honour of his education.            He en
tered on his career of active service as a cadet of the Bombay army
in the year 1821.       At the early age of twenty he was appointed
Persian interpreter to a force of 8000 men assembled under Colonel
Napier for the invasion of Sinde.       The following year he was ap
pointed Deputy-Assistant-Quarter-Master-General.
    He received, in 1827, the thanks of Government for an elaborate
statistical report ; and the following year, the Government showed
itself equally satisfied with a valuable memoir of the eastern mouth
of the Indus. This was succeeded by a valuable supplement.
    In 1828, Lieut. Burnes applied for permission to visit the country
between the Indus and Marwar ; but though this plan was approved
of by Sir John Malcolm and Sir Henry Pottinger, its execution was
delayed.     Burnes was appointed the same year Assistant-Quarter-
Master-General, and received orders from the Court of Directors
to complete a map of Cutch already commenced by him.            Shortly
 after, he was appointed assistant to the political agent in Cutch, and
published in the Transactions of the Royal Geographical Society an
account of his survey of that country.
    In 1830, he was sent with a present of horses from the King of
 England to Runjeet Singh.         He visited Hydrabad, Lahore, Soo-
 diana, and proceeded to Simla to receive further instructions from
 Lord W. Bentinck.
     After travelling into Central Asia, he revisited Bombay in 1833 ;
 thence he received orders to return home with his own despatches,

and was received most cordially in England.       His travels were now
published,  and met  a most  hearty  welcome.   They  were immediately
translated into the French and German languages, the best proof of
their merit and importance being appreciated in other countries be
sides his own.     He was warmly welcomed by the Royal Asiatic
Society ; and the French and English Geographical Societies be
stowed on him their respective medals.
    He enriched the national collection of the British Museum by
presenting it with a collection of oriental coins.
    After staying a year and a half in Europe, he returned to the East,
and on his second arrival in India, he was sent on a mission to
Hydrabad, which was entirely successful. The next, and unfortu
nately the last public duty in which he was employed was in a
mission to Cabul, where those political events occurred which oc
casioned his falling a victim in his country's service at the early
age of 36.
    Such is a brief statement of the very active life of a man endowed
by nature with an extraordinary variety of powers. Personally
active and enterprising, he united to the qualities of the accom
plished soldier and statesman those of the philologist and philoso
pher.    What might we not have hoped from such a man, if Provi
dence had seen right to prolong his days !
    Sir Alexander was of a lively and playful disposition, and most
amiable in private life.    He was one of the best of sons and kindest
of brothers.
    George Fitzclarence, Earl of Munster, was born January
29, 1794..    He entered the army at an early age, and served in the
Peninsular war. He afterwards went to India, where he assiduously
and successfully studied the Sanscrit, Arabic, and Persian languages.
In  1818 he was entrusted with despatches announcing the conclusion
of   the Mahratta war ; he seized the opportunity of acquiring and
imparting additional knowledge, and travelled home by an overland
route, publishing an account of his journey.       He was created Earl
of Munster soon after the accession of his late Majesty, William the
Fourth.
    Shortly after his return from India, he was elected a Vice-Presi
 dent of the Asiatic Society, and by his personal exertions procured
 much valuable information on oriental geography and statistics, and
 on the natural productions of India.     He subsequently took a very
 active part in promoting the Oriental Translation Fund, and also the
 Society for the publication of Oriental Texts, and the Association
formed for the purpose of increasing our knowledge of the countries
 south of Egypt. For the last fourteen years, he devoted great la
bour to the collection of materials for the compilation of a military
 history, and history of the civilization of the Mahommedan nations.
 Of this elaborate and important work, which was nearly completed,
 a long and interesting account is given in the Asiatic Journal.     It
is to be hoped that the friends of Lord Munster will not allow these
 labours to have been performed in vain.

   It is needless for me to add what a severe loss his lordship's death
 must be to those who are interested in oriental pursuits, and indeed
to his country itself, when we reflect on the large empire held by
 England in the eastern regions of the globe.
   Lord Munster married Miss Wyndham in 1819, and has left a
family to lament his death.    He was elected President of the Asiatic
 Society only  a short time  before  his decease.
   Richard Hussey, Lord Vivian, was educated at Harrow, and
entered the army as an ensign in the year 1793.         In 1803, he be
came a major; Lieutenant-Colonel         in 1804; and Colonel in 1812.
He was promoted to the rank of Major-General in 1814, and Lieu-
tenant-General in 1830.      His first active service was under his late
Royal Highness the Duke of York in Flanders. Under Sir John
Moore, he commanded the 7th Hussars in 1808 and 1809, and a
brigade of cavalry from September 1813 to the termination of the
Peninsular war. He was present at the battles of Orthes, Nivelle,
and Toulouse ; and near the latter place was severely wounded. He
also partook of the glory of Waterloo.
   Lord Vivian represented his native town of Truro in 1820 ; sub
sequently, the borough of Windsor ; and lastly, the eastern division
of Cornwall in Parliament. He was Commander-in-Chief in Ireland
from the year 1831 to 1835, when he filled the office of Master-
General of the Ordnance under Lord Melbourne.            He received a
peerage in 1841, and retired from office at the same time as the
ministry which he had supported.
   Lord Vivian was Colonel of the 1st Guards at the time of his
death.    He was universally beloved by those who knew him in pri
vate life.   As an officer, he was accessible to all, and indefatigable
in his exertions in the public service, and few have been held in
greater esteem by those under their command.
   In the performance of his official duties as Master-General of the
Ordnance, he evinced a due sense of the importance of science to
the national welfare.      He zealously forwarded the views of the
Royal Society, and of the British Association, for the promotion
of Magnetical Science, by the establishment of magnetical ob
servatories.    He highly approved of the employment, to a li
mited extent, and in time of peace, of the officers and soldiers of
the Ordnance department in national scientific undertakings, and
gave much consideration to the means by which the objects of
the joint application of the above-named Societies might be ob
tained.
   He was also the advocate for the Museum of Economic Geology,
and an earnest promoter of the Trigonometrical Survey of the British
empire.
   John Yelloly, M.D., was born in 1773, at Alnwick in Nor
thumberland, and received his early education at a school in that
town. He chose medicine as his profession ; and at the age of 20,
went to Edinburgh, and after going through the usual course of

                                      416
 study in its University, graduated there in 1796.          Four years after
 wards, he settled in London, and became a Licentiate of the College
 of Physicians. In 1806, he married Miss Tyssen, heiress to a con
 siderable landed estate ; and established himself in Finsbury Square.
 About this time, also, he was elected Physician to the Aldersgate-
 street Dispensary ; and, in 1817, succeeded Dr. Cooke as Physician
 to the London Hospital.         He became a Fellow of this Society in
 1814.
     Endowed by nature with great activity of mind, Dr. Yelloly ap
 plied himself with indefatigable industry to the acquisition and the
 extension of medical knowledge. His views were not confined to the
 narrow circle of his own individual advancement, but, embracing a
 wider range of utility, they extended not only to the improvement,
 but also to the general diffusion of science, and to whatever was cal
 culated to raise the character and exalt the dignity of the profession
 to which he belonged.           This liberal public spirit, indeed, was,
 throughout life, the main spring of his exertions ; and one of its prin
 cipal fruits was the formation, in conjunction with his friend Dr.
 Marcet, of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London.                    The
 objects contemplated by such an institution were to establish a closer
 bond of union than had previously existed among the several branches
 of the medical profession ; to collect a comprehensive medical library
 for their use ; to read and discuss medical papers at the evening
 meetings ; to publish a selection of these papers in the form of Trans
 actions ; to promote a free interchange of information, and to culti
 vate liberal and kindly feelings among the members.             Many of the
 most eminent practitioners, both in Medicine and Surgery, were in
vited to join this new Society, which, from small beginnings, soon
 increased in numbers and in reputation, so as in the course of a few
 years to comprise a large portion of the professional rank and talent
 of the metropolis. It was to the active exertions and persevering
 zeal of its two founders that this Society was mainly indebted for its
 early success and its continued prosperity, amidst occasional difficul
 ties with which it had to contend.          Dr. Yelloly, in particular, de
 voted himself to its welfare with the attachment of a parent. At its
 commencement he officiated as Secretary, in conjunction with Mr.
 Charles Aikin ; and for many years he was scarcely ever absent from
its meetings, taking a lively interest in all its
                                                         proceedings, and an
 active part in the discussions of the evening. To its Transactions
he contributed many valuable memoirs*.              At a later period, about
    * These                                      —

the   year 1814,    under the presidency of Sir Henry Halford, Dr.
Yelloly, Dr. Marcet,        and other influential members,       conceiving
that great advantages would result to the Society, and its perma
nence be better secured, by its being incorporated under a Royal
Charter, took the proper measures for accomplishing this object.
The necessary forms were gone through, and the grant was on the
eve of being signed, when an unexpected opposition was suddenly
raised by the College of Physicians, who finally prevailed on the
Privy Council to refuse the prayer of the petitioners. Dr. Yelloly,
however, lived to see the great change which has since taken place
in the spirit of the times ; for, in the year 1834, his favourite scheme
was realised, all opposition had subsided, and the Society obtained
at once from the Crown the Charter under which it is now consti
tuted as the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London.
    Although Dr. Yelloly diligently availed himself of the extensive
opportunities aflbrded by his public appointments, and had acquired
universal respect and esteem by the suavity of his manners and the
kindness of his disposition, it is remarkable that he nevertheless failed
to obtain more than a very moderate share of private practice.             In
course of time his family had become very numerous, while his pro
fessional income was by no means increasing in an equal ratio ; and
prudential motives prevailing over his attachment to the metropolis,
he at length determined to quit London, and establish himself at
Carrow Abbey, in the immediate vicinity of Norwich.              He resided
there during many years, engaged in practice : he was soon elected
one of the Physicians of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and in
troduced into that establishment many useful reforms. It was du
ring this period that he undertook the examination of the urinary
calculi, of which the Hospital contained a large collection.       He com
municated to the Royal Society the result of his labours in a paper
which was published in the volume of our Transactions for 1829*.
In this paper he gives an account of the structure and chemical com
position of 330 calculi, which had either been purposely divided or
accidentally broken in their extraction.       The results are arranged in
tables, exhibiting, in the order of their superposition from the centre,
the consecutive deposits of which each calculus is composed.           It ap
pears from these tables, that not less than two-thirds of all urinary
calculi consist of the lithates, or have those substances for their nu
clei : whence Dr. Yelloly inferred the probability that a large pro
portion of them owe their existence to the previous formation of such
a nucleus, and was led to suspect that carbonate of lime, although

rarely found in a separate form in calculi, is not an unfrequent con
comitant of phosphate of lime. With the assistance of Dr. Prout
and Mr. Faraday, he ascertained the presence of carbonate of lime in
some of the specimens which were not previously supposed to contain
it ; a result which was confirmed by the analysis of several calculi
from the collection of the Hunterian Museum, and also from the
Museum of Guy's Hospital.
    He presented to the Society, two years afterwards, a sequel to this
paper, recording, in a tabular form, the analysis of 335 additional
specimens, which had, in the interval, been divided*.       The most re
 markable fact noticed in this memoir, is the presence of silex in a
 few specimens.      Dr. Yelloly finds reason to believe that the ave
rage number of calculous disorders occurring in Scotland has been
 much underrated ; that, on the other hand, the proneness to these com
 plaints is very small in Ireland ; and that, on the whole, a much larger
proportion of calculous cases occurs in towns than in the country.
    For some years before his death, Dr. Yelloly had relinquished
 practice, and resided at Woodton Hall, near Bungay ; his attention
 being chiefly turned to agricultural pursuits. From thence he re
 moved, about two years ago, to Cavendish Hall, in the neighbour
 hood of Clare, in Suffolk ; where, in February last, his valuable life
 was suddenly terminated by an attack of apoplexy, while taking an
 airing in his carriage.
    The  Earl of Macclesfield was born on the 24th of February,
 1755.   He married, 25th of May 1780, Mary Frances, daughter and co
 heir of the Rev. Thomas Drake, and died last March at the advanced
 age of eighty-seven.     He was Lord Lieutenant of the county of Ox
 ford. In former times he used often to attend the meetings of the
 Royal Society ; to which, indeed, it was natural that he should feel
 something of an hereditary regard, descended as he was from one of
 our former Presidents.
    Among those Fellows whose loss by death this Society has to de
plore since my last annual address, Mr. Gage Rokewode should
 not be forgotten.
    This gentleman, long so well known for the admirable manner in
which he discharged the duties of Director of the Society of Anti
 quaries, was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Gage of Hengrave, in
 Suffolk, the sixth Baronet of that ancient family.
    If this were a fit place from which to pronounce an eulogium on
private worth of the highest order, the memory of no one could de
serve it better, and to his friends (and no one had more) the loss is
irreparable.     But to the public also the loss is most considerable,
and to this more particularly it is my duty to refer.
    At an early period of his life he evinced an attachment to the
study of those antiquities for the knowledge of which he afterwards
became so eminent.       I need but refer to the pages of the ' Archaeo-
                      * Phil. Trans, for 1831, p. 415.

logia' and ' Vetusta Monumenta' for proofs of his varied learning, his
indefatigable zeal and industry, and his careful accuracy on every
 one of the many subjects which he touched.        His last and perhaps
 one of his most valuable communications to the Society of Antiqua
 ries, of which he was one of the brightest ornaments (I allude to
his paper on the Painted Chamber at Westminster), was completed
just before his death.   I must not omit to refer also to those beautiful
 works, in which he so carefully and ably illustrated the history of
 the ancient and curious seat of his own family, Hengrave Hall, and
 that portion of Suffolk in which it is situated. Throughout all these
 varied and laborious pursuits, he displayed not only all the qualifica
 tions of a most able and careful antiquary, but also a disposition the
 most kind-hearted, and a tone of mind the most courteous towards
 the opinions and feelings of others, as well when differing from them
 in opinion, as when compelled to notice their errors in the same path
 of antiquarian learning.
     Much as he had done, how much more might not yet have been
 expected from the labours of one so gifted, had not his life been sud
 denly and unexpectedly brought to a close !
   Lieutenant       Wellstead, of the Indian Navy, was a distin
 guished  traveller in the East. He was the author of a notice on the
 ruins of Berenice, of a journey into the interior of Oman, and of a
journey to the ruins of Nahab el Hajar, published in the Transac
 tions of the Royal Geographical Society.    He died in the month of
 October last.    He received a severe injury on the head while in
 India, which was the remote cause of his early and lamented death.
   Mr. Hennell, the chemical operator at Apothecaries' Hall, lost
his life by an extraordinary accident ; he was mixing a large quan
tity of fulminating mercury for the service of the army in India, and
being desirous that it should be of an uniform colour, the whole was
placed in a large evaporating dish ; as he was stirring   it,
                                                           an explosion
of the whole took place, which was attended with his complete de
struction, many parts of the body being thrown to     a considerable di
stance.    He was an eminent chemist, and had furnished two papers
to our Transactions.

have not the pleasure of seeing here today Mr. MacCullagh,            I
shall beg Mr. Wheatstone, as his friend, to transmit his Medal to
that gentleman.
        Mr. Wheatstone.
   It     me great satisfaction to be the organ of the Council of
        gives
the Royal Society in bestowing on your friend Mr. MacCullagh the
Copley Medal.    It needless for me to dilate on the profound ma
                     is
thematical skill and exemplary diligence with which he has explained

                                      420
the laws   of the undulatory theory of light. Philosophers more able
than myself to appreciate their merits, have given their testimony to
the great value of his discoveries, and to the elegant means that he
has employed.        It is the sincere wish of us all, that these labours
may be followed by others as important to science and as honourable
to the University of Dublin ; an University that numbers Mr. Mac-
Cullagh among the most eminent of her sons.
     The Council have awarded the Copley Medal for the present year
to Professor MacCuIlagh, for his researches connected with the wave-
theory of light, contained in the Transactions of the Royal Irish
Academy.         The grounds on which they have made this award are
the following.       One of the most important steps made in the physi
 cal theory of light, since it was first promulgated by Huygens, is,
 undoubtedly, Fresnel's discovery of the laws of refraction by cry
stallized media, embodied in his ' Memoire sur la double refraction.'
 The object proposed by Professor MacCuIlagh, in his first paper *,
was to simplify and to develope that theory.          He has shown in this
paper,   that  the  elastic force of the luminiferous  aether may be repre
sented, in magnitude and direction, by means of an ellipsoid, whose
 semiaxes are the three principal refractive indices of the medium ;
 and he has thence deduced, in a geometrical form, the leading results
 of Fresnel's theory. This ellipsoid is closely related to the genera
 ting ellipsoid of Fresnel ; and by the aid of these relations, Professor
 MacCuIlagh has demonstrated, in a very simple manner, the truth of
 Fresnel's construction of the wave-surface, the demonstration of
 which had been left imperfect by its author.
    In Mr. MacCullagh's next paper, entitled " Geometrical propositions
 applied to the Wave-theory of Lightf," he has examined the proper
 ties of a surface, which he calls the surface of indices, and which had
 presented itself likewise in the researches of M. Cauchy and Sir
 William Hamilton ; and he has shown that it affords a general and
 exact construction for the interval of retardation of the two rays in
 their passage through a double-refracting crystal ; and thus that the
 forms of the rings, or isochromatic curves, which had previously been
 deduced only by approximate methods, may be determined generally.
     The next paper of Professor MacCuIlagh is that " On the Double
 Refraction of Quartz J ;" a subject which had engaged the attention,
 successively, of Biot, Fresnel, and Airy.        The first of these writers
 had determined experimentally the laws of rotatory polarization,
 which take place when a ray is transmitted along the axis of rock-
 crystal ; and the second had shown that these laws were explained
 by the interference of two circularly polarized rays, which are trans
 mitted along the axis with different velocities. The next step in this
 curious subject was made by Mr. Airy, who examined the peculiar
 phenomena of refraction by quartz in other directions, and showed
 that they were accounted for by the supposition of two elliptically
'polarized rays, the ratio of the axes of these elliptical vibrations va-

rying with the inclination of the rays to the axis of the crystal.
Lastly, Professor MacCullagh has shown that both the circular po
larization of the rays in the axis, and the elliptical polarization of the
rays inclined to    it,may be explained by          certain assumed form of
                                                    a
the differential equations of vibratory movement, which not only
links together the two classes of phenomena, but also affords a ma
thematical expression for their laws. The general theory, to be al
luded to presently, has enabled him to explain the origin of these as
sumed forms of the differential equations.
    The theory of reflexion at the surfaces of uncrystallized media
had been given by Fresnel, although apparently on erroneous prin
ciples. The more complex case of reflexion at the surfaces of cry
stals was left by him to his successors       ;and the discovery was made
independently, and nearly at the same time, by Professor MacCul
lagh* and M. Newmann of Konigsberg.                    The discovery   is not
only important     in itself,  as bringing  within  the domain of the wave-
theory  a    large class of hitherto unexplained phenomena, but per
haps   still more on account of the physical principles upon which           it
is based, and the constitution of the luminiferous aether which        itren
ders probable.      Thus,     it   assumed in this theory, in opposition to
                                   is
the hypothesis of Fresnel, that the vibrations are parallel to the plane
of  polarization, and that the density         ofthe atheris  the same in all
media. These, together with the law of the vis viva, and the beauti
ful principle of the equivalence        ofvibrations (but half perceived by
Fresnel), form the foundation of the theory of crystalline reflexion,
and derive the highest probability from its accordance with pheno
mena.      The results of the theory are embodied in geometrical con
structions of great elegance, which determine generally the plane of
polarization of the reflected ray, and the amplitudes of the reflected
and refracted vibrations.
   Hitherto the laws of reflexion at the separating surface of two me
dia were apparently unconnected with those which govern the pro
pagation of light in the same medium. It remained to connect these
laws as parts of one and the same system, and to trace the hypothe
tical principles upon which each theory was based, up to some higher
mechanical principle.         This crowning point of the theory has been
attained by Professor MacCullagh          f.    Employing the general pro
cesses of analytical mechanics, as laid down by Lagrange          J,  and   li
miting the general theorems solely by the conditions that the density
of the aether  is constant, and that the vibrations are transversal, he

has consequently been led to erroneous results.

 has succeeded    in deducing, as parts of one and the same general
theory,   not  only the laws of propagation in the same medium, pre
 viously   discovered  by Fresnel, but also the laws of reflexion which
take place at the bounding surface of any two media, already disco
vered by himself and M. Newmann.           The same theory has likewise
led to the demonstration of those physical principles, which had been
assumed in the former paper.       It has shown that the vis viva is ne
 cessarily preserved, in the passage of light from one medium into
another ; that the resultants of the vibrations are the same in the two
media ; and finally, that the vibrations themselves are parallel to the
plane ofpolarization.
     This seems to be the most advanced point to which the physical
theory of light, in its present form, is capable of being pushed ; and
it is only by the addition of new physical principles, and further in
sight into the constitution of the luminiferous medium, that any ul
terior progress can be expected.

 title you to the honour of the Rumford Medal at our hands.        Your
papers, indeed, have been so great an ornament to our volumes, that
we can never sufficiently express our thanks to you for them.           I
trust that you will not desert so promising a line of inquiry, and that
our Transactions may receive from you still greater acquisitions of
knowledge in the path which is traced by light itself.
        Mr. Bowman.
     It must be always satisfactory for a President of the Royal Society
to present to one of your profession a Royal Medal for labours which
have as their instruments, the assiduous application of the noblest
faculties of reason — as their immediate purpose, the knowledge of the
sublime truths contained in the wonderful adaptations of the organs of
created beings — and as their ultimate end, the cure of disease, the al
leviation of agony, and the prolongation of human life. Gentlemen of
yourown valuable profession have given their testimony to the import
ance of your discoveries, and the Council feels pleasure in rewarding
your zeal and talents.     To you, and all who, like you, are employed
in these noble pursuits, all here will say with me, may God prosper
your labours to His glory and to the happiness of His creatures.
        Mr. Daniell.
     The continued intercourse that I   have had with you in the Coun
cil of the Royal Society increases      the pleasure which  I experience
in giving into your hands this Medal.        Electrical Chemistry, at all
times of great importance as giving us an insight into the most re
condite laws of nature, has now acquired additional interest by the

                                             423
   practical purposes to which a Wheatstone, a Spencer, a Jacobi, and
   others have applied it.         Its connection with magnetism seems to
   promise    still greater   discoveries    than those that have already immor
   talised a Davy and a Faraday. You have pursued this difficult branch
   of Chemistry with signal success, and the Council have approved of
   the recommendation of the Chemical Committee, that one of the Royal
   Medals should be conferred on you for the valuable papers which
   you have contributed to our Transactions.              I trust that our future
   volumes may be still more enriched by the result of your scientific
   labours.

The   MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                   President, in the Chair.
    The following  papers were read, viz. : —
    1. "Observations on the Blood-corpuscles, particularly with re
ference to opinions expressed and conclusions drawn in papers ' On
the Corpuscles of the Blood,' and ' On Fibre,' recently published
in the Philosophical Transactions."      By T. Wharton Jones, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    The author points out what he considers to be important errors in
the series of papers by Dr. Martin Barry, which have lately appeared
in the Philosophical Transactions, and are entitled, " On the Corpus
cles of the Blood," and " On Fibre." He alleges that Dr. Barry has
generally confounded the colourless corpuscles contained in the blood
with the red corpuscles of the same fluid ; each of which latter kind
consists of a vesicle or cell, with thick walls, but in a collapsed and
flattened state, and having therefore a biconcave form, and in con
sequence of its thick wall being doubled on itself, presenting under
the microscope a broad circumferential ring, which is illuminated
or shaded differently from the depressed central portion, according
to the focal adjustment of the instrument : while the colourless
corpuscles, on the other hand, are of a globular shape, strongly
refractive of light, and granulated on their surface, and are of less
specific gravity and of somewhat larger size than the red corpuscles.
The author quotes various passages from Dr. Barry's papers in proof
of his assertions, and refers particularly to fig. 23 of his second
paper on the corpuscles of the blood. He farther states, that Dr.
Barry's description of the appearances of what he terms the red
corpuscles, in paragraphs 53, 68, and 76 of his second paper, can,
in fact, apply only to the colourless corpuscles : and he observes,
that even when Dr. Barry does, at last, in his " Additional Observa
tions," advert to the distinction between the red and the colourless
globules, he considers the latter as being merely " the discs" con
tained in the red globules appearing under an altered state.
    The author regards as wholly erroneous the notion which Dr.
Barry entertains that a fibre exists in the interior of the blood-cor

                                      432
  puscle   ; and that these fibres, after their escape from thence, consti
  tute the fibres which are formed by the consolidation of the fibrin
  of the liquor sanguinis. The beaded aspect presented by the double
  contour of the thick wall of the red corpuscle when it has been acted
  upon either by mechanical causes or by chemical reagents, of which
  the effect is to corrugate the edge, and to bend it alternately in op
  posite directions, has, in the opinion of the author, given rise to the
  illusive appearance of an internal, annular fibre. The appearance
  of flask-like vesicles presented by some of the red corpuscles, with
  the alleged fibre protruding from their neck, the author ascribes
  altogether to the effects of decomposition, which has altered the
  mechanical properties of the corpuscle, and allowed it to be drawn
  out, like any other viscid matter, into a thread.
      In conclusion, he remarks, that if these statements of Dr. Barry
 should be recognised as fundamental errors in his premises, the
 whole of the reasonings built upon them must fall to the ground.
      2. " Wind Table, from    observations   taken at the summit of the
 Rock of Gibraltar."     By Colonel George J. Harding. Communicated
 by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S., by order of the Lords Commis
 sioners of the Admiralty.
     3. " Spermatozoa observed within the Mammiferous Ovum." By
 Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S. L. and Ed.
     In examining some ova of a rabbit, of twenty-four hours, the
 author observed a number of spermatozoa in their interior.
                             December 15, 1842.
               FRANCIS BAILY,        Esq., V.P., in the Chair.
     His Grace the Duke of Norfolk       was balloted for and duly elected
 a Fellow    of the Society.
     A paper was read, entitled " Experimental Inquiry into the cause
of the Ascent and Continued Motion of the Sap ; with a new method
of preparing plants for physiological investigations." By George
Rainey, Esq., M.R.C.S.,         Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
F.R.S.
     The ascent of the sap in vegetables has been generally ascribed
to a vital contraction either of the vessels or of the cells of the plant :
the circumstances of that ascent taking place chiefly at certain sea
sons of the year, and of the quantity of fluid, and the velocity of its
motion being proportional to the development of those parts whose
functions are obviously vital, as the leaves and flowers, have been
regarded as conclusive against the truth of all theories which pro
fessed to explain the phenomenon on purely mechanical principles.
The aim of the author, in the present paper, is to show that these

                                    433
objections are not valid, and to prove, by a series of experiments,
that the motion of the sap is totally independent of any vital con
tractions of the passages which transmit it ; that it is wholly a mecha
nical process, resulting entirely from the operation of endosmose ;
and that it takes place even through those parts of a plant which
have been totally deprived of their vitality.
    The lower extremity of a branch of Valeriana rubra was placed,
soon after being gathered, into a solution of bichloride of mercury.
In a few hours a considerable quantity of this solution was absorbed,
and the whole plant, which had been previously somewhat shrunk
from the evaporation of its moisture, recovered its healthy appear
ance. On the next day, although the lower portion of the branch had
lost its vitality, the leaves and all the parts of the plant into which
no bichloride had entered, but only the water of the solution, were
perfectly healthy and filled with sap. On each of the following days
additional portions of the stem became affected in succession ; but
the unaffected parts still preserved their healthy appearance,       and
the flowers and leaves developed themselves as if the plant had ve
getated in pure water and the whole stem had been in its natural
healthy state. On a minute examination it was found that calomel,
in the form of a white substance, had been deposited on the internal
surface of the cuticle ; but no bichloride of mercury could be de
tected in those parts which had retained their vitality ; thus showing
that the solution of the bichloride had been decomposed into chlo
rine, calomel, and water, and had destroyed the vitality of the parts
where this action had taken place ; after which, fresh portions of the
solution had passed through the substance of the poisoned parts, as
if they had been inorganic canals. Various experiments of a similar
kind were made on other plants, and the same conclusions were de
duced from them.
    As the addition of a solution of iodide of potassium converts the
bichloride of mercury into an insoluble biniodide, the author was
enabled, by the application of this test to thin sections of the stems
of plants into which the bichloride had been received by absorption,
to ascertain, with the aid of the microscope, the particular portion
of the structure into which the latter had penetrated.         The result
 of his observations was, that the biniodide is found only in the in
tercellular and intervascular spaces, none appearing to be contained
within the cavities of either cells or vessels.
    As the fluids contained in the vessels and in the cells hold in so
lution various vegetable compounds, their density is greater than
 the ascending sap, which is external to them, and from which they
 are separated by an intervening organized membrane.          Such being
 the conditions requisite for the operation of the principle of endos
 mose, the author infers that such a principle is constantly in action
 in living plants ; and that it is the cause of the continual transmis
 sion of fluids from the intervascular and intercellular spaces into the
 interior of the vessels and cells, and also of the ascent of the sap.

    1. The reading of a paper, entitled " On the Nerves," by James
Stark, M.D., was resumed and concluded.
   The author gives the results of his examinations, both microscopical
and chemical, of the structure and composition of the nerves; and
concludes that they consist, in their whole extent, of a congeries of
membranous tubes, cylindrical in their form, placed parallel to one
another, and united into fasciculi of various sizes ; but that neither
these fasciculi nor the individual tubes are enveloped by any fila
mentous tissue ; that these tubular membranes are composed of
extremely minute filaments, placed in a strictly longitudinal direc
tion, in exact parallelism with each other, and consisting of granules
of the same kind as those which form the basis of all the solid
structures of the body ; and that the matter which fills the tubes
is of an oily nature, differing in no essential respect from butter,
or soft fat ; and remaining of a fluid consistence during the life of
the animal, or while it retains its natural temperature, but becoming
granular or solid when the animal dies, or its temperature is much
reduced. As oily substances are well known to be non-conductors
of electricity, and as the nerves have been shown by the experiments
of Bischoff to be among the worst possible conductors of this agent,
the author contends that the nervous agency can be neither elec
tricity, nor galvanism, nor any property related to those powers ;
and conceives that the phenomena are best explained on the hypo
thesis of undulations or vibrations propagated along the course of
the tubes which compose the nerves, by the medium of the oily
globules they contain.       He traces the operation of the various
causes which produce sensation, in giving rise to these undulations ;
and extends the same explanation to the phenomena of voluntary
motion, as consisting in undulations, commencing in the brain, as
determined by the will, and propagated to the muscles.        He corro
borates his views by ascribing the effects of cold in diminishing or

                                     435
 destroying both sensibility and the power of voluntary motion, par
 ticularly as exemplified in the hybernation of animals, to its mecha
 nical operation of diminishing the fluidity, or producing solidity, in
 the oily medium by which these powers are exercised.
    2. A letter from Prof. Hanson to G. B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S., A.R.,
 was also read, " On a New Method of computing the Perturbations
 of the Planets whose eccentricities and inclinations are not small."
 Communicated by G. B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author announces that he has found a method by which the
 absolute perturbations of planets for any given time, with any given
 eccentricity and inclination of the orbit, may be calculated ; and he
 exemplifies his method by applying it to the computation of the per
 turbations produced by Saturn on the comet of Encke, in every point
 of its orbit; a problem of which hitherto there existed no solution.

    2. The reading of a paper, entitled
                                              " On the minute structure
of the Skeletons or hard parts of Invertebrata," by W. B. Carpenter,
M.D., was resumed and concluded.
    The present memoir is the first of a series which the author
intends to communicate to the Society, and relates only to the Mol-
lusca ; and he proposes, hereafter, to extend his inquiries to the
skeletons of the Echinodermata, and the various classes of articu
lated animals. After adverting to the classifications of shells pro
posed by Mr. Hatchett and Mr. Gray, from the propriety of which
he finds reason to dissent, he proceeds to state the results of his
microscopic examination of the texture of shells under the several
following heads.     First, shells having a prismatic cellular structure,

                                   436
aa  the Pinna, and which are composed of a multitude of flattened
hexagonal calcareous prisms, originally deposited in continuous
layers of hexagonal cells, and thus constituting a calcified epithe
lium, analogous with the enamel of the teeth. Secondly, those con
sisting of membranous shell-substance, the basis of which, after the
removal of its calcareous portion, presents nothing but a membra
nous film, of greater or less consistence, composed of several layers,
but without the appearance of any cellular tissue : this membrane
the author regards as being derived from the mantle, of which it
was originally a constituent part, by the development of nucleolated
cells ; and the various corrugations and foldings of which it is sus
ceptible in different species, introducing many diversities into the
structure of the shells of this class. Thirdly, shells having a nacreous
structure, and exhibiting the phenomena of iridescence ; a property
which the author ascribes to the plicated form of the membrane of
the shell, combined with a secondary series of transverse corruga
tions. Fourthly, shells exhibiting a tubular structure, formed by
cylindrical perforations occurring among the several layers, and
varying in diameter from about the 20,000th to the 3500th part of
an inch ; but measuring on an average about the 6000th part of an
inch, and presenting a striking analogy with the dentine or ivory
of the teeth. The last sections of the paper relate to the epidermis
and the colouring matter of shells.
   References are made, in many parts of the paper, to illustrative
drawings ; which, however, the author has not yet supplied.

   The following papers were read, viz. : —
   1. " Observations on certain cases of Elliptic Polarization of
Light by Reflection," by the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S.,
 Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
   The author, by way of introduction, passes in review the la
bours of various inquirers on the subject of the elliptic polarization
of light, and notices more particularly those of Sir David Brewster,
who first discovered this curious property, as recorded in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1830; of Mr. Airy, in the Cambridge
 Transactions for 1831 and 1832 ; and of Professor Lloyd, in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1840, and in the Reports of the
British Association for 1841. He then proceeds to give an account
of his own experimental examination of the phenomena of elliptic
polarization in the reflection of light from various surfaces, by ob
serving the modifications of the polarized rings under different con
ditions, both of surface and of incidence, and by endeavouring to
ascertain both the existence and amount of ellipticity, as shown by

                                    437
 the dislocation of those rings, and to determine its peculiar cha
 racter, as indicated by the direction in which the dislocation takes
 place ; the protrusion of the alternate quadrants appearing, in cer
 tain cases, in one direction, and in others in the opposite.     These
 observations are reducible to two classes ; first, those designed to
 contribute to the inquiry, what substances possess the property of
 elliptic polarization, by examining the light reflected from various
 bodies ; and second, those made on certain cases of films of several
 kinds, including those formed on metals by oxidation or other action
 upon the metal itself, as well as by extraneous deposition. The
author found the general result, in all these cases, to be, that from
 any one tint to another, through each entire order of tints, the form
 of the rings in the reflected light undergoes certain regular changes;
passing from a dislocation in one direction to that in the opposite,
through an intermediate point of no dislocation, or of plane polar
 ization ; and thus exhibiting a dark and a bright centred system
alternately, as long as the order of tints are preserved pure. These
changes in the form of the rings, he observes, are precisely those
expressed by successive modifications of Mr. Airy's formula, corre
sponding to the increments in the retardation which belong to the
periodical colours of the films.
    The remaining portion of the paper is occupied by a description
of the apparatus and mode of conducting the experiments ; and of
the observations made on mica, on decomposed glass, plumbago,
daguerreotype, and other metallic plates, and on the coloured films
produced on steel and on copper by the action of heat, and of voltaic
electricity.    The author gives, in conclusion, an analytical inves
tigation of   Mr. Airy's general formula.

                                 " Experimental Researches in Electri
city :" Eighteenth Series ; by Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S.
Section 25. On the Electricity evolved by the Friction of Water
and Steam against other bodies.

                                   438
    The object of the experiments related in this paper, is to trace
the source   of the electricity which accompanies the issue of steam
of high pressure from the vessels in which it is contained. By
means of a suitable apparatus, which the author describes and de
lineates, he found that electricity is never excited by the passage of
pure steam, and is manifested only when water is at the same time
present ; and hence he concludes that it is altogether the effect of
the friction of globules of water against the sides of the opening,
or against the substances opposed to its passage, as the water is
rapidly moved onwards by the current of steam.           Accordingly it
was found to be increased in quantity by increasing the pressure and
impelling force of the steam.     The immediate effect of this friction
was, in all cases, to render the steam or water positive, and the
 solids, of whatever nature they might be, negative.      In certain cir
 cumstances, however, as when a wire is placed in the current of
steam at some distance from the orifice whence it has issued, the
solid exhibits the positive electricity already acquired by the steam,
and of which it is then merely the recipient and the conductor.       In
like manner, the results may be greatly modified by the shape,
the nature, and the temperature of the passages through which the
steam is forced. Heat, by preventing the condensation of the steam
 into water, likewise prevents the evolution of electricity, which
 again speedily appears by cooling the passages so as to restore the
water which is necessary for the production of that effect.          The
phenomenon of the evolution of electricity in these circumstances
is dependent also on the quality of the fluid in motion, more espe
 cially in relation to its conducting power. Water will not excite
 electricity unless it be pure ; the addition to it of any soluble salt
 or acid, even in minute quantity, is sufficient to destroy this pro
perty. The addition of oil of turpentine, on the other hand, occa
sions the development of electricity of an opposite kind to that
which is excited by water ; and this the author explains by the par
ticles or minute globules of the water having each received a coat
ing of oil in the form of a thin film, so that the friction takes place
 only between that external film and the solids, along the surface of
which the globules are carried.       A similar, but a more permanent
effect is produced by the presence of olive oil, which is not, like
oil of turpentine, subject to rapid dissipation.
    Similar results were obtained when a stream of compressed air
was substituted for steam in these experiments.        When moisture
was present, the solid exhibited negative, and the stream of air po
sitive electricity ; but when the air was perfectly dry, no electricity
of any kind was apparent. The author concludes with an account
of some experiments in which dry powders of various kinds were
placed in the current of air ; the results differed according to the
nature of the substances employed, and other circumstances.

    2. " On the Structure and Mode of Action of the Iris :" by C. R.
Hall, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    After reciting the various discordant opinions entertained at dif
ferent periods by anatomists and physiologists, relative to the struc
ture and actions of the iris, the author proceeds to give an account
of his microscopical examination of the texture of this part of the
eye, in different animals.     He considers the radiated plicae, which
are seen on the uvea in Mammalia, as not being muscular ; but he
agrees with Dr. Jacob in regarding them as being analogous in
structure to the ciliary processes.      The white lines and elevations
apparent on the anterior surface of the human iris, he supposes to
be formed by the ciliary nerves which interlace with one another in
the form of a plexus. The iris, he states, is composed of two portions ;
the first, consisting of a highly vascular tissue, connected by vessels
with the choroid, ciliary processes, sclerotica and cornea, and abun
dantly supplied with nerves, which, in the human iris, appear, in a
front view, as thread-like striae ; and which are invested, on both
surfaces, by the membrane of the aqueous humour. They are more
or less thickly covered with pigment, which, by its varying colour,
imparts to the iris on the anterior surface its characteristic hue ; and,
by its darkness on the posterior surface, renders an otherwise semi-
transparent structure perfectly opake.        The second component por
tion of the iris consists of a layer of concentric muscular fibres, which
fibres, in Man and Mammalia generally, are situated on the posterior
surface of the pupillary portion of the iris ; but which in Birds ex
tend much nearer to the ciliary margin, and consequently form a
much broader layer. In Fishes and in some Reptiles they do not
exist at all.
     The author then proceeds to inquire into the bearings which
 these conclusions may have on the physiology of the iris. He thinks
 that the phenomena of its motions can receive no satisfactory expla
 nation on the hypothesis of erectility alone, or on that of the anta
 gonism of two sets of muscular fibres ; the one for dilating, the
 other for contracting the pupil.      He is convinced that the contrac
 tion of the pupil is the effect of muscular action ; but does not con
 sider the knowledge we at present possess is sufficient to enable us
 to determine the nature of the agent by which its dilatation is effected.
 He, however, throws it out as a conjecture, that this latter action
 may be the result of an unusual degree of vital contractility, residing

                                     440
either in the cellular tissue, or in the minute blood-vessels of the
iris. It is from elasticity, he believes, that the iris derives its power
of accommodation to changes of size, and its tendency to return to
its natural state from extremes, either of dilatation or of contraction ;
but beyond this, elasticity is not concerned in its movements.

results are specified in the following letter from the author to Cap
tain Beaufort, which accompanies the paper : —
                    " Her Majesty's
                                    Ship Sulphur, Woolwich, August 2, 1842.
     " Sik, — Referring  to the Tide Registries, forwarded on my arri
val,   I beg leave   to offer the following general remarks upon the
tides at Tahiti.
     " In
          consequence of your very special instructions relative to the
 determination of the actual periods of high water at the Island of
 Tahiti, the most minute attention was paid to this subject ; and as
these periods could only be approximated, recourse was had to my
 old method (successfully practised in the Lancashire survey), of de
riving them from the Equal-altitude system.
     " By a reference to the Tide
                                      Registry annexed, it will be found
that there are two distinct periods of high water, during each interval
 of twenty-four hours ; and that during the seven days preceding,
and seven days following the full and change, they are confined be
 tween the limits of 10 a.m. and 2h 30m p.m., the whole range of
 interval, by day as well as by night, being about 4h 27m.
     " Commencing with the seventh day preceding the full moon, viz.
 the 9th of April, it will be perceived that high water occurs at
 10 a.m., this being the greatest a.m. interval from noon ; and that
 on the 16th, at the full moon, it occurs nearly at noon.
     " Passing on to the 23rd, it reaches the greatest p.m. limit at
 2h 30m, and on the 2nd of May again reaches the noon period.
     " Between the 23rd and 24th, however, a sudden anomaly presents
 itself. Throughout the day of the 23rd, the variation of the level
 does not exceed 2^ inches, and the general motion is observed to be
 '
   irregular.'   The time of high water is also the extreme p.m. limit

                                    441
   " On the 24th we discover that it has suddenly resumed the most
distant am. period, viz. 10 a.m., but proceeds regularly to the noon
period at the change.
   " Although the differences of level do not at full and change ex
ceed 1 foot 4£ inches, still   I presume that we have sufficient data
to establish the fact, — that it is not invariably high water at noon
(as asserted by Kotzebue, Beechey and others) ; and, further, that
we have corresponding nightly periods of high water.
   " It is evident that the time of high water at full and change may
be assumed as that of noon, because we have sufficiently decided
changes of level to fix the approximate period of high water.
   " It does not appear by these Registers, that any higher levels
result from the rollers sent in by the strong sea breezes (as asserted
by several writers), but rather the contrary, the highest levels being
indicated during the night, when the land breezes prevailed.
    " I have great satisfaction in presenting you with these facts, and
trust that they may induce others to follow up the same experiments,
so as, eventually, to obtain the variations which other seasons may
produce.

    2. " On Fissiparous Generation     :" by Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S.
L. and Ed.
    The author observes that the blood-corpuscle and the germinal
vesicle resemble one another in the circumstance of an orifice ex
isting in the centre of the parietal nucleus of both. He pursues the
analogy still farther, conceiving that as a substance of some sort is
introduced into the ovum through its orifice, which the author
terms the point of fecundation, so the corpuscles of the blood may
undergo a sort of fecundation through their corresponding orifice ;
and also that the blood-corpuscle, like the germinal vesicle, is pro
pagated    by self-division of its nucleus ; a mode of propagation
which he believes to be common to cells in general. The nucleus
of the germinal vesicle, or original parent cell of the ovum, gives
 origin, by self-division, to two young persistent cells, endowed with
 qualities resulting from the fecundation of the parent cell ; these
two cells being formed by assimilation, out of a great number of
 minuter cells which had been previously formed. This account of
 the process, which takes place in the reproduction of the entire or
 ganism, explains, according to Dr. Barry, the mysterious reappear
 ance of the qualities of both parents in the offspring.
    Certain nuclei, which the author has delineated in former papers
 as being contained within and among the fibres of the tissues, he
 conceives to be, in like manner, centres of assimilation, from obser
 ving that they present the same sort of orifice, that they are repro
 duced by self-division, and that they are derived from the original
 cells of development ; that is, from the nuclei of the corpuscles of
 the blood.    He considers that assimilation of the substance intra

                                    442
duced into the parietal nucleus of the cell is part of the process
which propagates the cell ; that the mode of reproduction of cells
is essentially fissiparous, and that the process of assimilation pre
pares them for being cleft.
    A pellucid point is described by the author as being " contained
in a certain part of the cell-wall, and as representing the situation
of a highly pellucid substance, originally having little if any colour."
This substance, which he considers as being primogenital and form
ative, he denominates hyaline, and ascribes to it the following pro
perties. It appropriates to itself new matter, thus becoming enlarged ;
then divides and subdivides into globules, each of which passes
through changes of the same kind.         Under certain circumstances,
it exhibits a contractile power, and performs the motions called
molecular. It is the seat of fecundation, and it is by its successive
divisions that properties descend from cell to cell, new properties
being continually acquired as new influences are applied ; but the
original constitution of the hyaline not being lost. The main pur
pose for which cells are formed is to reproduce the hyaline ; and
this they do by effecting the assimilation which prepares it to
 divide ; such division being thus the essential part of fissiparous
generation.
     The remaining part of the paper is occupied with a detailed ac
 count of these processes as they occur in the development of the
ovum, and also in the changes exhibited by the corpuscles of the
blood, in which fissiparous reproduction also takes place, and the
red blood-discs are converted into fibrin, and thus give origin to
 the various tissues of the organs.      The same theory of fissiparous
 reproduction he also applies to the formation of the muscular fibre,
 in connexion with his belief that it is composed of a double spiral
filament. Contractile cilia, he supposes, are also formed by the
 elongation of nuclei, the filaments proceeding from them in opposite
 directions.   The author considers, lastly, the subject of the fissipa
rous reproduction of the Infusoria, and particularly of the Volvox
globator, the Chlamido-monas, Baccillaria, Gonium, and the Mona-
dina in general ; and applies the same theory to gemmiparous repro
duction, and to the so-called spontaneous generation of infusoria and
parasitic entozoa.

    The  MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                    President, in the

    James Meadows Rendel, Esq., was balloted for, and duly elected
a  Fellow of  the Society.
    The following papers were read, viz. —
    1. " Researches on the Decomposition         and Disintegration   of
Phosphatic Vesical Calculi     ; and  on the introduction of Chemical

                                    443
decomponents     into the living Bladder." By S. Elliott Hoskins, M.D
 Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     The object of these researches was the discovery of some chemi
 cal agent, more energetic in its action on certain varieties of human
 calculi, and less irritating when injected into the bladder, than any
 of the fluids hitherto employed.
     These indications not being fulfilled by dilute acids, or other sol
 vents which act by the exertion of single elective affinity, the author
 investigated the effects of complex affinity in producing decompo
 sition, and consequent disintegration, of vesical calculi.
     For this purpose an agent is required, the base of which should
 unite with the acid of the calculus, whilst the acid of the former
should combine and form soluble salts with the base of the latter.
 The combined acids would thereby be set free in definite propor
 tions, to be neutralized in their nascent state, and removed out of
the sphere of action, before any stimulating effect could be exerted
 on the animal tissue.
    These intentions the author considers as having been fulfilled by
the employment of weak solutions of some of the vegetable super-
salts of lead ; such as the supermalate, saccharate, lactate, &c. The
preparation, however, to which he gives the preference, is an acid
saccharate, or, as he calls it, a  nitro-saccharale of lead.
    The salt, whichsoever it   may be, must be moistened with    a   few
drops of acetic, or of its own proper acid, previous to solution in
water, whereby alone perfect transparency and activity are secured.
He furthermore states, that the decomposing liquid should not ex
ceed in strength one grain of the salt to each fluid-ounce of water,
as the decomposing effect  is   in an inverse ratio to its strength.
    Having by experiments which are fully detailed ascertained the
chemical effects of the above class of decomponents on calculous
concretions out of the body, the author briefly alludes to the cases
of three patients, in each of whom from four to eight ounces of
these solutions had been repeatedly, for weeks together, introduced
into the bladder, and retained in that organ without inconvenience
for the space of from ten to fifty minutes.
    It not being the intention of the author to enter into the medical
history of these cases, he merely cites the above facts as sufficient
to establish the principle originally laid down namely, chemical
                                                  ;
decomposition of phosphatic calculi, by means of solutions so mild
as to be capable of retention in the living human bladder without
irritation or inconvenience.
  2.   "   Method of proving the three leading properties of the
           A
Ellipse and the Hyperbola from       well-known property of the
                                      a
Circle." By Sir Frederick Pollock, Knt., F.R.S., Her Majesty's At
torney General.   Communicated in a letter to P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Secretary to the Royal Society.
   In this communication, the author first demonstrates the well-
known property of the circle, that   from
                                      if     point in the diameter
                                              a
produced there be drawn tangent to the circle, and from the point
                          a

                                     444
of contact    there be drawn a line perpendicular to the diameter ; and
if from     any  point in the circumference there be drawn two lines,
one   to  the point without the circle, and another to the foot of this
perpendicular, the former of these lines will be to the latter, as the
distance of the point without the circle from the centre, is to the ra
dius of the circle. By means of this property, and assuming that
the ellipse is the curve whose ordinate, at right angles to its axis, is
to the corresponding ordinate of the circle, described upon this axis
as a diameter, in a constant ratio, the author proves the following
propositions relating to this curve : —
    1. The rectangle of the abscissae is to the square of the ordinate,
as the square of the semiaxis major to the difference of the squares
of the semiaxis major and the excentricity.
    2. The distance of any point in the curve from the focus, is to
its distance from the directrix, as the excentricity is to the semiaxis
major.
    3. The sum of the distances of any point in the curve from the
two foci is equal to the axis major.
    By a method nearly similar to that employed for the ellipse, and
 assuming that the hyperbola is a curve in which the rectangle of the
 abscissae is to the square of the ordinate, as the square of the ordi
 nate in a circle, described upon the axis major as a diameter, is to
 the square of the subtangent, the author shows, first, that the distance
 of any point in the curve from the focus is to its distance from the
 directrix, as the distance between the foci is to the axis major ; and
 secondly, that the difference of the distances of any point in the curve
 from the two foci is equal to the axis major.
    3.  " On   the diurnal Temperature of the Earth's surface, with the
 discussion of a simple formula for ascertaining the same." By S. M.
 Drach, Esq., F.R.A.S.          Communicated by John Lee, Esq., LL.D.,
 F.R.S.
    The author      investigates  the several causes which influence the
 daily temperature of any point       at the earth's surface.  He employs
 the term Thermal establishment to denote the retardation of the effects
 of solar light caused by atmospherical conduction and by local cir
 cumstances, in the same manner that the term Tidal establishment
 has been used to express the local constant by which the astronomical
 effects on the waters of the ocean are delayed.       After explaining the
 formation of the tables and diagrams given at the end of the paper,
 and detailing the conclusions derivable from them, the author enters
 into a review of the perturbing causes, investigates the analytical
 expression for the daily heat, and concludes with some observations
 on isothermal lines, on the influence of the friction resulting from
 the rotation of the earth about its axis, and on the agency of elec
 tricity.

The   MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                   President, in the Chair.
   1. A  paper was read, entitled, "On the Laws of Individual Tides at
Southampton and at Ipswich."        By G. B. Airy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
Astronomer Royal.
   The author gives the results of his own personal observations of
the tides at Southampton and at Ipswich, in both of which places
they present some remarkable peculiarities. In conducting these in
quiries he obtained, through the favour of Colonel Colby, R.E., and
Lieut. Yelland, R.E., the able assistance of non-commissioned officers
and privates of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners.       He explains
in detail the nature of his observations, and the method he pursued
in constructing tables of mean results ; and deduces from them the
conclusion, that the peculiarities in the tides which are the object of
his investigation are not dependent on any variations in the state of
the atmosphere, but are probably connected with the laws which
regulate the course of waves proceeding along canals.
   2. A paper was in part read, entitled, " On the Special Function of
the Skin."     By Robert Willis, M.D. Communicated by John Bos-
tock, M.D., F.R.S.
                             March   9, 1843.
  Sir JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK,                 Bart., V.P. and Treasurer,
                              in the Chair.
   John Miers, Esq., was balloted for, and duly elected a Fellow of
the Society.
   1. The reading of a paper, entitled, " On the Special Function of the
Skin." By Robert Willis, M.D.         Communicated by John Bostock,
M.D., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   The purpose which is answered in the animal economy by the cu
taneous exhalation has not hitherto been correctly assigned by phy
siologists : the author believes it to be simply the elimination from
the system of a certain quantity of pure water, and he considers that
the saline and other ingredients which pass off at the same time by the
skin are in too inconsiderable a quantity to deserve being taken into
account. He combats by the following arguments the prevailing
opinion, that this function is specially designed to reduce or to regu
late the animal temperature.      It has been clearly shown by the ex
periments of Delaroche and Berger, that the power which animals
may possess of resisting the effects of a surrounding medium of high
temperature is far inferior to that which has been commonly ascribed
to them; for in chambers heated to 120° or 130° Fahr., the tempe

                                     446
rature of animals is soon raised to 11° or even 16° above what it had
been previously, and death speedily ensues.       The rapid diminution
or even total suppression of the cutaneous exhalation, on the other
hand, is by no means followed by a rise in the temperature of the
body. In general dropsies, which are attended with a remarkable
diminution of this secretion, an icy coldness usually pervades both
the body and the limbs. A great fall in the animal temperature was
found by Fourcauld, Becquerel and Breschet to be the effect of
covering the body with a varnish impervious to perspiration ; and
so serious was the general disturbance of the functions in these cir
cumstances, that death usually ensued in the course of three or four
hours.
    The question will next arise, how does it happen that health and
even life can be so immediately dependent as we find them to be on the
elimination of so small a quantity of water as thirty-three ounces from
the general surface of the body in the course of twenty-four hours?
To this the author answers, that such elimination is important as
securing the conditions which are necessary for the endosmotic trans
ference between arteries and veins of the fluids which minister to
nutrition and vital endowment. It is admitted by physiologists that
the blood, while still contained within its conducting channels, is
inert with reference to the body, no particle of which it can either
nourish or vivify until that portion of it which has been denomina
ted the plasma has transuded from the vessels and arrived in imme
diate contact with the particle that is to be nourished and vivified :
but no physiologist has yet pointed out the efficient cause of these
tendencies of the plasma, first, to transude through the wall of its
efferent vessels, and secondly, to find its way back again into the
afferent conduits.    The explanation given by the author is that, in
consequence    of the  out-going current of blood circulating over the
entire superficies of the body perpetually losing a quantity of water
by the action of the sudoriparous glands, the blood in the returning
channels has thereby become more dense and inspissated, and is
brought into the condition for absorbing, by endosmosis, the fluid
perpetually exuding from the arteries, which are constantly kept on
the stretch by the injecting force of the heart.
   In an appendix to the paper, the author points out a few of the
practical applications of which the above-mentioned theory is suscep
tible. Interference with the function of the skin, and principally
through the agency of cold, he observes, is the admitted cause of the
greater number of acute diseases to which mankind, in the tempe
rate regions of the globe, are subject.     He who is said to have suf
fered a chill, has, in fact, suffered a derangement or suppression of
the secreting action of his skin, a process which is altogether indis
pensable to the continuance of life ; and a disturbance of the general
health follows as a necessary consequence.      Animals exposed to the
continued action of a hot dry atmosphere die from exhaustion ; but
when subjected to the effects of a moist atmosphere of a temperature
not higher than their own, they perish much more speedily ; being

                                   447
destroyed by the same cause as those which die from covering the
body with an impervious glaze ; for, in both cases, the conditions re
quired for the access of oxidized, and the removal of deoxidized
plasma, are wanting, and life necessarily ceases. The atmosphere of
unhealthy tropical climates differs but little from a vapour-bath at
a temperature of between 80° and 90° Fahr.; and the dew-point in
those countries, as for example on the western coast of Africa, never
ranges lower than three or four degrees, nay, is sometimes only a
single degree, below the temperature of the air. Placed in an atmo
sphere so nearly saturated with water, and of such a temperature,
man is on the verge of conditions that are incompatible with his ex
istence : conditions which may easily be induced by exposure to fa
tigue in a humid atmosphere under a burning sun, or other causes
which excite the skin while they prevent the exercise of its natural
function.    The terms Miasma and Malaria may, according to the
author, be regarded as almost synonymous with air at the tempera
ture of from 75° to 85° Fahr., and nearly saturated with moisture.
   2. A paper was also read, entitled, "On the Cause of the reduction
of Metals from solutions of their salts by the Voltaic circuit."    By
Alfred Smee, Esq., F.R.S., Surgeon to the Bank of England.
   The reduction of a metal from its saline solution by the agency of
voltaic electricity, has, the author states, been explained in three
different ways.    By Hisinger, by Berzelius, and by Faraday it has
been ascribed to the liberation of hydrogen in this process : Davy
and others considered it as resulting directly from the attraction of
the metal to the negative pole : and Daniell conceives that the metal
is directly electrolysed by the action of the voltaic circuit.     The
author found that the ends of copper wires, placed in a solution of
sulphate of copper between two platina poles in the circuit, mani
fest electric polarity ; so that while one end is dissolving, the other
is receiving deposits of copper : he also found that platina was, in
like manner, susceptible of polarity, although in a much less degree
than copper, when placed in similar circumstances. With a view to
determine the influence of nascent hydrogen in the voltaic reduc
tion of metals, he impregnated pieces of coke and of porous char
coal with hydrogen, by placing them, while in contact with a metal,
in an acid solution, when they thus constituted the negative pole of
the circuit ; and he found that the pieces thus charged readily re
duced the metals of solutions into which they were immersed ; and
thence infers that the hydrogen is the agent in these reductions.
From another set of experiments he concludes, that during these de
compositions, water is really formed at the negative pole ; a circum
stance which he conceives is the chief source of the difficulties ex
perienced in electro-metallurgic operations when they are conducted
on a large scale, but which may be avoided by a particular mode of
arranging the elements of the circuit so as to ensure the uniform
diffusion of the salt.
   The author obtained the immediate reduction of gold, platina,
palladium, copper, silver and tin from their solutions by the agency

                                     448
of hydrogen contained in      a tube, with a piece of platinized platina in
contact with the metallic    salt : nitric acid and persalts of iron, on the
other   hand,  yielded their oxygen by the influence of the same agent.
     The general   conclusion  which he deduces from his experiments is
 that, when a metallic solution is subjected to voltaic action, water is
decomposed, its oxygen passing in one direction, and its hydrogen in
the opposite direction ; the latter element performing at the moment
 of its evolution at the negative pole the same part with respect to a
 solution of sulphate of copper, that a plate of iron or zinc would per
form to the same solution.

     William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, M.D.,            was  balloted  for, and
duly elected a Fellow of the Society.
     The following papers were read, viz .—
     1.
        " On the import and office of the Lymphatic Vessels." By
 Robert Willis, M.D. Communicated by John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S.
     That absorption is the special office of the lymphatic vessels was,
 until very lately, a universally received doctrine in physiology : but
 it is now admitted that if they exercise this faculty, it can be only to
an inconsiderable extent ; and physiologists of high authority have
even denied that they possess any absorbing power at all.               This
last is the opinion of Magendie, in which the author concurs. So lately
as 1841, Rudolph Wagner asserted that "neither anatomical nor
physiological considerations render any satisfactory account of the
import and office of the lymphatics," which thus, shorn of their
ancient office, were repudiated as a superfluous apparatus in the
animal mechanism.         The grand organs of absorption the author
believes to be the veins ; and a principal object of his paper is to
point out the mode in which they acquire this remarkable faculty.
The principal condition which this faculty of imbibition implies, is
a difference in density between the contents of the vessels which are
to absorb, and the contents of those which furnish the matter to be
absorbed. If the several constituent materials of the body, both fluid
and solid, were to remain in the same unaltered state, both chemi
cally and physically, there could be no interchange among them :
in order that mutual penetration may take place between two ele
ments, the one must differ from the other : that which is designed
to absorb must be, with relation to that which is to be absorbed,
more dense ; that is, must contain a smaller quantity of water in
proportion to its solid ingredients.       For the continuance of the de
licate processes concerned in the access and removal of the nutrient
fluids, it is necessary that a difference should be established be
tween the arterial and the venous blood in respect of density.         This
purpose the author conceives is accomplished by the abstraction from

                                     449
 the former of a portion of its water by the sudoriparous glands of the
 skin on the one hand, and by the lymphatic vessels on the other.
     That the separation of the lymph from the blood is calculated to
 increase its density, is proved by its chemical analysis ; lymph con
 taining from 96 to 97 per cent, of water, and blood from 77 to 82
 per cent.    The author regards this separation of lymph from the
 blood as the result of a purely vital process of the same nature
 as that by which the saliva and the watery portion of the urine are
 secreted from the circulating mass. He considers that his views are
 supported by the anatomical distribution of the lymphatic system :
 for, on the principle that organs are found in the vicinity of the
 places where their office is wanted, the office of the lyphatics must
 be general, inasmuch as the system is general.        These vessels may,
 in fact, be regarded as the essential element of an universally dis
 tributed gland. The mode in which the lymphatics are finally con
 nected with the blood-vessels appears also to indicate that the object
 in view is to keep their watery fluid separate from the blood as long
 as possible ; for, as is well known, they do not transfer their contents
 into the neighbouring veins, but pour their whole fluid into the
 superior vena cava at the moment it is about to enter into the
 heart.
    The remarkable manner in which the lymphatic system is de
 veloped in some of the lower tribes of animals, whose bodies are en
 cased in an impervious horny covering, such as turtles, lizards and
serpents, is adduced in further corroboration of the author's views.
 He regards the serous membranes as contrivances for the accom
 modation of a great number of lymphatics ; and the intimate con
 nexion which the function of these vessels has with the life and
nutrition of internal organs he thinks is shown by the remarkable
amount of disturbance consequent on inflammation, or other morbid
condition of serous membranes.         Finally, the author adverts to the
influence which the difference of endosmotic capability engendered
by the abstraction of a certain amount of water in the course of the
circulation, (first between the blood corpuscles and the plasma in
which they swim, and then between the liquor sanguinis and the
containing channels,) must have on the capillary circulation, which
he conceives it is calculated to facilitate.
    2.  " Further Observations    on the descending fluids of Plants, and
more     especially the  Cambium."     By George Rainey, Esq. Com
municated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author relates an experiment in proof of the sap descending
from the upper to the lower part of an exogenous tree, through vessels
which are continuous from the leaves to the roots ; the course of
these vessels being shown by the addition of a solution of iodide of
potassium after they had taken up by absorption a quantity of a
solution of acetate of lead.     The fluids in these vessels are, he con
ceives, separated from the sap, which is ascending from the roots,
only by the membrane of which they are composed.               When the
leaf-buds of a tree are vegetating, large separations are observable

                                     450
between the cells of the bark, and also between the bark and the
wood : while no such separations are apparent when the leaf-buds
are entirely inactive.     These separations are various in size, and
irregular in form ; their parietes consist of rows of cells, piled up
one above another, like the bricks of a wall : and their cavities all
communicate with one another. From these and other anatomical
facts, which are given in detail by the author, he concludes that the
propulsion of the sap along the vessels, resulting from the opera
tion of endosmose, will explain the descent of the cambium, which,
being the nutritious portion of the vegetable fluids, corresponds in
its nature to the chyle in animals.
                              March 23, 1843.
            GEORGE RENNIE,             Esq., V.P., in the Chair.
     A paper  was read, entitled, " Notice of an Extraordinary Lumi
nous Appearance seen in the Heavens on the 17th of March, 1843,"
in a Letter to S. H. Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., by Sir John F. W.
 Herschel, Bart., F.R.S.
                                              Collingwood, March 17, 1843.
     My Dear Sir, — This evening,at half-past       seven o'clock,I received
 notice from one of my servants of a luminous appearance in the
 sky, visible towards the S.W., which I immediately ran out to ob
 serve, and which, as it differed in some remarkable particulars from
 any phenomenon of the kind I have ever before observed or seen
 described, I think it not unlikely to prove interesting to the Royal
Society.
     The evening was one of uncommon serenity and beauty : the
 moon, only thirty-eight hours after the full, having considerable south
declination, was not yet risen. In consequence, the sun being already
 far enough below the horizon to leave only a faint glow of twilight
 in the west, the stars shone with unsubdued brilliancy, no cloud
 being visible in any quarter.       Orion in particular was seen in all
 its splendour ; and commencing below that constellation, and stretch
 ing obliquely westward and downwards, nearly, but not quite to
 the horizon, was seen the luminous appearance             in question. Its
  general aspect was that of a perfectly straight, narrow band of con
 siderably bright white cloud, thirty degrees in length, and about a
 degree and a quarter, or a degree and a half in breadth in the mid
 dle of its length ; its brightness nearly uniform, except towards the
 ends, where it faded gradually, so that to define its exact termination
 at either end was difficult. However, by the best judgement I could
  form, it might be considered as terminating, to the eastward or fol
  lowing side, at, or a very little beyond, the stars i, k, X Leporis, which
  stars (being of the fifth, or at most 5-4 magnitude) were pretty con
  spicuously visible ; from which circumstance the degree of bright
  ness of the ground of the sky in that region may be well estimated.
  Between these stars and fi Leporis, the luminous band then com

                                   4-51
nicnced, involving neither of them, but more nearly contiguous to k
and X than to fx. From thence its course was towards ir Eridani, which
star must have been covered by     it, and was not seen ; this judgement
of its direction having been formed by noticing that passed clearly
                                                        it
above y    Eridani, and as clearly below and parallel to the direction
of   £,
     e   Eridani, which two stars being dimmed by the vapours of
the horizon and the twilight, were so little conspicuous as perfectly
to account for ir not having been noticed.      At the point of its pass
age between   y    and   S  was still considerably bright, and as
                              it                                 it   ter
minated with somewhat more abruptness at       a   point beyond (then
                                                                 e
about 12° high) than at its upper extremity,       I am rather disposed
to consider this end as somewhat curtailed by the vapours.        Making
no allowance, however, for this, and estimating its visible termina
tion at   a point on a celestial globe nearly opposite  f Eridani (which
star however was not noticed at the time), the length above assigned
to the luminous band (30°) has been concluded by measurement
on the globe.
 I    am thus particular in describing the course, situation and di
 mensions of the band, not only as terms of comparison with other
 observations of   it,should any have been made, but for another rea
 son, in which consists the peculiarity of the phenomenon, and which
is  my sole motive for making this communication.        The above situ
 ation and course, relatively to those stars, remained perfectly unal
 tered the whole time    remained visible at all, which
                         it                                 itdid for up
 wards of an hour from the time first saw
                                   I         it, accompanying the stars
 in their diurnal motion, until the preceding end at length was extin
 guished in the horizon vapours with the stars adjacent, and until
 the light of the rising moon dimmed and at length effaced the rest,
 thoughI     apprehend its intrinsic lustre to have been in progress of
 diminution during the last quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.
I     should not forget to mention, that neither in the north-west, nor
 elsewhere, were any streamers or other appearances of Aurora Borealis
 perceptible during any part of the evening. The only other luminous
 appearance, the milky way excepted, was that of the zodiacal light,
 whichI     have seldom seen to greater advantage in this climate, and
 which extended high enough to involve the Pleiades, then about
 55° from the sun.
 I    have said that the general aspect of the phenomenon was that
 of a bright white cloud. In fact, my first impression was that such
 was its nature an impression immediately dissipated and ultimately
               ;
 converted into the contrary certainty by the following considerations
 and observed facts.      For, in the first place, no ordinary cloud at
 such an angular elevation above the horizon could have received
 from the sun, even at the earliest hour when      it was observed, any
 thing like sufficient illumination to have presented so luminous an
 appearance; that luminary being then between 9° and 10° below
 the horizon, and the moon not yet being risen, even at eight o'clock,
 whenI    judged the light of the band by contrast with the increasing
 darkness of the ground of the sky to have attained its maximum,
 at which hour the depression of the sun was nearly 12°.

                                     4-52
     Moreover, 2ndly, about a quarter of an hour after the band was
 first observed, being then on the roof of my house and having a
 very uninterrupted view of the western horizon, I noticed the for
 mation of a small streak of cloud about the same apparent altitude,
 somewhat to the north of the pyramid of the zodiacal light, and
 therefore nearer to the place of the sun below the horizon.         The
 direction of this streak was horizontal, not oblique, and its hue
 black, not white. This cloud enlarged and became projected as a
 dark space within the zodiacal light, and soon after others of a less
 defined character formed elsewhere, all, however, without exception,
 dark instead of luminous.
    3rdly.    At the rising of the moon, about half-past eight, the
 light of our band, already probably on the decrease, was almost
 wholly effaced.      On the other hand, by this time numerous lines
 and cirrous streaks of light cloud which had been for some time in
 progress of formation, and had been either wholly unseen before or
 only noticed by their effacing the stars behind them, became illu
 minated, and appeared as white streaks and patches, such as are
 usually observed in moonlight nights.
    4thly, and lastly. Although the night was very calm, yet on
 watching narrowly the motions and changes of these real clouds
 with respect to the stars, they were perceived to rise very slowly
from the west, i. e. in a direction nearly or quite contrary to that of
 the declining band.
    From these united considerations, and from the extreme fixity of
 the band among the stars, I consider it impossible to regard it as a
 cloud illuminated by the sun through the medium of atmospheric
 refraction.     The latter reason, too, is equally conclusive against its
 being   classed  with ordinary auroral bands and arcs, which, though
 they keep their position well enough to be regarded as at rest by a
 careless observer, yet, when compared with stars, are always per
 ceived to be drifting, as it were, in some certain direction, or other
 wise changing in figure and dimension.
    If we look to an origin for this phenomenon beyond our atmo
 sphere, we become involved in speculations, which, however inter
 esting, it is not the object of this communication to enter into.
 On the other hand, its purpose will be answered if either it should
 be the occasion of eliciting corresponding observations of the same,
 or notices of similar phenomena already observed, or should lead
 to increased watchfulness on the part of meteorologists to avail
 themselves of occasions (which perhaps occur oftener than we are
 aware) of noting anything analogous in future.

    P.S. — There having been no post today, and the above not having
 been finished in time for despatch last night, an opportunity is af

                                     453
forded me for stating that the phenomenon above described has again
reappeared    this evening, at the same hour and in the same situation,
or rather a very little more to the north, so as to graze and partly
to involve the stars k,    \  Leporis.    It was also traceable in R. A.
some little way beyond those stars on the following side.              The
horizon being more obscured by vapour tonight than last night,
neither y, S, nor e Eridani could be seen.
    The fixity of this object among the stars on the 17th, induced me
to express to a member of my family this morning an idea that it
might possibly be seen again tonight, in which event its extra-at
mospheric origin would become quite evident.              If a thread be
stretched on a celestial globe along the central line of the band as
nearly as the above observations will enable us to fix         it,and pro
longed to meet the ecliptic,        will strike on the actual place
                                                                     is of

sun.    The inference seems almost unavoidable, that our band            no
other than the tail of magnificent comet, whose head at the times
                       a
of both observations has been below the horizon.         I    await, there
fore, with extreme interest, the event of further observation, but           al
though to afford others an opportunity of observing     it,
                                                          it will be neces
sary for me to make   a   more immediate and public announcement,            I
am still desirous to place on record my first impressions respecting so
remarkable an appearance, in the mode originally intended, both as
a  mark of respect to the Royal Society, and as pointing inquiry to
                            "                  "
other luminous " streaks      and " columns       in the sky, which have
been spoken of to me as having been seen during the last summer
and autumn on more than one occasion, and which in point of fact
caused me to desire every inmate of my family to give me imme
 diate notice of the appearance of anything unusual in the heavens,
and thus led directly to the observations above detailed.

    The following papers    were read, viz. —
    1. " Researches into   the Structure and Developement of a newly
 discovered parasitic Animalcule of the Human Skin, the Entozoon
folliculorum." By Erasmus Wilson, Esq., Lecturer on Anatomy
 and Physiology at the Middlesex Hospital.            Communicated by
 R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S.
    While engaged in researches     on the minute anatomy of the skin
 and its subsidiary organs, and particularly on the microscopical com
 position of the sebaceous substance, the author learned that Dr.
 Gustow Simon of Berlin had discovered an animalcule which inha
 bits the hair follicles of the human integument, and of which a de
 scription was published in a memoir contained in the first Number
 of Midler's Archiv for 1842. Of this memoir the author gives a
 translation at full length.   He then states that, after careful search,
 he at length succeeded in finding the parasitic animals in question,
 and proceeded to investigate more fully and minutely than Dr. Simon
 had done the details of their structure, and the circumstances of their
 origin and developement.       They exist in the sebaceous follicles of
 almost every individual, but are found more especially in those per
 sons who possess a torpid skin ; they increase in number during
 sickness, so as in general to be met with in great abundance after
 death.    In living and healthy persons, from one to three or four of
 these entozoa are contained in each follicle.     They are more nume
 rous in the follicles situated in the depression by the side of the
 nose ; but they are also found in those of the breast and abdomen,
 and on the back and loins.      Their form changes in the progress of
 their growth.     The perfect animal presents an elongated body, di
 visible into a head, thorax, and abdomen. From the front of the head
 proceed two moveable arms, apparently formed for prehension : and
 to the under side of the thorax are attached four pairs of legs, termi

                                    4.56
nated by claws. The author distinguishes two principal varieties of
the adult animal ; the one remarkable for the great length of the
abdomen and roundness of the caudal extremity ; whilst the other is
characterized by greater compactness of form, a shorter abdomen,
and more pointed tail. The first variety was found to measure, in
length, from the one-lOOth to the 45th, and the second, from the
one-160th to the 109th part of an inch.
    The author gives a minute description of the ova of these entozoa,
which he follows in the successive stages of their developement.
The paper is accompanied by numerous drawings of the objects de
scribed.
    2. " On Factorial Expressions, and the Summation of Algebraic
 Series." By W. Tate, Esq.          Communicated by the Rev. Henry
 Moseley, M.A., F.R.S., &c.
    This paper, which is wholly analytical, contains an investigation of
 certain general methods for the summation of algebraic series, which
 have led the author to the discovery of some curious and elegant pro
 positions relative to factorials and the decomposition of fractions ;
 and also to a new demonstration of Taylor's theorem.
    3. " Notice of the Comet ;" in a Letter from Captain John Grover,
 F.R.S., addressed to P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S., and dated from
 Pisa, March 21st, 1843.
    The author states that at Pisa, on Friday, the 17th of March, 1843,
 at eight o'clock in the evening, he saw a luminous arc in the heavens,
 extending from a spot about a degree to the south of Rigel to some
 clouds which bounded the western horizon. It was about 40 minutes
 in width ; the edges sharply and clearly defined. On the 20th of
 March, the author could distinctly trace the extremity of the lumi
 nous streak, which he concluded was the tail of a comet, below the
 lower part of the constellation Orion, and reaching to the star jj Eri-
 dani ; while the stars S and e Eridani were distinctly seen with the
 naked eye through the coma.        From i) Eridani, it extended 47° 30'
 to a spot nearly equidistant from ^ Orionis and i; Leporis.

    The following    papers were read,   viz.—
    1.  " On the general and minute Structure of       the Spleen in Man
and other Animals."        By William Julian Evans, M.D. Communi
cated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    After adverting briefly to the discordant opinions of Malpighi,
Ruysch, and others regarding the structure of the spleen, the author
proceeds to detail the results of the investigations on this subject, in
which he has been for many years engaged.           According to his ana
lysis,  the  following are  the component parts   of this organ : — first, a
reticulated fibro-elastic tissue ; secondly, a pulpy parenchyma, con
taining the Malpighian glands and the splenic corpuscles ; thirdly,
distinct cellular bodies; fourthly, the usual apparatus of arteries,
veins, lymphatics and nerves ; fifthly, certain fluids ; and lastly, the
membranes or tunics by which it is invested.
    He describes the cells of the spleen as being formed of a lining
membrane, continued from that of the splenic vein, and strengthened
by filaments of the fibro-elastic tissue.      The splenic vein communi
cates with these cells, at first by round foramina, then by extensive
slits resembling lacerations ; and it ultimately loses itself entirely in
the cells. The cells themselves communicate freely with one another,
and also with the veins of the parenchyma ; and may therefore be
considered as in some measure continuations of the veins.              This
structure constitutes a multilocular reservoir of great extensibility,
and possessing great elastic contractility ; properties, however, which
exist in a much less degree in the human spleen than in that of her
bivorous animals ; in which animals the cellated structure itself is
 much more conspicuous, and predominates over the parenchymatous
 portion.     As the splenic artery has no immediate communication
 with the cells, these latter may be filled much more readily by in
jection from the vein than from the artery. In the ordinary state
of the circulation, the blood, which has passed into the cells from the
veins, is pressed into the branches of the splenic veins by a force de
rived from the elasticity of the fibro-elastic tissue which surrounds
 the cavities of the cells, thus constituting a vis-a-teryo, which con
 tributes to propel the blood onwards in its circulation through the
 liver.   Should there arise, however, any obstructing cause which the
 resilience of the spleen is unable to overcome, a regurgitation must
 take place, leading to a congestion both in the mesenteric and splenic
 veins.     The spleen may thus serve as a receptacle for the blood of
 the abdominal circulation during any temporary check to its free
 passage into the vena cava ; a purpose which is more fully answered
 in herbivorous animals in whom the abdominal circulation is more

                                   458
 extensive,  and the spleen is of larger dimensions  and   greater elas
 ticity.
    The splenic corpuscles are thickly scattered throughout the cellu
 lar parenchyma of this organ ; and from each corpuscle there arises
  a minute lymphatic vessel; the interlacing of adjacent lymphatics
 giving rise to a fine and extensive net-work.     The trunks of these
 vessels enter into the Malpighian glands, and again ramifying, form
 a lymphatic plexus in the interior of these bodies.     The fluid con
 tents of these vessels, which had been before pellucid, is now found
 to contain white organic globules, similar in every respect to those
 observed in the fluid of lymphatic glands in other parts of the body.
 The author considers the secretion of this fluid, which appears to be
 identical with the contents of the lymphatic glands, as being the
 peculiar function of the splenic parenchyma.
    A few illustrative drawings and diagrams accompany this paper.
    2. " On the Structure and Developement of the Nervous and Cir
 culatory Systems, and on the existence of a complete Circulation of
 the Blood in Vessels in the Myriapoda and the Macrourous Arach-
 nida." By George Newport, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget,
 M.D., Sec. R.S.
    This paper is the first of a series which the author proposes to
submit to the Royal Society on the comparative anatomy and the
 developement of the nervous and circulatory systems in articulated
animals. Its purpose is, in the first place, to investigate the minute
anatomy of the nervous system in the Myriapoda and the Macrou
rous Arachnida, and more especially with reference to the structure
of the nervous cord and its ganglia ; and thence to deduce certain
 conclusions with respect to the physiology of that system and the
reflex movements in vertebrated animals ; secondly, to demonstrate
the existence of a complete system of circulatory vessels in the
Myriapoda and Arachnida ; and thirdly, to point out the identity of
the laws which regulate the developement of the nervous and circu
latory systems throughout the whole of the Articulata, and the de
pendence of these systems on the changes which take place in the
muscular and tegumentary structures of the body, as, in a former
paper, he showed was the case with regard to the changes occurring
in the nervous system of true insects.
    The first part of the paper relates to the nervous system.   A de
scription is given of this system in the Chilognatha, which the au
thor was led, by his former investigations, to regard as the lowest
order of the Myriapoda, and approximating most nearly to the
Annelida.     He traces the different forms exhibited by the nervous
system in the principal genera of that order, the most perfect of
which are connected on the one hand with the Crustacea, and on
the other with true insects.   Passing from these to the Geophili, the
lowest family of the Chilopoda, which still present the vermiform
type, the nervous system is traced to the tailed Arachnida,         the
Scorpions, through Scolopendra, Lithobius and Scutigera ; the last
of which tribes connects the Myriapoda on the one hand with the

                                      459
true insects, and on the other with the Arachnida.           The brain and
the visceral nerves, the coverings and structure of the cord and
ganglia, and the distribution of the systemic nerves are examined in
each genus, but more particularly in the Scorpion, in which the
nerves of the limbs are traced to the last joints of the tarsi, and
those of the tail to the extremity of the sting.      Especial attention is
bestowed on the structure of the cord and its ganglia, and their de-
velopement during the growth of the animal. In the lowest forms
of the Iulidae, in which the ganglia are very close together, and
hardly distinguishable from the non-ganglionic portions of the cord,
the author has satisfactorily traced four series of fibres, a superior,
and an inferior one, and also a transverse and a lateral series.       The
superior series, which he formerly described in insects as the motor
tract, he has assured himself is distinct from the inferior, which he
regarded as the sensitive tract ; this evidently appears on examining
the upper and under sides of a ganglionic enlargement of the cord.
On the upper surface the direction of the fibres is perfectly longitu
dinal ; while the fibres on the under surface are enlarged, and cur
vilinear in their direction.     But he remarks that it is almost impos
sible to determine by experiment whether these structures are sepa
rately motor and sensitive, as formerly supposed, or whether they
both administer to these functions by an interchange of fibres. These
two series appear also to be separated in each ganglionic enlargement
of the cord by the third series, constituting the transverse or com
missural fibres, which pass transversely through the ganglia, and of
which the existence was first indicated by the author in his paper on
the Sphinx ligustri, published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1834. The author states that, in addition to these, there is in each
half of the cord another and more important series of fibres, which
constitute a large portion of the cord, but of which the existence has
hitherto entirely escaped observation.        This series forms the lateral
portion of each half of the cord, and differs from the superior and
inferior series in the circumstance, that while those latter series are
traceable along the whole length of the cord to the suboesophageal and
cerebral ganglia, the former series extends only from the posterior
margin of one ganglion to the anterior margin of the first or second
beyond it ; thus bounding the posterior side of one nerve and the an
terior of another, and forming part of the cord only in the interval be
tween the two nerves. From this circumstance, the author designates
the fibres of this seties,fibres of reinforcement of the cord. Every nerve
proceeding from a ganglionic enlargement is composed of these four
sets of fibres, namely, an upper and an under one, communicating
with the cephalic ganglia ; a transverse or commissural, which com
municates only with corresponding nerves on the opposite side of the
body ; and a lateral set, which communicates only with nerves from
another ganglionic enlargement on the same side of the body, and
which forms part of the cord in the interspace between the gan
glia. The author had long suspected that this latter set of fibres
existed ; but he had never, until lately, ascertained their presence by
actual observation.      Their action seems fully to account for the re

                                  460
fleeted movements of parts both anterior and posterior to an irritated
limb ; as that of the commissural set does the movements of parts
situated on the opposite side of the body to that which is irritated.
In the ganglia of the cord in lulus and Polydesmus, the fibres of the
inferior longitudinal series are enlarged and softened on entering the
ganglion, but are again reduced to their original size on leaving it ;
thus appearing to illustrate the structure of ganglia in general. In
the developement of the ganglia and nerves in these genera, and
also in Geophilus, the same changes take place as those which were
formerly described by the author as occurring in insects ; namely,
an aggregation of ganglia in certain portions of the cord, and shift
ing of the position of certain nerves, which at first exist at ganglionic
portions of the cord, but afterwards become removed to a non-
ganglionic portion.    The nervous cord is elongated, in order that it
may keep pace    with the  growth of the body, which is periodically
acquiring additional segments : that this elongation takes place in
the ganglia is proved by these changes of position in the nerves lying
that the ganglia are centres of growth and nourishment, as well as
of reflex movements, and that they are analogous to the enlarge
ments of the cord in the vertebrata.
    A series of experiments on the lulus and Lithobius are next re
lated; the result of which shows that the two supra-oesophageal gan
glia are exclusively the centres of volition, and may therefore strictly
be regarded as performing the functions of a brain : so that when
these ganglia are injured or removed, all the movements of the ani
mal are of a reflex character. When, on the other hand, these gan
glia are uninjured, the animal movements are voluntary, and there
exists sensibility to pain : thereis,  however, no positive evidence that
 the power of sensation does not also reside in the other ganglia.
    The second part of the paper relates to the organs of circulation.
 In all the Myriapoda and Arachnida the dorsal vessel or heart          di is
 vided, as in insects, into several compartments, in number corre
sponding to the abdominal segments. Its anterior portion          divided,
                                                                      is
 immediately behind the basilar segment of the head, into three di
stinct trunks. The middle portion, which         the continuation of the
                                                  is
 vessel itself, passes forwards along the oesophagus, and      distributed
                                                                 is
to the head itself;    while the two others, passing laterally outwards
and downwards in an arched direction, form a vascular collar round
the oesophagus, beneath which they unite in         single vessel, as was
                                                       a
first noticed by Mr. Lord in the Scolopendra.         This single median
vessel lies above the abdominal nervous cord, and         extended! back
                                                            is
wards throughout the whole length of the body as far as the termi
nal ganglia of the cord, under which        it  subdivided into separate
                                                 is
branches accompanying the terminal nerves to their final distribu
tion. Immediately anterior to each ganglion of the cord, this vessel
gives off a pair of vascular trunks and each of these trunks
                                        ;                               di is
vided into four arterial vessels, one of which      given to each of the
                                                       is
principal nerves proceeding from the ganglion, and may be traced
along with it   ato  considerable distance. Of these, the vessel situated

                                     461
most posteriorly is again connected with the great median trunk by
means of a minute branch, so that the four vessels on each side
form, with their trunks, a complete vascular circle above each gan
glionic enlargement of the cord. Besides these, which may be re
garded as the great arterial trunk and vessels conveying the blood
directly from the anterior distribution of the heart to the limbs and
inferior surface of the body, the author has also discovered a pair of
large arterial vessels in each segment, originating directly from the
posterior and inferior surface of each chamber of the heart. Theso
vessels he has named the systemic arteries ; and in the Scolopendra
he has traced them from the great chamber of the heart, which is
situated in the penultimate segment of the body, to their ultimate
distribution and ramification in the coats of the great hepatic vessels
of the alimentary canal.
    After the blood has passed from the arteries, it is returned again
to the heart in each segment of the body by means of exceedingly
delicate transparent vessels, which pass around the sides of the seg
ments and communicate with the valvular openings of each cham
ber of the heart at its upper surface, where the valvular openings
are situated, not only in all the Myriapoda, but also in the Scorpio-
nidae.   In Scorpions, the circulatory system is more complete and
important than even in the Myriapoda.             The heart, divided as in
Myriapods    into  separate chambers,    is lengthened out at its posterior
extremity   into a  long caudal  artery,   and  gives off a pair of systemic
arteries from each chamber, precisely as in the Myriapoda.            These
arteries not only distribute their blood to the viscera, but send their
principal divisions to the muscular structures of the inferior and
lateral parts of the body, as well as to the pulmonary sacs. At the
anterior part of the abdomen, the heart becomes aortic, descends
suddenly into the thorax, and immediately behind the brain spreads
out into several pairs of large trunks, which are given to the head,
and to the organs of locomotion.      The posterior of these trunks form
a vascular collar around the oesophagus, beneath which they unite,
anteriorly, to a strong bony arch in the middle of the thorax, to form
the great arterial trunk, or supra-spinal vessel, which conveys the
blood to the posterior part of the body, as in the Myriapoda.           This
vessel passes beneath the transverse bony arch of the thorax, and is
slightly attached to it by fibrous tissue, which circumstance pro
bably induced Professor Miiller, who observed this structure in 1828,
to regard it as a ligament.     In its course backwards, along the ner
vous cord, this vessel is gradually lessened in size, until it arrives at
the terminal ganglion of the cord in the tail, where it is divided into
two branches, which take the course of the terminal nerves, and
these are again subdivided before they arrive at their ultimate distri
 bution. In addition to these parts, the author found a hollow fibrous
structure, which closely surrounds the cord and nerves immediately
 after they have passed beneath the arch of the thorax. From the
sides of this structure there pass off backwards two pairs of vessels,
 that get beneath the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity and
 are distributed on the first pair of branchiae.         A small vessel also

                                    462
passes backwards beneath the cava, and, being joined by anasto
moses from the spinal artery, form the commencement of a vessel
which the author formerly described in the ' Medical Gazette' as the
subspinal vessel.     This vessel, extending along the under surface of
the nervous cord, communicates directly, by short vessels, with the
supra-spinal artery, and gives off, at certain distances from its under
surface, several large vessels, which unite with others that convey
the blood which has circulated through the abdominal segments, di
rectly to the branchiae, whence it is returned to the heart by many
minute vessels that originate from the posterior internal part of each
branchia, and, united into single trunks, pass around the sides of the
segments to the valvular openings on the dorsal surface of the heart.
In the tail of the Scorpion there is a direct vascular communication
between the caudal artery and the subspinal vein, which, from the
direction of the vessels, induces a belief that there is some peculi
arity in the circulation of the blood in this part of the body.        Be
sides these vessels, the author found an arterial trunk that originates
from the commencement of the aorta as it descends into the thorax.
This vessel passes backwards along the alimentary canal, to which
it is distributed, and gives off branches to the liver.
    This paper is accompanied by five drawings, illustrating the ana
tomical facts which are described in it.
    The Society then adjourned over the Easter Recess to meet again
on the 27th instant.
    In consequence of the lamented death of H. R.        H.   the Duke  of
Sussex, the Society did not resume their Meetings        till  the 11th of
May.

                                     463
    The author observes, that the structure of the blood-corpuscles
 can be accurately learned only by a careful investigation of their
 mode of origin, and by following them through all their changes in
 the capillary vessels, and especially in the capillary plexuses and di
 latations, where all their stages of transition from the colourless to
 the red corpuscles may be seen.         The filament which forms here
 and there in the corpuscles of coagulating blood he has shown to
 other persons, with Microscopes made by Ross and Powell.             Dr.
 Barry denies that he meant certain general remarks in his paper, re
 ferring to more than twenty delineations of corpuscles from various
 animals, to apply exclusively to those of man.

   James Tulloch, Esq., was balloted for, and duly elected into the

    1. The reading of     a paper,  entitled "Experiments on the Gas

                                   464
Voltaic Battery, with a view of ascertaining the rationale of its Ac
tion and on its application to Eudiometry."        By William Robert
Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c, was resumed and concluded.
   The author, referring to a paper published in the Philosophical
 Magazine for December 1842, giving an account of a voltaic bat
tery of which the active ingredients are gases, and by which the de
composition of water is effected by means of its composition, de
scribes several variations in the form of the apparatus recorded in
that paper. The experiments he has made with this new apparatus,
and the details of which occupy the greater part of the present
memoir, he conceives establish the conclusion that the phenomena
exhibited in the gaseous battery are in strict conformity with Fara
day's law of definite electrolysis.     They also confirm him in the
opinion  which   he had  expressed   in  his original paper, and which
had been controverted by Dr. Schoenbein, in a communication to
the Philosophical Magazine for March 1843, as well as by other
philosophers, namely, that the oxygen, in that battery, immediately
contributes to the production of the voltaic current.      Besides em
ploying as the active agents oxygen and hydrogen gases, he extends
his experiments to the following combinations : namely,
   Oxygen and peroxide of nitrogen ;
   Oxygen and protoxide of nitrogen ;
   Oxygen and olefiant gas ;
   Oxygen and carbonic oxide ;
   Oxygen and chlorine ;
   Chlorine and dilute sulphuric acid ;
   Chlorine and solutions of bromine and iodine in alternate tubes ;
   Chlorine and hydrogen ;
   Hydrogen and carbonic oxide ;
   Chlorine and olefiant gas ;
   Oxygen and binoxide of nitrogen ;
   Oxygen and nitrogen, with solution of sulphate of ammonia ;
   Carbonic acid and carbonic oxide, with oxalic acid as an electro
lyte;
   Hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphate of ammonia.
   The author concludes,     on reviewing the whole of this series of
experiments, that, with the exception, perhaps, of olefiant gas, which
appears to give rise to an extremely feeble current, chlorine and
oxygen, on the one hand, and hydrogen and carbonic oxide, on the
other, are the only gases which are decidedly capable of electro-
synthetically combining so as to produce a voltaic current.        He
thinks that the vapours of bromine and of iodine, were they less
soluble, would probably also be found efficient as electro-negative
gases.
   He proceeds to consider, in the remaining part of his paper, the
application of the gas battery to the purposes of eudiometry, founded
on the circumstance already mentioned, that nitrogen gas, as well
as several other gases, are absolutely without effect in as far as re
gards any alteration of their volume, and may therefore be ad
vantageously employed in the analysis of atmospheric air, or other

                                  465
mixed gases.    Several experiments of this nature are described, and
others suggested  for future trial. Various theoretical views, arising
from this train of inquiry, are then discussed ; particularly with re
ference to the contact theory, with which the author conceives that
the action of the gas battery is not reconcileable ; and also to the
source of the caloric evolved during voltaic action, which he is
strongly inclined to think is in the battery itself.
  2.   A paper was                     " Contributions to Terrestrial
                     also read, entitled
Magnetism."    No. IV.     By Lieut-Colonel Edward Sabine, It. A.,
F.R.S.
  In the  present number of these contributions, the author resumes
the consideration of Captain Sir Edward Belcher's magnetic obser
vations, of which the first portion, namely, that of the stations on
the north-west coast of America and its adjacent islands, was dis
cussed in No. 2.    The return to England of H.M.S. Sulphur by
the route of the Pacific Ocean, and her detention for some months in
the China Seas, have enabled Sir Edward Belcher to add magnetic
determinations at thirty-two stations to those at the twenty-nine
stations previously recorded.
   The author first describes the experiments which he instituted
with the different needles employed by Captain Sir Edward Belcher
for determining the coefficient to be employed in the formula for
the temperature corrections ; and takes this opportunity of noticing
the singular fact that, in needles made of a particular species of
Russian steel, this coefficient is negative ; that is, in these needles,
an increase of temperature increases the magnetic power.             M.
Adolphe Erman describes this particular kind of steel as consisting
of alternate very thin layers of soft iron and of steel, so that when
heated the soft iron layers increase their magnetic intensity and the
steel layers diminish theirs.
    He next considers the more important question of the steadiness
 with which the needles may have maintained their magnetic condi
tion. By intercomparison of the results obtained at various stations
 with the different needles employed, he assigns corrections to be
 applied to the determination of the magnetic force deduced from
 the observed times of vibration.    The magnetic force thus corrected,
 from the observations with each of the needles employed at the
 various stations visited by Sir Edward Belcher,     is then given in a
 general table of results. The observations of the inclination of the
 needle are given in another table and
                                     ;     a   third table contains the
 determination    of the declination and inclination  of the needle, the
 horizontal and total magnetic intensity deduced from the observa
 tions at thirty-two stations, of which the latitudes and longitudes
 are given in the same table, together with the dates of observation,

   1. "Meteorological Journal, from January to April inclusive,
 1843, kept at Guernsey."     By Samuel Elliott Hoskins, M.D. Com
 municated by Samuel Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
   2. " On the Respiration of the Leaves of Plants."       By William
 Haseldine Pepys, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author gives an account of a series of experiments on the
products of the respiration of plants, and more particularly of the
leaves ; selecting, with this view, specimens of plants which had
been previously habituated to respire constantly under an inclosure
of glass ; and employing, for that purpose, the apparatus which he
 had formerly used in experimenting on the combustion of the dia
mond, and consisting of two mercurial gasometers, with the addi
tion of two hemispheres of glass closely joined together at their
bases, so as to form an air-tight globular receptacle for the plant
subjected to experiment.
   The general conclusions he deduces from his numerous experi
ments conducted during several years, are, first, that in leaves which
are in a state of vigorous health, vegetation is always operating to
restore the surrounding atmospheric air to its natural condition, by
the absorption of carbonic acid and the disengagement of oxygenous
gas : that this action is promoted by the influence of light, but that
it continues to be exerted, although more slowly, even in the dark.
Secondly, that carbonic acid is never disengaged during the healthy
condition of the leaf. Thirdly, that the fluid so abundantly exhaled
by plants in their vegetation is pure water, and contains no trace of
carbonic acid. Fourthly, that the first portions of carbonic acid
gas contained in an artificial atmosphere, are taken up with more
avidity by plants than the remaining portions ; as if their appetite
for that pabulum had diminished by satiety.

 families and genera of Mollusca."
    The author here gives in detail the results of his inquiries into
 the combinations of the component elements of shell as they are
 met with in the several families and genera of the Mollusca ; and
 considers all these results as tending to establish the general propo
sition, that where a recognizable diversity presents itself in the ele
 mentary structure of the shell, in different groups, that diversity af
 fords characters which indicate the natural affinities of the several
genera included in those groups, and which may therefore be em
ployed with advantage in classification, and in the recognition and
 determination of fossils.

again on the 15th instant.

The     MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                 President, in the Chair.
    The following   papers were read, viz. —
    1.  "On the   supposed developement of the Animal Tissues from
Cells."    By James Stark, M.D., F.R.S.E. Communicated by James
F. W. Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    The author controverts the prevailing theory of the developement
of animal tissues from cells, and denies the accuracy of the micro
scopical observations on which that theory is founded, as regards the
anatomy of the adult as well as of the foetal tissues.   He asserts that
at no period of foetal life can rows of cells be discovered in the act
of transformation into muscular fibres : and he denies that these
fibres increase either in length or in thickness by the deposition of
new cells. He contends that the ultimate filaments of muscles, as
well as all the other tissues of the body, are formed from the fibri
nous portion of the blood, which is itself composed of globules that
are disposed to cohere together, either in a linear series, so as to
form a net-work of fine filaments, or in aggregated masses of a form

                                   468
more or less globular, composing what have been termed fibrinous
corpuscles. These corpuscles have been considered to be the nuclei
of cells ; but the author regards them as being merely accidental
fragments of broken down tissues, adhering to the filaments, and
noways concerned in their developement.         The more regularly dis
posed granules,   which  are observed  to  occupy the spaces intervening
between the filaments composing the ordinary cellular tissue, he
considers as being fatty matter deposited within these spaces.       He,
in like manner, regards the observations tending to show the cellular
origin of the fibrous, cartilaginous, and osseous tissues, as altogether
fallacious ; and maintains that the cells, which these animal textures
exhibit when viewed under the microscope, are simply spaces occur
ring in the more solid substance of these structures, like the cavities
 which exist in bread.     These views are pursued by the author in
discussing the formation of the skin, the blood-vessels, and the
nerves, and in controverting the theory of secretion, founded on the
action of the interior surfaces of the membranes constituting cells.
    2. " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism." — No. V. By Lieut.-
 Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., F.R.S.
     In this paper the author details and discusses the magnetic obser
 vations made on board Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror,
 between October 184-0 and April 1841, being the first summer which
 the expedition under the command of Captain James Clark Ross,
 R.N., passed within the Antarctic Circle.
     The elimination of the influence of the ship's iron in the calcula
 tion of the results of these observations occupies a considerable por
 tion of the paper.    Formulae for this purpose are derived from M.
 Poisson's fundamental equations, and the constants in the formulae
 are computed for each of the two ships, from observations made on
 board expressly with that object. With these constants, tables of
 double entry are formed for each of the three magnetic elements,
 namely, declination, inclination, and intensity, giving the required
 corrections of each, for all the localities of the voyage.
     These and other corrections being applied, the results are tabu
 lated and charts formed from them.         The full consideration of the
  charts is postponed until the whole of the materials collected by the
  Antarctic Expedition shall be before the Royal Society. Meanwhile
  the paper concludes with the following general remarks, viz.
      1. The observations of declination, particularly those which point
  out the course of the lines of 0 and of 10° east, indicate a more
  westerly position than the one assigned by M. Gauss in the ' Atlas
  des Erdmagnetismus,' for the spot in which all the lines of declina
  tion unite. The progression of the lines in the southern hemisphere
  generally, from secular change, is from east to west ; the difference
  consequently is in the direction in which a change should be found
  in comparing earlier with more recent determinations.
      2. The general form of the curves of higher inclination in the
  southern hemisphere is much more analogous to that in the northern
  than appears in M. Gauss's maps.       For example, the isoclinal line

                                    469
of — 85°, instead of being nearly circular, as represented in the     3te
Abtheilung of Plate XVI. of the ' Atlas des Erdmagnetismus,' is        an
elongated ellipse, much more nearly resembling in form and dimen
sions the ellipse of 85° of inclination in the northern hemisphere in
the same work, Plate XVI. 2te Abtheilung.         The analogy between
the two hemispheres in the characteristic feature of the elliptical
form of the higher isoclinal lines is the more important to notice, on
account of the particular relation which appears to subsist in the
northern hemisphere between the change in the geographical direc
tion of the greater axis of the ellipse, and the secular changes of the
inclination generally throughout the hemisphere. The present di
rection of the greater axis in the northern hemisphere, is nearly
N.N.W. and S.S.E., or that of a great circle passing through the
two foci of maximum intensity.         In the southern hemisphere, the
present direction of the greater axis differs little from E.S.E. and
W.N.W.
    3. Captain Ross's observations of the intensity do not appear to
indicate the existence anywhere in the southern hemisphere of a
higher intensity than would be expressed by 2-l of the arbitrary
scale.    In this respect also the analogy between the two hemi
spheres appears to be closer than is shown in M. Gauss's maps,
 Plate XVIII.      With respect to the direction of as much of the line
of highest intensity (2-0) as it has been possible to draw with any
degree of confidence from the observations now communicated, it
will be found to be in almost exact parallelism with the isodynamic

    3. " An Account of several new Instruments and Processes for
determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit," by Charles Wheat-
 stone, V.P.R.S., Professor of Experimental Philosophy in King's
 College, London, Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of
 Sciences at Paris, &c.
    The author proposes in the present communication to give an ac
 count of various instruments and processes which he has employed
 during several years past for the purpose of investigating the laws
 of electric currents. He states that the practical object for which
 these instruments were originally constructed, was to ascertain the
 most advantageous     conditions for the production of electric effects
 through   circuits of great extent, in order to determine the practica
 bility of communicating    signals by means of electric currents to more
 considerable distances than had hitherto been attempted. Their use,
 however, is not limited to this special object, but extends equally to
 all inquiries relating to the laws of electric currents and to every
 practical application of this wonderful agent.
    As the instruments and processes described by the author are all
 founded on Ohm's theory of the voltaic circuit, he commences with

                                      470
 a short account of the principal results to which this theory leads,
 and shows how the clear ideas of electromotive forces and resist
 ances, substituted for the vague notions of intensity and quantity
 which formerly prevailed, furnish us with satisfactory explanations
 of phenomena, the laws of which have hitherto been involved in ob
 scurity and doubt. According to Ohm's system, the force of the
 current is equal to the sum of the electromotive forces divided by
 the sum of the resistances in the circuit. The several electromotive
 forces and resistances which enter into the circuit of a voltaic battery
 are then defined ; and having frequent occasion to refer to the laws
 of the distribution of the electric current in the various parts of a
 circuit, when a branch conductor is placed so as to divert a portion
 of the current from a limited extent of that circuit, the author directs
 particular attention to these laws.         After recommending several
 new terms in order to express general propositions, without circum
 locution and with greater precision, the author states the method of
 obtaining the constants of a circuit employed by Fechner, Lenz,
 Pouillet, &c, and then proceeds to explain the new method he has
 himself adopted.     The principle of this method is the employment
 of variable instead of constant resistances, bringing, thereby, the
 currents in the circuits compared to equality, and inferring from the
 amount of the resistance measured out between two deviations of
 the needle, the electromotive forces and resistances of the circuit
 according to the particular conditions of the experiment ; a method
 which requires no knowledge of the forces corresponding to differ
 ent deviations of the needle. To apply this principle, it is requisite
to have a means of varying the interposed resistance, so that it may
be gradually changed      within any required limits. The author de
scribes two instruments for effecting this purpose ; one intended for
circuits in which the resistance is considerable, the other for circuits
in which it is small. The Rheostat (for thus the inventor names the
instrument under both its forms) may also be usefully employed as
a regulator of a voltaic current, in order to maintain for any required
length of time precisely the same degree of force, or to change it in
any required proportion ; its advantages in regulating electro-mag
netic engines and in the operations of voltatyping, electro-gilding, &c.
are pointed out.
    Various methods of measuring the separate resistances in the cir
cuit, particularly that of the rheomoter itself, are next described ;
and it is shown that the number of turns of the rheostat requisite
to reduce the needle of a galvanometer
                                                from one given degree to
another, is an accurate measure of the electromotive force of the
circuit. It is then proved
                              that similar voltaic elements of various mag
nitudes, conformably to theory, have the same electromotive force ;
                            force increases exactly in the same propor
that the electromotive
                       of  similar  elements arranged in series ; and that
tion as the number
                      for  decomposing     water is placed in a circuit, an
when an apparatus
                 force, opposed to that of the battery, is called into
electromotive
action, which is constant in its
                                     amount, whatever may be the number
                               battery consists. The electromotive forces
of elements of   which   the

                                    471
  of voltaic  elements formed of an amalgam of potassium with zinc,
  copper and platina, a solution of a salt of the negative metal being
  the interposed liquid, are given ; the last combination is one of great
  electromotive energy, and when a voltameter is interposed in the
  circuit, it decomposes abundantly the water contained in it. A still
  more energetic electromotive force is exhibited by a voltaic element,
 consisting of amalgam of potassium, sulphuric acid, and peroxide of
 lead.    The author then shows, that if three metals be taken in their
 electromotive order, the electromotive force of a voltaic combina
 tion formed of the two extreme metals is equal to the sum of the
 electromotive forces of the two elements formed of the adjacent
 metals.
     Among the instruments and processes described in the subsequent
 part of the memoir are the following.        1. An instrument for mea
 suring the resistance of liquids, by which the errors in all previous
 experiments are eliminated, particularly those resulting from neglect
 ing the contrary electromotive force arising from the decomposition
 of the liquid. 2. The differential resistance measurer, by means of
 which the resistances of bodies may be measured in the most accu
 rate manner, however the current employed may vary in its energy.
 3. An instrument for ascertaining readily what degree of the gal-
vanometric scale corresponds to half the intensity indicated by any
 other given degree.      4. A means of employing the same delicate
galvanometer to measure currents of every degree of energy, and
in all kinds of circuits.   5. Processes to determine the deviations of
the needle of a galvanometer corresponding to the degrees of force,
and the converse.
    4.  " On  the Organ of Hearing in Crustacea."      By Arthur Farre,
M.D., F.R.S.
    The author finds that in the Lobster (Astacus marinus), the organ
of hearing consists of a transparent and delicate vestibular sac, which
is contained in the base, or first joint of the small antennae ; its situa
tion being indicated externally by a slight dilatation of the joint at this
part, and also by the presence of a membrane covering an oval aper
ture, which is the fenestra ovalis. The inner surface of the sac gives
origin to a number of hollow processes, which are covered with
minute hairs and filled with granular matter, apparently nervous.
A delicate plexus of nerves, formed by the acoustic nerve, which is
a separate branch supplied from the supra-oesophageal        ganglion, is
distributed over the base of these processes and around the sac.
Within the sac there are always found a number of particles of sili
ceous sand, which are admitted, together with a portion of the sur
rounding water, through a valvular orifice at the mouth of the sac,
being there placed apparently for the express purpose of regulating
the size of the grains.    The author considers these siliceous parti
cles as performing the office of otolites, in the same way as the
stones taken into the stomachs of granivorous birds supply the office
of gastric teeth.     Several modifications of this structure exhibited
in the organs of hearing of the Astacus Jluviatilis, Pagurus streb-
                                                           B

                                    472
lonyx, and Palinurus quadricornis are next described, and an ex
planation attempted of the uses of the several parts and their sub
serviency to the purposes of that sense.
    The author concludes by a description of another organ situated
at the base of the large antennae, which it appears has been con
founded with the former by some anatomists, but which the author
conjectures may possibly constitute an organ of smell.        The paper
is accompanied by illustrative drawings.
    5.  " A statement of Experiments showing that Carbon and Ni
trogen    are compound bodies, and are made by Plants during their
growth." By Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author, finding that sprigs of succulent plants, such as mint,
placed in a bottle containing perfectly pure water, and having no
communication with the atmosphere except through the medium of
water, or mercury and water, in a few weeks grow to more than
double their size, with a proportionate increase of weight of all the
chemical elements which enter into their composition, is thence
disposed to infer that all plants make carbon and nitrogen ; and that
the quantity made by any plant varies with the circumstances in
which it is placed.
    6. " Physiological inferences derived from Human and Compara
tive Anatomy respecting the Origins of the Nerves, the Cerebellum,
and the Striated Bodies."      By Joseph Swan, Esq.      Communicated
by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author remarks that those parts of the nervous system which
are concerned in motion and in sensation exhibit a great similarity
in all vertebrate animals. To the first of these functions belong the
anterior and middle portions of the spinal cord and medulla oblon
gata, including the anterior pyramids, the crura cerebri, and some
fibres leading to the corpora striata and the convolutions, and also
the cerebellum.      To the function of sensation belong the posterior
surface of the spinal cord, the posterior and lateral portions of the
medulla oblongata, including the posterior pyramids, the ventricular
cords, and the fourth and third ventricles.
    From a general comparison of the relative magnitude and struc
ture of these several parts in the different classes of vertebrated
animals, the author infers that only a very small portion of the brain
is necessary for the origins of the nerves, their respective faculties
 being generally derived near the place at which they leave the brain.
 These origins are traced in various cases, where, from peculiarities
 of arrangement or of destination, they present certain remarkable
differences of situation.
    The author is led to consider the cerebellum as an appendage
 to the brain, rather than to the medulla oblongata and spinal
 nerves, for it does not correspond with either the number or the
 size of the sensitive or motor nerves ; and that it is not required
 for the intellect, for the special senses, for common sensation, or for
 volition, appears from its size bearing no proportion to the strength of

                                     473
  any of these faculties. Neither is it concerned in digestion or assi
 milation, nor does its size present any relation with the heart, the
 lungs, the muscles, the limbs, the vertebrae, the ribs, or any other
 organ, not even those of reproduction.        As, however, its nervous
 connexions are principally with those parts which are exclusively
 subservient to the will, it is probable that it is concerned in the
completion, and not in the commencement of the voluntary act.           It
 is probable, also, that the principal crossing of impulses from one
 side to the other takes place in the medulla oblongata and the motor
 tracts of the brain.    Some of the arrangements of its lobules may
 have reference to the paces and attitudes of different animals.     The
 will, acting through the cerebral convolutions, sets in action certain
 muscles placed in proper directions ; but the influence of the cere
 bellum is required for giving them steadiness amidst the alterna
tions from one set to another, and especially when a slight change
 disturbs the centre of gravity, and until the balance is effectually
restored by a subsequent act of the will operating on antagonist or
other muscles.      The cerebellum also constitutes an additional focus
of nervous influence, and may, therefore, cooperate with the brain
in increasing the vital powers, and imparting greater energy to the
various functions of the body.
    The author regards the corpus striatum as being a centre for con
veying to the mind the perception of the motions of the limbs and
of their different parts. He concludes with some remarks on the
double crossings of the tracts of the centres of the nerves of the
arms and legs, and the explanation given by these facts to various
pathological phenomena.
    7.   " Nouveaux faits a ajouter a la Theorie de la Chaleur et a celle
de   l'Evaporation." Par Daniel Parat, Medecin a Grenoble. Commu
nicated by the President.
    The author commences by explaining his conception of the nature
of heat, of which he gives the following definition : — " Mouvemens
centraux obsculaires de la cohesion devenus extemporantiment plus
rapides, et dilatant de plus en plus tous les corps par une augmenta
tion ainsi acquise de toutes les forces centrifuges."     He adopts the
theory that the evaporation of water in contact with air is a process
identical with chemical solution, and adduces as evidence supporting
his views various circumstances which are common both to evapora
tion and to the solution of a salt in water.
    8.   " On the nature and properties of Iodide of Potassium, and its
general applicability to the cure of Chronic Diseases." By James
Heygate, M.D., F.B..S.
    The author has been led by his experience to estimate highly the
medicinal properties of the iodide of potassium (which he prefers to
the tincture of iodine) in various diseases, and thinks that when it
is administered judiciously no deleterious effects are likely to arise
from its use.

          " Observations on the relation which   exists between the  Re-

                                 4,74
spiratory Organs of Animals, and the preservation of independent
Temperatures." By George Macilwain, Esq., Consulting Surgeon to
the Finsbury Dispensary.      Communicated by William Lawrence,
Esq., F.R.S.
   The author expresses his dissent from the prevailing opinion that
the temperature maintained by animals above the surrounding
medium is proportionate to the extent of their respiration ; and ad
duces many instances among different classes of animals in which he
can trace no such correspondence, and others, on the contrary,
where increased powers of respiration appear to diminish instead of
raising the animal temperature.     Hence the author is disposed to
regard respiration as a refrigerating rather than a heating process.
   The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again
on the 16th  of November next.
