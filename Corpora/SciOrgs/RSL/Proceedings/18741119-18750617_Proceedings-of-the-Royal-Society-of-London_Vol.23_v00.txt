       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
     Hugo vox     Mohl,    born   April  8, 1805, was the   fourth of five brothers,
  all of whom were men of note, either for public services or intellectual
  ability.   His father was some time Minister at Wurtemberg for Home
  Affairs and Worship, while his mother, a person of exceptional gifts, was
  the daughter of Autenrieth, Finance Minister in the same State.
     Von Mold's early education was obtained at the Gymnasium of his
 native town, Stuttgart.         In his nineteenth year (1823) he entered the
 University of Tubingen, where (in 1828) he graduated in medicine. In
  his inaugural    dissertation   (alluded to below) he clearly foreshadowed the
  course   in  science in which he was to preeminently excel. It was his
 fathers wish that he should devote himself to surgery.             This, however,
 was distasteful to him ; and the intercourse into which he was thrown
  during the next few years with Von Martius, Zuccarini, Steinheil, and
 other botanists, soon determined the direction of his pursuits.            In 1831
he contributed to the great work of Marti us on Palms a memoir on the
structure of the stems of those plants.            In this year he was nominated
        "
first adjunct
                   "
                     to  the  Botanic   Garden   of  St. Petersburg, a post which,
however, he did not accept, owing to his being appointed Professor of
Physiology at Bern, whither he went in 1832.                   After the death of
Schiibler he returned, in 1835, to Tubingen as Professor of Botany in the
University ; and here he remained, notwithstanding many brilliant pro
posals tempting him elsewhere, till the time of his death. The interests
of the University of Tubingen were matters about which he felt a keen
solicitude, and the foundation of a Faculty of Natural Science in that
University was essentially his work. In 1843 the Order of the Crown of
Wurtemberg was conferred on him and he was ennobled. About this time
he was obliged to make a prolonged stay in South Tyrol on account of
 delicate health.      He recovered ; but although a man of great stature and
robust build,     he  appears, after he had accomplished his sixtieth year, to
have fallen into chronic ill health.         He suffered from pleurisy and attacks
of diarrhoea. Eventually           he became   very reserved in manner and sub
ject to giddiness.        On the morning of Easter Monday, April 1, 1872,
having     been   cheerful    and well the night before, he was found dead
in bed.
     These particulars are derived from the memoir which appeared in the
'                          '
   Botanische Zeitung for 1872. Von Mohl was elected a Foreign Member
of the Royal Society, March 26, 1868.
     In  describing fully Von Mohl's scientific career and position, it would
be necessary to write the history of vegetable histology.               His work is
practically coincident with the application of the higher powers of the
 microscope to the investigation          of vegetable tissue. Confining himself
almost exclusively to        the  higher classes of plants, from the group of Mus-
cineae upwards (and neglecting the Algae, Fungi, and Lichens), there is
  hardly a point of any consequence in which some research or investigation
     TOIi. xxirr.                                                        a

                                     ii
  of Von MohPs is not the solid foundation of our present knowledge. The
  Catalogue of Scientific Papers of the Royal Society enumerate* 78 of
  his papers — not including various dissertations, some of which, along with
  a selection of the more important of his papers, were in 1845 collected and
  published in a quarto volume, under the title of "Vermischte Schriften."
  The list of his publications which accompanies the memoir in the
                         '
  '
    Botanische Zeitung gives the titles of no less than 90.     Nor were his
  own labours the only way in which he contributed to the advancement of
 our knowledge of the minute anatomy of plants. In 1843 he commenced,
 in conjunction with Schlechtendal, the ' Botanische Zeitung,' a small
  quarto weekly periodical of eight pages, occasionally illustrated with
 plates, which he continued to edit till the time of his death.           The
 volumes of this journal chronicle, year by year, the gradual development
 of the microscopic study of plants, a field in which (doubtless in no small
 degree owing to the example of Von Mohl) German science has reaped a
 more abundant harvest than that of other nations.        No one can fail to
 be struck with the thorough character of Von Mohl's scientific work. His
 energies were always ready to turn themselves to any part of his subject
 where facts seemed to need investigation, or the results of others to
 challenge reexamination or criticism.       His papers are, in their way,
models of " contributions to knowledge." Except when they are controver
 sial, they always commence with a careful history and estimate of the work
of previous investigators of the particular subject under consideration.
     Von Mohl's first publication in 1827 was a prize thesis on the structure
of cbmbing plants, in which he endeavoured to show that the stems have
a dull kind of irritability, so that they bend towards any object which
they touch.      This explanation has given place to a better knowledge of
 the phenomena ; but Mr. Darwin, to whom that service to science is
largely due, bears witness to the primd facit probability of Von Mohl's
view (Journ. Linn. Soc, Bot. vol. ix. p. 10). His inaugural dissertation in
 1828 (already alluded to) gave the first account of the true structure of
the dots or " pores
                       "
                          frequently met with in the walls of cells (' Ueber
die Poren des Pflanzenzellgewebes   ').   He showed that they were thinner
portions of the cell-membrane.
     In 1831 Von Mohl, as already mentioned, contributed to the 'Historia
Naturalis Palmarum of Von Martius an elaborate account in Latin of

the structure of the stems and roots of palms, under the title " De Struc-
tura Palmarum." This was republished in German in his Vermischte'
Schriften' in 1845, and was translated for the Ray Society in 1849 by
Prof. Henfrey. Von Mohl gave the final blow to the theory of the internal
growth of monocotyledonous stems first propounded      by  Desfontaines, and
upon which De Oandolle had founded the division of vascular plants into
Exogens and Endogens.           In this memoir he appears to have first
described the origin of ducts from rows of closed cells,    a point which he
further developed in the following year in paper, " Ueber den Bau der
                                            a
porosen GefSsse.

       In   1832 he also described the movements due to irritability in various
   species of Robinia.       In a paper on Lenticels he disproved the theory of
   De Gandolle that these structures were in any way dependent on the
   production of adventitious roots.          His memoir on the stems of Cycads
   appeared      also this year.
      In 1833 he worked out the anomalous structure of the stomata in the
  Proteaceje, which Robert Brown had regarded as imperforate and had
  described simply as
                            " glandulae  cutaneae."      He contributed to the ' Icones
                                                   '
  Plantarum        Cryptogamicarum      Brasiliae of Von Martius a description of
  the anatomy of the stem of tree ferns.                 Hitherto the course of their
  vascular      bundles  had  been  supposed    to   be  very similar to that of Mono
  cotyledons.        Von Mohl was the first to explain the structure of the hollow
  fenestrated cylinder into which the bundles are combined, and subsequent
 observers       have added little to his account.            In a memoir published in
        ' Flora ' he described the                      of
 the                                  development           the spores in various of the
 higher Cryptogams.           He gave the first accurate account of the develop
 ment of       the  moss-capsule, pointed out the development of the spores in
 fours in one mother-cell, explained the development of the elaters of
 Jungermannise, and gave a correct account of those of Equisetum.
     In 1834      he published an elaborate paper on pollen, in which he detailed
 an immense number of observations.                   It is true he fell into error in
 regarding the external coat as in some cases itself cellular.              On the other
 hand, he was able to correct         Robert Brown, who, in describing the pecu
 liar movements (which have been called after him) in the granules of the
 fovilla of pollen, attributed to the granules at the same, time a change of
 form. Von Mohl also established the development of the pollen-grains
-in fours within each mother-cell, thus indicating an analogy with the
 development of spores in Cryptogams.
    The publication by Von Mohl in 1835 of his discovery of the multiplica
 tion of cells by division (' Ueber die Vermehrung der Pflanzenzellen durch
 Theilung') in Cladophora glomerata has been the starting-point of all
 subsequent investigations into the development of the tissues and organs
 of plants.        It revealed, in fact, the precise mode by which vegetative
 growth is accomplished.          Mirbel, in his memoir on the development of
 Marehantia, communicated to the Academie des Sciences in 1831 and
 1832, but not published till 1836, had described the formation of pollen-
 grains by the quadripartite          division of a mother-cell.         This, however,
 though      an  extremely  important    observation,     is not  a case of growth, pro
 perly speaking, and does not affect Mohl's historical position in the matter.
 In 1838 Schleiden announced the multiplication of cells by the formation
 of new cells in their interior as a general law in the vegetable kingdom.
 Be was supported by Nageli. The views of Von Mohl, developed as they
 were by        Meyen and Unger, eventually established themselves. In a
 paper     on the structure of cork and bark, Von Mohl described the nature
 of the    tissues which enter into their composition, and accounted for the
                                                                           a 2

 diversity of their character in different plants, especially the enfoliation,
 of layers of bark in such trees as the Plane.
    The following year (1836) Von Mohl developed his theory of an inter
 cellular substance    in which the cells of tissues were held to  be imbedded.
 This supposed cement is now known to belong to the cell-walls them
selves, and not to be a substance independent of them.             Mohl indeed,
later in life, practically withdrew his views upon the matter (' Die vege-
tabilische Zelle,' 1850).     He also, in 1836, gave an account of the singular
 caudex of Tamus (Testudinaria) elephantipes.
    In 1837 Von Mohl published the results of his investigations with
regard to chlorophyl.       They still remain essentially undisturbed.       He
 showed that chlorophyl-granules were soft and homogeneous bodies, and
not vesicular, as had been supposed ; he detected in them the presence
 of starch. Nageli having asserted that chlorophyl-granules            possess a
 cellulose investment, Von Mohl returned to the subject in 1855, and
 showed that this view was untenable.         During 1837 he also published a
 dissertation on the structure of vegetable membrane, in which he declared
 " secondary cell-membranes to      possess a fibrous  structure."    The objec
  tive fact observed by Von Mohl is one of very general truth, although a
 rather different set of considerations are now brought to its explana
 tion.    His paper on the porous cells of Sphagnum finally put to rest the
 controversy as to their nature.       He contributed an examination of some
 abnormal     cones to the difficult question of the floral morphology of
 ConifersB.    In his observations on the sporangium in the vascular Crypto
 gams he established      the real nature of this structure in ferns.     In the
 case   of Selaginella, Bischoff's view, that the sporangium is an axillary
 bud, was abandoned by Hofmeister for the explanation given by Von
 Mohl.
     In 1838 he published the first account of the development of stomata,
 which he observed in Hyacinihus orientalis. He also corrected the account
 which Mirbel had given of the origin of the stomata of Marchnitia. His
 dissertation, ' Ueber den Einfluss des Bodens auf die Vertheilung der
 Alpenpflanzen,' has served as a basis for the more extended investigations
 of Alphonse De Candolle on the same subject.
     In 1839 he discussed the structure of annular vessels, contending
 against Schleiden that they were not a derivative form of spiral vessels. In
 his ' Die vegetabilische Zelle ' he maintained a similar view with regard
 to reticulated and other vessels.      He published some important observa
 tions on the development of the spores of Anthoeeros.
     In 1840 he described the peculiar phenomena of the growth of Isoetea;
 and, as Hofmeister has remarked (' On the Higher Cryptogams,' p. 337),
  "since Von Mohl's discoveries the special attention of botanists has been
  almost constantly directed to this interesting family."
      In 1842 he published remarks on the structure of dotted ducts. In
   this he gave the first explanation of the structure of bordered pores.      In
  the corrected form given to it by Schacht (1859) this is probably           the

                                      V
final account of the matter.  In the same year he published his investi
gations on the cuticle of plants, which he demonstrated to be organi
cally derived from the epidermic cells. He further supported this view
in papers published in 1847 and 1849.
     Von Mohl's researches in 1843 ('Ueber deu Milchsaft uud    S3ine   Bewe-
gung ') demolished Schultz's analogy of latex to blood.   They were pub
lished in the ' Botanische Zeitung,' which was started in this year.
   In 1844 Von Mohl maintained, against the theory of Dupetit-Thouars,
the dependence of the growth of Dicotyledons on the physiological activity
of leaves.  The same year he published his remarks on the structure
of the vegetable cell, which for a long time immensely influenced the
course of vegetable histology.   He regarded the cell-wall as generally
composed  of a primary  external imperforate membrane, and a secondary
one usually perforated with apertures.     This he supposed to be lined
by a  third membrane, " Primordialschlauch,"  the primordial utricle of
English writers.
                 " This membrane forms a perfectly closed, cell-like, thin-
walled vesicle, which in the fresh plant is closely applied    to the inner
wall of the cell, and therefore escapes observation ; while    in specimens
which have been preserved in spirit it is contracted, and      more or less
detached from the wall of the cell."
  In 1845 Von Mohl published a memoir on the Flora of         Wurtemberg.
It is interesting to find a great physiological botanist engaged in work of
this kind, which it is rather the fashion at present to depreciate. Von
Mohl enters at some length into the causes which influence the local dis
tribution of plants ; and it is in regard to points of this kind that he
attaches scientific importance to local floras.  An examination of a mon
strous state of  Poa alpina led him to  the  now generally received opinion
that the lower floral glume of grasses is not a perigonial leaf but a bract.
To the same year belongs a paper on the penetration          of cuticle into
stomata.
   Von Mohl's paper, " Ueber die Saftbewegungen im Inneren der Zellen,"
published in 1846 (Bot. Zeit. p. 73), has been the starting-point of all
modern views about the vegetable cell.      He first described accurately the
"
  opaque viscid fluid of a white colour, having granules intermingled with
it,which fluid call protoplasm." He observed the vacuolization of the pro
              I
toplasm until    forms
                it      a  mere network.    He described the motion which
takes place in the filament of the network,
                                              " or perhaps now first becomes
visible," and he measured its rate. Schleiden gave the theory its finishing
touch in the third edition of his Principles (1849), by identifying Mohl's
                                '           '
primordial utricle and circulating fluid.
   In 1847 Von Mohl confirmed the researches of Amici (for whom he
had   ahigh regard) on the impregnation of Orchideae, which, in his judg
ment, made an end of Schleiden's theory as to the origin of the embryo
in Phanerogams, although the controversy was carried on for some time
longer by Hofmeister, Tulasne, Schacht, and Radlkofer.          He also pub
lished an elaborate memoir, which has been translated into both French

                                         vi
and English, in which he discusses against Mulder the value of the com
 bined action of sulphuric acid and iodine as a colour-test for cellulose, his
 object being to insist on that substance being regarded as the basis of all
 vegetable   membrane.
    In  1850 he experimented with Hoffman on the function of vessels, but
  with contradictory results.     .
    He pointed out in 1851 that the formation of chlorophyl is in intimate
 relation with protoplasm, portions of which        it tinges in making its first
 appearance.
    In 1852 he published a short paper on the grape-mildew.
    In 1855 his researches on the structure of " liber brought out some
                                                             "
 entirely new facts.    He had already been the first (in 1836) to examine
 bast- cells with care.  He pointed out that bast-cells were far from being
 so exclusive a constituent   of the liber as had been supposed, and that they
                                                                  "
 were often accompanied, or even entirely replaced, by the Gitterzellen."
 His study of the causes of the opening and closing of stomata in 1856
 was the first systematic examination which the question had received.
 It cleared up the apparent contradiction of the results obtained by Sir
 Joseph Banks on the one hand, and Moldenhawer on the other.
    In 1857 Von Mohl discovered the extremely curious fact that the
  substance known as " gum tragacanth
                                               "
                                                  is produced by the altera
 tion of the cells of the pith and medullary rays of various species of
 Astragalus.
    Passing over contributions of minor importance, Von Mohl published
 in 1870 a short discussion of the passages in the writings of Linnaeus
 which have been held to indicate a foreshadowing in his mind of the theory
 of descent.
    The last paper which appeared in Von Mohl's lifetime was on an
extremely suggestive subject, the morphology of the foliar organs of the
umbrella-pine of Japan (Sciadopitys).        The microscopic structure of these
 organs led him to compare       them    to two consolidated leaves with the
organic underside turned uppermost.          They therefore suggested an ana
logy   with  the  squama fructifercc   of  Coniferae   generally, upon the true
nature of which they have therefore been held to throw an important
light.
    In  1850 Von Mohl published a small work with the title " Die vege-
tabilische Zelle," which weaves the results of a great deal of what he had
written in scattered memoirs into a continuous whole. It was translated
into English by Prof. Henfrey in 1852.
'   Von Mohl felt the greatest interest in improving        the means of histo
logical and anatomical research, and wrote several papers on the con
struction and use of optical instruments, and in 1846 published a book
on micrography.
    Dr. B/OBebt Edmond Gbant was the seventh son of Alexander Grant,
Esq., Writer to the Signet. He was born in his father's house in Argyle

  Square,   Edinburgh,   on the 11th of November,       1793.    His mother's
 maiden    name was   Jane Edmond.     It  appears, from a memorandum in
 Dr. Grant's handwriting, that he was sent from home to be nursed, and
 saw little of either of his parents during his infancy and childhood.    He
 had eight brothers and three sisters, all  of whom died before him ; and
 as  none of them     left any children, Dr. Grant was the last survivor
of his family.
    When about ten years old he was placed at the High School of Edin
 burgh, where he continued for five years, under the tuition, successively,
 of Mr. Christison (afterwards Professor in the University), Dr. Carson,
 and Dr. Adam, the Rector, author of the well-known work on Roman
Antiquities. Hi 1808 his father died ; and in November of that year Dr.
 Grant became a student in the University of Edinburgh, attending the
junior classes of Latin and Greek.          In the following November he
entered     on his curriculum of medical study, and during its course
attended the several classes in the Faculty of Medicine under the Pro
fessors of that day.      He also studied Natural History under Professor
Jameson, and attended the lectures of some of the extra-academical
teachers.     After completing his course of medical study, he in 1814 took
his Degree of Doctor of Medicine, and published his inaugural disser
tation, " De Sanguinis Circuitu."
    In the mean time he had obtained (in May 1814) the Diploma of the
College of Surgeons.       In November of the same year he was elected one
of the Presidents of the Medical Society of Edinburgh, a place justly
regarded as an honourable object of ambition among the young aspirants
in the Medical School.
    Rather more than a year after taking his degree Dr. Grant went to the
Continent, where he spent upwards of four years. During this time he
visited various places of interest in France, Italy, and Germany, and made
a pedestrian tour in Hungary ; but his principal stay was in Paris, Rome,
Leipsic, Dresden, Vienna, and Munich, on account, no doubt, of the varied
opportunities for scientific study and general culture afforded by these
foreign seats of science, art, and learning.     He returned to Edinburgh in
the summer      of 1820,  and took up his residence in his native city. At a
later time he became a Fellow of the Edinburgh College of Physicians ;
 but he seems not to have engaged in medical practice —his career had
taken another direction.       He had early imbibed a taste for Comparative
 Anatomy and Zoology, and now devoted himself assiduously to the pro
 secution of those branches of science, both by continued systematic study
 and by original research.      The study of the invertebrate animals was
 peculiarly attractive ; and at this time Dr. Grant published various
 interesting anatomical and physiological observations on mollusks and
 zoophytes ; and his name will always be associated with the advances of
 our knowledge concerning the structure and economy of sponges, to the
 investigation of which Dr. Grant at this time enthusiastically applied him
 self.    The pools left by the retiring tide on the shores of the Firth of

                                              viii
  Forth afforded favourable opportunities for observation ; and he would
  spend hours patiently watching the phenomena exhibited by these humble
  organisms in their native element.
     Dr. Grant remained in Edinburgh till 1827, and in the mean time com
                                                                           '

  which he became an active member.                 He was also (in 1824) elected a
  Fellow    of the  Royal    Society  of Edinburgh.
     In June 1827 Dr. Grant was elected Professor of Comparative Anatomy
  and Zoology in the newly founded University of London, afterwards
  University College.         He was not altogether new to the work of teaching.
  He had some early, though brief, experience in Edinburgh, in 1824, when
  Dr. Barclay, who for some years had delivered lectures on Comparative
  Anatomy during the Summer Session, entrusted him with the part of the
  course which related to the anatomy of invertebrated animals. He entered
  on his duties in London in 1828, and in October of that year delivered his
 inaugural lecture, which was published at the time and went through two
  editions.     In this office he continued up to the time of his death, during
 which long period of forty-six academical years he never omitted a single
 lecture. This was a point on which he justly prided himself. Up to the last
 Session (1873-74) he continued to give five lectures a week ; but, sensible
 of failing strength, he proposed to reduce the number to three in the next
 Session (which he was not destined to see).              The number of pupils in his
 class fluctuated      a good deal, but was never large, attendance          not being
 compulsory in the Medical Curriculum prescribed by the Licensing Cor
 porations.       In one Session the number was fifty-six, but usually it was
 between thirty and forty, and sometimes much less.
    After he had thus laboured for more than twenty years, the Council of
 the College added to the small return he received for his services an
 annual stipend of £100, which was continued during the rest -of his
 incumbency.        About the same time a number of his friends, in present
 ing   him  with   a  microscope in testimony of their esteem, purchased for
 him a Government Annuity of £50.                  Afterwards he succeeded to some
 property    left  by  his  brother  Francis,   an  officer in the Madras Army, who
 died in 1852; so that in his latter years he found himself in easy circum
stances.
    His leading pupils were much attached to him, and he was sincerely
esteemed and respected by all.               His style of lecturing was clear and
impressive, with a ready and copious flow of language.                Without mean
ing   to  speak    of  his  mode   of  treating his subject, we may nevertheless
remark that on one great biological question (the origin of species) he
was from the first an evolutionist, and on the promulgation of the Dar
winian hypothesis          of natural selection     he became     one of its warmest
adherents.
    In 1833 Dr. Grant delivered a gratuitous course of forty lectures on
the structure and classification of animals to the members of the Zoolo

                                         ix
 gical Society.     In 1837 he was appointed Fullerian Professor of Phy
 siology in the Royal Institution, which office he held for the usual period
 of three years.      At a later time he was appointed by the Trustees of
 the British Museum to the Swiney Lectureship on Geology, the tenure
of which is limited to five years. In 1841 he delivered the Annual Ora
tion before the British Medical Association.          In 1836 he was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society of London.           He was also a Fellow of the
Linnean, Zoological, and Geological Societies.
    Dr. Grant's vacations were spent sometimes in Scotland, but chiefly
abroad,    in France, Germany, Belgium, and Holland. On more than one
of these occasions he was accompanied by an intelligent and favourite
Hindoo pupil, Dr. C'huckerbutty, who afterwards became a Professor in
the   Government Medical College of Calcutta.          Dr. Grant seems to have
had a special    liking  to Holland,  which   he visited  and revisited several
times   — partly, no doubt, on account of its scientific institutions and
zoological museums, but largely also for the sake of acquiring the Dutch
language.      In like manner be afterwards spent his vacation in Copen
hagen,    and  worked   hard at Danish.    Indeed it is to be noted that he had
a great taste for the study of languages, both practical and philological,
and spoke the principal European tongues fluently.
    Dr. Grant's lectures were reported in the early Numbers of the 'Lancet'
(1833-34), and heafterwards published a treatise on Comparative Anatomy
which embodied the substance of them.           The work came out in parts,
but was not completed.         He   was  also  author   of the article " Animal
             "            '
 Kingdom in Todd's Cyclopaedia of Anatomy.' The titles and dates of
his communications to periodical works are given in the Royal Society's
 '
   Catalogue of Scientific Papers.'     They are 35 in number, and extend
from 1825 to 1839.
    Dr. Grant was     a devoted lover of music, and attendance at operas and
concerts was one of his chief enjoyments in his latter years.
    In August 1874 Dr. Grant suffered from a dysenteric attack, for which
 at first he would have no medical advice ; and although subsequently, by
appropriate treatment, the virulence of the disease was subdued, his
strength was exhausted, and he died on the 23rd of that month at his
house close by Euston Square.        He was buried in Highgate Cemetery,
attended to the grave by a few old friends and attached pupils, among
whom was his friend and former companion in travel, Dr. Chuckerbutty,
who was then in England, and two months later was destined to follow
his venerated master.
    Dr. Grant was never married.        He knew of no surviving relatives.
Three of his brothers, whose deaths he has recorded, were military officers.
Of these, James, a lieutenant in the German Legion, fell at the siege of
Badajoz in 1811 ; Alexander, captain in the Madras Engineers, died in
the Burmese war in 1825 ; and Francis, captain in the Madras Army, as
already mentioned, died at Edinburgh in 1852.
    By his will Dr. Grant bequeathed the whole of his property, including
 vol. urn.                                                            >,

       Sir John Rennie, C.E., past President of the Institution of Civil Engi
    neers, was born August 30, 1794. He first assisted his father, the late
    John Rennie, in building both Southwark and Waterloo bridges.            After
    the death of his father     in  1821  he succeeded him as Engineer to the
    Admiralty, a post he held for ten years. Among his more important
    works are London Bridge (for which he received the honour of knight
    hood), Sheerness Dockyard,        the completion of Ramsgate Harbour and
    Plymouth     Breakwater   (commenced by his father), the Earl of Lonsdale's
    Docks at Whitehaven, a portion of those at Cardiff, and the carrying out
    for a number of years of the great system of drainage and land reclama
    tion in the Lincolnshire fens, also works at Newry and Dundalk. He was
    the author of a noble work on Harbours, of which Her Majesty was
   graciously pleased to accept the dedication, and for which he received
    tokens of honour from their Imperial Majesties the Emperors of Russia
   and Austria ; also of a monograph on Plymouth Breakwater, and a small
«• History of Engineering in the form of a Presidential Address to the In
   stitution of Civil Engineers.         In conjunction with his late brother,
   G. Rennie, he contributed to introduce the screw-propeller into the navy,
   and erected the machinery for the mints of Calcutta, Bombay, and Mexico ;
   they also erected the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard at Plymouth ;
   and Sir John Rennie was the first to perceive the uses of the diving-
   bell in engineering works.       Sir John Rennie was admittedly the highest
   anthority on all subjects connected with hydraulic engineering, harbours,
   drainage, canals, irrigation, the storage of water, and the management of
   rivers ; and his pamphlets on the drainage of Lombardy having at
   tracted notice, the Italian Premier, Signor Sella, advised His Majesty
   the King of Italy to confer upon him the Order of St. Maurice and
   St. Lazare.      Sir John long possessed a wide reputation on the Con
  tinent, as may be gathered not only from the above remarks, but from
  the fact that he constructed the harbour of Ponte Delgada in the Azores,
  that he was a Knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal, of the Wasa
  of Sweden, and was also a Member of the Academy of Sciences of Stock
  holm and of the Austrian Society of Civil Engineers.              Sir John was,
  further, well versed in general science and literature ; and besides belong
  ing to most of the scientific and learned societies in the metropolis, he
  was long an active Member of the Boyal Society and the Meteorological
  Committee and one of the Council, and was also Chairman of the Juries
  at the Exhibition, 1862.         Of late years, owing to age and increasing
  infirmities, he retired almost entirely from active life and public notice,
  and finally died, September 3, 1874.          His kindness of heart won him
  many friends, who will greatly regret his loss.

                                         xi
    Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet was born at Ghent on the
22nd of February, 1796.        He had the misfortune of losing his father at
the early age of seven ; and the poverty of his family obliged him to seek
his  own livelihood   at once on leaving the Lycee. He obtained an appoint
ment as teacher of mathematics, drawing, grammar, &c. in a school at
Oudenarde.       At the end of a year he returned to Ghent ; and in February
1S15, the very day on which he completed his nineteenth year, he was
appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at the New College, which had
replaced   the Lycee.     This appointment was not a brilliant one ; but with
the private lessons which he had the opportunity of giving, it afforded
him a subsistence, and he had the satisfaction of feeling himself inde
pendent.        He had even some leisure to devote to science, his flute,
drawing, and to literary composition.           About this time he, in conjunc
tion with his intimate friend and former schoolfellow Dandelin, wrote
     opera, entitled
                        " Jean Second ou Charles
an                                                      Quint dans les murs de
GandV which was favourably spoken of.             Dandelin soon afterwards left
Ghent ; and Garnier, who had become Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Ghent, persuaded Quetelet to return to science.                He
studied the higher mathematics under Garnier, and at the same              time
assisted   the latter by giving  some   of his lectures.
    In 1819 he took the degree of Doctor of Science, the first conferred
in that     University.     On this occasion he gave a brilliant inaugural
address,    in which he made known his discovery of a new curve of the
third degree.
                                       "
    This discovery    of the " focale     was much noticed in the ' Annates
              '             '
 Belgiques and in the Mercure Beige,' and was spoken of by Garnier
 and Raoul as a great honour to the newly founded university.
    At the beginning of August, M. Falck, Minister of Public Instruction,
 came to Ghent, and was present at the laying of the first stone of the
 New University Buildings.        Quetelet was on this occasion presented to
 M. Falck, and the strong recommendation of him by two such men as
 Garnier and Eaoul led to his appointment shortly afterwards to a Pro
 fessorship of Elementary Mathematics at the Athenieum of Brussels.
     This appointment was made in the beginning of October ; and by a
 private arrangement Quetelet engaged to give one quarter of his salary
 to his aged predecessor,     M. Delhaye,   as a retiring pension.
     In Brussels Quetelet soon became intimate with the French refugees,
 David, Arnault, &c., besides frequenting the society of artists and literary
 men, and the theatres, where Talma, Mademoiselle Mars, &c. gave a
  series of performances    each year.
     At this period he composed various verses, and published, in the
    Annales Belgiques,' in the year 1825, an " Essai sur la Romance."
  '
      On the 24th of February Quetelet was made a Member of the Royal
  Belgian Academy of Science, receiving the diploma from Van Ilulthem.
      The first memoir he presented to the Academy, after his reception,
   vot„ xxm.                                   .                      c

                                       xii
 was on the 14th of October, 1820, and was entitled        " Memoire sur une
 Formule Generale pour determiner la surface d'un polygone forme sur
une sphere par des arcs de grands ou de petits cercles, disposes entre
eux d'une maniere quelconque."
    The following are the titles of other papers, also read in the Academy,
between December 1820 and February 1826 : —
    " Sur les Conchoi'des Circulaires." Note to " Memoire sur les Caus-
tiques."
             " Memoire sur une nouvelle maniere de considerer les Caus
tiques, produites soit par Reflexion, soit par Refraction."
                                                                     " Resume
d'une nouvelle Théorie     des Caustiques,   suivi de differentes  applications
h la theorie des projections stcreographiques."      "Demonstration et deve-
loppements de la théorie des Caustiques secondaires."
    Quetelet's researches, already noticed by Gergonne and other distin
guished geometricians, were particularly remarked on by Chasles, after
                                                      '
the ' Correspondance Mathematique et Physique had given them greater
publicity.
    Two other memoirs by Quetelet, inserted in the collection of the
Academy, still remain to be noticed — the
                                                 " Memoire sur quelques con
structions graphiques des orbites planctaires" and the "Memoire sur
differents sujets de Geometric    a trois dimensions."
         '
   The     Correspondance Mathematique et Physique,' already mentioned,
was commenced by Garnier and Quetelet early in the year 1825.               Its
contributors    were dispersed   after   1830, and    it came   to an end    in
1839.
   In  1822 Quetelet went, at the request of the Academy, with M.
Kickx to explore the celebrated grotto known as the Trou de Han, and
they drew up a report with plates.
   In 1824 it was proposed that Quetelet should extend his teaching at
the Athenaeum, so as to include Elementary Physics, Natural History,
and Chemistry.       About the same time M. Thiry, Professor of the Higher
Mathematics,     resigned his post; and during the session 1824 and 1825
we find Quetelet teaching at the Athenfeum the Descriptive Geometry
of Monge, the Theory of Shadows and Perspective, and the Calculus of
Probabilities of Lacroix. He also gave public lectures at the Museum on
Experimental Physics and on the Elements of Astronomy, which he had
substituted for Natural History and Chemistry.            He had two classes,
which   he  conducted  simultaneously   in adjoining rooms, passing from one
to another, and perfect order is said to have reigned in each. His teaching
is described as simple and natural : his arithmetical instruction was
founded on a few general principles ; and as soon as his pupils were ini
tiated into algebraic notation and its first rules, he showed them how
this admirable instrument could be made to solve ordinary problems.
His talent for drawing was evident in his manner of tracing his geome
trical figures.
   His courses of Physics and Astronomy at the Museum attracted large

                                       xiii
audiences   of all classes of society. He had a true gift for exposition,
and could with very simple apparatus make himself clearly understood.
In fact he objected to complicated instruments, and said of them that
they often serve only to distract the attention from the results which it
is the object of the lesson to explain.
    Quetelet composed several elementary works for his public courses of
instruction. The first in date, " On Elementary Astronomy," appeared in
                          '
1S26 at Paris, in the Bibliotheque Industrielle de Malher,' and was fre
quently reprinted in France and Belgium, and translated into several lan
guages.     In 1827 he published a much more complete work, his ' Astro
nomic Populaire.'      This latter was shortly followed by ' Les Positions de
                                                    '
Physique,' which is considered superior to the Astronomie.'          He endea
voured subsequently, in a little volume entitled      " De la Chaleur," to put
into practice bis idea of founding instruction in Elementary Physics on
experiments within reach of all. His intention was to follow this up
by similar    treatises on Magnetism, Electricity, and Light.         Quetelet
                                               '
wrote the chapter on Acoustics in the Physique,' contributed by M.
Plateau to the ' Encyclopedic Populaire.'        Finally, he published in 1828
'Instructions Populaires sur le Calcul des Probabilites,' which was a
 rimme of the lessons he had been giving for several years at Brussels.
    His public courses of lectures had been more and more successful
ever since 1824.      The government now deemed it advisable to organize
 other lectures of the same kind ; and towards the end of 1826 the Admi
 nistrator General Van Ewyck requested of Quetelet, on the king's
 behalf,  a report on the matter, and on the 17th December the Museum
 of Science and Literature was established by a royal decree at Brussels.
 Quetelet was chosen for the Chair of Physics and Astronomy ; but as he
 already gave courses of lectures on these subjects in his capacity of
 Professor at the Athenceum, he obtained leave to give a course on the
 History of Science at the Museum.           He did not, however, long con
 tinue to give   this course, as he  left the Athenaeum at the beginning of
 the year 1828, when he transferred     his courses of Physics and Astronomy,
 which he had been giving at the latter institution, to the programme of
 the Museum, and these he continued to give until the close of the session
  1833  and 1834.
     The usefulness   of the Museum was much diminished by the Revolution
 of 1830 ; and after languishing for a few years that institution was finally
 absorbed in 1834 by the Free University.            A proposal was made to
  Quetelet to join the Free University ; but this he declined, stating that
  he considered such an appointment to be inconsistent with his duties at
  the Observatory, to which he had been appointed on condition of not
  taking any other.     He proposed, however, to continue his courses at the
  Observatory, those of Physics and Meteorology during the winter, and
  that of Astronomy during the summer evenings.             This proposal was
  not acceded to ; and Quetelet for a short time gave up public teaching, in

                                       xiv
  whioh he had already been engaged for twenty years.               He, however,
  soon entered on it again, for, by a royal decree, Jan. 6, 1836, he was
  appointed Professor of Astronomy and Geodesy at the Ecole Militaire.
  During this time he paid much attention to falling stars, and gave a
  method for determining the height of aerolites, by making simultaneous
  observations from different points.     He also made experiments on the
  declination and inclination of the needle.
     Quetelet had very earnest views on the subject of education, and he
 had twice occasion to make them publicly known — once under the Govern
 ment of the Low Countries, once after the Revolution of 1830.
     In the Commission instituted by King William in 1828, he was one
 of the small minority who wished to emancipate public instruction. He
 demanded a reduction of the number of Universities, and the establish
 ment of two Polytechnic Schools —one for the northern provinces of the
 kingdom, the other for the southern provinces.          Finally, he maintained
 that the time had come for substituting the use of modern languages          for
 that of Latin, still in use.
     Between 1823 and 1832 Quetelet was much occupied with Statistics ;
 and the papers he published on this subject have perhaps contributed
 more than any others to popularize his name.
     The first memoir was read to the Academy, and entitled " Memoire
 sur la loi des naissances et de la mortalite a Bruxelles."
     The second, also read to the Academy, " Recherches sur la population,
 les naissances, les deces, les prisons, les depots de mendicite, &c. dans
le Royaume des Pays-Bas."
     A third, also read to the Academy,      " Recherches
                                                             Statistiques sur  le
Royaume      des  Pays-Bas."
     No new memoir appeared in 1830        ; but during the years 1831 and
 1832 he devoted most of his time to Statistics, and published the fol
lowing five memoirs on the subject : —
     " Recherches sur la loi de croissance de l'homme." "
                                                                 Recherches sur
 le penchant au crime aux differents ages." " Recherches sur le poids         de
l'homme aux differents ages." " Recherches sur la reproduction et              la
mortahte," conjointly with M. Smits.       " La
                                                  Statistique des Tribunaux   de
la Belgique pendant les annees 1826 ii 1831."
    In the memoir " Sur le penchant au crime," Quetelet worked out some
of the ideas already made known by "Les Recherches Statistiques surle
Royaume des Pays-Bas."
    He passed in review the different causes tending either to develop or
to lesson the disposition to crime, and denied that instruction in reading
and writing had the purely beneficial influence usually ascribed to it.
    In enumerating his works we must not omit two other papers :—
    " De l'influence des saisons sur les facultes
                                                   de l'homme," and " Sur la
possibilite de mesurer l'influence des causes qui modifient les Elements
Sociaux."

   Quetelet had been deputed by Government to attend the Meeting of
the British Association for the Advancement         of Science which was to
be held at Cambridge, beginning on the 25th of June, 1833.          He went
by Paris, where he read at the Institute his memoir on Mortality.
   At Cambridge     he took a warm interest     in the establishment of the
Statistical Section, of which Malthus, Babbage, and other savants became
members.
   In London he was summoned before an Inquiry Commission              insti
tuted by    Parliament, to furnish information on the mode of keeping
the  Civil Registers of Belgium, and on the Census of the 1st of Januarv,
1830.
   Quetelet was one of the most active members of the Academy of
Sciences at Brussels, and was always very desirous of promoting its inde
pendence.     In  1834 he was appointed Permanent Secretary.
   In  1835 he brought out an ' Annuaire de l'Acadcmie.'          About this
time  also he wrote for the British Association a paper of great interest,
entitled " Apercu de l'etat actuel des Sciences Mathcmatiques chez les
Beiges."
   Quetelet was appointed      by the House of Representatives one of the
Central Jury of Science.       He retained these functions for some time,
and showed great kindliness      and sagacity in discharging them.
   In the course of the year 1835 there appeared at Paris the chief of all
                     " Sur l'homme et le developpement de ses facultcs, ou
Quetelet's works,
Essai de Physique Sociale."        It was a resume of all his previous works
on  Statistics.
   In February 1836 Quetelet was charged with the execution of a Royal
Decree for the establishment of a little meridian in the cities of Antwerp,
Ostend, Bruges, Ghent, and Liege, and for placing a meridian-instrument
on the walls of the Cathedrals, Hotels de Ville, or other suitable buildings
 of forty-one different towns.
    In August 1839 Quetelet made a journey, in company with his wife,
 in France, Italy, and Tyrol.        His object was threefold. In the first
 place, he was to compare,    in conjunction with his fellow commissioners,
 Messrs. Dumortier and Teichman, the standard weights and measures of
 Belgium with those of France ; secondly, he was to attend the Congress
 of Savants at Pisa ; and thirdly, he purposed to revise the determinations;
 of magnetic intensity obtained in 1830, of the correctness of which he
 entertained some doubts.
    At the sitting of the 7th December the Academy received a report of
 the proceedings of the Commission in the month of August ; and Quetelet
 also presented   the results of the Magnetic Observations which he had
 made   in Tyrol and Italy.
    In  1839 Quetelet communicated to the Academy a new Catalogue of
 the most remarkable                                   —
                         appearances of falling stars the second which he
 had made, for he had early turned his attention to this subject.         Fe

                                       xvi
appears, however, to have been in some uncertainty as to the nature of
these phenomena.
   The year 1839 was marked at the Observatory by the commencement
of the observations on the flowering of plants, and in the month of January
was begun the first of a series of monthly magnetic observations.       These
last observations were made at the suggestion of the Royal Society of
London. It was in the year 1839 that Quetelet was elected a Foreign
Member of the Royal Society; and in May 1841 these observations were
considerably extended, and were thenceforth made regularly day and night
at intervals of two hours.
   The year     1841 was an important period of        Quetelet's life.    He
thought   that the  time was past for individuals to  promote    the advance
ment of science by their isolated efforts, and that   further investigations
would need to be conducted by people associated         together in academic
bodies. In 1842 he drew up a set of instructions as to the choice of
subjects for the reports.     These instructions embraced Meteorology and
Physical Geography and the Animal Kingdom.
   In 1846 Quetelet published " Lettres a S.A.R. le due regnant de Saxe
 Coburg sur la theorie des probability's appliques aux Sciences Morales et
                                                                  '
Politiques," which was reviewed by Sir John Herschel in the Edinburgh
Review.'     Soon afterwards he published a work entitled
                                                               " Du Systeme
 Sociale et des lois qui le regissent."
   The Revolution of 1848 turned Quetelet's thoughts to political ques
tions ; and in 1849 he read to the Academy a new note, entitled " Frag
ments sur la maniere dont il convient d'envisager les Sciences Politiques et
sur l'intervention du gouvernement dans les affaires des particuliers." He
also presented to the literary section of the Academy a ' Note sur la Nature
des Etats constitutionels, et sur quelques principes qui en derivent.'
   Quetelet had in 1841 organized a general system of observation of
the periodical phenomena of vegetation.       Five years later he attempted
to solve the question as to the influence of temperatures on these phe
nomena ; and he was led to appreciate the influence of heat, not according
to the sum of the mean daily temperatures, as did Reaumur, but by the
 sum of their squares.
   The results of these researches ou the electricity of the atmosphere
appeared in 1849. Two years afterwards Quetelet made an important
investigation   on the shape, size, and velocity of atmospheric waves,
according to the observations made in June, July, and August 1841, and
of the system of atmospheric waves of Central Europe, according to
hourly observations of the summer solstice of 1841 and of the winter
solstice of 1843.
   This work on atmospheric waves was an important step in meteo
rology, and paved the way for the recent labours in international meteo
rology, to which we owe the remarkable law of tempests of M. Marie-
Davy. The researches on the temperature of the earth, of which the

                                                   xvii
accounts were first inserted              in the 'Mcmoires' of the Academy, and those
on the          atmospheric waves, which had appeared successively in the
'                '
    Annales        of the Observatory, were afterwards united with other works
on meteorology,            and published        under the title     " Sur le Climat     de    la
Belgique."
  Quetelet married in 1825 a daughter of M. Curtet, a French physician,
and niece of the well-known chemist Professor van Mons, a highly
accomplished lady, by whom he had a son and a daughter.     He was very
hospitable, and entertained at his house persons of distinction who
came to Brussels — artists, savants, literary men, and politicians of all
parties.
      In July      1855        he   was   seized    with   a   fit of apoplexy, which        was
pronounced                      to be serious.
                    by the physicians            His memory was much
injured by         it,
               although after   week  or  ten
                                            a  days he wished to resume
work    and in the September following he was able to be present at the
         ;
public Meeting of the Section of Fine Arts.
   He continued to work during the remaining years of his life and, in           ;
fact, when misfortune came heavily upon him by the loss of his wife, his
daughter, and several of his grandchildren, work became his only con
    solation.
      His son, M. Ernest Quetelet, had now taken the direction of the

    Six months before his death he made the fatiguing journey to St. Peters

    Neither the fear of cholera nor the anxious entreaties of his family could
    deter him from this enterprise.     On his return he seemed refreshed,
    having been pleased by his reception. About this time also he had been
    made an Associate of the Academy of Moral and Political Science of the
    Institute of France and ten days afterwards, in congratulatory address

    for the last time down to his study, and was with difficulty prevented
    from going to the Meeting of the Fine- Art Section.      He became rapidly
     worse, and expired on the 17th   of February.

     Phnlifpe-Edouabd      Potoletiee de Verneuil was born at Paris
  on the 13th of February, 1805. He was educated for the magistracy,
  but the events of the year 1830 interfered with his plans.        It so hap
  pened that just at this period of indecision about his future career
  geology was making a great advance.           The fact was now becoming
  recognized that the earth's crust, far from having remained unchanged
  from remote antiquity, had undergone upheavals and fractures which
  had repeatedly caused alterations in the surface.       In addition to this,
  even the relative ages of these different phenomena had been estimated.
  De Verneuil's interest was engaged by these results, and he studied
  under Elie de Beaumont the methods of investigation of geology ; and
 resolved not merely to be a passive student of the works of others, but
  to devote himself to the extension of the science. With this view he
 made up his mind to travel, and selected Wales as the place of greatest
 interest since the publication of the researches of the two celebrated
 geologists Sedgwick and Murchison.          These latter had recently esta
 blished a certain order    of  superposition in the very thick group of the
 most ancient strata, which had hitherto been confounded under the
 general name of
                    " Transition Rocks."
    He next travelled in the East ; and on the way to Turkey, on the
 Danube, fell in with some sympathetic companions, and with them he
 travelled through Moldavia and Bessarabia to Odessa, thence on to the
 Crimea and to the frontiers of Circassia, and later on to the Bosphorus.
\, He now published a memoir on the Crimea, which was supplemented
 and made more complete by a collection of fossils belonging to new and
 interesting species, which were described by M. Deshayes.       Through the
 private instruction of this savant De Verneuil became intimately ac
 quainted with the fossil shells, a subject of so much importance to
 stratigraphieal geology.
    In the year 1838 De Verneuil paid special attention to the lower strata
 of the Bas-Boulonnais district, and thereby acquired considerable autho
 rity in determining the fossils of the ancient rocks. It was on this
 account that when Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison wished to compare
 the most ancient formations of the districts of the Rhine and Belgium
 with those of England, they invited De Verneuil to accompany them in
 their exploration.   In the memoir they afterwards published they ac
 knowledge the great assistance afforded by their companion in placing
 at their disposal his rich collections.
- In conjunction with M. d'Archiac, De Verneuil published in 1841 a
 description of the fossils of the oldest deposits of the Rhenish Provinces.
 The work is preceded by a general survey of the fauna of the so-called
 Palaeozoic rocks, and is followed by a table of all the organic remains
 hitherto met with in the Devonian S3'stem of Europe.
    The results of this journey were so satisfactory that shortly afterwards
 Murchison again requested De Verneuil's company when he was plan

                                          xix
ning  the exploration of Russia.   In the course of three summers,
Messrs. Murchison, De Verneuil, and De Keyserling examined an area
equal in extent to more than half Europe. They took different routes,
meeting occasionally to compare notes.
NIhe    important work devoted to Russia       in Europe and to the Oural
Mountains, and accompanied by geological maps, appeared in 1845.
The introduction of the Permian formation into the science was one of
the chief results of this exploration.    The whole of the second volume
of this book is the work of De Verneuil, assisted by De Keyserling
as far as the Palaeozoic fauna is concerned.    That part relating to the Se
condary fauna was intrusted to D'Orbigny.        Taking a general survey of
the fauna of the four Palaeozoic systems, the author shows that organized
beings follow each other there in the same order as in the other coun
tries of Europe.
   De Verneuil next turned his attention to the New World.       The North-
American geologists had been working hitherto quite independently of
those of Europe.     They had ascertained the remarkable development of
the ancient strata in that quarter of the globe, so remarkable for their
immense thickness as well as for the considerable area they cover — no
less than 35 degrees of longitude by 15 degrees of latitude.     There were
 then no data for connecting the two systems, owing to the separation of
 the two continents by several thousand miles.
    Scarcely was the publication of the results of the Russian expedition
 completed when De Verneuil undertook to supply this great want.         The
 task before him was no less than to follow and compare on the two di
 stinct continents the sedimentary deposits from the oldest fossiliferous
strata to those containing       coal.
     As a foundation for this labour      he had only those species which he
had studied      in local collections, or which he had himself found.    He
established     the fact that even in such remote countries the first traces
of life manifest themselves by nearly similar forms       ;   and there   is,   indeed,
a   striking agreement in the order of their succession.
    This notice on the parallelism of the Palaeozoic strata of these two
continents     remains     a standard work in spite of the constant advances of
the science,    and   is   perhaps the masterpiece of De Verneuil.
  His next labours were in Spain.      De Blainville, who did not believe
in the universality of the laws of Palaeontology, engaged him in this
enterprise. Though the order of succession of the strata of Northern
Europe and America were well established, this great naturalist supposed
that in Spain, especially towards the South, the order of succession of
the fossil strata must be reversed, or at any rate modified.
   Between the years 1849 and 1862 De Verneuil made no less than
twelve journeys in the Peninsula, sometimes alone, sometimes in com
pany with M. Edouard Collomb, well known for his works on ancient
glaciers, and sometimes accompanied by young naturalists desirous of

                                      XX
gaining instruction. In these various journeys De Verneuil collected a
great number of fossils, and the laws of Palaeontology already esta
blished received striking confirmation.
   A geological map of Spain was published after these laborious ex
cursions, besides some memoirs of great interest, especially one on the
Primordial fauna.
    De Verneuil had   been elected   in 1854 free Member of the Academie
des Sciences.     He was also    a  Member of the Royal Society and of
other foreign Academies.
   In his latter years he suffered from a weakness of sight.
    He possessed singular clearness of judgment and freedom from pre
judice, and could discuss with calmness and equanimity opinions directly
opposed to his own.
   In character he was extremely benevolent, and many acts of kindness
are recorded of him.     His modesty of disposition inclined him to prefer
dwelling rather on the discoveries of others than on his own ; and, in
fact, it is not improbable that some of his fellow workers may from this
very circumstance have failed to appreciate his -full merit.
    During his last illness, which was of three months' duration, he con
tinued to take a lively interest in scientific and other questions.    His
cheerfulness never forsook him    ; and he died calmly on the 29th of May,
1873, at the age of 68. He bequeathed his unique collection of fossils
to the Gallery of the IScole des Mines.

however, which from the context can lead to no mistake, and is                         conse
quently of no importance.            Though the proof of that part of the " Report"
passed under my eyes, the error entirely escaped my attention.
  With regard, however, to Professor Owen's remark that throughout
the " Report the discovery of Lagomys in Brixham Cave is treated as
              "
an original discovery,        I
                       have simply to observe that the Report consists of
one hundred pages, in which about five lines, at most, relate to Lagamyt
spelceus, in two of which the reporter observes, with perfect truth, that 1-it
has been met with elsewhere in association with Pleistocene mammals."
The statement of this well-known fact is hardly, in the usual sense of
words, a claim to       " original discovery."

   This paper is intended to complete and supplement three papers on
Music which       I  have already read before the Royal Society'.           It contains
s more complete theory of temperament, embracing that indicated by
Helmholtz*, but not worked out by him, and its application to the theory
of constructing musical instruments with an intonation practically just,
without      change of fingering, and, if there are three or four performers,
without change        of mechanism. The name Duodene refers to that collec
tion of twelve notes, suitable         to the present manuals, which is made the
unit of      construction. To obtain its precise form, and determine the
number and value of all such duodenes as it is necessary to tune,                I have
been obliged to indicate a theory of harmonic scales and modulation,
which     I believe to be entirely       new, and which has of course other uses,
The great       extent    of the subject obliges     me to confine    this part of my
 paper to a     mere indication.

ears   in melody, and can be detected harmonically only by very slow beats
for tones in the highest Octaves used in music.
    6.  Cyclic Temperaments.             The following method is far more general
than that     given    in  my previous paper (Proc. vol. xiii. p. 412).                Put
              m .  log  Y=v     .  log 2,               m  . log  k=q . log   2,
              m . log T=<       .  log 2,               mi . log s=z . log    2,
and, after     substituting these values for log V, log T, log                   I; log * in the
logarithms of equations (5) and (6), divide out by log                    2, and    multiply up
 by m.    Then
                        12v-7m        = q+z,              m-3t=2q-z                       (9,10)
    Take any integral values for q and z, and find the integral values which
 satisfy one of these indeterminate equations for v, m, or t, m, and substi
 tute in the other,       taking the resulting          integral values of t or v respec
 tively.    The five integral values determine a cycle in which the Octave is
 divided into m aliquot parts, which may be termed octs, v of which make
 a  Fifth,  t a major Third, q a comma, and r a skhisma of " the cycle of m."
 Most of the results are valueless, but the following present either theo
 retical convenience or historical interest : —

     Of these, the first three are here,      I believe, for the first   time shown  to
 be true cyclic temperaments.
     1. The cycle of 30103 is such an excellent representative of just
intonation (giving even 6 octs for the skhist), that it can be used without
 sensible error, in place of ordinary logarithms, to reduce the relations of
intervals to addition and subtraction, for general use among musicians
 or learners unacquainted with higher arithmetic.                   By dividing out by
 100,000 we obtain almost precisely the five-figure logarithms of the
 intervals.
     2. The cycle of 3010 is almost as correct, with smaller numbers.
     3. The cycle of 301 is almost a perfect representation of skhistic
 temperament,       in which the skhisma is eliminated, and for that reason
 becomes     perhaps the most practical representation of general musical
 intonation.
     4. The first cycle of 53 is Nicholas Mercator's representation of just
 intonation, but it is more correctly a representation of skhistic tempera
 ment, and not so good as No. 3'.
     5. The second cycle of 53 is a very accurate representation of Py
  thagorean intonation, and has actually been proposed for the violin by
  Drobisch.                                                                       •
     6. The cycle of 31 is Huyghens's Cyclus Harmonious, and closely repre
  sents the tertian or mean temperament.
     7.  The cycle of 12 is the ordinary equal temperament, and its principal
  convenience consists in the very small number of its octs, here called
  Semitones.
      Unequal Temperaments,       whether they consist of 12 selected tones from
  uniform temperaments, or of 12 tones turned intentionally false (see my
  former paper, Proc. vol. xiii. pp. 414-417, for their theory), are now aban
  doned.     But the difficulty of tuning equal temperament by estimation of
   ear, or even by the monochord, and of retaining the intonation of the
  piano or organ unchanged for even an hour, makes all temperaments in
   actual use really unequal.       The difficulty of original tuning by estimation

   Bosanquet in bis paper  read before the Royal Society  on 30th January, 1873.

1874.]                     Mr. A.    J.   Ellis   on   Musical Duodenes.                                   9
of ear            of skhistic temperament, where the Fifths have to be
              in the    case
flattened by an  almost inaudible skhist, is so much enhanced as to be
insuperable except by Scheibler's method '. Hence it is necessary to find
a   practical substitute. This             I term
     Unequally Just Intonation.            — Suppose
                                        that the 48 tones marked off by
a dotted line in Table I. hare to be tuned in this substitute for skhistic
intonation.   Tune C to the fork. Take 4 just Fifths up (or Fourths
down),   C to G, G to D, D to tA, fA to tE, without beats ; and three just
Fifths down (or Fourths up), C to F, F to Bh>, B[> to Et>.         Then tune C
to E as a just major Third up, without beats, and from E proceed to its
just Fifth B, verifying the result by determining that it is a just major
Third above G, and so on to G# up and JG down.              Then if from G# we
proceeded   to the just Fifth,   D#, the  resulting  tone would   be exactly one
skhisma sharper than Efcj, whereas in skhistic intonation it would be
identical with Fj>, as already shown.       It is needless to say that no tuner
could effect this exact difference of a skhisma, but he will come practically
near     and the error
         it,                that of the Fifth (the least of the errors) in equal
                                is
temperament.      If we were to proceed in this way for all the six columns
of   8 tones marked off in Table I., we should have just major Thirds
throughout, and just Fifths also in all but        cases — namely, +D## to iB,
                                                                5
Bjf to JG, G# to Eh>, tE to q>, and tC to fA^, each of which would be
too flat by one skhisma.      Since JG (Table       col.  line  I.     just major
                                                                         6,        x)   is   a
Third below JB, and        just a minor  Third   above   +E,  but +E        whole            is   a
skhisma flatter than +D#$ (col.        line p), which would be played for +E,
                                                  8,
it follows that the minor Third, +D## to +G, would be            skhisma too flat  a
or close    and similarly that the minor Thirds, B# to EJ>, GJf to C|>, and
               ;
tE to tA^jf>, or minor Thirds on the whole, would be skhisma too

places of decimals) corresponding to these logarithms.          This gives the vibrational
numbers of all the skhistic tones in the Octave, of which 48 will be required.     Subtract
4 from each of these values, and procure tuning-forks giving exactly the tones thus
determined to at least the hundredth of a vibration in second.      aThese may be obtained
of the great manufacturer of acoustic apparatus, Hons. R. Koenig, of Paris but                   ;    it   is
necessary to state that the English and German (not the French) system of counting

and     this means only, with great care and attention, the pitch may probably be ob

bad as the best intervals (Fifths) in equal temperament, and all the other
intervals absolutely just. Hence the name unequally just. In future shall                     I
consider that skhistic intonation is practically realized by unequally just
intonation, for which the practical rule is : — twu six tones making just
major Thirds without beats (as tFb to t A\? to C to E to JG# to JB£, line t

   Saunders's      "Tilting Action." — Before proceeding to show that 48 skhistic
tones suffice for modern modulational                    music, it will be useful for future
constructionsto remark that a method of realizing all the effects which                              I
contemplated by my duplex finger-board (Proc. vol. xiii. p. 422) has been
invented by Mr. T. W. Saunders ', by means of stops, which allow the
manual and fingering to remain unaltered.      Two sets of harmonium
vibrators are arranged one behind the other, tuned in tertian intonation
(by means of beats, counted by a pendulum, which gives a fairly accurate
means of approximating to the correct result) as follows, the capital
letters referring to the white or long digitals, and the small letters to the
black or short digitals, a mode of distinction which       shall constantly  I
employ : —

  There are 12 stops2, one corresponding to each digital in the Octave,
which, by   " tilting action," enables one, and one only, out of the two
               a
vibrators in the same column, as shown above, to be " damped" at plea
sure throughout all the Octaves of the instrument.  When all the stops
are pushed in, the front vibrators only are free, and any one may be
exchanged for  back vibrator by pulling out its stop.

the same series that are themselves consonant with each other, forms
what I  here mean by an harmonic scale.  This was not the principle on

   Each of these 8 trichordals contains 7 tones, and when these are reduced
to one Octave and sounded in order of pitch, they form that particular
scale in which a piece of music is usually written. But in repeating them
each may begin on any tone of the seven,      giving 7 modes (in the ancient
Greek sense) to each trichordal.     To distinguish these, change the m of
the name of the triad containing   the initial tone into^j when it is its First
(p rima), t when it is its Third (t ertia), and qu when it is its Fifth
(qu inta), which last is of course required for the highest or dominant
triad only. The final cadence fully distinguishes the 56 resulting harmonic
scales.                           I

that one or two of the cells may be made parts of  other  decads, and  that
the union triads may be regarded as parte of cells left incomplete.    The

the added tones   necessary to complete the heptadecad in small letters.
On the right solfeggio names are proposed as substitutes, to be pronounced
with Italian vowels. These names are founded on those used by the
Tonic Solfaists, and are suitable to any original tonic Do and they are                           ;
introduced because singers in just intonation should become accustomed
                        "
to the " mental effect of each of these tones in relation to the Do selected.
The decads are named from the names of the tones in the original decad.

degree. The dominant and subdominant decads have each seven tones,
the relative and correlative decads have each six tones, in common with
the original decad.    The dominant decad raises two tones,       and A, by                           F                    a

modulation           to the left        ;    and, owing to the closer relationship, modulation
to the    right relative               is   more common than into the right correlative, which
generally occurs              as       a    vertical (dominant)                     modulation             from the latter.
Vertical (dominant or subdominant) modulations are, however, the most
common of all, unconsciously    (owing to commatic temperament) into
the subdominant (when the minor chord, +d— f+a,      used for the chord                            is
of the added Sixth, f-f     d), and consciously into the dominant (in

     The vertical modulation                   is   so common that              it      influences scales, producing
actual terrachordals,       which are disguised in melody by being occasionally
deprived of       their extreme tones, so as to reduce their apparent number at
any time        to 7.   The fourth chord may be added on to the name by                                                             a

this paper, to explain them. A means of putting the strange-looking
chords1, f+a . .. b+id#, and f+a— c with £d#, or f+awith Jd#, which
they contain, under the hands of the performer on justly intoned instru
ments, is absolutely necessary.
    The Harmonic Duodme or Element of Modulation, as distinguished from
the heptadecad or unit of modulation, contains the 12 tones inclosed
within an oblong in the figure of the heptadecad. It is seen to contain
a complete decad of C and two additional tones, f# and d{>, which                 I term
mtttators, as each of them is part of two cells, and hence lead the old
decad to change into the new decads containing them.                        Thus f# is
part of
       the vertical cell       tf ta           and of the lateral cell     D   f#
                                     D  «                                     B tdfc
and hence leads both to the dominant decad and to the right correlative
decad.     Again,    d[>
                         is  a  part of           •
   the vertical cell        dh>  F          and of the lateral cell    tf[> tA[>

and hence leads to the subdominant                 decad and to the left correlative
decad.     But these mutators,           f# and d[>, also complete two scales left
incomplete in the decad            because they required vertical modulation (or
decadation), namely,
           tA\}   map&ma     . . . . dp +  f —

            E     miptmi     ....    a  —  c+    e  —  g+ b — d+ f#,

D+% DJ>+F— tA[>              with    B, fA[>+C-tEb        with f#,  which  occur in the
tetrachordals of minor scales already mentioned.
   A duodene, then, consists of 12 tones, forming four trinet of major
Thirds arranged in three quaternions of Fifths.              Hence the duodene con
structed on the second tone C of any trine, tAt>+C+E, contains the
map&ma or major of the first tone tA(?, the complete decad of the second
tone C, and the miptmi or common descending minor of the third tone E.
It has therefore three tonics, tA[>, C, and E ; but the tonic of the decad
being most characteristic, this is called the root of the duodene, and the
duodene is named after it.
   Any duodene is clearly and sharply separated from its adjacent trines
and quaternions, as shown in Table I., where the small innermost oblong
marks off the duodene of C. For in the duodene the smallest intervals

we proceed to the left.    Hence the intervals introduced by adjacent
trines and quaternions are all less than two commas.  In equal tempera
ment      no new intervals would                            be thus introduced                     ;   for all the Fifths are
there so altered  that the new upper trine, tempered tf +ta+c#, would
become  identical  with the original bottom trine, tempered dJ>      + A,                                                        +F

with the old quaternion to the left, tempered d[> x tA\} x tE[> x tBt>.   The
consequence      that only one duodene exists for equal temperament, and
                      is
the real nature of modulation        thoroughly disguised.  isIn tertian tem
perament this would not be the case        the quaternions would be distin

guished, but the  trines would partly  coincide, and hence some, but not all,
of the meaning of modulation would be lost1.

 18                  Mr. A.     J. Ellis  on  Musical Duodems.                [Nov. 19,
    In skhistic intonation, the modification of the Fifth leads to a modi
fication of the comma and obliteration of the skhisma ; so that the two
first tones, skhistic tf, ta, of the new upper trine, tf 4-ta+cJ, are one
skhistic comma higher, and the third, skhistic off, is one skhistic comma
lower than the two last tones, F, A, and the first tone D|? of the old
trine,   D(>+F+A.           And the tones of the new right quaternion will be
in the same order, exactly two skhistic commas flatter than the old left-
hand quaternion'.
    The consequence is that if we took 4 independent duodenes (that is,
such that no tone of one is common to any tone of the other) as the duo-
denes of tB{>, AJf, G\}, and +F#, the tones of which are contained within
the dotted lines and right side of the inner oblong of Table I., the tones
of the duodenes AJ and +F# will be two commas flatter than those of
tBh> and Gr[>; and the tones of the two first quaternions of the tBf> and
A# duodenes will be one comma sharper than those of the two last
quaternions of G\> and +F#, while the tones of the third quaternions of
tB[> and Ajf will be one comma fiatter than those of the duodenes of Gfcj
and +F# respectively.
    The result, then, is that the 48 tones will consist of four corresponding
sets of 12 tones each appearing in 4 forms, differing in pitch by one
skhistic comma. This will appear more clearly by the following Table,
in which the value in octs of the cycle of 301 is given for 73 tones, being
those in cols. I. to vi. of Table I., less those in col. I., lines I, m, n, and
col. VI., lines y, z. The 48 of those tones contained in 4 independent duo
denes are in Roman capitals, the other of the 73 tones, which are some
of their skhistic synonyms, are in Roman small letters, and other syno
nyms are added in Italics ; the whole are divided into groups of 4, the
constituents     of which differ from one another by 5 octs, or one skhistic
comma.
   1 This is readily seen by expressing the tones in terms of the octs of the cycle of 301 ,
by continually adding and subtracting 176 for the Fifths and 97 for the major Thirds,
adding or subtracting 301 as often as is necessary to reduce to the same Octave. A
skhistic comma is represented by 5 octs.     This gives
                     Tones.                                      Octs.

    Since, then, the duodene of C is precisely                   adapted for placing on our
ordinary manuals,          and   no   corresponding          tones    which have to be intro
duced within these limits will be more than two or three commas sharper
or flatter than        these, such corresponding tones (owing to our habits of
reading musical notes into directions for using digitals) will be all fitted
for being played on the same digitals.                    This is the most important point
in the     practical construction          of instruments,          and is for the first time
pointed out in this paper.
    Another important result is, that if we take any 12 consecutive skhistic
tones     in order of Fifths, or 8 consecutive tones in that order, and 4
others separated from them by 24 or 48 Fifths, although such tones will
not form        a   duodene, they will be 12 tones suitable for our manuals,
and    will therefore afford the means of temporarily supplementing other
arrangements.
    In skhistic intonation,           then,      the modulational          peculiarities of just
intonation are preserved          ;  and   it will    be convenient        in future to consider
modulation as         taking place by duodenes, and hence consisting of duodena-
tion.       We shall therefore have in just intonation both vertical and
lateral duodenation to consider ; but in skhistic intonation it will be seen
by Table II. that one right lateral duodenation, as from root tB[> to root
D, is the same as eight descending vertical duodenations, for these would
in just intonation lead to the root Ejjjj, which, as shown in the last Table,
is skhistically identical with D.               Hence in skhistic intonation we have, so
far as instruments           are  concerned, only to render vertical                   duodenation
possible     and easv.
                                                                                      c 2

    20                   Mr. A.      J.  Ellis  on   Musical Duodenes.                 [Nov. 19,
       And in writing music, if we note at the top of any bar the name of the
    duodene to which the notes to be played belong, and suppose this duodenal
    (as the mark may be called, in contradistinction to the signature, which
    will remain as before) to hold till a new one is written (according to the
   custom of musical signatures), we shall be able precisely to mark the pitch
   of every tone in just or skhistic intonation, without introducing any change
    or any additional sign into          the staff-notation of music '. This is again an
   entirely new practical principle resulting from the present theory.                         The
    duodenal will direct         the  player   to  the mode    of arranging     the  manual     he
   has to use.        It should be the duty of the composer to insert the duodenals
    himself ; but     in respect of existing compositions, which were composed for
    some commatic system of temperament, it will be often difficult to deter
   mine which of two adjacent vertical duodenes it would be best to use ;
   and it will probably be necessary to introduce commatic changes, when
    they can be made within the limits of a single heptadecad.                      Also in the
   case of compositions in a major scale, which do not change into tho minors
   of the same decad, and hence use only two quaternions of a duodene, but
   will necessarily and frequently modulate to the right, it is more convenient
   to consider the music as performed in the first and second quaternions of
   a duodene having for its root the Third of the major scale, because the
   third quaternion of that duodene contains the tones required for right
   lateral modulation.           Thus C major will be assigned to the duodene of E,
    No. 19 of Table       II.,  and F major to the duodene of A, No. 20 of Table II.,
   &c. This makes the modulation from the major into the relative minor
   as simple and direct as vertical modulation, for C major passes into any
   form of A minor or major by descending vertically from the duodene of
   E to that of A. All pieces in any minor scale pass into each of the three
   quaternions of a duodene, and hence their duodenal will be the tonic of
   their decad, which gives its name to the duodene. The duodene is then
   prepared for playing the synonymous major of that minor scale.                            Such
   duodenals might be distinguished by an added star.
       It often happens that passing tones, changing notes and appoggiature,
   are introduced which do not belong to the harmony.                       They are written
   usually after the laws of Pythagorean temperament, but their piteh is
   really indeterminate.            For these there is no occasion to change the duo
   denal at all.         They    will then be played in the duodene of the other

   be  considered as   their proper representative in just intonation.
                              E. Number of    Tones required.
      The next   important point is to determine how many duodenes must be
  provided.     In Table I. the large inner oblong contains all the duodenes
  which have    at least one tone in common with the original duodene of C.
  Thus the duodenes tD[> and +B have respectively the tones tBh> and                  A
 in common      with the original duodene, and no others.             If we proceeded
 further, as vertically from the tDjj to the ttA[> duodene, we should no
 longer have any connexion with the decad of the original tonic C.                  The
 confusions of modern equal temperament might lead much further ; but
 in that case we must restore the commatic changes which equal tempera
 ment ignored, considering, for example, that when the composer modu
lated    into tempered      A[> from    tempered    Djj he really meant to make a
modulation     from just Djj into just      tAjj,  and not from    tDjj  to just ttAjj.
It   would probably      have never been the composer's intention to proceed to
such    unrelated duodenes as these two last.
     The limits   of the original roots of duodenes may be taken to be the tones
of the duodene of C. Practically, composers had no others in their minds.
Any smaller changes of pitch were relegated to differences in the pitch
of C, whence all the others were derived.                If, then, we construct the
limiting    duodenes     to  the  extreme   tones  of the  duodene of C as original
roots, we shall obtain all the tones in Table I., being 9 x 13=117 in
number.        This is the number of tones required, therefore, in just
intonation.
     Skhistic intonation would introduce identifications which would reduce
this number to the 9 x 8=72 tones in the lines p to x in Table I., toge
ther with three     in col. 1, lines  I, m, n, and two  in col.  9, lines y and z, that
is to 77    skhistic tones in all.       The last 5 are so extremely unlikely to
occur,    however,   that   we   may   consider   these 72 skhistic tones as suffi
ciently representing the whole 117 of the Table.                These 72 tones form
6   independent duodenes, those of ttEfc)}>, D and +C##, and of tC^hs Bjj
and JA£.       It will be shown that there is really no difficulty in playing
them all, with existing means, if required ; but they would not be
required.      The tendency of musicians is not to modulate to both right
and    left equally in the same piece. It has been already noted that on
account of the prevalence of major scales duodenation is generally to the
right.     The fingering for the duodenes of tBlj and A$ would be the same
 on manuals     constructed on the duodenary theory, although the tones in
 skhistic intonation     would differ by two skhistic commas. If, then, a piece
 in tB[>   duodenated much to the left, that is (for skhistic intonation),
 ascended    vertically, we could play it as A£.         It would simply be neces
 sary to write +Bj> as its duodenal, as that is shown to be identical with
  A$ in the last Table.        We should then be able to use ascending duodena

tion with great       ease, as shown      in Table  II., even  if columns  1  and 2   in
Table    I.  were omitted.       Hence we may begin by cancelling columns 1 and
2 of Table       II.     In   view of the greater frequency of right lateral or
descending duodenation, we need only reject column 9 to the right                   We
have thus reduced the just tones to the 6 x 13              = 78 in columns I. to vi.
of Table I.          The skhistic identifications reduce these further to the
6 x 8=48 tones in lines p to * of the same columns, together with the
three tones in col. I., I, m, n, and the two in col. vi., y, z. As these tones
may,    I  think, be always avoided by properly choosing the original root,
motives of convenience induce me to reduce the number of skhistic tones
necessary to the 48 included by the dotted lines in cols. i. to VI. of
Table    I.
    In  my former paper (' Proceedings,' vol. xiii. p. 98), not having taken a
sufficiently comprehensive view of the nature of modulation,                I fixed the
number of just tones required at 72 instead of 117, and showed that they
would reduce by skhismatic substitution (for              I had not then worked out
the theory of skhistic temperament) to 45 ; and on examination it will be
found that these 45 include the 48 which               I have just named, with the
exception of those in col. I., lines p and q, and col. VI., line x of Table I.
The tones used in Mr. Listen's organ (according to the statement                  I was
able   to give in Proceedings,' vol. xiii. p. 417, note §), on being treated
                       '
skhistically, include 44 of these 48 tones, omitting the 4 tones in col. I.,
lines w, x, col. v., line x, and col. vi., line x, and introduces           two others
found in col. 2, lines p and x, and probably only due to his system of
tuning. He has thus 46 tones in all. Gen. T. Perronet Thompson's organ
                         '
(see my paper in Proceedings,' vol. xiii. p. 102), when similarly reduced,
has 38 of my 48 tones, omitting all col. I., col. n., line x, and col. vi.,
line r in Table I., and retaining the two tones of col. VI., lines y, z, which
I  do not find necessary.           Mr. Poole's latest organ (Silliman's Journal
for 1867, pp. 1 to 45), after rejecting his 39 natural Sevenths, which                 I
expressly exclude, has 61 just tones, which reduce to the 36 skhistic
tones in col. n., lines q to x, cols, in., it., and v., lines p to x, and col. VI.,
lines p to t. These are the principal attempts at limiting the scale actually
made up to this time ; and hence I conclude that my reduction to 48
skhistic tones (that is, practically, unequally just tones) would embrace
almost every case, though it is conceivable that some extraordinary music
might make it advisable to introduce 12 more, namely, col. 2, lines p to
x, and col. 9, lines p to s, making 60 tones in all, for adding which pro
vision should be made.
   1 If in
            changes of key in the movements of a long piece modulation took place first
much to the left and then much to the right, we might perhaps make cominatic changes
between the movements, without disturbing the connexion.           And when changes are
introduced by successions of discords, such commatic changes could not be observed at
all by the listener.     By the use of the duodenal, however, they will be rendered per
fectly simple to the performer.

  The 48 tones thus pointed out form the 32 trines, which, with their
skhistic synonyms, are shown on Table II. By taking these in quater
nions we obtain 29 duodenes.  In Table                        II.
                                          the root of the duodene is
written against its uppermost trine, and hence the root itself is found in
the middle of the second trine below, and the whole duodene extends to
the    third trine below. Trines on the same line are skhistically identical,
the capitals indicating the names of the 48 selected tones of cols. I. to vi.,
lines p to x, in Table I.   In Table III. the roota of these duodenes are
arranged in 4 columns, of which each tone in the same line is skhis
tically identical; but, proceeding from left to right, each tone           in                  is,
just intonation, one skhisma natter than the next adjacent tone on
 the right.
   In Table III., also, the tones in each of the duodenes are written down
in the order in which they would stand on         manual    but the skhistic
                                                                    a        ;
identities of the central column of tones in the preceding Table of Octs
 (p. 19) have been used to give the same names to all the tones in one
column, exclusive of the prefixed      and +.    We thus see clearly that
                                                    t
three new tones are introduced by each new successive duodene, two
falling and one rising by skhistic comma, as respects the tones they
                                     a
replace. We also see that each tone prevails through          consecutive          4
duodenes, and that there are                                    + in each
                                                                    4,

column.
   This completes the theory of the construction of instruments, because
the rest    properly the work of the mechanician, and consists simply in
               is
devising a method for bringing each of these 29 duodenes under the hand
of the performer, when indicated by the duodenal.     It will be sufficient
here to point out   few experimental
                          a           instruments, to suggest some prac
tical forms, and to show that means of playing in just intonation with
fixed tones already exist.

name), and consequently illustrates every kind of modulation in the first
degree, and becomes a most valuable instrument for the lecturer and
teacher of singing.    The front vibrators, to which correspond the digitals
when the stops are all pushed in, contain the whole duodene of          and                                  C,

 Tables    II.  and III., and the front set to duodene of +Q> or B, No. 18, of
the same.        This instrument contains the eight trines, Nos. 14 to 21, and
the five duodenes, Nos. 14 to 18, Table II.              The " tilting action " pro
duces a most useful experimental instrument, which is far easier to use
than Helmholtz's own double manual instrument, because it has only
one manual, and requires no alteration in ordinary fingering.               For this
purpose the stops may be reduced to four, each changing a trine instead
of a single note.
    5. Gueroult's Harmonium (Comptes Rendus, 1872, p. 1188).                     This,
again, may       be  treated  as   the  last  by  means  of Mr.  Saunders's  " tilting
action." Two sets of vibrators must be used, the back set tuned to duo
dene JDt> or C% No. 16, and the front to SBtf) or A, No. 20, of
Tables II. and III.          M. Gueroult tuned the BJf of duodene No. 16 as
        5463S
B"i   = '--tt^t B£, so as to make the combinational         tone of G# and B'# the
same as that of B'# and         EJj, the other tones being tuned in just intona
tion from C. Omitting this as unnecessary, the instrument contains the
eight trines, Nos. 16 to 23 of Table II., and the five duodenes, Nos. 16
to 20.       M. Gueroult arranged the tones somewhat differently for two
manuals.
    6. Duoni, Trioni, Quartoni, Quintoni, Sestoni.           The Russian horn-band
which visited London some years ago, and produed great effects by each
performer's playing a single tone only (and hence, probably, in just
intonation), and the customs of hand-bell and church-bell ringers, who
each play a single note in a melody, have suggested to me the use of two,
three, four, five, or six harmoniums or pianofortes, indicated by the above
names, for the purpose of playing in skhistic or unequally just intonation,
by means of two, three, four, five, or six performers, among whom the
tones are distributed.         The Duoni are intended for two independent duo
denes, as in the two last cases, the Quartoni for four such, playing the
whole 48 tones, the Sestoni for six, in the almost impossible case of 72
tones being required.           The Trioni supplement the Duoni by using 12
additional tones, forming consecutive Fifths, and hence not constituting
a duodene, by which means the 36 tones of Mr. Poole's compass can be
played. The Quintoni supplement the Quartoni in a similar manner ; but
the first 8 tones are those in col. 2, lines p to x, and the last 4 those
 in col. 9, lines p to s of Table II. — giving 60 tones on the whole,
chosen so as to supplement without changing the arrangement of the
  Quartoni.
    In each case separate harmoniums             or pianos are used, with no change
in existing mechanism or fingering, but only in intonation ; so that the
instruments could be obtained and tuned in unequally just intonation, as

    The digitals corresponding to the small letters are to rise | inch above
 the others and to be bevelled, so that they are § inch wide at bottom, and
 | inch wide at top. Each step is then a miniature finger-board in
 the ordinary arrangement.           Whenever any note occurs in 4 consecutive
 steps, as shown by the cross lines in Table III., its 4 digitals are to be
 consolidated into one, so that, except in " steps
                                                            "

 digitals will be practically 3 inches long.           To show which digitals are
 consolidated, colour the low wide digitals alternately white and light
 red, and the high narrow digitals alternately light blue and light
 brown, distinctions        of colour easily seen.          To mark the duodene,
 draw a black line,       \  inch broad, across the digital bearing the name
 of the duodene, and put           a black circle of ^ inch in diameter on the
 tonic    of the major scale which         it contains.     The lines thus marked,
 together with the alternation of            colour,  will clearly distinguish each
 duodene.
    The depth of this manual from front to back would be 21 1 inches, and
 the rise 7| inches ; the width of an Octave from C to B is 6 \ inches,
and from C to c is 6| inches.               This last width is 7f inches on the
 piano; but as the hand would on the duodenary always have to dip
 between high digitals to strike Octaves of low digitals, it must be
 held more upright, and hence its span will be less.                     A manual of
five Octaves and one note, C to c"", will be 31 1 inches long.                       The
number of movable digitals in each column of Table III. is 8, which
 open only 4 valves ; this will necessitate coupling —the details result
ing from Table III., which may be considered as a ground-plan of this
 manual1.
   1  When this paper was read   I mentioned that the 48 tones, making 29 duodenes, of
 Tables II. and III. could be played on Mr. Bosanquet's " generalized key-board," as
exhibited to the Royal Society when his paper was read on January 30, 1873, with lees

difficulty in mechanism than by the plan proposed (of which a model was exhibited),
but that slightly new fingering would then be necessary ; and also that the 72 tones of
Table I., lines p to x, making 53 duodenes, might be played by the same arrangement
on a manual not larger than that which      I proposed for the 48 tones or 29 duodenes ;
and hence that the sole advantage of my scheme for a manual was its preservation of
the present fingering, against which had to be set off the advantage that the new finger
ing of Mr. Bosanquet would be the same in all keys or duodenes.          The intonation,
however,   would remain different from Mr. •Bosanquet's.

    The tones  in the large central oblong form all the duodenes which hare at least one
tone in   common with the central duodene of C, forming the limits of radical duodena
 tion from C.
    The complete    Table contains all Ihe duodenes which haye at least one tone in com -
mon   with duodenes whose roots are tones in the duodene of C, forming the limits of
general radical duodenation.
    The 48 tones    in columns I. to VI., between the dotted lines, are those considered
tufficient for instruments with fixed tones in skhistic or unequally just intonation.

        Cruise in   the ' Southern     Sea in the early part of the year

        of the Civilian Scientific Staff on Board.         Received Nov. 12,

                                 [Plates I.— IV.]
    During our southern cruise the sounding-lead brought up five abso
lutely distinct kinds of sea-bottom, without taking into account the rock
and detritus of shallow soundings in the neighbourhood of land.           Our
first two soundings in 98 and 150 fathoms, on the 17th and 18th of
December, were in the region of the Agulhas current.          These soundings
                                       "
would have been naturally logged greenish sand ;" but on examining the
sandy particles with the microscope, they were found to consist almost
without exception of the casts of Foraminifera in one of the complex
silicates of alumina, iron, and potash, probably some form of glauconite.

 1874.]          Challenger'    Soundings in the Southern          Sea.           33
 The genera principally represented by these casta were Miliola, Biloeu-
lina, Uvigerina, Planorbulina, Rotalia, Textularia, Bulimina, and Num-
mvdina ; Globigerina, Orbulina, and Pulvinulina were present, but not
nearly   in so great abundance.       There were very few Foraminifera on the
surface of the sea at the time.         This kind of bottom has been met with
once or twice before ;      but  it  is  evidently exceptional, depending upon
some   peculiar local conditions.
   From the Cape, as far south as our station in lat. 46° 16', we found no
depth greater than 1900 fathoms, and the bottom was, in every case,
" Globigerina-ooze ; " that is to         it consisted of little else than the shells
                                    say,
of Globigerina, whole,    or more or less broken up, with a small proportion
of the shells of  Pulvinulina   and of Orbulina, and the spines and tests of
Badiolarians and fragments of the spicules of Sponges.
   Since the time of our departure, Mr. Murray has been paying the
closest attention to the question of the origin of this calcareous formation,
which is of so great interest and importance on account of its anomalous
character and its enormous extension.              Very early in the voyage, he
formed the opinion that all the organisms entering into its composition
at the bottom are dead, and that all of them live abundantly at the sur
face and at intermediate      depths, over the Ghbigerina-oom area, the ooze
being   formed   by the  subsiding    of these shells to the bottom after death.
   This is by no means a new view.             It was advocated by the late Pro
fessor Bailey, of West Point, shortly           after the discovery, by means of
Lieutenant     Brooke's ingenious sounding-instrument, that such a forma
tion had a wide extension in the Atlantic.              Johannes Mueller, Count
Pourtales, Krohn, and Max-Schultze observed Globigerina and Orbulina
living on the surface ; and Ernst Haeckel, in his important work upon
the   Radiolaria, remarks " that we often find upon, and carried along by
the floating pieces of sea-weed which are so frequently met with in all
seas, Foraminifera as well as other animal forms which habitually live at
the bottom.       However, setting aside these accidental instances, cer
tain Foraminifera, particularly in their younger stages, occur in some
localities so constantly, and in such numbers, floating on the surface of
the sea, that the suspicion seems justifiable that they possess, at all events
at a certain period of their existence, a pelagic mode of life, differing in
this respect from most of the remainder of their class. Thus Miiller
often found in the contents of the surface-net off the coast of France, the
young of Rotalia, but more particularly Globigerince and Orbulince, the
two latter frequently covered with fine calcareous tubes, prolongations of
the borders of the fine pores through which the pseudopodia protrude
through the shell.      I took similar Globigerina; and Orbulince almost daily
in a fine net at Messina, often in great numbers, particularly in February.
 Often the shell was covered with a whole forest of extremely long and
 delicate calcareous tubes projecting from all sides, and probably contri
 buting essentially to enable these little animals to float below the surface

friction against the water, and rendering it more difficult for them to
sink"*. In 1865 and 1866 two papers were read by Major Owen,
F.L.S., before the Linnean Society, "On the Surface-fauna of Mid
Ocean."       In these communications the author stated that he had taken
foraminifera of the genera Globigerina and Pulvinulina living, in the
tow-net on the surface, at many stations in the Indian and Atlantic
Oceans.       He described the special forms of these genera which were
most common, and gave an interesting account of their habits, proposing
for a family which should include Globigerina, with Orbulina as a sub
genus, and Pulvinulina, the name Colymbitae, from the circumstance that,
like the Radiolaria, these Foraminifera are found on the surface after
sunset, " diving" to some depth beneath it during the heat of the day.
Our colleague, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, chiefly on the strength of Major
Owen's papers, maintained that certain Foraminifera were surface-animals,
                                                          I
in opposition to Dr. Carpenter and myself t. had formed and expressed
a very strong opinion on the matter. It seemed to me that the evidence
was conclusive that the Foraminifera which formed the Globigerina-
ooze lived on the bottom, and that the occurrence of individuals on the
surface was accidental and exceptional ; but after going into the thing
carefully, and considering the mass of evidence which has been accumu
lated by Mr. Murray,          I now admit that      I                         I
                                                      was in error ; and agree with
him that it may be taken as proved, that all the materials of such deposits
(with the exception of course of the remains of animals which we now
know to live at the bottom at all depths, and which occur in the deposit as
foreign bodies) are derived from the surface.
    Mr. Murray has combined with a careful examination of the soundings,
a constant use of the tow-net, usually at the surface, but also at depths
from ten to one hundred fathoms              ;  and he finds the closest relation to
exist between the surface-fauna           of any particular locality and the deposit
which is taking place at the bottom.               In all- seas, from the equator to
the polar ice, the tow-net contains Globigerina-. They are more abundant,
and of a larger size, in warmer seas ; several varieties attaining a large
size, and presenting marked varietal characters, are found in the inter
tropical area of the Atlantic.         In   the latitude of Kerguelen they are less
numerous       and smaller, while further south they are still more dwarfed,
and only one variety, the typical Globigerina bulloid.es, is represented. The
living Globigerina from the tow-net are singularly different in appearance
from the dead shells we find at the bottom (Plate I.).                 The shell is clear

 and transparent, and each of the pores which penetrate it is surrounded
 by a raised crest, the crest round adjacent pores coalescing into a roughly
 hexagonal network, so that the pore appears to lie at the bottom of an
 hexagonal pit.        At each angle of this hexagon the crest gives oS a
 delicate flexible calcareous spine, which is sometimes four or five times the
 diameter of the shell in length.       The spines radiate symmetrically from
the direction of the centre of each chamber of the shell, and the sheaves
of long transparent needles, crossing one another in different directions,
have a    very beautiful effect. The smaller inner chambers of the shell
are entirely filled with an orange-yellow granular sarcode ; and the large
terminal chamber usually contains only a small irregular mass, or two
or three small masses run together, of the same yellow sarcode stuck
against one side, the remainder of the chamber being empty.                No defi
nite arrangement, and no approach to structure, was observed in the
sarcode,   and no differentiation, with the exception of round bright-yellow
oil-globules, very much like those found in some of the Radiolarians,
which are scattered apparently irregularly in the sarcode. We never
have been able to detect the least trace of pseudopodia in any of the large
number of Globigerince which we have examined, nor any extension, in any
form, of the sarcode beyond the shell.
   Major Owen (op. ctt.) has referred the Globigerina with spines to a
distinct species, under the name of G. hirmta.            I am inclined rather to
believe that all Globigerince are, to a greater or less degree, spiny, when the
shell has attained its full development.          In specimens taken with the
tow-net the spines are very usually absent ; but that is probably on
account of their extreme tenuity ; they are broken off by the slightest
touch. In fresh examples from the surface the dots indicating the origin
of the lost spines may almost always be made out with a high power.
There never are spines on the Globigerince from the bottom, even in the
shallowest water.         Two or three very marked varieties of Ghbigerina
occur   ; but I   certainly do not think that the characters of any of them can
be regarded as of specific value.
   There is still     a good deal of obscurity     about the nature of Orbuliiia
umversa, an organism which occurs in some places in large proportion in the
Ghbigerina-ooze.        The shell of Orbulina (PI. II.) is spherical, usually about
•5 millimetre in diameter, but it is found of all smaller sizes.        The texture
of the mature shell resembles closely that of Ghbigerina, but it differs in
some important particulars. The pores are markedly of two different sizes,
the larger about four times the area of the smaller. The larger pores are
the less numerous       ; they are scattered over the surface of the shell with
out any appearance of regularity ; the smaller pores occupy the spaces
between the larger.         The crests between the pores are much less regular
in Orbulina than they are in Ghbigerina ; and the . spines, which are of
great length and extreme tenuity, seem rather to arise abruptly from
the top of scattered papillae than to mark the intersections of the crests.

36                      Prof. C. W. Thomson on the                     [Nov. 26,
This origin of the spines from the        papillae can be well seen with a
moderate power on the periphery           of  the sphere.       The spines are
hollow and flexible; they naturally radiate regularly from the direc
tion of the centre of the sphere ; but in specimens which have been
placed under the microscope with the greatest care, they are usually
entangled together in twisted bundles.          They are so fragile that the
weight of the shell itself, rolling about with the motion of the ship, is
usually sufficient to break off the whole of the spines and leave only
 the papillae projecting from its surface, in the course of a few minutes.
 In some examples, either those in process of development, or a series
showing a varietal divergence from the ordinary type, the shell is very
thin and almost perfectly smooth, with neither papillae nor spines, nor
any visible structure, except the two classes of pores, which are constant.
    The chamber of Orbulina is often almost empty ; even in the case of
examples from the surface, which appear, from the freshness and trans
 parency of the shell, to be living, it is never full of sarcode ; but it fre
 quently contains a small quantity of yellow sarcode stuck against one
 side, as in the last chamber of Globigerina. Sometimes, but by no means
constantly, within the chamber of Orbulina there is a little chain of three
or four small chambers singularly resembling in form, in proportion, and
in sculpture a small Globigerina ; and sometimes, but again by no means
 constantly, spines are developed on the surface of the calcareous walls of
these inner chambers, like those on the test of Globigerina.          The spines
radiate from the position of the centre    of  the chambers    and  abut against
the insides of the wall of the Orbulina (PI. II.). In a few cases, the inner
chambers have been observed, apparently arising within or amidst the
 sarcode adhering to the wall of the Orbulina.
    Major Owen regards Orbulina as a distinct organism, nearly allied to
 Globigerina, but differing so far from it as to justify its separation into a
"special subgenus.    He considers the small inner chamber of Orbulina to
 represent the smaller chamber of Globigerina, and the outer wall as
 the equivalent of the large outer chamber of Globigerina, developed in this
 form as an investing chamber. Count Pourtales, Max-Schultze, and
 Krohn, on the other hand, believe, on account of the close resemblance in
 structure between the two shells, their constant association, and the un
 doubted fact that an object closely resembling a young Globigerina is
often found within Orbulina, that the latter is simply a special reproduc
tive chamber budded from the former, and capable of existing indepen
dently.     I am rather inclined to the latter view, although     I  think much
careful observation is still required  to substantiate   it ; and some, even of
our own, observations would seem to tell somewhat in the opposite direc
tion.    Although Orbulina    and Globigerina are very usually associated,
they are so in different proportions in different localities ; and in the icy
sea to the south of Kerguelen, although           Globigerina was constantly
taken    in the  surface-net,  not  a single   Orbulina   was detected.     Like

  Globigerina, Orbulina is moat fully developed and most abundant in the
  warmer seas.
    Associated with these forms, and, like them, living on the surface, and
 dead, with their shells in various stages of decay, at the bottom,
 there are two very marked species or varieties of Pulvinulina, P. Mcnardii,
 and P. MicJuliniana.      The general structure of Pulvinulina resembles
 that of Globigerina.   The shell consists of a congeries of from five to eight
 chambers arranged in an irregular spiral. As in Globigerina, the last
 chamber is the largest ; the inner smaller chambers are usually filled
 with yellow sarcode ; and, as in Globigerina, the last chamber is frequently
 nearly empty, a small irregular mass of sarcode only occupying a part of
 the cavity.    The walls of the chambers are closely and minutely per
 forated. The external surface of the wall is nearly smooth, and no trace
 of a spine has ever been detected.     Pulvinulina Menardii (PI. III. fig. 1)
 has a large discoidal depressed shell, consisting       of a series of flat
chambers overlapping one another, like a number of coins laid down
somewhat irregularly, but generally in a spiral ; each chamber is bordered
by a distinct somewhat thickened solid rim of definite width. On the lower
surface of the shell the intervals between the chambers are indicated by
deep grooves.      The large irregular opening of the final chamber is pro
tected by a crescentic lip, which in some specimens bears a fringe of
spine-like papillae. This form is almost confined to the warmer seas. It
is very abundant on the surface, and still more so during the day, at a
depth of ten to twenty fathoms in the Mid- Atlantic ; and it enters into
the composition of the very characteristic
                                                  " Globigerina-ooze " of the
" Dolphine Rise " in almost as large proportions as Globigerina. Pulvinu
lina Micheliniana is a smaller variety ; the upper surface of the shell is
flattened as in P. Menardii, but the chambers are conical and prolonged
downwards,     so that the shell is deeper and somewhat turbinate.         The
two species usually occur together ; but P. MicJuliniana has apparently a
much wider distribution than P. Menardii ; for while the latter was
limited to the region of the trade-winds and the equatorial drift current,
and was found rarely if at all to the south of the Agulhas current, the
former accompanied us southward as far as Kerguelen Land. Both forms
of Pulvinulina, however, are more restricted than Globigerina ; for even
P. Micheliniana   became scarce after leaving the Cape, and the   wonderfully
pure   calcareous   formation   in the neighbourhood      of  Prince Edward
Island and the Crozets consists almost solely of Globigerina bulloides,
and neither species of Pulvinulina occurred to the south of Kerguelen
Land.
   Over  a very large   part of the
                                    " Globigerina-ooze "  area, and especially
in those intertropical regions in which the formation is most charac
teristically developed, although the great bulk of the ooze is made up of
entire shells and fragments of shells of the above-described fora-
minifera, there is frequently a considerable proportion (amounting in

the shells and the interstices between them, and forms a kind of matrix
or cement. This granular substance is, like the shells, calcareous, dis
appearing in weak acid to a small insoluble residue ; with a low micro
scopic power it appears amorphous, and it is likely to be regarded, at first
sight, as a paste made up of the ultimate calcareous particles of the dis
integrated shells ; but under a higher power it is found to consist almost

observed by Mr. Murray and naturally called                      him " rhabdospheres."
Coccospheres and rhabdospheres live abundantly on the surface, especially
in warmer seas. If a bucket of water be allowed to stand over night
with  afew pieces of thread in        it,
                                   on examining the threads carefully
many examples may usually be found attached to them but Mr. Murray   ;
has found an unfailing supply of all forms in the stomachs of Salpa.
   What these coccospheres and rhabdospheres are, we are not yet in                      a
position to say with certainty but our strong impression
                                  ;                       that they are  is
either Algae of  a  peculiar form, or the reproductive gemmules or the
sporangia of some minute organism, probably an Alga                  ;   in which latter
case the coccoliths and rhabdoliths      might be regarded as representing in

position   and function the       amphidisci   on the surface of the gemmules
 of Spongilla, or the spiny facets on the zygospores of many of the Des-
mideae.    There are many forms of coccoliths and rhabdoliths, and many
of these are so distinct that they evidently indicate different species. Mr.
Murray believes, however, that only one form       met with on one sphere
                                                   is                                    ;
and that, in order to produce the numerous forms figured by Haeckel and
Oscar Schmidt, all of which, and many additional varieties, he has
observed, the spheres must vary in age and development, or in kind.
Their constant presence in the surface-net, in surface-water drawn in                    a
bucket, and in the stomachs of surface-animals, sufficiently proves that,
like the ooze-forming Foraminifera, the coccoliths and rhabdoliths, which
enter so largely into the composition of the recent deep-sea calcareous
formations, live on the surface and at intermediate depths, and sink to
                        "

 paratively small ; and to this circumstance the extreme clearness and the
 unusual appearance of being composed of Globigerince alone was pro
 bably mainly due. We found the same kind of ooze, nearly free from
 coecoliths and rhabdoliths,         in what may be considered about a corre
 sponding    latitude   in the north,    to the west of Faroe.
    Before leaving the subject of the modern Chalk, it may be convenient
 to pass on to stations 158, 159, and 160, on March 7th, 10th, and 13th,
 on our return voyage from the ice.             The first two of these, at depths
of 1800 and 2150 fathoms respectively, are marked on the chart " Glo-

spond in latitude with the like belt which we crossed going southwards ;
the  third sounding, at a depth of 2600 fathoms, is marked " red clay."
    According to our present experience, the deposit of " Globigerinarooze
                                                                                    "
is limited to water of a certain depth, the extreme limit of the pure
characteristic formation being placed at a depth of somewhere about
2250 fathoms.         Crossing    from these shallower      regions occupied by the
ooze   into deeper soundings, we find universally           that the calcareous for
mation gradually passes into, and is finally replaced by, an extremely fine
pure clay, which occupies, speaking generally, all depths below 2500
fathoms, and consists, almost entirely, of a silicate of the red oxide of
iron and alumina.         The transition is very slow, and extends over several
hundred fathoms of increasing depth ; the shells gradually lose their sharp
ness of outline and assume a kind of
                                                  " rotten " look and a brownish
colour, and become more and more mixed with a fine amorphous red-
brown powder, which increases steadily in proportion until the lime has
almost entirely disappeared.            This brown matter is in the finest possible
state of subdivision, so fine that when, after sifting it to separate any
organisms it might contain, we put it into jars to settle, it remained for
days    in suspension, giving the water very much the appearance and
colour of chocolate.
   In indicating     the nature of the bottom on the charts, we came from
experience, and without any theoretical consideration, to use three terms
for soundings in deep water.              Two of these, Gl. oz. and r. el., were
very definite, and indicated strongly marked formations, with apparently
but few characters     in common      ; but we frequently got soundings which we
could not exactly call either
                                   " Ghbigerina-oozQ " or " red clay ; " and before
we were fully aware of the nature of these we were in the habit of indi
                     " grey ooze " (gr.                                       " grey
cating them as                               oz.). We now recognize the
      "
ooze     as an intermediate    stage between the Globigerina-ooze and the red
clay ; we find that, on one side as it were of an ideal line, the red clay
contains more and more of the material of the calcareous ooze, while,
on the other, the ooze is mixed with an increasing proportion of
                                                                               " red

   Although we have met with the            same phenomenon so frequently,      that
we were at length        able to predict     the nature   of the bottom from the

depth of the sound, with absolute certainty, for the Atlantic and the
Southern Sea, we had perhaps the best opportunity of observing it in our
first section across the Atlantic, between Teneriffe and St. Thomas. The
first four stations on this section (PI. IV.), at depths from 1525 to 2220
fathoms, show " Globigerina-ooze ? From the last of these, which is about
300 miles from Teneriffe, the depth gradually increases to 2740 fathoms,
at 500, and 2950 fathoms, at 750 miles from Teneriffe.            The bottom in
these two soundings might have been called
                                                  " grey ooze ;" for although its
nature has altered entirely from the
                                          " Globigerina-ooze," the red clay into
which it is rapidly passing still contains a considerable admixture of car
bonate of lime.
    The depth goes on increasing, to a distance of 1 150 miles from Tene
riffe, when it reaches 3150 fathoms ; there the clay is pure and smooth,
 and contains scarcely a trace of lime.      From this great depth the bottom
 gradually rises, and, with decreasing depth, the grey colour and the cal
careous composition of the ooze return.        Three soundings in 2050, 1900,
 and 1950 fathoms on the
                                " Dolphin Rise," gave highly characteristic
 examples of the Globigerina formation. Passing from the middle plateau
 of the Atlantic into the western trough, with depths a little over 3000
 fathoms, the red clay returns in all its purity : and our last sounding, in
 1420 fathoms, before reaching Sombrero, restored the Globigerina-ooze
 with its peculiar associated fauna.
    This section shows also the wide extension and the vast geological
 importance of the red-clay formation.        The total distance from Teneriffe
 to Sombrero is about 2700 miles. Proceeding from east to west, we have
                  About 80 miles of volcanic mud and sand.

    The following Table, taken from the chart, gives a good general idea
 of the distribution of the two formations with respect to depth. It can
 not of course be taken as exact ; the indications were jotted down from
 the impression of colour given at the time, and there is no hard and
 fast line between Globigerina-ooze and grey ooze on the one hand, and
 between red clay and grey ooze on the other.                The Table gives an
 average depth of 1800 fathoms for our soundings in the Globigerina-
  ooze.   This is a datum  of no value  ; for we only rarely sounded in shallow
  water, and we know      that this formation     covers large areas at depths
  between 300 and 400 fathoms ; but the mean maximum depth at which it
  occurs is important, and that may be taken from the Table as about
  2250 fathoms.     The mean depth at which we find the transition grey
  ooze is 2400 fathoms ; and the mean depth of the red-clay soundings is

                 Challenger     Soundings in the Southern Sea.          41
about 2700   fathoms.      The general concurrence of so many observations
would go  far to prove, what seems now to stand, indeed, in the position of
an ascertained     fact, that wherever the depth increases from about 2200
to 2600 fathoms, the modern Chalk formation of the Atlantic and of
other oceans passes into a clay.

   The nature and      origin of this vast deposit of clay is a question of the
very greatest    interest ; and although   I think there can  be no doubt that
it is in the  main solved, yet some matters of detail are still involved in

 difficulty.   My first impression was, that it might be the most minutely
 divided  material,  the ultimate sediment, produced by the disintegration of
 the land, by rivers and by the action of the sea on exposed coasts, and
 held in suspension and distributed by ocean currents, and only making
 itself manifest in places unoccupied by the Globigerina-ooze.                Several
 circumstances    seemed,      however,  to   negative  this mode   of  origin. The
 formation seemed too uniform ; whenever we met with it, it had the
 same character, and      it only varied in composition in containing         less or
 more carbonate of lime.
    Again, we were gradually becommg more and more convinced that all
 the important elements of the Globigerina-ooze lived on the surface ; and
 it seemed evident that, so long as the conditions          on the surface remained
 the same, no alteration         of contour    at the bottom could possibly pre
 vent its accumulation      ;  and the surface conditions      in the Mid-Atlantic
were very uniform, a moderate current of a very equal temperature pass
ing continuously over elevations and depressions, and everywhere yield
ing to the tow-net the ooze-forming Foraminifera in the same proportion.
The   Mid- Atlantic swarms with pelagic Mollusca ; and, in moderate depths,
the shells of these are constantly mixed with the Globigerina-ooze, some
times in number sufficient to make up a considerable portion of its bulk.
It  is clear that these shells must fall in equal numbers upon the red clay ;
but scarcely a trace of one of them is ever brought up by the dredge on
the red-clay area.      It    might be possible to explain the absence of shell-
secreting animals      living on the bottom by the supposition that the
nature of the deposit was injurious to them ; but then the idea of a
current sufficiently strong to sweep them away is negatived by the
extreme fineness of the sediment which is being laid down ; the absence
of surface shells appears to be intelligible only on the supposition that
they are in some way removed.
    We conclude, therefore, that the         " red clay " is not an additional sub
stance introduced from without, and occupying certain depressed regions
on account of some law regulating its deposition ; but that it is produced
by the removal, by some means or other, over these areas, of the carbonate
of lime which forms probably about 98 per cent, of the material of the
 Globigerina-ooze.     We can trace, indeed, every successive stage in the
removal of the carbonate of lime in descending the slope of the ridge or
plateau where the Globigerina-ooze is forming, to the region of the clay.
We find, first, that the shells of pteropods and other surface Mollusca,
which are constantly falling on the bottom, are absent, or if a few remain
they are brittle and yellow, and evidently decaying rapidly. These shells
of Mollusca decompose more easily, and disappear sooner, than the smaller
and apparently more delicate shells of Bhizopods.              The smaller Forami
nifera  now   give way   and    are found   in lessening proportion to the larger   ;
the coccoliths first lose their thin outer border and then disappear, and
the clubs of the rhabdoliths get worn out of shape and are last seen,

under a   high power, as minute cylinders scattered over the field. The
larger  Foraminifera   are attacked, and instead of being vividly *white
and delicately sculptured, they become brown and worn, and finally they
break up, each according to its fashion ; the chamber-walls of Globigerina
fall into wedge-shaped pieces which quickly disappear, and a thick rough
crust breaks away from the surface of Orbulina, leaving a thin inner
sphere, at first beautifully transparent, but soon becoming opaque and
crumbling away.
   In the mean time, the proportion of the amorphous " red clay " to the
calcareous elements of all kinds, increases, until the latter disappear, with
the exception of a few scattered shells of the larger Foraminifera, which
are still found, even in the most characteristic samples of the " red clay."
    There seems to be no room left for doubt that the red clay is essenti
ally the insoluble residue, the ash, as it were, of the calcareous organisms
which form the Globigerina-ooze, after the calcareous matter has been by
some means removed.       An ordinary mixture of calcareous Foraminifera
with the shells of Pteropods, forming a fair sample of " Globigerina-ooze
                                                                            "
from near St. Thomas, was carefully washed and subjected by Mr.
 Buchanan to the action of weak acid ; and he found that there remained,
 after the carbonate of lime had been removed, about one per cent, of a
 reddish mud, consisting of silica, alumina, and the red oxide of iron.
 This experiment has been frequently repeated with different samples
 of " Globigerina-ooze" and always with the result that a small proportion
 of a red sediment remains, which possesses all the characters of the " red
clay."
   In the Globigerina-ooze,     siliceous bodies, including the spicules of
Sponges, the spicules and tests  of Radiolarians, and the frustulesof Diatoms
occur in appreciable proportion ; and these also diminish in number, and
the more delicate            of them disappear in the transition from the calcareous
ooze   to the " red clay."
   I havealready alluded to the large quantity of nodules of the peroxide
of manganese which were brought up by the trawl from the red-clay area
on the 13th of March.    Such nodules seem to occur universally in this
formation.       No manganese can be detected in the Globigerina-ooze                 ;   but no
sooner has the removal    of the carbonate of lime commenced than small
black grains make their appearance, usually rounded and mammillated on
the surface, miniatures, in fact, of the larger nodules which abound in the
clayand, at the same time, any large organic body, such as a shark's tooth,
       ;
that may happen  to be in the ooze is more or less completely replaced by
manganese ; and any inorganic body, such as a pebble or a piece of pumice,
is coated      with     fine black mammillated layer. It

what the proportion of manganese in the red clay may be, but             very    it       is
considerable. At  station   160, on the 13th of March, the  trawl brought up
nearly  bushel of nodules, from the size of
           a                                    walnut to that of an orange
                                                       a                                        ;
but these were probably the result of the             sifting of   a   large quantity of the

clay.    The manganese is doubtless, like the iron, set free by the decompo
sition of the organic bodies and tests.       It is known to exist in the ash
of   some Algae to the amount of 4 per cent.
    The interesting question now arises as to the cause and method of the
removal of the carbonate of lime from the cretaceous deposit ; and on this
matter we are not yet in a position to form any definite conclusion.
    One possible explanation is sufficiently obvious. All sea-water contains
a certain    proportion of free carbonic acid, and Mr. Buchanan believes
that he finds   it rather in excess in bottom-water from great depths. At
all events, the quantity present is sufficient to convert into a soluble com
pound, and thus remove a considerable amount of carbonate of lime. If the
balance of supply be very delicately adjusted, it is just conceivable that
the lime in the shells, in its fine state of subdivision, having been attacked
by the sea-water from the moment of the death of the animal, may be
entirely dissolved during its retarded passage through the half mile or so
of water of increasing density.     A great deal of the bottom-water in these
deep troughs has been last at the surface, in the form of circumpolar
freshwater ice ; and though fully charged with carbonic acid, it is possible
that it may be comparatively free from carbonate of lime, and that its
solvent power may thus be greater.
    The red clay or, more probably, the circumstances which lead to its
deposition seem on the whole unfavourable to the development of animal
life.   Where its special characters are most marked, no animals which
require much carbonate of lime for the development of their tissues or of
their habitations appear to exist. Our growing experience is, that although
animal life is possible at all depths, after a certain depth, say 1500
fathoms, its abundance diminishes.       This would seem to indicate that the
extreme conditions of vast depths are not favourable to its development ;
and one might well imagine that the number of shell-building animals
might decrease, until the supply of lime was so far reduced as to make
it difficult for them to hold their own against the solvent power of the
water of the sea — just as in many districts where there is little lime, the
shells of land and freshwater mollusks are light and thin, and the animals
themselves are stunted and scarce.
    It seems, however, that neither the extreme depth at which the red
clay is found, nor the conditions under which it is separated and laid
down, are sufficient entirely to negative the existence of living animals,
even of the higher invertebrate orders.          In several of the hauls, we
brought up     Holothurids   of  considerable  size, with the calcareous neck-
rings very rudimentary, and either no calcareous bodies in the test, or a
mere trace of such.        Nearly every haul gave us delicate branching
Bryozoa, with the zooecium almost membranous.              One fortunate cast,
about 150 miles from Sombrero, brought up, from a depth of 2975 fathoms,
very well-marked red mud, which did not effervesce with hydrochloric
acid. Entangled in the dredge, and imbedded in the mud, were many of

the tubes    of a tube-building annelid, several of them 3 to 4 inches long,
and    containing the worm, a species of Myriockele, still living. The
 worm-tubes, like all the tests of Foraminifera from the same dredging,
were made up of particles of the red clay alone.
    It seems evident, from the observations here recorded, that clay, which
we have hitherto looked upon as essentially the product of the dis
integration of older rocks, under certain circumstances, may be an organic
formation like chalk ; that, as a matter of fact, an area on the surface of
the globe, which we have shown to be of vast extent, although we are
still far from having ascertained its limits, is being covered by such a
deposit at the present day.
    It is impossible to avoid associating such       a formation   with the fine,
smooth,    homogeneous clays and schists, poor in fossils, but showing
worm-tubes^pd tracks, and bunches of doubtful branching things, such
as Oldhamia, siliceous sponges, and thin-shelled peculiar shrimps.          Such
formatwi^. more or less metamorphosed, are very familiar, especially to
the^lpttebt of palaeozoic geology, and they often attain a vast thickness,
vne is inclined, from this great resemblance between them in composition
and in the general character of the included fauna, to suspect that these
may be organic formations, like the modern red clay of the Atlantic and
Southern Se*, accumulations of the insoluble ashes of shelled creatures.
    The dredging in the red clay on the 13th of March was unusually
ritk.    The bag contained examples, those with calcareous shells rather
stunted, of most of the characteristic deep-water groups of the Southern
Sea, including Umbellularia,      Euplectella, Pterocrinus, Brisinga, Ophio-
glypha, Pourtcdesia, and one or two Mollusca.            This is, however, very
 rarely  the  case.   Generally the  " red clay

                                                  is  barren,  or contains only a
 very small number of forms.
    On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3,
 lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the sounding-instrument       came up filled
 with a very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced with
 acid, and dried into a very light impalpable white powder.           This, when
 examined    under   the microscope,   was found  to   consist almost entirely of
 the frustules of Diatoms, some of them wonderfully perfect in all the
 details of their ornament, and many of them broken up.            The species of
 diatoms entering into this deposit have not yet been worked up, but they
 appear to be referable chiefly to the genera Fragillaria, Coscinodiscus,
  Chcrtoeeros, AsterompJiahts, and Diclyocha, with fragments of the sepa
 rated rods of a singular siliceous organism, with which we were un
 acquainted, and which made up a large proportion of the finer matter of
  this deposit. Mixed with the Diatoms there were a few small Globigerinas,
  some of the tests and spicules of Sadiolarians, and some sand particles ;
  but these foreign bodies were in too small proportion to affect the
  formation as consisting practically of diatoms alone.           On the* 4th of
  February, in lat. 52° 29' S., long. 71° 36' E., a little to the north of the

Heard Islands, the tow net, dragging a few fathoms below the surface,
came up nearly filled with a pale yellow gelatinous mass.              This was
found to consist entirely of Diatoms of the same species as that found at
the bottom. By far the most abundant was the little bundle of siliceous rods
(PI. III. fig. 5) fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one
another at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a
spindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome
of the Diatomacea. Like the " Globigerina-oous" then, which it succeeds
to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the materials
of this siliceous deposit are derived entirely from the surface and inter
mediate depths.        It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not appear to
be in such large numbers on the surface over the Diatom-ooze as they
were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by our
not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net ; or it is possible
that when we found              it,
                              on the 11th of February, the bottom deposit was
really shifted      little to the south by the warm current, the excessively

of the two stations, that of the 11th of February, on our southward
voyage, and that of the 3rd of March, on our return, we brought^up
fine sand and greyish mud, with small pebbles of quartz and felspar, and
small fragments of mica-slate, chlorite-slate,        clay-slate, gneiss, and
granite.     This deposit,    have no doubt^was derived from the surface

like the others, but, in this case, by the melting of icebergs and the
precipitation of foreign matter contained in the ice.
   We never saw any trace of gravel or sand, or any material neeessarilv
derived from land, on an iceberg.        Several showed vertical or irregular
fissures filled with discoloured ice or snow     but, when looked at closelv,

the discoloration proved usually to be very slight, and the effect, at             a
distance, was usually due to the foreign material which filled the fissure
reflecting light less perfectly than the general surface of the berg.              T
conceive that the upper part of one of these great tabular southern ice
bergs, including           by
                      far the greater part of its bulk, and culminating in
the portion exposed above the surface of the sea, was formed by the
piling up of successive layers of snow throughout the period, amounting
perhaps to several centuries, during which the ice-cap was slowly forcing
itself over the low land and out to sea, over long extent of gentle slope,

     sea  is readily understood.         If any such exist it must be confined to the
     lower part of the berg, to that part which has, at one time or other,
     moved on the floor of the ice-cap.
        The icebergs, when they are first dispersed, float in from 200 to 250
    fathoms.        When, therefore, they have been drifted to latitudes of 65°
    or 64° S., the bottom       of the berg just reaches the layer at which the tempe
    rature of the water is distinctly rising ; and it is rapidly melted, the mud
    and pebbles with which it is more or less charged being precipitated to
    the bottom.         That this precipitation takes place all over the area where
    the  icebergs     are breaking up constantly, and to a considerable extent, is
   evident from the fact of the soundings being entirely composed of such
.   deposits ; for the Diatoms, Globigerincp, and Kadiolarians are present on
   the   surface     in large numbers     ; and unless the deposit from the ice were
   abundant       it would soon     be covered and masked by a layer of the exuvia
   of surface-organisms.

follows : —
      Gentlemen,
It  has been represented to me that, the Royal Society being now, after
eighteen years of temporary accommodation, settled in quarters of which

 we hope  to  retain undisturbed occupation for some generations to come,
 an account of the present position of the Society in respect of our more
 important possessions, foundations, and functions, and our relations to
 the Government, would not only be generally acceptable, but might even
be required of me by that large and increasing class of Fellows who live
far from our doors.       This class now numbers ns nearly as possible one
half of the Society, few of whom can be even occasional attendants at our
 Meetings ; and if to this class of absentees be added the large num
 ber of residents within the metropolitan district whose avocations prevent
 their attending, it will not surprise you to hear that (as I have ascer
 tained by careful inquiry) a very large proportion of our fellow Members
 know little of the Society's proceedings beyond what appears in our perio
dical publications, nor of our collections, nor of the tenure under which we
occupy our apartments under the Crown — and that many have never hoard
of the funds we administer, whether our own or those voted by Parlia
ment in aid of scientific research, nor of the fund for relief of the ne
cessitous, nor of the gratuitous         services rendered by the Society to
various departments of the Government.
    Unlike the great Academies of the continent, the Royal Society has
never published an Almanack or Annuaire containing               information upon
its privileges, duties, constitution,      and management.          Particulars on
these points are for the most part now accessible to the Fellows only
by direct   inquiry, or through the Council Minutes ; and these, to non
resident Fellows, are practically inaccessible.        In my own case, though
I have long been a resident Fellow and had the honour of serving on
your Councils for not a few years, it was not until               I  was placed in
the position    I  now hold that    I  became aware of the number and mag
nitude of the Society's duties, or of the responsibility             these impose
on your officers.
    It is upwards    of a quarter of a century    since an account of the foun
dations that      then existed and the work the Society then carried on
                                                          '
 was   published in Weld's valuable, but too diffuse,        History of the Royal
Society.'    These have all been      greatly modified or extended since that
period ; and many others have been added to them : so that the time has
now arrived when a statement of the large funds applicable to scientific
research which the Society distributes, the conditions under which these
are to be    applied for, and other particulars, might with advantage be
published in a summary form and distributed to the Fellows annually.
    Finance. — After    the financial statement made by the Auditors, you
will,  I am sure conclude 'that there is no cause for apprehension in respect
of the Society's funds or income ; and when to this            I  add that the ex
penses of removal from the old House, including new furniture, amount
to  £1300,     and that the volume of Transactions          for the present year
will contain eighty-six Plates, the largest number hitherto executed at the
                                                                       i2

Society's cost within the same period, you will also conclude that there
is no want of means for providing illustrations to papers communicated
to us for publication.
     The landed property of the Society, as stated in the printed balance-
sheet now before you, consists of an estate at Acton, in the neighbour
hood of London, and an estate at Mablethorpe,              Lincolnshire ; each
yielding     a  good  rental.   The   Acton estate, at present on lease to an
agricultural tenant, is planned to be let as building land, for which      it is
 favourably situate, and will thus become increasingly valuable.
     The subject of the tenure under which the Society holds the apart
 ments we now occupy was brought up on a question of Insurance. That
 question has been satisfactorily settled by reference to the Treasury :
 but it may still be worth while briefly to state the facts which the Council
 considered as furnishing valid grounds for appealing against the require
 ment to insure, and for at the same time requesting an assurance that the
 permanence of our tenure is in no way weakened by our removal to this
 building. These are : — that when the apartments in Somerset House were
 originally assigned to the Society by command of George III., they were
            " during the pleasure of the Crown without
 granted                                                    payment of rent or
 any   other   pecuniary  consideration  whatever;"  that the  Society was not
 required to insure either in Somerset House or old Burlington House ;
  that when the Society removed at the request of the Government from
  Somerset House, and accepted temporary accommodation in Burlington
  House, it was under the written assurance of the Secretary of the
  Treasury, addressed to the President of the Society, that the claims of
  the Society to " permanent accommodation should not be thereby in any
  respect weakened;" that in the debate on the estimates in 1857, the
  Secretary of the Treasury stated, in his place in Parliament, that
                                                                          " the
  Society could not be turned out of Somerset House without its own
  consent," and that " it was entitled to rooms by Royal grant."
      To this appeal the Lords Commissioners returned a satisfactory answer :
  and their letter, dated October 27th last, assures us " that there is no
   intention on the part of the Treasury to alter the terms on which the
  Eoyal Society holds its appointments under the Crown ; the conditions
  of the Society's tenure will therefore be the same as those on which it
   occupied rooms in Somerset House, and was subsequently transferred
   to Burlington House."
                                                                  I
      While feeling it my duty to lay these details before you, must accom
   pany them with the assurance that nothing has occurred during this cor
  respondence to disturb the unbroken harmony that has existed between
  Her Majesty's Government and the Royal Society ever since our occu
   pation of apartments under, favour of the Crown.
      On every occasion of change of quarters the Society has received
  abundant proofs of the regard shown by the Government for its position.

   1874.]                       President's Address.                         5.3
  requirements, and continued prosperity; and there is, 1 am sure, every
  disposition on the part of the Government to recognize the fact that the
 privileges conferred on the Society are fully reciprocated by ihe multifa
 rious aid and advice furnished by your Council in matters of the greatest
 importance to the well-being of the State.
    The practice of electing Fellows of the so-called privileged class whose
qualification^ were limited to accident of lineage or political status, has
been viewed with grave dissatisfaction by many, ever since the election
of ordinary Fellows was limited to fifteen.           The Council has in con
sequence felt it to be its duty to give most careful attention to the
subject, which it referred to a Committee, whose report has been
adopted and embodied in a bye-law.
    The privileged class consisted, as you are aware, of certain Royal per
sonages, Peers of the Realm and Privy Councillors (Statutes, Sect. IV.
cap. 1 ) ; and they were balloted for at any meeting of the Society, after
a week's notice given on the part of any Fellow, without a suspended
certificate, or other form whatever.
    The Committee reported        that it was desirable to retain the power of
electing, as a
                 " privileged class," persons who, while precluded    by public
duties or otherwise        from   meeting   the scientific requirements custo
mary in the case of ordinary Fellows, possessed the power and had
shown the wish to forward the ends of the Society, and recommended
that  the class should be limited to the Princes of the Blood Royal, and
members of     Her Majesty's Privy Council. And with regard to the
method of election, they recommended that a Prince of the Blood Royal
might be publicly proposed at any ordinary meeting, and balloted for at
the next ; that, with regard to a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council,
he might be proposed at any ordinary meeting by means of a certificate
prepared in accordance with Chap. I. Sect. 3 of the Statutes, membership
of the Privy Council being the only qualification stated — the certificate
being, with the Society's permission, suspended in the meeting-room till
the day of election, which should fall on the third ordinary meeting after
suspension.
    Having regard to the eminent services to the State which have been
rendered by Privy Councillors, and to the fact that all Peers who do
render such services are habitually enrolled on the list of Privy Coun
cillors, it was believed by the Council that the effect of thus limiting the
privileged class would be that the doors of the Society would remain open
to all such Peers as desire and deserve admission, but who have not the
ordinary    qualifications for fellowship ; while all such Peers as might
appear with claims which compete with those of ordinary candidates
would prefer owing the fellowship to their qualifications rather than to
their birth.
    The Council     hopes that by this means the so-called privileged class

54                             Anniversary Meeting.                     [Nov. 30,
will  be reinforced,     and that statesmen      who may have considered them
selves inelegible through want of purely scientific qualifications, or who
have hesitated to offer themselves from the fear of interfering with
the scientific claims of others, will in future come forward and recruit
our ranks.
    A   passing notice of th ; manner of proposing candidates for the ordi
nary class of fellowship may not be out of place. Theoretically this is
done by a Fellow who is supposed to be a frieud of the candidate, is
versed in the science on which his claims are founded, and is satisfied of
his fitness in all respects for fellowship.         It is most desirable that the
Fellow who proposes a candidate should          take upon himself the whole duty
and responsibility of preparing the certificate, should sign it first, and
himself procure the signatures of other Fellows in whose judgment of the
candidate's qualifications the Council and the Society may place implicit
confidence.      It is unsatisfactory   to see attached to a candidate's certificate
an ill-considered     list of signatures, whether given from personal or from
general knowledge ; and the happily rare practice of soliciting signature s
and support, directly or indirectly, by the candidate himself, cannot be
too strongly deprecated. For obvious reasons the President, Officers, and
other Members of Council have hitherto during their periods of office
abstained from proposing a candidate of the ordinary class or from signing
 his certificate, but have not withdrawn their signatures from certificates
sent in before they took office. The Council and Officers will probably
 not feel the same objection to signing the certificates of candidates of the
 privileged class, as these will not be selected for ballot by the Council,
 but will be elected by the Society at large at their ordinary meetings.
    In carrying      on the business of the Society the Council is much
 indebted to Committees appointed annually for special purposes, or to
 whom an occasional question is referred.              The annual appointments
 include the Government-Grant, the Library, the Soiree, and the Acton-
 Estate    Committees.      The temporary Committees of the past year have
 been    the Circumnavigation,        the Transit -of -Venus -Expeditions, the
 Arctic, the House, the Brixham-Cave, the Privileged-Classes,              and the
 Davy-Medal Committee.            Besides these there are two permanent Com
 mittees, the Meteorological         and the Scientific-Relief, to which fresh
 Members are appointed as vacancies occur.            From these designations it
 will be understood that some of the Committees have been occupied
 with questions connected with the Government service, while others have
 devoted themselves exclusively to the business of the Society.
    I  shall now mention such of the labours of these Committees as seem
 to be most worthy of your attention.
    The Meteorological Committee of the Board of Trade, as it ought to
 be called, discharges in all respects the most arduous and responsible
duties of any, controlling as it does the whole machinery of the British

    1874.]                        President's Address.                            55
    Government      for the making, registering, and publishing of especially
     oceanic meteorological   phenomena throughout the globe.
        The primary purpose for which this and all similar offices were esta
1    blished, was the acceleration of ocean passages for vessels by an accurate
I   investigation of the prevalent winds and currents.         In other words, their
   great object is to aid the seaman in what Captaiu Basil Hall called " one
   of the chief points of his duty" — namely, "to know when to find a fair
  wind, and where to fall in with a favourable current." The first impulse
  to the formation       of an Office for this purpose was given by the late
  General Sir J. Burgoyne, who in 1852 started the idea of laud obser
  vations to be carried out by the Corps of Royal Engineers.
       Shortly afterwards our Government corresponded with the United-
  States Government on the subject of cooperating in a scheme for land
  observations,     which was followed by a suggestion on the part of America
  that the operations should be extended to the sea.
       The correspondence was referred to the Royal Society, which warmly
  approved the scheme of sea observations, but saw many difficulties in
  carrying out that for the land. The Brussels Conference followed in
  1853, when representatives of most of the maritime nations assembled and
   adopted a uniform plan of action.          Soon after this, Lord Card well, then
    President of the Board of     Trade,   established the Meteorological Depart
    ment of that office, and placed the late Admiral FitzRoy at the head of it —
   the Royal Society, at the request of the Government, supplying copi
   ous and complete instructions for his guidance, which were drawn up
   mainly by Sir Edward Sabine.            Admiral FitzRoy's zeal and his great
   labours are known to all ; he worked out the system of verifying and
   lending    instruments,    planning surveys, registering observations, pub
   lishing results ; and, lastly, himself originated the plan of predicting the
   weather, and establishing storm-signals at the sea-ports along the coast.
       On Admiral FitzRoy's death in 1865 the Royal Society was again
   consulted as to the position and prospects of the Office.            Its Report,
   which did not differ materially from that of 1855, was in 1866 referred to
  a Committee, composed of a representative of the Board of Trade, of the
  Admiralty, and of the Royal Society. This Committee supported the
  previously expressed views of the Society, and suggested the placing of
  the Office under efficient       scientific  superintendence   ; upon which the
  Society, in the    same year, was requested by the Government        to undertake
  the superintendence       of what had been the Meteorological Department
  of the    Board  of Trade.    To this request the Council of the Society so far
   acceded as to nominate a Committee of eight Fellows (subsequently
   increased to ten) to undertake the entire and almost absolute control of
   the Office ; and a Parliamentary grant of £10,000 per annum was pro
   vided to maintain it.
      This is in brief the history of the connexion between the Royal Society
  and the Meteorological Office on the one hand, and between the Office and

56                           Anniversary     Meeting.                [Nov. 30,
the Government      on the other.     It is a very anomalous position,  and has
been   greatly misunderstood.       It has led to the misconception      on* the
part of some that the Society controlled the Office, and by others that
the Government (Board of Trade) controlled it, and by more that the
annual grant of £10,000 is made to and in support of the Royal Society,
or of its own objects, whereas the grant is paid direct to the Director
of the Office as soon as voted.        The Society's action is confined to the
selection of the Committee, which superintends the Office, while the Board
of Trade, leaving to the Committee the details of their operations, exercise
only a general control.         The labours of the Committee are entirely
gratuitous,    and no part     of the £10,000 is touched by them or by the
Royal Society.
    I believe there is no parallel to such an organization as this in any other
department of the Government.           It has its advantage in securing to the
Office absolute freedom from that disturbing element in the public offices,
that their heads are chosen partly on political grounds and change with
every Government, and its disadvantage in wanting the support of direct
Government authority and prestige.           Hitherto, owing to the care of the
Committee, which meets almost weekly, to the zeal and efficiency of the
Director (who is also Secretary to the Committee) and of the Marine
Superintendent, it has worked well. Into its working it is not my pur
pose to enter; its efficiency and value are fully acknowledged by the
public.    No more practical proof of this can be cited than the general
desire, supported by memorials presented to Parliament, for the restitu
tion of the storm-signals, which were discontinued after Admiral FitzRoy's
decease, on the ground of their trustworthiness having been called in
question.     It is no little testimony to the foresight of that zealous officer
that they are not only now reestablished and in full working order at
 100 stations on the coast of Great Britain, but that the very warnings
issued from Paris to the coast of France by the Government of that
couutry are actually sent to Paris from the Meteorological             Office in
London. The same warnings are transmitted along the whole European
coast, from Norway to Spain         ;  and the system has been extended       to
 Italy, Portugal, and Australia.
    The Kew Observatory, which is used also as the Central Observatory of
 the Meteorological Committee, is supported by a grant from that Com
 mittee, and by the munificence of our Fellow, Mr. Gassiot, who has
settled on it a fund which produces about £500 a year for the carrying
on of observations chiefly magnetical.

    Transit-of- Venus Committee.
                                       — Upon the representation of your Council,
Her Majesty's Government                has attached naturalists    to two of the
astronomical      expeditions      sent    out  from   this country to observe the
approaching transit of Venus.             The stations selected were the two most
inaccessible to    ordinary cruisers, and at the same time most interesting
in regard to their natural productions — namely, the island of Rodriguez in
the Mauritius group, and Kerguelen's Land in the South Indian Ocean.
   The objects and importance of these appointments were laid before
the Government in the following statement : —
   " It is
            an unexplained fact in the physical history of our globe, that all
known oceanic archipelagos distant from the great continents, with the
sole exceptions of the Seychelles and of a solitary islet of the Mascarene
group (which islet is Eodriguez), are of volcanic origin.              According to
the meagre accounts hitherto published, Rodriguez consists of granite
overlaid with limestone and other recent rocks, in the caves of which
have been found the remains of recently extinct birds of a very singular
structure.      These facts, taken together with what is known of the
Natural History of the volcanic islets of Mauritius and Bourbon to the
west of Rodriguez and of the granitic archipelago of the Seychelles to the
 north of it, render an investigation           of its natural products a matter of
exceptional •scientific interest, which, if properly carried out, cannot fail
 to be productive of most important results.
    "As regards Kerguelen's Land, this large island (100 by 50 miles)
 was last visited in 1840, by the Antarctic Expedition under Sir James
 Boss, in midwinter only, when it was found to contain a scanty flora
 of flowering plants, some of which belong to entirely new types, and an
 extraordinary profusion of marine animals and plants of the greatest
 interest, many of them being representatives of north-temperate and
  Arctic forms of life.
    "                           '
      H.M.S. ' Challenger           will no doubt visit Kerguelen's Land, and

collect largely ; but it is evident that many years would be required to
obtain even a fair representation of its marine products ; and though we
are not prepared to say that the scientific objects to be obtained by a
naturalist's  visit to Kerguelen's Land are of equal importance to those
which Rodriguez will yield, we cannot but regard it as in every respect
most desirable that the rare opportunity of sending a collector to Ker
guelen's Land should not be lost."
    I may further state as a matter of great scientific interest, that
Rodriguez contains the remains of a gigantic species of land-tortoise
allied to those still surviving in some other islands of the Mauritian
group, and that the nearest allies of these are the gigantic tortoises
of the Galapagos Islands in the opposite hemisphere of the globe, as one
of our fellows, Dr. Giinther, has shown in a paper read last Session
to the Society.     Very valuable collections of these fossils have been made
by Mr. Newton, the Colonial Secretary of Mauritius, during a brief stay
which he was enabled to make in Rodriguez; but the materials are far
from sufficient for obtaining all the information we want.
    In accordance with your Council's recommendation, the Treasury sanc
tioned the appointment of four naturalists — three to Bodriguez, and one
to Kerguelen's Land. Those sent out to Rodriguez are : — Mr. I. B. Balfour,
son of Prof. Balfour, of Edinburgh, F.R.S., who, besides being educated
as a botanist, has worked as a field geologist in the Geological Survey of
Scotland   ; he is charged with the duties   of botanist  and geologist  ; Mr.
George Gulliver, son of one of our Fellows and a pupil of Professor
Rolleston, in Oxford, who goes out as naturalist ; and Mr. H. H. Slater,
who has had great experience as a cave-explorer, and who will devote his
attention especially to the collection of fossils.
   The Kerguelen's-Land duties are undertaken by the Rev. A. E. Eaton,
M.A., a gentleman most favourably known as an entomologist, and who
had made very important collections in Spitzbergen, which he visited
for the purpose of studying its fauna and flora.       These gentlemen had,
by the last accounts, all proceeded to their destinations.
    Committee             —
               of Papers. The strength of the Society being represented
by its publications, the Committee of Papers is the one whose functions
are unquestionably the highest and most onerous, as they are the most
closely scrutinized by the Fellows and the public.
   Every member of the Council is included in this Committee, which
meets after almost every Council-meeting ; and no part of its duties is at
present performed by a subcommittee.          It appears to me to be very
doubtful whether this arrangement, even if the best, can last, owing to
the greatly increased number of papers now communicated and their
augmenting bulk, and to the value of their contents being less easily

As it is, in the majority of cases but few of the members present can

  judge    of the merits of many of the papers ; and it is not easy after a pro
  tracted     Council-meeting, and one occupied with promiscuous business, to
  til the attention of a large Committee upon subjects with which but few
 members          present may be familiar.     It is true that the Committee is aided
 in all cases by the written opinions of careful and impartial referees, and
 by the special attainments            of our Secretaries, and that it is most desi
 rable that         the sometimes divergent opinions of these should be weighed
 by   others as well as by experts        in the subjects of the papers. But for all
 this a    Committee of the whole Council is not necessary ; and though 1
should not be          disposed to advocate a return to a system once pursued of
resolving the Committee into subcommittees charged with special sub
jects, I think it possible that some other plan may meet the difficulties
of the case          and relieve our overburthened Council of much labour.            A
possible        plan for relieving both the Council and the Committee, while
securing as careful a scrutiny of the Papers as we now have, would be a
division of the labours of the Committee, and an addition of extra members
to its     number, chosen from among the Fellows, who should continue
iu office      throughout the Session. This, or some plan of the kind, would
have the        advantage of engaging more of the Fellows than at present in
the affairs        of the Society ; and   I  feel sure that bo responsible a position
as   that of Extra Member of the Committee of Papers would be accepted
with pride by t hose         Fellows who are most competent to discharge the duties.
    It   seems      convenient to refer here to suggestions that have been made
to me as      to the expediency of breaking up our Transactions or Proceedings,
or both,       into sections devoted to Physics and Biology respectively, or even
subdividing them still more.             This separation has been advocated on the
ground        that science has become so specialized that no scientific man can
grasp all        its subdivisions, that the mixed publications are cumbersome
and    difficult to consult, and that private libraries are now overburthened
with the publications           of Societies, of  each  of which   a small part would
suffice    for all their possessors' wants.         There is no question that this, if
now an        evil, will soon become intolerable ; for our publications increase
rapidly      in number of contributions, and in their bulk.           There are, how
ever, so      many considerations to be discussed before any system of relief
can be     adopted, that      I  confine myself to stating the subject as it has been
urged     upon me.
     The Society's        Library now comprehends 36,270 volumes and 10,000
 tracts, the most considerable collection of scientific works in the pos
 session of any private body ; and in respect of Transactions                and Pro
 ceedings of Scientific Academies, Societies, and Institutions,          I believe it is
 unrivalled among public bodies.
      A.  complete       Catalogue of the Scientific Books, MSS., and Letters,
 which     I   regret   to  say is unaccompanied by any historical or other infor
 mation      regarding the Library, was printed in 1830. Another Catalogue

 of the Miscellaneous Literature and Letters was printed in 1841 ; and
 there is also a manuscript Catalogue of Maps, Charts, Engravings and
 Drawings, numbering upwards of 5000.
    For some years past the Library Committee, indefatigable in steady
 endeavour, have greatly increased the value and efficiency of our Library ;
 and in 1873, previous to leaving old Burlington House for our present
 apartments, it ordered a rearrangement of the whole, and the preparation
 of a new Catalogue, which is being proceeded with as fast as the cur
 rent duties of the officers will permit.
    In the mean time the Catalogue of Transactions and Journals is printed
 for working-purposes, and will be added to until such time as the general
 Catalogue is ready for press.
    The collection of Oriental MSS. presented by Sir William Jones in
 1792, and added to by his widow in 1797, was largely consulted by
 several of the distinguished foreigners who assembled at the Oriental
 Congress in London last September.           From conversation with some of
 these gentlemen,   I  learnt that the collection contains many documents of
 the greatest value and rarity, together with some that are unique ; and it
 may be worth the consideration of the Council, whether they would not
 be more useful if transferred to, or deposited in, the India Office or
 some other   Oriental Library, where they would       be consulted   to greater
 advantage than here ?      At present they occupy part of the room devoted
 to our Archives.
    The two most noteworthy additions to the Library during the past year
 have been  : — the MSS. on logic and mathematics of our late fellow Pro
 fessor Boole, presented by his widow ; and Dr. Fayrer's collection of
 47 original drawings of the poisonous snakes of India, which are of
interest in connexion with his and Dr. Brunton's experiments on snake-
                            '
poisons, printed in our Proceedings.'
    The apartments devoted to the Library afford space for 20 years' addition
at the present rate of increase ; they are remarkably commodious ; and those
who assembled at our Soiree last spring and saw them for the first time
lighted up and decorated, will consider with me that they are not only a
noble suite of apartments, but that they are in keeping with the purposes
and the high position of the Society.
    Tou are aware that the Council resolved that the Catalogue of Scientific
Papers should be continued through the decade 1864-1873.             This work
is now progressing under direction of the Library Committee, who have
had charge of the undertaking from the commencement.             The necessary
funds are granted by a vote of the Council ; and we may hope, in the
course of the coming year, that the seventh volume of this important
work will  be ready    for publication.   And we confidently trust that the
Government     will extend its liberality by printing this as it did the former
volumes of the series.        The total outlay upon the six volumes alreadv

paper, and binding) by the Treasury ; against which must be set the
proceeds of sale, repaid to the Treasury in occasional amounts, the last
within the present year, making a total      of  one thousand pounds.
   The number of copies of the Society's Transactions distributed gratui
tously to Institutions and Individuals not Fellows of the Society is now
269, and of the Proceedings 325.
   House Committee.  — The great labours of this Committee in connexion
witi the removal into the apartments we now occupy had not terminated
at the beginning of the past Session ; and various matters have still
to be attended to.      That the arrangements the Committee has made
have given satisfaction to the Fellows at large has been amply acknow
ledged.   We are, indeed, greatly indebted to them for the knowledge,
experience, and time all so freely given in our service, as also to the
knowledge of our requirements and the practical views of our Assistant-
Secretary, upon whom fell the duty of suggesting the best disposition of
the apartments throughout this large and commodious building.          Lastly,
I would beg your permission to record the services of the eminent architect,
Mr. Barry, who has throughout shown the greatest regard to our position
and requirements, and but for whose professional ability enlisted in our ser
vice we might have found ourselves as   ill as we are now well accommodated.
   Funds and Bequests. — The Donation Fund. In 1828 our former Presi
dent, Dr. Wollaston, invested £2000 in the Three per Cents for the crea
tion of a Fund, the dividends from which were to be expended liberally
" from time to time in
                         promoting experimental researches, or in rewarding
tho3e by whom such researches have been made, or in such other manner
as shall  appear to the President and Council for the time being most
 »nducive to the interests of the Society in particular, or of Science in
general."    There is no restriction as regards nationality ; but Members
 of Council are excluded from    participation during their term of   office.
   To this Fund many liberal additions were made : Mr. Davies Gilbert
gave £1000 ;      Warburton, Hatchett, Guillemard, and Chantrey each
contributed 100 guineas.      From these gifts, and by accumulations, the
Fund in 1849 had increased to £5293.          With subsequent contributions,
and   a bequest of £500 by our eminent Fellow the late Sir Francis
Ronalds,   the total, as shown by the balance-sheet now in your hands,
 amounts to £5816 Is. Id.        In addition to the balance-sheet already
referred to, a detailed statement of grants from the       Donation Fund is, in
accordance    with a resolution   of Council, published with the Report of
the  Anniversary Meeting.
   Sir Francis lionalds died in 1873 ; his bequest (reduced by payment
of legacy duty to £450) was made, as declared in his Will, in recognition

 vatory at Kew, from the sums granted to him out of the Fund to aid
 him in the construction of his photographic apparatus for the registration
 of Terrestrial Magnetism, Atmospheric Electricity, and other Meteoro
 logical phenomena.
    Of the grants made during the past Session, T would especially men
 tion £100 to Dr. Dohrn in support of the Stazione Zoologica at Naples,
 in which two British naturalists, Mr. Lankester and Mr. Balfour, have
 recently made a valuable series of observations on marine animals.
    Among the others were a grant of £25 to Dr. Carpenter for the purpose
 of constructing an apparatus to illustrate the theory of Oceanic Circula
 tion in relation to temperature, and £50 in aid of the Sub-Wealden Explo
 ration.                                I
           In reference to this last, should remark that, in recognition of
 the important scientific results which have been obtained from the Sub-
 Wealden boring (which is now carried to a depth of 1000 feet), and in
 view of obtaining further assistance from Her Majesty's Government
 towards the work, the Council authorized me to lay before the Chancellor
 of the Exchequer such a statement as I should judge appropriate with the
 object of obtaining a grant from the public purse in aid of the boring.
    In pursuance of this resolution, I joined the Presidents of the Geo
 logical Society and of the Institution of Civil Engineers in presenting a
 Memorial, which was most favourably received, and was answered by a
promise on the part of the Treasury of £100 for every 100 feet of boring
that should be accomplished, down to a depth of 2000 feet.
    The Government Grant (of £1000 per annum) continues to be ex
pended with satisfactory results.        I must refer you to the report which
will be published in our Proceedings for the statement of the grants,
making, however, special allusion to Dr. Klein's work on the Anatomy of
the Lymphatic system, towards which £100 from this fund was granted,
and by means of which copies have been distributed to the best advantage
in this country and abroad.
    The Scientific-Relief Fund slowly augments, and has been of the greatest
service. It is almost unique among charities in costing nothing in the
working, and in being inaccessible to direct or indirect canvassing.       The
amount    hitherto expended in relief since its establishment has         been
£2240, extended to fifty-two individuals or families.
    The Gilchrist Trust.  — One of the most munificent bequests ever made in
the interest of science is that of the late Dr. Borthwick Gilchrist, a retired
Indian Medical Officer, well-known as the author of the ' Grammar of
Hindostani.'
    Dr. Gilchrist was an intimate friend of Dr. Birkbeck, Joseph Hume,
Sir John Bowring, and others of the advanced liberals of fifty years ago,
and took part in the establishment of the " London University," now
University College. He died in 1841, leaving his large fortune to be de
voted, after his wife's death, to   " the benefit, advancement, and propaga

  tion of education     and learning in every part of the world, as circum
  stances permit," the Trustees having an " absolute and uncontrolled dis
 cretion "as to the mode of applying it.        The income of the Trust, which
 is being    gradually augmented by the sale of building-lots at Sydney,
 irhere   Dr. Gilchrist had invested a considerable sum in the purchase of
an estate with a view to its ultimate rather than its immediate produc
tiveness, now amounts to' about £4000 per annum.              The Trustees have
created various Scholarships for bringing young men of ability from India
and the Colonies to carry on their education in this country ; and they
have also given assistance to various educational institutions which they
considered to have a claim for occasional help from the Fund, such as the
Working Men's College in London and the Edinburgh School of Arts ;
and they have instituted short courses of scientific lectures to working
men in London, Manchester,          Leeds, and Liverpool.
     The Trustees now desire to do something effectual for the advancement
of learning ; and a scheme— subsequently submitted to the Council of the
Boyal Society — was suggested by Dr. Carpenter, the Secretary of the Trust,
as one which seemed to him to be the most effectual for carrying out this
object ; and it was adopted by the Trustees on his recommendation.
                                         J
     In a letter addressed to myself in une last Dr. Carpenter informed your
Council that the Trustees of the Fund had resolved to employ a portion of
it in the promotion of scientific research, and empowered him to submit the
following liberal proposal to the consideration of your Council : namely, the
Trustees propose annually to entertain the question of placing £1000 at
the disposal of the Council of the Royal Society to be expended in grants
to men of proved ability in scientific research, but who, from their limited
pecuniary means, are precluded from prosecuting inquiries of great inter
est by the necessity of devoting to remunerative           work the time they
would wish to devote to such inquiries, the Council of the Society to
undertake on their part to recommend to the Trustees suitable subjects of
inquiry, competent        men circumstanced as indicated, and the sum to be
assigned     in each case.  The Trustees desire, further, that the grants should
not be regarded as eleemosynary, but rather as Studentships        carrying with
them     scientific  distinction, and not as rewards for past work, but as
means     for work to be done.
     Upon this communication (in which you cannot fail to perceive not only
an enlightened regard for the interests of science on the part of the
Trustees, but, on the part of their Secretary, an accurate perception of the
best means of supplying one of the greatest scientific needs), your Council
appointed a Committee to report on the proposal.               Their labours are
already concluded ; the proposition        has been accepted, but under stipu
lation for fulfilment of the following conditions by applicants for the
grants    : —
     That the grants should     be made  for one year only  in each case, though
subject to renewal.

                             Anniversary    Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
    That the recipients be designated Gilchrist Students for the year in
 which the grants are made.
    That no application for grants be received except it has been approved
 by the President and Council of any one of the six Societies —namely,
 the Royal, Astronomical,     Chemical, Linnean, Geological,    and Zoological   ;
 and that all applications    be submitted to a Committee,    consisting of the
 Presidents   of the six Societies together with the Officers of the Royal
 Society, which Committee shall recommend          the applicants   to the  Gil
 christ Trustees.
    That a form of application be prepared setting forth the general objects
 of the Gilchrist Studentships, and the conditions upon which they are
 conferred.
    That each Student    furnish, at the end of the year for which the grant is
 made, a report   of his progress and results, signed by himself and counter
signed by the President of the Society through which the application was
transmitted.
    Simple and acceptable as such a scheme appears, it may prove by no
means always smooth in the working. It will be easy to find subjects,
and candidates too ; but the Trustees must not expect in every case a
full annual harvest for what they annually sow, or that some of the seed
will not be productive of a crop of good intentions rather than good
fruits.   Putting aside all the temptations to procrastination that pre
payment fosters, there is the fact that every subject of scientific research
presents a labyrinth in which the investigator may wander further and
further from the main gallery, always following some tempting lateral
track leading to discovery, but never either reaching the end of it or get
ting back to that which he set out to follow.
    We must, however, hope for the best results from so munificent an
endowment of scientific research, and watch with the deepest interest
the progress of an experiment, the means for instituting which, after
being urgently called for from the Government and our Universities,
are now forthcoming      from private resources.
    The Wintritujham Bequest.— Hitherto this curious bequest has, so far as
the Society is concerned, proved alike profitless and troublesome, as
will appear from a few particulars of its history.
   Sir Clifton Wintringham, Bart., a Fellow and son of a Fellow          of this
Society, died at Hammersmith, January 10, 1794, and bequeathed           .£1200
three-per-cent. Consols (payable twelve months after the decease          of his
wife) to the Royal Society, subject to the condition that within one     month
of the pavment of the annual dividends in each year the President should
fix on the subjects for three essays in Natural Philosophy or Chemistry,
and submit them to the Society to be adopted by secret ballot.         The sub
jects were then to be advertised in the papers of London, Paris, and the
Hague : the essays were to be sent to the Royal Society within ten                 -
months of date of advertisement, each author to deliver ten copies ; and

   1874.]                      President's Address.                          65
  the  President   and nine Members     of  Council  were to choose    the best,
  and then to have made a     silver cup of £30 value, to be presented to the
  successful  essayist on the last Thursday in December.     In case of failure
 the  dividends were to be paid to the Treasurer of the Foundling Hos
 pital.
     Lady Wintringham died in 1805 ; but the Royal Society heard nothing
 of the bequest    until 1839, when steps were taken to obtain possession of
 the fund.      The Foundling Hospital put forward their claim ; legal
 proceedings    were taken, costs being paid out of accumulated dividends ;
 and in 1842 the Royal Society were put in possession of the £1 200 stock.
 Owing to the essential difficulties of carrying out the conditions of the
 testator's will, the dividends have ever since been paid to the Foundling
 Hospital.                                                               ,
    The Council, desirous that those difficulties   should be overcome, have
at  different times appointed a Committee to examine the question and
suggest if possible a solution ; but no satisfactory conclusion has yet
 been arrived at.
    The   Handley Bequest. — Mr. Edwin Handley, of Old Bracknell, Berks,
 was a country gentleman, and the possessor of a considerable landed and
personal estate in Berkshire and Middlesex.          He died in 1843, having
bequeathed the bulk of his property, after the decease of his two sisters,
to the   Royal Society.
    The last of these ladies died in 1872, since when certain        legal for
malities have been complied with, and the       claims of the Royal Society
to the   landed estates under the Mortmain Act have been brought before
the Court.      In February last the Master of the Rolls decided that " the
gifts to the Royal Society, so far as they relate to pure personalty, ara
good charitable gifts, but otherwise void."      The personalty as set forth
in the    " Bill of Complaint," comprises £6033 7s. M. Three-per-Cent.
Consols, £1904 17*. 2d. Reduced, and £41 18*. 5d. Bank-of-England
Stock.
    By the terms of the Will the Society is to preserve the property
intact   in value, as a Fund Principal, the income of which is to be applied
to the rewarding inventions in art, discoveries in science, physical or
metaphysical (" which last and highest branch of science," to quote the
testator's words, " has been of late most injuriously neglected in this
country "), or for the assistance of fit persons in the prosecution of in
ventions and discoveries.        The rewards or assistance are to be granted
annually, or after longer periods, to British subjects or foreigners,
according to the impartial decision of the President and Council.
    The Dircks Bequest. — Mr. Henry Dircks, of Liverpool, and latterly of
London, who died      in 1872,   has bequeathed the residue of his property
(about £4000), after payment of debts and charges, to the Royal Society,
Royal Society of Literature, Chemical Society, and Royal Society of
Edinburgh, in equal shares and proportions, in furtherance of their

several objects.     As, however, it is possible that certain claims to the
residue under the Bankruptcy Act, dating from 1847, may be set

the aid of the Court of Chancery,       which has been appealed to accord

   *The Ponti Will. — Lastly, it is my duty under this head to inform you
that our Secretary has received a communication from the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, to the effect that the late M. Girolamo Ponti,
of Milan, has bequeathed a portion of his immense property to the
" Academy of Science of London." As, however, it does not appear
 what Society is indicated under this title, and as the relatives of the tes
tator intend to dispute the •Will, the Council, as at present advised, will
take no steps in the matter.      I have further to observe that under the
terms of the Will, the Academy of Science will, if it accepts the trust, be
burthened with annual duties and responsibilities respecting the distri
bution of the proceeds which would be altogether inconsistent with the
position and purposes of the Royal Society.
    The Fairchild Lecture. — This Lecture no longer appears in the annual
 financial statement of your Treasurer.      Though an obvious anachronism
and regarded almost from the first with little sympathy either within or
without our walls, it should not pass away without a notice from the Chair.
In February 1728 Thomas Fairchild, of Hoxton, gardener, bequeathed £25
to be placed at interest for the payment of 20s. annually for ever for
preaching a sermon in the parish church of St. Leonard's on Tuesday in
Whitsun week on " the wonderful works of God in the creation, or on
the certainty of the resurrection of the dead proved by certain changes of
the animal and vegetable parts of the creation."          From 1733 to 1758
most of the lectures were read by Archdeacon              Denne, one of the
original   Trustees,  who  in 1746   contributed  all bis  lecture-fees to the
fund, which, with a subscription raised by the Trustees, enabled them
in 1746 to purchase £100 South Sea stock. Subsequently this stock was
offered to and accepted by the Society : the transfer was made in 1767 ;
and from that date the Lecturers were appointed by the President and
Council.     The lectures have been regularly delivered, but of late years
to empty pews, under which circumstances the Council, after full
deliberation, unanimously resolved that it was desirable to relieve the
Society from the Fairchild Trust, and that to this end application should
be made to the Charity Commissioners.         The regular forms having been
gone through,     the   Trust  was transferred    to the Commissioners      in
November last, and thus disappears from our balance-sheet.
    The Croonian and Bakerian Lectures are given annually as usual : and
those of this year appear in our Proceedings.      These do not diminish in
interest and importance.
    The Davy Medal. — The Council has accepted the duty of annually
awarding a medal, to be called the Davy Medal, for the most important

                             President's Address.                           07
discovery in Chemistry made in Europe or Anglo-America.            The history
of this medal is as follows : —
     Our former illustrious President, Sir Humphry Davy, was presented
 by the coal-owners of this country with a service of plate, for which
 they subscribed £2500, in recognition of his merits as inventor of the
 Safety Lamp. In a codicil to his will Sir Humphry left this service
 of plate to Lady Davy for her use during her life, with instructions
 that after her death it should pass to other members of the family,
 with the proviso that, should they not be in a situation to use or enjoy
 it. it should be melted and given to the Royal Society, to found a Medal
 to be awarded annually for the most important discovery in Chemistry,
 anywhere made in Europe or Anglo-America.
    On Sir Humphry's death the service of plate became the property of
his brother, Dr. John Davy, F.R.S., who, in fulfilment of Sir Humphry's
intentions, bequeathed it after the death of his widow, or before if she
thought proper, to the Royal Society, to be applied as aforesaid.       On the
death of Mrs. Davy the plate was transferred to the custody of your
Treasurer, and, having been melted and sold, realized £736 8s. 5d., which
is invested in Madras guaranteed railway stock, as set forth in the
Treasurer's balance-sheet. The legacy duty was repaid to the Society by
the liberality of the Rev. A. Davy and Mrs. Rolleston.
    The style and value of the medal, and the steps to be taken in reference
to its future award, are now under the consideration of the Council, and
       I
will, hope, be laid before you on the next Anniversary. The accept
ance of the trust has not been decided upon without long and careful deli
beration, nor without raising the question of the expediency of recognizing
scientific services and discoveries by such trivial awards as medals, and
of the extent to which the awards entrusted to our Society are depreciated
by their multiplication.    My own opinion has long been that some more
satisfactory way of recognizing distinguished merit than by the presenta
tion of a medal might be devised, and that the award might take a form
which would convey to the public a more prominent and a more permanent
record of the services of the recipients, such as a bust or a portrait to be
hung on our walls, or a profile or a record of the discovery to be engraved
on the medal, which might be multiplied for distribution or sale to Fellows
and to foreign Academies.               I
                               In short, consider awards of medals without
distinctive features to be anachronisms ; it is their purpose, not their value,
which should be well marked ; and the question      is, whether that purpose
is  well answered by their being continued under the present form.
    Instruments. — The small but remarkable and, indeed, classical collection
of instruments and apparatus belonging to the Society, and for which
there was no accommodation in old Burlington House, was, on our
migration from Somerset House in 1857, by order of the Council, depo
sited in the Observatory in the Kew Deer-Park, near Richmond, then
under the control of the British Association.

      The instruments    have been now for the most part brought back and
placed in our Instrument-Room, and will, 1 hope, at no distant period
be accessible to the Fellows.
      On the motion of General Smythe, seconded by Mr. Francis Galton,
 it was resolved — " That the thanks of the Society be returned to the
 President for his Address, and that he be requested to allow it to be
 printed."
      I  now pass to the presentation of the Medals.
      The Copley Medal has been awarded to Prof. Louis Pasteur, one of
 our Foreign Members,
                               " for his researches on Fermentation and on
 Pebrine."
       Prof. Pasteur's researches on fermentation consist essentially of two
 parts : — the first part, in which he enters exhaustively into the examina
  tion of the products formed in this process ; and the second, in which he
 takes up the question of the cause of fermentation.
       Previous   observers had noticed the production, in solutions of sugar
 which had been fermented, of substances other than the two commonly
  recognized, alcohol and carbonic acid ; but it remained for Pasteur to
  show which were essential, and which were occasional products.           In the
  series   of able papera contributed to the ' Comptes Rendus ' and to the
  '
     Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' he proved conclusively that suc
  cinic acid and glycerine were always found in fermented solutions of
  sugar, while lactic acid and acetic acid, although occasionally present,
  were not always so. He also showed that, in addition to these substances,
  a part of the sugar was converted into cellulose and fat.
       The study of the products formed during fermentation opened the way
  to the second part of the research, viz. the cause of fermentation.
       It had been found that certain solutions, when exposed to the air, soon
  became full of living organisms; and Pasteur's experiments led him to
  support the view that these organisms originated from the presence of
  germs floating in the air.       He found that no living organisms were de
  veloped    if care were taken to destroy completely all those which might be
  present in the solution, and if the solutions were then carefully sealed up
  free from air. Nor was it necessary to exclude the air, provided that pure
  air, free from germs, were admitted.        By passing the air through red-
   hot tubes or through gun-cotton before reaching the solutions, he found
  that the development of organisms, in such boiled solutions, did not take
  place.     An exception to this was notioed in the case of milk, which required
   to be heated to a higher temperature than the boiling7point of water at
   atmospheric pressure.      Pasteur showed that this was connected with the
   alkaline reaction of milk, for in all cases in which the development of
   life was prevented by heating to the boiling-point of water, the solution*

   1874.]                         President's Address.                              6!)
  had a    faintly acid reaction — but that when this was neutralized by car
  bonate    of lime, the solutions then behaved like milk.
     Prof. Pasteur also examined the gun-cotton through which the air has
 been passed ; and he found, among other things, certain cells to which he
 attributed the power of causing the growth of organisms in solutions.             By
 sowing some      of these cells in solutions which previously had remained clear,
 and    finding that such solutions speedily became turbid from the growth of
living organisms, it was proved that the air which had passed through
the gun-cotton had lost its property of causing the development of life in
solutions because the germs which the            air contained had   been stopped by
the   gun-cotton.
    The result    of the  second part   of the research may be thus summed up : —
    1. No organisms         are developed in solutions if care be taken to prevent
the possibility of the presence of germs.
    2. This negative result does not depend upon the exclusion of oxygen.
    3.   The matter      separated from ordinary air is competent to develop
organisms in solutions which previously had remained unchanged.
    Not less important were the results of Pasteur's experiments respecting
the chemical functions of the ferment.
    It  had been     held that the entire ferment was in a state of putrefactive
decomposition,        and induced a similar decomposition in the sugar with
which it was in contact.
    In corroboration of this view, it was stated that ammonia (a product of
the decomposition of albuminous substances              such as those present in the
ferment) is always found in liquids which are undergoing fermentation.
    Pasteur proved that the ammonia in fermenting liquids diminishes in
quantity in proportion as the process advances, and that the yeast-cells
increase      and grow while forming complex albuminous substances at the
expense of the ammonia and other aliments which are supplied to it.               He
found that,      in   addition  to ammonia and sugar, the cells require mineral
substances, such as phosphates and other constituents, such as are present
in the organism of every healthy and growing yeast-cell.
    In short, he proved that those conditions which are most favourable to
the   healthy growth and development of the yeast-cells are most conducive
to the      progress of fermentation, and that fermentation is impeded or
arrested by those influences which check the growth or destroy the vitality
of the cell.
    The above results are but samples          of the fruits of Pasteur's long series
 of researches      in this subject. Many and many an able investigator had
 worked     in the same field ; and such were the difficulties they encountered,
 that Dumas himself recommended Pasteur not to waste his time in working
 at so hopeless     a subject.
    To the biologist, two      of Pasteur's   researches  are of very great interest
 and   importance.       He  has shown that    Fungi find all  the materials needed
 for their   nutrition and growth in water containing an ammonia salt and

certain    mineral    constituents, and devoid of any nitrogenized organic
matter   ;   and he has proved that all the phenomena presented by the de
structive silk-worm epidemic, the pebrine (even the singular fact that it
is hereditarily transmitted through the female and not through the male),
are to be explained by the presence      of a parasitic organism in the diseased
caterpillars.
    The medal was received for Prof. Pasteur by the Foreign Secretary of
the Society.
    The Rumford Medal has been awarded to              Mr.  J. Norman Lockyer,
F.R.S., " for his Spectroscopic          Researches    on the Sun and on the
 Chemical Elements."
    Mr. Lockyer     has long been   engaged   in spectroscopic researches on the
sun.    His first observations were directed to      a scrutiny of the spectrum
 of sun-spots as compared with that of the general surface, with a view to
bring evidence to decide between two rival theories respecting their for
           '
mation.       In the course of the paper in which his first observations were
described, and which was read before the Royal Society on November
 15th, 18(36, he asks, " May not the spectroscope afford us evidence of
                                      '
the existence of the ' red flames which total eclipses have revealed to us
in the sun's atmosphere, although they escape all other modes of exami
 nation at other times     ?"
    The spectroscope     he then employed proved to be of insufficient disper
 sive power for his researches,    and he was induced to apply to the Govern
 ment-Grant Committee of the Royal Society for aid to construct one of
 greater power.       This aid was accorded, and the instrument was delivered,
 though not quite complete, on the 16th of October, 1868.           On the 20th
 his efforts were crowned by the detection of a solar prominence by means
 of the bright lines exhibited in its spectrum. An account of this discovery
 was immediately communicated to the Royal Society and to the French
 Academy of Sciences.
     Meanwhile had occurred the total solar eclipse of August 18th, 1868,
 to observe     which various parties had gone out armed with suitable in
 struments, and especially with spectroscopes, for determining the character
 of the hitherto unknown spectrum of the prominences ; and the firstfruits
 of their labours had reached Europe, showing that the spectrum in ques
 tion is one of bright lines. It occurred to Mr.' Janssen, who had observed
 with eminent      success the spectrum   of the prominences during the eclipse,
 that the same mode of observation might enable one to detect them at
 any time, and he saw them in this manner the very next day. The first
 account of this discovery, which was sent by post, did not, however, reach
 the French Academy until a few days after the communication of Mr.
  Lockyer's notice ; so that nothing interferes with the perfect independ
 ence with which these two physicists established the possibility of detecting
  the prominences at any time.

   1874.]                       President's Address.                          71
     A   discovery  like this  opened   up a new field of research, which Mr.
  lockyer was not hackward in exploring.           One of the firstfruits of the
 application of the method was the discovery of a continuous luminous
 gaseous     envelope    to the sun, which he calls the chromosphere, of
 which     the  prominences are merely local aggregations.         Evidence was
 further obtained of gigantic convulsions at the surface of the sun, which
were revealed by slight alterations of refrangibility in the lines, observed
in a manner       similar to that in which Mr. Huggins had determined the
relative velocity     of approach or recess of the Earth and Sirius.
    The interpretation of spectroscopic solar phenomena required a reexami
nation in several respects of the spectroscopic features of artificial sources
of light. Among these researches special mention must be made of Mr.
Lockyer's classification of the lines due to the metals of the electrodes be
tween which an induction discharge was passed, according to their "length,"
i. e. the distance from the electrodes to which they could respectively be
traced.      This led to the explanation of various apparent anomalies as to
the presence or absence of certain dark lines in the solar spectrum, and to
the detection of additional elements        in the sun, especially potassium, an
element which, though so common on the earth and so easily detected by
spectral analysis, had not previously been proved to exist in the sun, be
cause the attention of observers had been turned in a wrong direction, as
was shown      by these researches.
    Nor was it only in relation to solar physics that these researches bore
fruit.     They led to a quantitative determination in many cases, by means
of the spectroscope, of the proportion of the constituents in an alloy, and
afforded     new evidence of the extent to which impurities are present even
in substances     deemed   chemically pure.
    The   Medal was received by Mr. Lockyer.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to Mr. Henry' Clifton Sorby, F.R.S.,
 "for his Researches on Slaty Cleavage and on the minute Structure of
 Minerals and Rocks ; for the construction of the Micro-Spectroscope,
 and   for his Researches on Colouring-matters."
    The   principal grounds on which Mr. Sorby's claims to a Royal Medal
 rest are the following : —
    1. His long-continued        study, and his successful application of the
 microscope to the solution, of problems       in petrology.
    2.  His employment of the prism in conjunction with the microscope
 for the analysis    of the colours transmitted by substances, as well organic
 as inorganic.
    Though     Mr. Sorby's labours during the last ten years    have   been more
 particularly    devoted to observations of the latter class, his work, extend
 ing over a period that commenced in 1849, is represented in the Catalogue
  of Scientific Papers (limited by the year 1863) by no less than 47
 memoirs.      Among the more remarkable of        these must be mentioned the

 72                         Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
Reports     to the British Association   and the contributions  to the Philo
sophical Magazine (1853, 1856, 1857), in which he grappled with the
 subject of slaty cleavage, and helped to establish the explanation that
 cleavage was the result of greater relative condensation of the material
in  a direction perpendicular   to the cleavage, due in the case of rocks to
 mechanical     compression in that direction — an idea that met with imme
 diate illustration from other experimentalists.
    His memoirs on the temperatures and pressures at which certain rocks
and minerals were formed (in the Geological Society's Journal, 1858),
 founded on the relative volume of the liquid and vacuous portions of
 microscopic hollows, or, again, on the character of microscopic substances
 mingled with the mineral matter he investigated, convinced the geologist
 that he had to take into account the action of water under high pressures
 and at high temperatures in explaining the formation of granitoid rocks.
    And the refinement of the methods that Mr. Sorby employed for making
 his rock-sections at Sheffield has made those methods the models sought
 after by the now large school of Continental and English microscopic
 petrol ogists.
    His applications of spectroscopic methods to the microscope fall more
 strictly within the limit of ten years, as they have been worked out since
 1867, when Mr. Sorby first described his adaptation of the spectroscope
 to the microscope, as carried out by Mr. Browning.
    The observations he has made with this instrument, and generally by
combining optical examination with the use of chemical reagents, have ex
tended over a very wide range — such as the recognition of blood-stains, of
adulteration in wine, the means of discriminating among the compounds of
certain of the metals, chiefly of zirconium, titanium, and uranium, by the
aid of blowpipe-beads — and finally to the elucidation, to a considerable
extent, of the causes of the complexity in the tints exhibited by plants in
the different stages of development of their annual foliage and flowers.
    These are only some of the more important of Mr. Sorby 's contributions
to science ; and they are characterized by an untiring application of the
methods of experimental research to a great variety of subjects suggested
by a very ingenious and active mind.
    The Medal was received by     Mr. Sorby.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to Prof. William Crawford William
son,  F.R.S., " for his Contributions to Zoology and Palaeontology, and
especially for his Investigation into the Structure of the Fossil Plants of
the Coal-Measures."
    Professor Williamson's contributions to Biological Science were com
menced forty years ago, and embrace investigations into the structure of
the Foraminifera, the Rotifera, the scales and bones of Fishes, and the
fossil plants of the Carboniferous and Oolitic periods.      These comprise
works of great merit and value, not only on account of their accuracy

and the  extent and novelty of the observations which they contain, but
bj reason of the breadth of view and the philosophical spirit which per
vade them.
   His labours     in Vegetable      Palaeontology    are above   all  remarkable,
being alike laborious,     searching, and productive of important results.
These are embodied in six contributions (of which the last will soon ap
pear) to the Philosophical Transactions upon the organization of the Fossil
Plants of the Coal-measures —and one on the restoration of a Cycadeous tree
(Zamia gigas) from the Yorkshire Oolite, published in the Transactions
of the Linnean Society.        These are not only models of laborious research
and exact description, but they are illustrated by more than fifty plates,
devoted to microscopic analyses of vegetable tissues, obtained by making
transparent slices of the fossils.         Both the slices and the drawings are
made by Prof. Williamson himself, who thus, to his reputation                  as a
biologist, unites those     of  an  accomplished    artist and  a skilful lapidary,
qualifications which should be named along with those for which
the medal is awarded, because            no unscientific     lapidary could have
obtained equally illustrative sections, and no common artist could have
depicted them with equal exactitude.          The more important results thus
obtained refer to the structure, affinities, and reproductive organs of
Catamite* and its allies, to Lepidodendron, SigiUaria, Lepidostrobus, Astero-
phyUites, and to other genera of the Carboniferous epoch.
   In addition to these contributions to the history of previously known
genera of that epoch, Prof. Williamson has been able to show, on the one
hand, that groups of now living plants which were not previously supposed
to have a great geological antiquity, actually flourished during the Car
boniferous period, and, on the other, that plants of that period which had
been previously referred with confidence to groups now living, have in
reality other and widely different affinities.
   The Medal was received by Prof. Williamson.

    Magnetic  Work. — The Magnetograph instruments were dismounted in
 January 1874 for the purpose of thorough examination and readjust
 ment, as was announced in last Report.        The necessity for this measure
is obvious, when it is remembered that the instruments had been in unin-
 termitted action   for the period of fifteen years.
    The scale-values were accordingly     redetermined, and the instruments
 handed over   to  Mr. Adie for  examination and repair. They were returned
and   remounted in May, but have not been set in continuous action as
yet,  inasmuch as it is intended that the automatic records should be sus
pended    for the entire year, so as to commence a new series of observa
tions   with the year     1875.    The cost of these operations has been
£17 10i.
   The monthly      observations   with the absolute instruments have been
continued, as usual, by Mr. G-. M. Whipple, who also takes charge of the
general magnetic work, in which he has had the assistance, for the first
part of the year of Mr. Cullum, and latterly of Mr. Power.
   As regards the Magnetic Reductions, the Tabulations of Declination
have been completed up to the end of 1873 ; and copies           of the results
to 1872 have been intrusted, for discussion, to the two Sergeants of the
Koyal Artillery, formerly in Sir E. Sabine's office at Woolwich, who have
been in constant attendance at Kew since Nov. 1871.            The Tabulations
of Inclination and Horizontal Force have not been effected.
   Magnetic data have been supplied to Dr. Wijkander, of Stockholm, in
connexion with the Swedish Expedition to Spitzbergen, M. Diamilla
Miiller, of Florence, and Capt. Creak, R.N.
   A Unifilar and Dip-circle have been repaired        for  use at the Observa
tory, and another     pair of similar instruments have been lent to the Rev.
S.  J.  Perry, F.R.S., for  use at Kerguelen Island, on the Transit of Venus
Expedition,    as mentioned in last Report.

82                       Report of the Kew Committee.
   Meteorological Work. — The several automatic arrangements for record
ing respectively the Barometer, the Dry- and Wet-Bulb Thermometers,
the Anemometer,  and the Rain-gauge, have been maintained in constant
action under the superintendence of Mr. T. W. Baker, assisted by Mr.
Foster and Mr. Figg ; and the daily standard eye-observations for control
of the photographic records have been made regularly.
   The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly
to the Meteorological Office as in former years.   The Barograms and
Thermograms are obtained in duplicate, and one copy is preserved at Kew.
As regards the Anemograms and Hyetograms, the copy is obtained by
the method of tracing.
   In addition to the regular work of          Kew   of the self-recording
                                                           as one
Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office, the duty of
examining and checking the work of all the seven Observatories of the
same character has been carried on, in accordance with the method de
scribed in the Report of the British Association for 1869. This portion
of the work has been performed by Messrs. Cullum, Hawkesworth, and
Deane.
      A
     series of investigations have been conducted with the view of testing
the degree of accuracy attainable in the tabulation of the Thermograms
by the process described in the British-Association Report just referred
to.       It   has been found to be an improvement to set the glass tabulating-
scale by  means  of fiducial lines  traced   on the  Thermograms by photo
graphic means, in preference to setting              it,
                                                  as heretofore,         by
                                                                      standard
readings.   The great advantage    derived  from  the  new  method     the dis
                                                                          ia

      Electrometer.   — The Self-recording   Electrometer,      which had been taken
to Glasgow for alteration, as described in last Report, was returned by
Mr. White in February, and was adjusted for action on March 10.                    It
has since continued in satisfactory working order.
   Photoheliograph. — A necessity for reexamining the measurements of the
series of Kew sun-pictures having arisen, they have been retransferred to
Kew      Mr. De La Rue, and their reexamination has been undertaken,
           by
at his expense,   Mr. Whipple, assisted
                        by                 Mr. M'Laughlin, who has
                                                      by
been temporarily   engaged for this purpose.
   The eye-observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,
have been made daily       Mr. Foster, when possible, as described in the
                              by
Report for 1872, in order, for the present, to maintain the continuity of
the Kew record of sun-spots.
   Extra Observations. — The Committee, at the request of Prof. Roscoe,
F.R.S., undertook to test for year an instrument which he had devised
                                    a
for measuring the chemical intensity of daylight, as described in the Pro
                                                                               '
ceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. xxii. p. 158. The apparatus was
completed for trial in September, but        few preliminary experiments
                                                 a
showed that      required further adjustment
                   it                            so that operations in this
                                                       ;

 direction are suspended       for the present, to be resumed as soon as the
 instrument    is in a satisfactory condition.
    The daily record of temperature from Thermometers at different eleva
 tions on the Pagoda in the Royal Gardens, Kew, at the expense of the
 Meteorological Committee, was continued up to August, when it was
 interrupted, to be resumed during the winter months.
    Verifications. —This department of the Observatory has exhibited
increased activity, especially as regards the verification of Thermometers
and the construction of Standard Thermometers.

    In  addition, thirty-six Thermometers have been tested at the freezing-
 point of mercury, and one metallic Thermometer has been tested.
    Eighteen Kew Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and di
 vided at Kew.

     A  Barograph and Thermograph have been verified for Mr. Kingston
 for the Observatory at Toronto, and the values of the Scales have been
 determined as far as practicable.
     Experiments have been made with a view to the construction of an
 apparatus devised by Mr. F. Galton, F.R.S., for facilitating the verifica
 tion of thermometers, and also for rendering it possible to extend the
 range to which the Kew verifications at present apply.
     A  large stock of filled Thermometer-tubes         for the construction of
  Standards has been     laid  in, and  the tubes have been annealed.
     In the last Report mention was made of certain experiments in pro
  gress with respect to the testing of Anemometers, a piece of ground
  having been rented in the Park for erecting the instruments.
     The experience of a few months was sufficient to show that the ex
  posure in the Park was not nearly sufficiently open to afford facilities for
  testing the instruments at any but very low velocities, and not very
  satisfactorily  even in such cases.      Application was therefore made to the
  Secretary of the Crystal Palace Company for permission to employ a
  rotary machine driven by steam-power, so as to be able to vary the velo
  cities at pleasure.
     Consent having been most freely given, the experiments were com
  menced, and the instruments          tested at various velocities up to about
  30 miles an hour, the highest attainable by the apparatus.           The investi
  gations were interrupted during the summer, and will be resumed on a
  future occasion. It is hoped that by this method of artificial rotation, which
  was that employed by Smeaton in his experiments on windmill sails.
  more satisfactory results will be attained than it is otherwise possible to

                        Report of the Kew Committee.
 get.    The expense of these experiments has been defrayed by a vote of
 the  Government-Grant Fund.
    The experiments on the vibration of pendulums, which were conducted
 by Capt. Heaviside, K.E., in connexion with the Great Trigonometrical
 Survey of India, as mentioned in the last Report, were completed at the
 end of May.      The apparatus employed in the experiments, with the ex
 ception of the Russian pendulums and their accessories, was, at the re
 quest of Prof. G. G. Stokes, F.E.S., received at Kew for storage.
    The apparatus for testing Sextants, which had been temporarily re
 moved in 1873 to afford space for swinging the Bussian pendulums, has
 now been restored.       The entire cost of this restoration and all other
 expenses connected with these pendulum experiments have been defrayed
 by the  India Office.
    The collimators of the Sextant Testing-apparatus     have been arranged
so as to be illuminated by gas-jets.
   Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the
Meteorological Office (3 reams), the India Office (1 ream), the Magnetic
Observatory,    Toronto (4 reams), the Central Observatory, St. Peters
burg (1 ream), the Hohe Warte, Vienna (| ream), the Observatory of
Don Luiz, Lisbon (| ream).
   It has been found necessary to make a change in the arrangements
for obtaining waxed paper.       For many years, through the kindness of a
firm, the paper waxed at Kew has been hot-pressed at a nominal charge,
but it was not found possible to continue this arrangement for an inde
finite period.    Waxed paper has now to be purchased, ready-made, at a
considerable increase of cost, and the rate at which it is supplied to
observatories has been consequently proportionately increased.
   Mr. M'Clatcbie and Mr. Beazeley, gentlemen holding appointments
in the Chinese      Customs   Departments, and Mr. Steventon, appointed
Assistant to the Observatory at Mauritius, have received instruction in
the   manipulation and methods of testing both Meteorological and Mag-
netical instruments, and the management of the photography of the self-
recording apparatus.
   In the month of September the Superintendent was informed by the .
President of the Royal Society that that body was prepared to remove
the instruments belonging to it, which had been deposited at Kew for
storage in Sept. 1851.       Accordingly, on the 25th of September, they
were "handed over to     Mr. Ladd, Optician, who had been commissioned
by   the  Council to receive them.
   The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as the Whitworth
Lathe and Planing Machine, procured by Grants from either the Govern
ment-Grant Fund or the Donation-Fund, for the use of the Kew
Observatory, have been kept in thorough order ; and many of them are
in constant and the others in occasional use at the Observatory.

 to at any time exist either in the frog or in certain fish, was pointed out
 nearly twenty years ago by Professor Huxley, who, however, accepted,
 on the authority of Goodsir, the latter's theory of the process as true of
 Man and Mammalia.        In more recent years Kolliker and Waldeyer have
 traced out the course of the development of teeth with great accuracy
 in Man and some other Mammalia, with the result of showing that the
 usually accepted views propounded        by  Goodsir and Arnold are not by
 any means an accurate representation of what takes place in them.
    Since the date of the publication of Professor Huxley's paper,         I am
 not aware that any thing has been published bearing upon the develop
 ment of the teeth of Reptilia and Batrachia, save a paper by Dr. Lionel
 Beale upon the development of the teeth of the Newt, and a short and
inconclusive paper by Santi Sirena; with the exception of the papers
alluded to, the subject may be taken to stand in the position which it

occupied at the time of the publication of Professor Owen's             Odonto
graphy,' in which we are told that the teeth-germs of Reptiles and
Batrachia never stop at the papillary stage, but that the primitive dental
papilla sinks into the substance of the gum and becomes inclosed by a
capsule.
    The principal facts which my observations enable me to state are : —
    That there is no such thing as a " dental groove " or " dental fissure "
in the Batrachia and Sauria, but that the whole process takes place
beneath an unbroken surface of epithelium.

                                                       the teeth are developed
in a region which may be termed the area of tooth-development, varying
in form and extent in different Reptilia, but agreeing in all in possessing
the following characters : —
   It is bounded on the one side by the teeth in place and the parapet of
bone which carries them, and on the other, or inner,         side by an exceed
ingly sharply      defined  boundary, consisting  of  dense connective tissue.
At the surface, near where the functional tooth projects above the oral
epithelium, it is narrow, but it expands as it passes more deeply below the
surface. Within this area are developing tooth-sacs of different ages, the
interspaces being occupied with a loose areolar tissue, differing in
appearance from that which is seen outside the area, and appearing to be
derived from portions of older tooth-sacs, which have not been entirely
used up in the formation of the teeth.
   The individual tooth-sacs are formed thus      : an inflection of the cells of
the oral epithelium, in section like a tubular gland, passes down along
the inner side of the area above defined, until it reaches nearly to the
level of the floor of the area.      The depth tp which it penetrates is con
siderable in many forms, e. g. in the Lizards, in which, therefore, this
double layer of epithelial cells appears a mere line.
   At the bottom of this inflection of epithelial cells the adjacent tissue
assumes    the form of a small eminence (without at first any visible struc
tural alteration), while the epithelial process takes the shape of a bell
like cap over the eminence.
   This epithelial inflection then goes to form the enamel-organ ; the
 eminence becomes the dentine-organ.
   Thus the enamel-germ is the first thing recognizable, and the presence
 of this ingrowth of epithelial cells seems to determine the formation of
a dentine-organ at that particular spot which lies beneath its termi
nation.
   The enamel-organs, after they are fully formed, retain a connexion
with epithelial cells, external to the ovoid or spherical tooth-sacs, at their
summits ; and the enamel-organs of successive teeth appear to be derived
from the necks of those of their predecessors rather than from fresh
inflections from the surface of the oral epithelium, though        I  am not sure
that  this  is, in all instances, the case.
   The tooth-sac of the newt is entirely cellular, and has no special in
vestment or capsule ; under pressure it breaks up and nothing but celli
remain, as was noted by Dr. Lionel Beale.
   That of the frog has an investment, derived in the main from what
may be called the accidental condensation of the surrounding connective
tissue, which is pushed out of the way as it grows ; while in the lizard

the base      of the dentine-germ furnishes lateral prolongations, just as has
been obserraHo be the case in man.
    The dentine-organs conform closely with those of mammals ; the
odontoblast layer is very distinct, and the processes passing from these
cells into the dentine-tubes are often visible.
     The enamel-organs consist only of the outer and inner epithelia, with
out any stellate intermediate tissue ; as, in -some instances, enamel is
certainly formed, the existence of the stellate tissue is obviously non
essential.        When a tooth is moving to displace its predecessor, its sac
 travels with it, remaining intact until the actual attachment of the tooth
 to the bone by ankylosis.
 II. "       On the Structure and Development                    of the Teeth of
          Ophidia." By Charles T. Tomes, M.A.                    Communicated by
          John     Tomes,    F.R.S.     Received October 5, 1874.
                                         (Abstract.)
      Contrary to the opinion expressed by Professor Owen and endorsed
  by Giebel and all subsequent writers, the author finds that there is no
  cementum upon the teeth of snakes, the tissue which has been so named
  proving, both from a study of its physical characters and, yet more con
  clusively, from its development, to be enamel.             The generalization that
  the teeth     of all reptiles consist of dentine and cement, to which is occa
  sionally     added   enamel, must hence be abandoned.
       Without as yet pledging himself to the following opinion, the author
   believes that     in the class of Reptiles the presence of cementum will be
   found associated with the implantation of the teeth in more or less com
   plete sockets, as in the Crocodiles and Ichthyosaurs.
       The tooth-germs of Ophidia consist of a conical dentine-germ, resem
   bling in all save its shape that of other animals, of an enamel-organ,
    and of a feebly expressed capsule, derived        mainly from the condensation
    of the surrounding connective tissue.
        The enamel-organ consists only of a layer of enamel-cells, forming a
    very regular columnar epithelium, and of a few compressed cells external
    to this, hardly amounting to a distinct layer ; the enamel-organ is coex
    tensive with the dentine-germ.         There is no stellate reticulum separating
     the outer and inner epithelia of the enamel-organ.
        The successions! teeth are very numerous,          no less than seven being
     often seen   in  a single   section ; and their arrangement is peculiar, and
     quite  characteristic of the Ophidia.
        The tooth next     in order of succession is to be found at the inner side
      of the base of the tooth      in place, where it lies nearly horizontally ; but
      the others stand more nearly vertically, parallel with the jaw and with
      the  tooth in place, the youngest of the series being at the bottom.
                                                                        i 2

96              On the Development    of the Teeth of Ophidia.      [Dec. 10,
    The whole row of tooth-sacs is contained within a single general con
nective-tissue investment, which is entered at the top by the descending
process of oral epithelium, whence the enamel-germs are derived.
    As they attain considerable length, the forming teeth, which were at
first vertical,  become nearly horizontal, resuming, of course, their upright
position  once   more when they come into place.
    The clue to the whole peculiarity of this arrangement is to be found in
the extreme dilatation which the mouth of the snake undergoes. The
general capsular investment probably serves to preserve the tooth-sacs
from displacement ; while, if the forming teeth remained vertical after
they had attained to any considerable length, their points would be pro
truded through the mucous membrane when this was put upon the stretch
in the swallowing of prey.
    Just as the author   has shown in a previous communication to be the
case in the Batrachia and Sauria, the hypothetical
                                                      " papillary stage" is at
no time present.
    From the oral epithelium there extends downwards a process which,
passing between and winding around the older tooth-sacs, after pursuiug
a tortuous course, reaches the furthest and lowest extremity of the area
of tooth-development.       Here its caecal end gives   origin to an enamel-
organ, and, while it does so, buds forth again beyond it in the form of a
 cecal extremity.     Thus at the bottom of this area of tooth-development
there is a perpetual formation of fresh enamel-organs, beneath which
arise corresponding dentine-organs, or papillae, if such they can be called
 when arising thus far away from the surface.
    In essential principle, therefore, the formation of a tooth-germ is
 similar to that already described in mammals aud other reptiles, the
 difference lying principally in the enormous relative length of, and the
 tortuous course pursued by, that inflection of the oral epithelium which
 serves to form the enamel-organs.       The attachment of the tooth to the
 jaw is effected by the rapid development of a coarse bone, which is not
 derived from the ossification of the feebly expressed tooth-capsule, but
 from tissues altogether external to it.    Nevertheless this coarse bone of
 attachment adheres more closely to the tooth than to the rest of the jaw,
 from which, in making sections, it often breaks away.
    The base of the dentinal pulp assists in firmly binding the tooth to
 this new bone, being converted into a layer of irregular dentine.
    This " bone of attachment " is almost wholly removed and renewed
 with the change of each tooth.

lowing experiments were made in order to determine whether such
peculiarities exist, to note the effects of higher temperatures upon the
iodide than those employed by Fizeau (which in no instance exceeded
 100° C), and to determine the point of maximum density of the
iodide.     The phenomena which most closely approximate to those
 assigned to the iodide of silver when heated are to be found in the
 case of the anomalous expansion of ice and bismuth, and a few other
 substances which at the moment of fusion, and for         few degrees above
                                                                  a
 their point of solidification, exhibit contraction on being heated but in        ;
 these instances we have to bear in mind that       change of state

 taneously effected, or about to be effected, in the substance.       Again,
 certain crystals contract in the direction of one of their axes on the
 application of heat     ;but they expand in the direction of another axis,
and the total expansion       greater than the contraction, so that they

possess   apositive coefficient of expansion.    Garnets and     few othera
crystals undergo an increase of specific gravity  on being strongly heated,
 and slowly recover their original density.
    The iodide of silver, on the other hand, when far removed from the
 point at which    undergoes any change of state, appears to exhibit con
                    it
 traction, to possess what M. Fizeau calls a " negative coefficient of
 expansion    ;"and this       the more remarkable when we remember
                                is
 that the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of potassinm, sodium, and
 ammonium,         and the chloride and bromide         of silver expand consider
 ably when heated, more so, indeed, than the most expansible metals,
 such as lead, tin, and zinc.  The contraction of the iodide of silver                  is,
 according to Fizeau,    quite regular between —10° C. (14° F.) and
  -+70° C. (158° F.); and he calculates that the contraction    equal tc     is
  about        of its volume at      0°   C for 100° C, or,   again, equal to one sixth

hexagonal crystal       exhibited   a  very considerable    contraction in the direc
tion of the axis of symmetry, while a slight expansion was produced in a
direction normal to the axis of the crystal*.                  The contraction was
observed in the case both of the crystal, a confused crystalline mass, and
an amorphous mass produced by strongly compressing the precipitated
iodide until it became a hard mass capable of receiving a fine polish, and
 possessing a specific gravity of 5-569.          Fizeau considers that the iodide
 possesses    its maximum of volume or minimum of density at a tempera
ture of -60°       C.  (-  76° F.).
    The iodide of silver employed in the following experiments was pre
 pared : — (1) By precipitation.          Pure iodide of potassium was added to
 nitrate of silver, both in dilute solution.           The precipitated iodide was
 thoroughly washed in the dark, slowly dried, fused in a porcelain crucible,
 and cast into cylindrical masses, either in a warm porcelain or brass
 mould t. (2) By dissolving pure silver in strong hydriodic acid, eva
 porating to dryness, fusing.             (3) By exposing pure silver leaf for
 several hours to the vapour of iodine produced by spontaneous eva
 poration.
     Before we examine the effects of heat upon the iodide, it may                be well
 to say a word or two concerning the action of light upon it.                     A  con
 siderable amount        of misconception     appears to exist in regard to this.

 Fizeau describes it as " noircissant lentement a la lumiere ;

 Vogel (' Jahresbericht,' 1863) affirms that if it be precipitated with
 excess   of iodide of potassium it is scarcely affected by light, whereas if
 precipitated with excess of nitrate of silver it changes colour, but under
 goes no chemical change.          The general idea that it is nearly as sensitive
 to light as the chloride, has no doubt arisen from the fact that iodides
 and chlorides are known to have many points of resemblance, and that
 the iodide is largely used in photography ; moreover we remember that
 a thin film of iodide of silver was the sensitive medium in the original
 daguerreotype.        But we must bear in mind that the change produced by
 light is not apparent until the so-called " developing solution," which
 contains reducing agents, has been employed.                  The change is indeed
 most obscure : the author of the article on Photography                      in •Watf s

                                        a
450° C. (842° F.), the iodide fuses to a dark-red liquid, the colour of
bromine, or of melted sulphur shortly before its boiling-point. At red                          a
heat the iodide begins to volatilize and to decompose, and at a bright
red heat this takes place readily.   If the iodide be fused and poured
into cold water,     becomes  it  lemon-yellow, amorphous, very brittle

                  a                        hot surface,   a passes to a pale it
yellow transparent variety.     The transparent varieties, at      temperature       a
which varies with the mass of the substance, and which in the case of                               a

pale greenish-grey colour, somewhat brittle, and of a granular fracture.
At the moment of the change from the amorphous, transparent, plastic
variety to the opaque, brittle, crystalline variety, considerable expansion

takes    place, often accompanied       by a loud cracking,   and large fissures
appear in the mass.
    Many attempts were made to determine the precise temperature at
which the change from the amorphous to the crystalline condition takes
place ; but the results were somewhat discordant, depending apparently
on the mass of the iodide, and perhaps on the number of times it had
been    previously fused. The iodide was fused in a glass tube or porcelain
crucible, and when fusion was quite complete was placed in an air-bath
at 150° C. (302° F.) and allowed to cool.            The exact temperature at
which the tube was broken by the expanding mass was noticed.               About
15 grammes of iodide, which had been often fused, changed suddenly
from the amorphous to the crystalline condition at 120° C. (248° F.).
Another specimen cracked the tube at 116° C. (240°-8). A porcelain
crucible containing 10 grammes of the fused iodide commenced to change
at 118° C. (244°-4 F.) ; the crucible was violently riven open at 105° C.
Two small test-tubes, about 6 millimetres diameter and each contain
ing 2 grammes of iodide, were placed in the hot-air bath ; the two
masses of iodide simultaneously changed to the crystalline condition at
109° C. (228°-2 F.).         On one occasion a small mass weighing 3 grammes,
prepared by dissolving silver in hydriodic acid, was fused in a tube and
slowly cooled. It cooled down to the ordinary temperature of the air
without breaking the tube ; on moving the tube, however, the mass sud
denly underwent molecular change, and the tube was broken.              The same
iodide fused with some which had been similarly prepared suddenly
changed to the crystalline variety at 121° C. (249°-8 F.). From the
 above    results  we cannot be far wrong in stating that the change from
 the amorphous to the crystalline variety of the iodide takes place at a
 temperature of about 116° C. (240°-8 F.).
     Presumably heat is evolved when the amorphous           modification  of the
 iodide passes into the crystalline.      Several attempts were made to ascer
 tain this by plunging a mass of hot amorphous iodide into hot mercury,
 inserting a thermometer, and allowing the whole to cool, but no rise of
 temperature was observed at any given point of the cooling.
      If the fused iodide be cast into a tube of porcelain or brass the fol
  lowing effects may be observed : —(a) The mass contracts considerably
  at  the moment     of solidification, the level liquid surface sinking into a
  deep conical depression when it becomes solid.              For many seconds
  after the solidification the solid cylinder of iodide will freely slip out of
  the tube, and is then seen to be red and transparent,           in fact in the
  amorphous condition ; but (y) if the mass cools until          it assumes the
   crystalline condition it can no longer be    got out of the tube ; and if the
   latter be of glass or porcelain, it is infallibly broken by the expansion.
   Hence if a mass of iodide be allowed to cool in a tube which it cannot
   break when it expands, it may be made to contract and slip easily out of
   the tube by heating   it.    Hence also, as the change from   the amorphous

 102                         Mr. G. F. Rodwell       on the                [Dec. 10,
 to the crystalline condition takes place at 116° C, it would appear that
 between the point of fusion, 450° C. (p. 100), and the temperature at which
 the amorphous iodide becomes crystalline it follows the ordinary law
 and contracts as it cools, while below that temperature (and, as will be
 shown, as low as — 18° C, — 0o-4 F.) it expands on getting cooler, and
 possesses    a negative coefficient.    It thus appears that when the iodide is
 in the amorphous condition at 116°         C,  immediately before the change to
 the crystalline condition, it is at its point of maximum density.
     Several unsuccessful attempts were made to burst metal bottles, after
 the manner of the familiar ice-experiment, by the expansion of the iodide
 at the moment when it passes from the amorphous to the crystalline con
 dition.    On one occasion, when a somewhat large cylindrical mass had
been cast in a tube of thin brass, the latter was burst by the expanding
 iodide, but thick metal bottles, furnished with a screw, which was forced
 down into the molten mass, were not broken.                  Thick porcelain and
 glass  tubes   were  invariably   broken  by  the  expansion  ; and a good lecture
 experiment to illustrate the anomalous expansion is furnished by the
 following means. Let 20 or 30 grammes of fused iodide be cast into a
 thick cylindrical tube of porcelain a centimetre diameter ; in the course
 of a minute or two the mass has cooled down to the temperature at
 which it changes from the amorphous to the crystalline condition ; it then
expands, cracks the tube with a loud noise, and sometimes jerks portions
 of the tube to a distance of several feet.
    A curious effect was noticed in the case of bars of the iodide during
cooling.      If a bar be cast in a tube and pushed out before it begins to
 expand,   it  is seen to curve considerably during cooling.         In the case of
a bar 15 centimetres       long by 6 millimetres diameter, the curvature was
 such as would be produced with a radius of 48 centimetres, and was
always the same with bars of the same length and diameter.                   A very
slight pressure resisted       the  tendency    of the  bar to   curve.   The  effect
was not due to conduction of heat from one part of the bar while the
 rest remained perfectly hot ; for the effect was the same whether the bar
was allowed to cool on a flat copper plate, in an air-bath,             or even if it
were suspended by a thread of non-conducting               matter.    It takes  place
 when the iodide passes from the amorphous to the crystalline condition,
and is no doubt due to the inequality of strain produced between the
outside portions,      which first become crystalline and expand, and the
internal portions,     which   assimilate the change less rapidly, for the iodide
is a very bad conductor of heat.
    It  has been stated      above   that at the moment of solidification        of a
mass of iodide of silver a considerable contraction takes place. The
following experiments were made in order to determine the amount
of this contraction.       A copper tube, which contained 105*548 grammes
of mercury,       was   found to contain 42-080 grammes of iodide in a
molten condition (say 450° C.)— that is, a little above the fusing-point

of the iodide.        This would give as the specific gravity of the molten
iodide 5-406.       The mass was then allowed to solidify in the tube, and a
large conical cavity appeared at the moment                 of congelation. This cavity
contained 4-552 grammes            of mercury,      and  would    contain 1-8149 gramme
of iodide.       Hence, if the volume of the iodide before fusion be taken as
 100, the      volume    of the resulting fused iodide will be 104-499. Or,
 again, 100 volumes of molten iodide contract to 95-694 volumes of the solid.
 The principal expansion takes place at the moment of fusion, and the ex
 pansion between 116° C and 450° C. is not considerable.                    No really satis
 factory method        has   been   yet   found    for   determining     the  coefficient of
 expansion between 116° C. and 450° C. ; but if we assume it to be equal
 to the mean expansion           on the other side of 116° C. (of course omitting
 the    sudden expansion which takes place when the amorphous passes into
 the     crystalline condition), we find that a volume 1-00000 at 116° C.
 will become a volume of 1-01455238 at 450° C. just below the melting-
 point, while in passing from the solid to the liquid condition the volume
 increases     from 1-01455 to 1-04499, an expansion =-03044.
      When a mass of iodide of silver passes from the amorphous into the
 crystalline condition the molecular commotion is so considerable that
 portions of the mass are sometimes jerked off from the ends of a bar, and
 large fissures appear in the mass.             These are sometimes as much as half
 a millimetre      broad and several centimetres long in a cylindrical mass
 weighing from 10 to 20 grammes.                 They penetrate to the centre of the
  mass, as may be shown           by cooling the iodide under mercury, when the
  whole mass is found to be permeated by the metal.                   The capacity of these
  intercrystalline spaces was determined                by allowing a known weight of
  iodide to pass from its amorphous to its crystalline condition beneath the
  surface of mercury, and again weighing.
          a. 3-643 grammes       Agl  after thus cooling weighed 3-968 grammes.

   And as we know the specific gravity of mercury and of the iodide, it is
   easy to deduce from the above that the volume of the cracks is repre
   sented respectively        by (a)    -1353    gramme and (fl)         -2098 gramme of

   Frequent fusion and cooling appear to render       mass of iodide more   a

fusion was less brittle than that produced by precipitation and fre
quently fused.    We have before noticed that while the latter passes into
its crystalline condition at temperature ranging

                                 precipitation to be 5*61 but he was probably   ;
unaware   of the presence of the intercrystalline spaces, or he did not
take special precautions to obviate them.      An ordinary fused mass                             of
iodide was found to have   specific gravity of 5-545, when no precautions
                                a
were taken to dislodge the air from the intercrystalline spaces. Now we
have already given reasons for believing that    volume of iodide at    a
its maximum density (116° C.) becomes   volume of 1-047619 in chang

5-816 at the maximum            density,we deduce the specific gravity in the
crystalline condition,      not taking into account the intercrystalline spaces,

direct weighing, when no precautions were taken to dislodge air from the
intercrystalline spaces. When, however, the mass of iodide was boiled
for   length of time in water and cooled in
      a                                       good vacuum, the specific

gravity at 0° C. was found to be 5-681. Deville found   under the same              it
conditions to be 5-687*. The specific gravity of the molten iodide has
been shown above to be about 5-406, and the specific gravity at the point
of maximum density of the amorphous iodide would appear to be 5-8167.
This applies to the precipitated iodide which had been several times fused,
and with which the principal experiments herein described were made.
A  specimen of iodide produced by the direct solution of silver in hydriodic
acid gave a specific gravity of 5•812j and appeared to be less crystalline

and more compact than        that produced by precipitation.    Deville found the
specific gravity of the unfused precipitated iodide to be 5*807, and of the
fused iodide 5-687, while Damour found the native crystals to have a
specific gravity of 5-667 ; hence the amorphous precipitate has a higher
density than either the fused crystalline iodide and their native crystals.
Thus the density of the amorphous precipitate coincides almost perfectly
with the density of the fused iodide at its point of maximum density
(116° C.) when in the amorphous condition, as deduced from the above
experiments.
    If we place in a specific-gravity      flask a quantity of fused iodide of
silver,  fill it up with mercury (taking every precaution to displace the air
from the      intercrystalline spaces), and place in the ground neck of the
flask a perforated      stopper continued as a capillary thermometer-stem, we
have obviously a thermometer in which we can observe the effect pro
duced by the anomalous contraction              of the iodide on the regularly
expanding mercury.           On applying heat to such an arrangement we
observe that     for  a while the mercury    rises in the stem, until on further
beating the contraction of the iodide exceeds the expansion of the mercury,
and the column retreats if much iodide is present into the very bulb of
the   instrument.
    If the heating be now discontinued the mercury slowly rises as the
iodide cools, until the contraction of the mercury exceeds the expansion
of the iodide, beyond       which point the mercury continues to sink as the
bulb cools.      Nothing could better illustrate the complete inversion of the
effects usually produced by heat on bodies in the case of the iodide of
 silver.
    Professor Guthrie suggested to me that a convenient method of deter
 mining the amount of contraction produced by heat in the iodide would
be to fill a specific-gravity flask with mercury, and determine the amounts
 of mercury exuded from the flask for every ten or twenty degrees of
 temperature ; then to place in the flask a known weight of fused iodide
 with a known weight of mercury, and repeat the determinations.              This
 was accordingly done.         About 440 grammes of mercury were employed,
 and weighings made at intervals of a few degrees. The method was
 found to be satisfactory, and the results concordant.          Por example (to
 take a few instances from many), the amounts of mercury driven from
 the flask by expansion for 10° C. were found to be as follows         : —
                     Between    29° C. and 53° C         -066062

 the expansion of the glass, agree very well with Begnault's determina
 tions of the absolute expansion of mercury.         Then 38-3680 grammes of
 the fused iodide were placed    in  the flask ; it was filled up with mercury,
 the whole was heated, cooled in a good vacuum, weighed, cooled to
 — 18° C.      0°-4 F.) and weighed.       The flask was then heated respec
            (—
tively to 0°   C,  21°  C, 67°   C,   and the weights determined.       At high
temperatures the mercury acts upon the iodide and a green iodide of
 mercury is formed.     The results were not very concordant above 67° C.
 and have not been introduced.          The general results were as follows :
 the   amounts   of mercury     driven   from the flask for 1° C. were re
 spectively —

Now from the known weight of mercury in the flask and the known
expansion of mercury, it is easy to deduce the quantity of mercury which
ought to have been driven from the flask by expansion for any number
of degrees ; and having determined the actual amount of mercury ex
pelled, we at once find the contraction of the known weight of iodide of
silver from known number of degrees by subtracting the amount of
mercury expelled from the amount of mercury which ought to have
been expelled if the iodide had not been present. We can thus arrive at
 the coefficient of contraction of the iodide for one degree Centigrade.
 This appears to be -00000718 for temperatures between — 18° C and
 0° C, -00003297 for temperatures           between 0° C. and 21° C, and
 •00005570 for temperatures between 21° and 67° C. Thus the coefficient
 augments with the temperature. The following Table (p. 107) represents
 the relationship between the effects of heat on iodide of silver and on mer
 cury.   It cannot be regarded as more than an approximation until more
 perfect methods for investigating the actions can be devised.          The ex
 treme peculiarities of the molecular constitution of the iodide, com
 bined with the fact that it cannot be raised to a high temperature
 in mercury without suffering decomposition, and that its fusing-
 point is above the boiling-point of mercury, render experiments of
this nature, especially when a high temperature is required, unsatis
factory.

     I   have endeavoured to prove in the foregoing         pages  the  following
  main facts : —
     1.  That the iodide of silver exists in three allotropic forms, viz. (a),
 at temperatures between 116° C. and its fusing-point, as a plastic,
 tenacious, amorphous substance possessing a reddish colour and trans
  parent to light ; (j3), at temperatures below 116° C, as a brittle, opaque,
  greenish-grey, crystalline mass ; and (y), if fused and poured into cold
 water, as an amorphous, very brittle, yellow, opaque substance.
     2. That the iodide possesses a point of maximum density at or about
 116° C. at the moment before passing from the amorphous into the crys
 talline condition.
    3. That if we allow a mass of molten iodide to cool, the following
 effects may be observed :— (a) at the moment of solidification a very
 considerable contraction takes place ; (/3) the solid, on further cooling,
 undergoes slight and regular contraction after the manner of solid bodies
 in general, until (y) at or about 116° C. it undergoes sudden and violent
 expansion, passing from the amorphous into the crystalline condition ;
 (2) after undergoing this expansion the mass on further cooling undergoes
 slight expansion, and (e) the coefficient of contraction diminishes as the
 temperature decreases (or otherwise expressed, the coefficient of con
 traction augments with the temperature).
    I   must, in conclusion, express my great indebtedness to Dr. Guthrie
for allowing me to carry out many of the foregoing experiments in the
 Physical Laboratory at South Kensington.
 IV. " On the Coefficient       of Expansion of a Paraffine of high boiling-
         point." By G. F. Rodwell, F.R.A.S., F.CS., Science Master
        in Marlborough College. Communicated by Prof. Stokes,
        Sec. R.S.     Received November 17, 1874.
    In the search for a liquid of high boiling-point which could be used
for the exact determination of the coefficient of expansion of iodide of
silver, and which at the same time should be free from certain objections
which apply to the employment of mercury for this purpose, a paraffine
of high boiling-point naturally suggested itself. Mr. W. H. Hatcher, to
whom      I express my acknowledgments, procured for me a specimen of
paraffine which was taken from one of the stills at Messrs. Price's works
at a high temperature.        With it the following experiments were made.
    The paraffine in question is perfectly white and pearly, and in thin
layers translucent ; it fuses to a colourless liquid, which slightly darkens
when heated for some time to a temperature                 exceeding 600° F.
(315°-55 C).       Its specific gravity at 32° F. (0° C.) is -921.    It is hard
and somewhat granular when broken, and at a low temperature may be
crudely     pulverized   by a blow.     At   temperatures    exceeding   100°F.

 (37°-75            C.) it begins to soften slightly, and gradually becomes softer as
 the temperature             rises, until just before reaching the fusing-point, 142° F.
 (6P-11             C), it is quite plastic, and may
                                         be moulded by pressure, or spread
out into  thin coherent sheets.  It thus resembles some metals which are
brittle at the ordinary temperature, but become more and more malleable
as the  temperature rises. As the temperature rises, the paraffine becomes
more and   more translucent ; and, like sealing-wax and some other bodies,
it becomes    what we may call either semifluid or semisolid before it
finally fuses to a colourless perfectly transparent fluid. As the tempera
ture approaches               400°      F. (205°-5 C), the liquid begins to give off fumes   ;   it
"                   "
     flashes         (that is to say, the vapour ignites on the application of flame,
but does            not continue to burn) at 458° F. (236c-65 C.) ; and the vapour
ignitesspontaneously without the presence of flame and continues to burn
at      F. (302°-75 C). Finally the boiling-point is above the melting-
      576°
point of lead and the boiling-point of mercury, but below the melting-
point of zinc (apparently not much below it), presumably about 750° F.
(3980-8         Air-thermometer determinations of the boiling-point were
                C).
not  satisfactory.   As the liquid cools from the boiling-point the contrac
tion is seen to be enormous.     The comparatively small quantity of liquid
paraffine (about 15 grammes) capable of being contained in a tube 15
centimetres (nearly 6 inches) long by 15 millimetres (nearly § inch)
diameter   can be seen to sink two or three centimetres in less than 10
minutes.     The subsidence continues until the point of solidification is
attained, when the mass commences to solidify at the bottom, and pro
ceeds gradually up the sides of the tube, leaving a central core of perfectly
fluid matter which does not solidify for some length of time.      The mass
parts with its heat very slowly.     When perfectly and uniformly cooled
down to the ordinary temperature, a hollow central core is found in the
mass of        paraffine, extending nearly to the bottom, and gradually narrow
    ing   as    descends.

the       liquid to the solid condition    very considerable.

     The expansion which paraffine undergoes when heated appeared to be
so           great, that the following experiments were made in order to
      unusnally
determine its amount.     They may be divided info three parts, viz. ex
periments to determine — (a) the coefficient of expansion of the solid
                                         :
for temperatures between 32°            F. (0° C.) and the point of fusion, 142° F.
(61°-1     1
                C.) (J3);the precise change of volume which ensues when the solid
at 142°         F. passes into the liquid at 142° F. and (y) the coefficient of ex

its
      boiling-point (presumably about 750° F., 398°-8C.).
     In    these determinations  the greatest obstacle to be contended against
was the     slight conductivity of the paraffine, which made      very difficult
                                                                             it

                                    a
was to keep                 the mass for        a  length of time at the precise temperature
required        ;       and this   it   is   almost impossible to do when the temperature of

the liquid mass is above the point at which the vapour ignites spontane
ously.    It is also difficult to manipulate with a liquid which is above the
boiling-point of mercury, and is at the           same     time giving    off clouds    of
spontaneously inflammable vapour.             The slight conductivity of the solid
is shown by the following results.           The bulb of      a thermometer      was im
 bedded in a mass of paraffine in such a manner that the distance between
 the outer surface of the paraffine and the surface of the bulb was 8 millims.
 (about -j=,ff inch).    It was immersed in water, and kept in a fixed position
 about 3 centimetres above the bottom of the beaker, and on a level with a
 thermometer-bulb        in direct contact with the water.             The beaker was
 gently heated on a sand-bath, and the thermometers were observed for
 nearly an hour at intervals of two minutes.              At starting, 11.20 a.m., the

    out when the      thermometer immersed in the water read 141° P., but it
   rose to 148°    F. (six degrees above the point of fusion of the paraffine),
   and a very   small amount of paraffine at the surface melted ; hence, with
   the exterior     surface actually fusing at 148° F., it will be seen that the
   imbedded   thermometer, separated from the fused surface by only 8 millims.
   of paraffine, read   48° F. lower. Further, it will be noticed that the tem
   perature  of the water rose steadily to 148° F. and then sank at the rate
  of about one      degree in a minute, while the paraffine acquired heat in
  creasingly   till the water   ceased to be heated, then less   quickly, until when
  the paraffine     had acquired a temperature of 130° F. the temperatures
  coincide,  half an hour after the commencement of heating.                Then the
  temperature      of the paraffine begins to fall gradually, and less quickly
  than that   of the water, until at 90°-5 F. there is once again coincidence,
 one hour and twenty-seven          minutes from the commencement of heating.
  After this the temperatures read alike, and the thermometers continue to
 fall pari passu.    In the column    of differences, minus differences signify that
 the temperatures        of the paraffine-thermometer were below those of the
 water-thermometer, plus differences that the former were above those of
 the latter.
     It will be noticed    that the two-minute observations      cease at 12.10 p.m.,
 and that     the last four are made at intervals          of 12,  25, 19, and 68
 minutes.
     In regard    to the fluid paraffine, a mass of from 20 to 30 grammes takes
 two or three hours to cool down from just below its f using-point to the
 temperature of the air — that is, to cool through about 80° F.             The bulb
 of a thermometer was surrounded              by 8 millimetres of liquid paraffine
at 150° F., and was plunged            in a bath kept at 245° F. ; at the end of
 half an hour the mass of about 30 grammes had barely acquired the tem
 perature of the bath.         In heating a vessel of paraffine there is always a
marked difference between the temperatures of the upper and lower
levels.     The convection-currents part with their heat so slowly that a
uniform temperature throughout the mass seems to be altogether unat
tainable without constant and complete agitation.               During the heating
of about half a litre of the liquid paraffine in a cylindrical copper vessel
75    millimetres (about 3 inches) diameter by 150 millimetres high, the
following results were obtained : — The upper thermometer was placed
with its bulb a centimetre from the surface, the lower thermometer with
its bulb a centimetre from the bottom.               The fluid mass was directly
heated     by a Bunsen burner from below.            In the column of differences,
minus    differences signify     that the  temperature of the lower thermometer
is below that of the upper thermometer, and plus differences that the
temperatures of the former are above those of the latter.              The gas was
turned out at 6 p.m., the highest temperature           being attained by the lower
thermometer (361° F.) at 6.1 p.m., while the highest temperature attained
bv the upper thermometer was 354° F. at the same time.

   It will be observed that     while observations were made at intervals of
5- minutes (and at first at each of the intervening minutes), the interval
between the last two is 50 minutes, and the mass partly solidified had
fallen to 144° F. The greatest difference between the upper and lower
thermometers during the cooling through a range of 200° F. is no less than
26° F., and only for an instant, at a temperature of about 355° F., have
the two thermometers coincided.
  Determination    of  the coefficient   of expansion of solid paraffine       between
           32°  F.  (0° C.) and    the  fusing-point, 142° F. (61-11 C).
   The  above    examples show us the extreme difficulty of obtaining uni
formity of temperature in either a solid or liquid mass of paraffine, and
help to explain various incongruities which presented themselves in the
course of the following determinations.             The coefficient of expansion of
the solid was determined by weighing a piece of compact paraffine in
water at different temperatures, the expansion of water (as determined
by  M. Despretz to     seven places of decimals) being       of course well known.

 Owing to the great contraction           which takes place when a mass of liquid
 paraffine solidifies, it was found to be somewhat difficult to obtain a solid
mass free from         minute cavities and of uniform texture.                The plan
eventually     adopted was to take a long column of melted paraffine and to
cool the    lower extremity of it. The supernatant fluid forced its way into
the  central cavity produced by the contraction of the solidifying mass, and
the   result was a mass of paraffine apparently quite compact and free
from cavities.        It  was suspended from the balance by horsehair, and
weighted by a piece of brass, the weight of which in air and water at
different temperatures was known ; and the whole was finally weighed in
distilled water which had been well boiled and cooled              in a good vacuum.
After the immersion of the paraffine the whole was again placed in a good
vacuum.        The mass was heated and weighed in water at various tem
peratures, between 32°         F. (0° C.) and   142°   F. (61°-11 C.)   ; the melting-
point and the cubical          expansion    was found to be as follows,         for one
degree    Fahrenheit : —

   The considerable increase of the coefficient as the point of fusion is
approached is explained by the fact, already adverted to, that the solid
paraffine     becomes    soft and semisolid like sealing-wax and gutta-percha
before actually becoming          liquid. From the above coefficients we deduce
the fact that
        100 volumes of paraffine at 32°        F. become 100-8955 at        60°  F.

    As the latter temperature is approached the mass may be moulded by
the hand like a mass of dough or putty ; and on continuing the heat at
 the same    temperature,     it fuses to  a limpid liquid.
Determination      of the amount of expansion which paraffine undergoes when
       it passes  from the solid condition at 142° F. to the liquid condition at the
       same temperature.
   Tubes     of known weight and capacity were exactly filled with melted
paraffine at 142°.       They were then allowed to cool ; the cavity produced
by contraction was accurately filled with mercury, which was weighed
and the capacity       of the cavity      deduced therefrom.        The   results were
concordant and satisfactory.             Thus it was found that volume =100 at
60° F. becomes, in the fluid condition, at 142° F. : —

 V. " Experiments showing the Paramagnetic condition of Arterial
       Blood, as compared with the Diamagnetic condition of Venous
       Blood." By Richard C. Shettle, M.D. Communicated
       by Dr. Lockhart Clarke, F.R.S. Received October 20, 1874.
    The magnetic condition of all matter has been well ascertained, and the
 fact that the same matter may exhibit different magnetic phenomena
 according to the medium in which it is placed is a point of considerable
 importance when testing for such results.
    It is therefore absolutely essential that any experiments which have
 for their object the demonstration of paramagnetic force of low power
 should be tested in media of known strength.      In the experiments I have
  now the honour of laying before the Royal Society, the relative condition
 which bodies bear to each other as regards their magnetic properties has
 been strictly observed.
    The experiments consist in suspending between the poles of a power
 ful electromagnet arterial blood hermetically sealed in a glass tube in a
 medium of venous blood, and venous blood in the same tube, previously
 well emptied of its contents, in a medium of arterial blood, care being
 taken to avoid as far as possible any exposure of the blood to the atmo
 sphere, thus preventing any alteration in its physical characteristics as
 regards the gases which it contains.
    The necessary apparatus consists of some German glass tubes in which
 the fluid to be tested is hermetically sealed, a thin glass vessel for hold
 ing the medium in which the testing-tube is suspended, two glass bottles
 for defibrinating the blood, two store glass bottles for receiving the blood
 after it has been defibrinated, oxygen gas, carbonic acid gas, very thin
 india rubber, and an electromagnet and battery of 15 Grove's cells.
    The testing-tube (fig. 1) was made of very thin German glass, and
 the one used for these experiments was of the size and shape shown.
 It was filled by means of the two short tubes on the upper surface, and
 when filled was carefully tied over with very thin india rubber ; it was
 suspended by silk in the ordinary way.

   The thin glass vessel for holding the medium in which the testing-tube
was suspended consisted of an ordinary beaker (fig. 2) of sufficient
                    Fig. 1.                         rig. 2.

internal capacity to allow of the testing-tube rotating freely, without risk
of touching the sides. The mouth of this vessel was closed with a cork
(fig. 3), the cork being pierced with two glass tubes, to which were
 attached pieces of india-rubber tubing, capable of being closed when
 required by means of strong brass clips.     This cork was also pierced in
 its centre by  a small copper  wire, bent into a crook at its lower end, to
 which the testing-tube was suspended.      The wire was sufficiently long
 to permit of the testing-tube being raised or lowered as necessary for
 adjusting the ends to the level of the poles of the magnet.
    The bottles used for defibrinating (fig. 4) were wide-mouthed, and
 capable  of holding two pints each ; they were well corked, and the corks
  were pierced with two glass tubes with india-rubber       tubing attached,
 similar to the cork shown in fig. 3. Brass clips were also supplied.
 Into the under surface of these corks were driven four strips of wood
 sufficiently long to reach to the bottom of the bottle, and these acted as
 excellent defibrinating rods.

    The store bottles (fig. 5) were narrow-mouthed, capable of holding a
pint ; they were dosed with a cork with one glass tube, fitted with india-
                                                      Fig. 5.
rubber tubing and clip as the others.       Near the bottom of these bottles
was another opening, to which a similar cork with tubing and clip was
fitted.
    One of these defibrinatiug bottles and one of the store bottles were
filled with oxygen gas, the other defibrinatiug bottle and the other store
bottle with carbonic    acid gas  ; this was done to prevent the blood when
drawn    from the vessels   (artery and vein) being exposed to the atmo
sphere.
    The apparatus being thus prepared, blood was allowed to flow through
a glass tube (one end of which was tied      into the vein, the other into the
india-rubber tube) from the jugular vein of a sheep into the defibrina-
ting bottle filled with carbonic acid gas ; both clips having been removed
from the india-rubber tubes, the gas flowed out of one tube as the blood
entered at the other : during this process, and until defibrination had
taken place, the bottle was rotated upon its axis, the clips being re
applied as soon as sufficient blood had been taken.        The vein was then
properly tied and the carotid artery opened ; a similar glass tube was
inserted, and blood drawn from it into the defibrinating bottle filled with
oxygen gas ; the process of defibrination was then performed, as in the
case of the venous blood, and the clips again applied.
    The liquor sanguinis containing the corpuscles was then drawn off
through similar tubes into the store bottles and was ready for testing.
    The testing-tube (fig. 1) was readily filled from these store bottles by
inserting one of the short tubes (marked «) into the india-rubber tubing

1874.]                 Magnetic Conditions      of the Blood.                  119
attached      to the bottom of one of the store bottles, and then removing
the    clips, which were replaced as soon as the tube (fig. 1 ) was thoroughly
filled   : the open tube (6) was then speedily tied over with the thin india
rubber ; the india-rubber tubing connecting it with the store bottle was
then carefully removed, and the aperture (a) tied over in the same man
ner ; the tube was then carefully wiped and attached by the suspending
silk to the crook of the adjusting-wire.
     The tube (fig. 1) was first filled with arterial blood, and the vessel
(fig. 2) having been filled with carbonic acid gas and placed between the
poles of the passive electromagnet, the cork with testing-tube attached,
filled as above described, was properly inserted ; by means of the adjust
ing-wire (fig. 3) the points of the tube were made level with the points
of the magnetic         poles ; battery contact was then made, and the tube
(fig. 1) took up a diagonal position, pointing north-east by east and
south-west by west.          The tube connected with the bottom of the store
bottle containing venous blood was now connected with one of the glass
tubes of the vessel (fig. 2) ; and the clips being again removed, sufficient
venous blood was allowed to run into it to cover the tube (fig. 1), with
the exception of the two apertures covered with india rubber, as these
marked the position of the tube when immersed in the blood.               The tube
 immediately assumed the direct axial line, then slowly made a half turn
 and took the axial position again, the ends of the tube being directed to
the poles of the magnet, the reverse of that they had first assumed.
                                   Experiment No. 2.
      The suspending-tube      was now removed and thoroughly emptied of its
  contents.       It was then filled with venous blood in the manner described
 in Experiment No. 1, and suspended as before, with the exception that
  the vessel (fig. 2) was this time filled with atmospheric air instead of car
  bonic acid gas ; the tube was then levelled and tested by battery con
  tact being made as in No. 1, and found to occupy an equatorial position.
  Arterial blood was then allowed to flow into fig. 2 from the store bottle
  in the same manner as described in Experiment No. 1 ; the slight oscil
   lations which had previously existed immediately ceased, and the vessel
   (fig. 1) came to rest in the equatorial line.
                                      Observations.
       For the proper performance        of these experiments    special attention
   should be given,
       1st, to the proper coagulation and removal of the fibrin ;
       2nd, to the preparation of the blood without contact with the atmo
   sphere ;
       3rd, to the employment       of sufficient battery force, not  less than 15
    Grove's cells.
       1st.  It is very necessary that the fibrin be properly removed, for the
    liquor sanguinis and corpuscles constitute together a medium of con

 si Jerable density,   in which the testing-tube       has  to rotate ; and in cal
 culating the degree of force which exists in the blood, as shown by the
 rapidity of the movements of the tube under the influence of the magnet,
 allowance must be made for the resistance from this source that has to
 be overcome    :  consequently any fibrin that has not been removed must,
 in the same degree in which it increases the viscidity and density of the
 fluid, increase the resistance to the movements of the tube, and so inter
 fere with the manifestation of results.
     2nd. By preserving the blood from contact with the atmosphere any
change in its physical character from such source is prevented.
     3rd. And for the reason that the paramagnetic force in arterial blood
 must depend upon the amount of oxygen it contains, and the diamag-
 netic force in venous blood upon carbonic acid, it is evident that the force
 in the testing-tube as opposed to the force in the suspending medium
 must be very little, whilst the mechanical resistance afforded by such
medium must be considerable.            It is therefore essential that the battery-
 force should be of sufficient power to develop these forces to the greatest
 possible extent.
                                       Addendum.
     Since writing the foregoing paper, in repeating the experiments, it has
been found that, for the due performance of them, the blood should be
maintained as nearly as possible at its natural temperature.               To effect
this the shape of the vessel (No. 2) has been altered, and it is immersed
in a water-bath, the heat of which is sustained by a spirit-lamp, its tem
 perature, and also that of the blood, being regulated            by thermometers
placed in each vessel.

   It may be remembered that many years ago Mr. Lassell invented, and
described in the eighteenth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astro
nomical Society, a machine for polishing specula. It is no part of the
object of this paper to disparage or supersede that machine, as with it
he has polished many specula sensibly perfect, some of which are now in
his possession, in whose surfaces he can find no imperfection whatever,
and which he should vainly attempt to improve      ;   but it possesses   scarcely
power enough for polishing a two-foot speculum, though the specula
belonging to the telescope of that size which he took out to Malta in
1852 were polished with that machine.     Indeed the first surfaces on the
four-foot specula of the telescope taken out to Malta on his last expedi
tion were obtained in the same way ; but it was with great difficulty, and
ultimately the machine broke down hopelessly, the result of which was
the construction of the present one described in the paper now presented
to the Society. But reference must be had to the paper itself, and to the
drawings which accompany        it,
                                for an adequate description.

   Mr. Lassell attempts in this paper to describe the processes with suffi
cient precision to enable persons of ordinary intelligence and some me
chanical aptitude to obtain with ease and certainty surfaces on specula
 (taking two-foot speculum as an example) which shall be sensibly per
           a
fect in figure and polish   ; and this, as his words imply, without the tedi
ous trial-and-error process, which amateurs have had too frequently to
experience.      Another object he has had also especially in view           tois
render the process interesting and pleasurable throughout, by devising
new modes of performing the most disagreeable parts of the operation,
such as the formation of the pitch-tool, which in large surfaces         apt to
                                                                          is
be very troublesome and annoying.            This is accomplished by simply
studying    the properties of pitch  and  adapting its treatment, so to speak,
to its peculiar unaccommodating humour.        A  further aim has been to sim
plify  to the  utmost  the mode   of  action  in every particular, leaving out
every thing which long 'experience has shown to be unnecessary — for
instance, polishing with the speculum partly immersed in water, straining
pitch through muslin, &c, processes tedious and vexatious enough with
out being required.
  Rules are given     in the paper for the rates of motion of both the
polisher and  speculum, as well as for the lengths of the strokes of the
crank-arms, which have an immediate and powerful influence in the pro
duction of the required curve. The mode of making the polisher-base, and

for repeated polishings, are also described.      The mode of construction of a
bed of hones for bringing the curve of the speculum back to the sphere,
if it should happen to have gone beyond the parabola in the polishing,
without reverting to the emery-grinder, is also explained ; and a word
or two is added respecting the treatment of the speculum when finished.
II. "Note          on the Vertical     Distribution of Temperature in the
        Ocean." By J. Y. Buchanan, Chemist on board H.M.S.
        '
           Challenger.' Communicated by Prof. A. W. Williamson,
        For. Sec. R.S. Received November 11, 1874.
     From newspapers        and other reports which have been received by late
mails,     it appears that the distribution of temperature in the ocean is
occupying the attention of a certain portion of the scientific public, and
even giving rise to considerable discussion.         The observations made on
board this ship, and more especially in the Atlantic, have furnished the
greater part of the material on which the various speculations have
been      founded.     It  appears to me that one point suggested by these
observations       has not received sufficient attention from those who have
written and spoken on the subject :          I mean, the effect of the changing
seasons on sea-water.          Consider the state of the water at and near the
surface of the ocean, somewhere not in the tropics.            To be more pre
 cise, let us suppose that we have taken up our position in the middle of
 the North Atlantic, somewhere about the 30th parallel.             This part of
 the ocean is not vexed with currents, and affords the best possible field
 for the observation of the phenomenon in question. The whole ocean en
 closed by the 20th and 40th parallels of north latitude and the meridians
 of 30° and 60° west longitude forms one oceanic lake, not affected by
 the perturbing influence of currents or of land, and where, therefore, the
  true effect of differences of atmospheric temperature on the waters of
  the ocean may be most           advantageously  studied.  Let us assume the
  winter temperature        of the surface-water to be 60° F. and the summer
  temperature to be       70° F. If we start from midwinter, we find that, as
   summer approaches, the surface-water         must get gradually warmer, and
   that the temperature of the layers below the surface must decrease at a
   very rapid rate, until the stratum of winter temperature, or 60° F., is
   reached   ; in the language of the isothermal charts, the isothermal line for
   degrees between 70° F. (if we suppose that we have arrived at mid
   summer) and 60° F. open out or increase their distance from each other
   as the depth increases.       Let us now consider the conditions after the
   summer heat has begun        to waver.   During the whole period of heating,
   the water,    from its increasing temperature, has been always becoming
   lighter, so that heat communication by convection with the water below
   has been entirely suspended during the whole period.           The heating of

the surface-water     has, however, had another effect, besides increasing
its volume ;  it has,  by evaporation, rendered it denser than it was before,
at the same temperature.        Keeping in view this double effect of the
summer heat upon the surface-water, let us consider the effect of the
winter cold upon it. The superficial water having assumed the atmo
spheric temperature of, say, 60° F., will sink through the warmer water
below it, until it reaches the stratum of water having the same tempera
ture as itself.   Arrived here, however, although it has the same tem
perature  as the  surrounding   water, the two are no longer in equilibrium,
for the water, which has come from the surface, has a greater density
than that below at the same temperature.           It will therefore not be
arrested at the stratum of the same temperature, as would have been
the case with fresh water ; but it will continue to sink, carrying of course
its higher temperature with it, and distributing it among the lower
layers of colder water.      At the end of the winter, therefore, and just
before the summer heating recommences, we shall have at the surface
a more or less thick stratum of water having a nearly uniform tempera
ture of 60° F., and below this the temperature decreasing at a consider
able but less   rapid rate than at the termination of the summer heating.
If we  distinguish between surface-water, 'the temperature of which rises
with the atmospheric temperature (following thus, in direction at least,
the variation of the seasons), and s«6*ur/ac«-water, or the stratum imme
diately below        it,
                   we have for the latter the, at first sight, paradoxical effect
of summer cooling and winter heating.         The effect of this agency        to is
diffuse the same heat to      greater depth in the ocean, the greater the
                              a
yearly range   of atmospheric temperature at the surface.          This effect         is
well shown in the chart of isothermals, on vertical section, between
                                                      a
Madeira and a position in lat. 3°      N., long. 14° 49' W. The isothermal

line for 45° F. rises from      depth of 740 fathoms at Madeira to 240
                                  a
fathoms at the above-mentioned position*.         In equatorial regions there
is  hardly any variation in the surface-temperature of the sea; conse
quently we find cold water very close to the surface all along the line.
On referring to the temperature section between the position lat. 3°         N., 8'
long. 14° 49' W., and St. Paul's rocks,         will be seen that, with

observed) the slightly concentrated water descending from the surface as
the winter approaches does not meet water of greater density at the same
temperature than its own.      Unfortunately the determination of the
specific     gravity of water below the surface is much less simple than that
of the temperature ;       for although we have an instrument which gives,
within any required degree   of accuracy, the density of the water at any
depth   in exactly the same way as the thermometer gives its tempera
ture, the results of the observations are composed of three factors, which
depend on the temperature, the pressure, and the salinity.     By sending

   From the figures in the Table it will be seen that in that part of the
ocean the specific gravity of the water in summer decreases from the
surface downwards.      As a rule it attains an inferior limit at a depth of
from 400 to 500 fathoms, which it preserves to the bottom.          In those
latitudes, therefore, the stratum   of  intermixture  extends  down   to 500
fathoms ; and this may be said also to be the depth to which the sun's
influence at the surface penetrates. The results in column              III.
                                                                    show the
curious phenomenon of the surface-water being specifically lighter than
any water below            it,
                      and that under an equatorial sun.      The position of
this sounding was peculiar, inasmuch as       was within line of separation
                                                it
between the Guinea and the equatorial currents.         All along the equa
torial section the water at 50 and 100 fathoms was found to be speci
fically heavier than either at the surface or that at greater depths.     All
along the equator, however,     current runs with great velocity and have
                                      a                                    ;     I
invariably observed that strong surface-currents introduce considerable
irregularities into the specific gravity of the water near the surface. The
effect of the greater specific gravity at 100 fathoms conspires, of course
within the small yearly range of temperature, in preventing vertical
diffusion iu the above described manner.         Column IV. shows      return    a
in the southern hemisphere to        state of things similar to that which

studied on the ocean at large, it would then be proper to apply the
experience gained to the consideration of the more complicated phe
 nomena of the currents.

III.        "Preliminary Note upon the Brain and Skull of Amphioxus
           lanceolatus."        By T. H. Huxley, Sec. R.S. Received De
           cember 17, 1874.
     The singular little fish Amphioxus                lanceolatus  has been universally
 regarded as an extremely anomalous member                    of the Vertebrate series, by
 reason of the supposed absence of renal organs and of any proper
 stall and brain. On these grounds, chiefly, Agassiz proposed to separate
 it from all other fishes, and Haeckel, going further, made a distinct divi
 sion of the Vertebrata (Acrania) for its reception ; while Semper t, in a lately
 published paper, separates it from the Vertebrata altogether.
      In a recent communication to the Linnean Society,                  I   have described
 what       I believe to be the representative      of the ducts of the Wolffian bodies,
 or    "
          primordial kidneys
                                  "
                                     of the higher Vertebrata, in Amphioxus ; and            I
 propose,- in this preliminary notice, to point out that although Amphioxus
 has no completely differentiated brain or skull, yet it possesses very well-
  marked and relatively large divisions of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis
  and of the spinal column, which answer to the encephalon and the
  cranium of the higher Vertebrata.
      The oral aperture of Amphioxus is large, of a long oval shape, and
     *   It will be seen that the principle that the depth to which the    effect of the sun's
  rays penetrates    depends  on the   yearly range of temperature  of the  water at the sur
  face, explains the presence of the large body of comparatively warm water in the North
  Atlantic, the existence of which has been usually ascribed to an assumed reflux or back
  water of the Gulf-stream.         The warm water is due to no extraneous cause, but is
  the natural effect of the conditions of climate at the surface ; and the effect of these
  conditions of climate are so apparent in the temperature of the water, just because it
  is free from the influence of oceanic currents and exposed to the effects of climate
  alone.

   fringed   by tentacles,   external  to which lies a lip, which is continuous
   behind with    the ventro-lateral   ridge of the body.        The oral chamber is
  spacious, and extends back to the level of the         junction between the sixth
  and    seventh   myotomes (fig. A).      Here   it is   divided from the branchial
 cavity by a peculiarly constructed, muscular velum palati, the upper
 attachment of which to the ventral aspect of the sheath of the notochord
  lies vertically below the anterior angle of the seventh myotome.
      Eight pairs of nerves are given off from the cerebro-spinal axis as
 far as this point.        The eighth, or most posterior, of these, which, for
 convenience,     may be called h, passes out between the sixth and seventh
 myotomes,       and runs down parallel with the lateral attachment of the
 velum.      The next five (<f,f, e, d, c) pass out between the first six myo
 tomes, and are distributed by their dorsal and ventral branches to those
 myotomes, to the integument, and to •the walls of the buccal cavity.
 The foremost two nerves (6 and a) pass in front of the first myo
 tome, and the nerve a runs parallel with the upperside of the noto
 chord to the end of the snout, giving off branches to that region
 of the body which lies in front of the mouth.              This nerve lies above the
eye-spot.
     In the Marsipobranch fishes Myxine and             Ammocates (now known to
be a    young    condition   of Petromyzon)   a  velum     also separates the buccal
from the branchial cavity (figs. B, C, D).           But this velum is in connexion
with the hyoidean arch.          The resemblance of the buccal cavity, with its
tentacles, in Ammocates to the corresponding cavity in Amphioxus is so
close, that there can be no doubt that the two are homologous.                 In the
Ammocates there is a hyoidean cleft which has hitherto              been overlooked.
The     auditory   sac lies at the dorsal end   of the arch and above the dorsal
attachment of the velum.             The latter, therefore, corresponds with the
auditory region of the skull, and the nerve h should answer to the last
of the prseauditory cranial nerves, which is the portio dura.               Assuming
this to be    the case, though the detailed homologies of the cranial nerves of
the    higher Vertebrata are yet to be worked out, it follows that the segment
of the cerebro-spinal        axis which in Amphioxus lies between the origin
of the nerve A and the eye, answers to all that part of the brain which
lies between the      origin of the seventh nerve of Petromyzon and the optic
nerve.       Consequently, the lateral walls of the neural canal in the same
region answer to that region of the skull in Petromyzon which lies
between the origin of the seventh and the origin of the optic nerve.
Hence, as each myotome of Amphioxus represents the corresponding
portion of a protovertebra, it follows that the same region of the skull
in the Lamprey and other Vertebrata represents, at fewest, six protover
tebra, almost all traces of which are lost, even in the embryo condition
 of the higher Vertebrata.
      It  may further be concluded that the several pairs of nerves which
 leave the cerebro-spinal axis, between those which answer to the portio

130                   Prof. T. H. Huxley on the Brain                 [Dec. 17,
dura and the optic nerve, in Amphioxus, are represented by the third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth pairs of cranial nerves of the higher Vertebrata.
The nerve a, in fact, has the characteristic course and distribution of
the orbito-nasal division of the trigeminal ; while, without at present
drawing a closer parallel, it is easy to see that the nerves b, c, d, e,f, and
g, with their respective myotomes, supply the requisite materials for
metamorphosis into the oculomotor, pathetic, trigeminal, and abducens
 nerves, with the muscles of the eye and of the jaws, in the more differen
 tiated vertebrate types.
     Thus, that part of the cerebro-spinal axis of Amphioxus which lies
 in front of the seventh myotome answers to the praeauditory part of the
 brain in the higher Vertebrata, and the corresponding part of the head to
  the trabecular region of the skull in them.         On the other hand, from
 the seventh myotome backwards, a certain number of segments answer
 to the postauditory, or parachordal, region of the skull of the higher
 Vertebrata.
      The answer to the question, how many         ? involves sundry considera
  tions.    It must be recollected that though the branchial chamber of
  Amphioxus is the homologue of the branchial chamber of other Verte
  brata, it does not necessarily follow that the imperfect branchial skeleton
  of Amphioxus corresponds with their branchial skeleton.         The branchial
  skeleton of the higher Vertebrata consists of cartilaginous rods, which
  seem to be developed in the somatopleure, and to be homologous with the
  ribs, while the branchial skeleton of Amphioxus consists of fibrous bands
  apparently developed in the splanchnopleure.
      The branchial arches of the higher Vertebrata, in accordance with their
  essentially   costal nature,  receive   their innervation from     the glosso
  pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves, which are homologues of spinal
  nerves ; and, in seeking for the posterior limits of that region in Amphioxus
   which corresponds with the skull and brain in other Vertebrates, we must
   only take into account as many pairs of those nerves which arise from the
   cerebro-spinal axis as we know are, in the Vertebrata next above Amphi
   oxus, devoted to the branchial arches.      In  none of these are there more
   than seven pairs of branchial arches ;  so that not more than eight myotomes
   (and consequently protovertebrae)      of  Amphioxus, in addition to those
   already mentioned, can be reckoned as the equivalents of the parachordal
   region of the skull in the higher Vertebrates.      Thus it would appear that
   the cranium of the latter is represented by those segments of the body
   of Amphioxus which lie in front of the fifteenth, counting from before
   backwards, and that their cranial nerves are represented by the corre
   sponding anterior pairs of nerves in Amphioxus.
      In all Vertebrata above Amphioxus the nerves which answer to the
   seven posterior pairs in Amphioxus unite into one or two trunks on
  each   side, and give rise to the nerves called pneumogastric and glosso
  pharyngeal    ; and, as these pass out of the skull in front of the occipital

 1874.]                     and Skull of Amphioxus lanccolatus.                               131
 segment,       it would appear that this segment is, in the main, the result
 of the      chondrification, with or without subsequent ossification, of the four
 teenthprotovertebra.
      Thereis no evidence, at present, that the ear-capsule represents a
modification of any part of the vertebral skeleton, nor that the trabeculiB
are any       thing but an anterior pair of visceral arches.   And if these parts
have       nothing  to do with  centra, or  arches, of  vertebrae, it follows that
thenumerous protovertebrae, which lie in front of the fourteenth in
Amphioxus, are represented only by muscles and nerves in the higher
Vertebrata.
                end of the cerebro-spinal axis of Amphioxus answers
     The anterior
to the lamina terminalis of the thalamencephalon of the higher Verte
brata, the cerebral hemispheres and olfactory   lobes remaining unde
veloped.
  If the       auditory nerve      is,   as Gegenbaur has suggested, the dorsal branch
of   a                    represents both the portio dura and the portio
         single nerve which
mollis, theauditory organ of Amphioxus       to be sought in connexion with
                                                     is
the dorsal branch of its eighth nerve.     have found nothing representing
an auditory organ in this position

                                     and can only conclude that Amphioxus
                                               ;
really has no auditory apparatus.     In all other respects, however, con             it
forms to the Vertebrate type       and, considering its resemblance to the
                                           ;
early stages of Petromyzon described by Schulze,         can see no reason

for removing           it   from the class Pisces.        But its permanently segmented
skull and     its many other peculiarities suggest that     should be regarded
                                                                    it
as the     type of a primary division or subclass of the class Pisces, to which
the      name of Entomocrania may be applied, in contrast to the rest, in
which the  primary segmentation of the skull    lost, and which may be

   Deak Sib, — 1 write to give you a short account of my proceedings
 and success here so far, in my explorations of the Rodriguez bone-
caverns.
    I must     confess to a more or less degree of disappointment on my first
inspection of the caverns ; and you will understand the cause,                    I  think,
 when    I  inform you that out of thirteen caves which 1 found on my arrival,
 and which 1 believed till lately to be the only ones, twelve bore evident,
and some recent, signs of previous digging.                However, 1 set to work at
 once, and, with much diligent search, had found five new caves by the time
that we had finished the first thirteen.                               I
                                                      Out of these have reason to
 believe that, in three of them, no mortal foot has ever been previous to
 mine ; for the mouths of all were closed up by a falling-in of the rock, and
it was by this sign that         1 guessed at    their existence. We had to work
 some time at     all of them with a big iron mallet before entrance could be
effected.                                 I           I
               In one of these caves believe found the bones of two Soli
taires, without admixture of those of any other individuals. Of the truth
of this    I am pretty certain ; for they were clearly the bones of a male and
female which had fallen down into a cleft, from which egress to so
unwieldy a bird was impossible.
   Some of the bones had fallen into dust from exposure to the air, being
only partially covered with sand, whilst others had been altogether
removed, whether by water or not              I could not say, for     I found no trace
of its action there. The same cause, decay, which had nearly annihilated

  1874.]               the   Transit- Expedition at Rodriguez.                        133
 others    might have entirely removed these.             I found amongst these about
thirty rings      of the  trachea    or tracheoB.
    Since then     I  have found a small hook in another cave, to which it was
difficult, from the small size         of the entrance, to penetrate.       Into this also
a  slit or cleft from the surface          had led, but had since been obliterated.
In     this   I  found,    I   should say, seven " sets
                                                              "
                                                                of bones of Solitaire.
These were more or less mixed up together by the action of water ; but
they were still, to a certain extent, in groups, each group being those of
an    individual.      Amongst these        I  found a perfect skull, with maxilla
attached,     and the three parts of the mandible lying close by, four perfect
and several injured furcula, and many rings of tracheae.
    I propose soon to try my fortune in a small marsh near here, which looks
as if it might originally have been a lakelet or pond.                I  am induced to do
so by the      success that my labours met with in a similar locality in Mau
ritius.     I  have said " near here," but this is a slip of the pen ;           I  should
have said
               " near my encampment at the caverns."
    I have found, an immense quantity of tortoise-bones, from which shall           I
only make a selection           before leaving.    I have also exhumed a great quan
tity of bones        of smaller birds ; but       I  rather hesitate before giving a
description of their genera.
                           I
    I am afraid that cannot send any bones by this mail, as the difficulty
of  transport is so very great.            I  have every week brought back a few
bones     of Solitaire, but have had hardly any time to put even these in
gelatine, without which operation they would not travel with any degree
of safety.
                                        I am, dear   Sir,

    My bear       Sir, — A mail being about to            leave the island by H.M.S.
'
   Shearwater,'      I now    send you some account of my proceedings up to the
present     time.
    I have     searched for frogs, more especially tree-frogs, but all the natives
of   the island tell me that there are none ; and as               I  have neither heard
nor seen      them,    I conclude     that this must be the case.         •With regard to
lizards, there is a small          house-lizard very abundant.          It belongs to the
genus Peripia,        and   is  very probably the same as that found in Mauritius.
It is not only found in houses, but also in trees, beneath the bark of which
 it lays its eggs.       I have been      told of a much larger     lizard which inhabits
a certain      part of the island, and have myself searched the spot, but have

have     not yet procured one.

    The                         with regard to another lizard which lives
                same has been the case
on Frigate Island, a small island lying oil the coast of Rodriguez.
  With regard to freshwater fish, there are said to be four kinds,
viz.    :   —
    1.      A    of perch, commonly called carp here.
                 species
    2.      A    of eel, in most points agreeing with Anguilla marmorata,
                 species
but differing in one important point at least.   It undoubtedly enters the
streams here, as the specimen which                     I
                                          have was caught about a quarter
of a mile above the place whence we get our drinking-water.
   3. A species of Eleotris, a specimen of which was caught at the same
place as the eel.      This fish, however, undoubtedly enters brackish
water.
    4.      A   species     of Mugilva.       I   have my doubts as to whether                 this fish
can really be called a freshwater
                                species.
    With regard to the Arachnida,                   I
                                   have collected a considerable quantity
of spiders, and have got specimens of the small scorpion which is very
fairly common on the island.
    A  large Scolopendra is very common ; but a small species is not so,                            and
I   have only succeeded in procuring one specimen.
    I have collected           a very considerable      quantity of insects, more especially
of the order Coleoptera.
    Peripatus         I    have not been able to find, though                 I have made       diligent
search for it.
  There are two species of land-crab, both of which   have procured.              I
    I
    have only been able to find one very minute species of freshwater
sponge, which seems to be very rare.                        I
                                         have only found two small spe
cimens, which, however, came from two streams in widely different parts
of the island.
   The Vermes are not numerously represented on the island.     There are
one or two species of Lumbricus.     There are no leeches in the streams,
nor are there planarians either there or on land. There        however, a               is,
beautiful nemertine, which    have found under stones and wood in damp
                                      I
places.    have also found
                I             species of Gordius in
                                          a           stream.                 a

    P.S. — do not send any specimens home at present,
                I                                                                     as, being   nearly
all in spirit, they still want attention, and   also necessary for me
                                                                    it   is
to keep specimens by me, in order to ascertain whether   have already                 I
got specimens which            I   may find.

                                                    to-morrow,      for transmission by the
 mail leaving Mauritius on the 12th instant, a packet of seeds of some of
 the plants of this island ; and, in accordance with my instructions,                       I
 submit the following short report of my proceedings here up to the
 present date.
    I have   paid special attention to the Palms and Pandani.                  Of the former
 there are   three species indigenous — one of the genus Latania, and two
 belonging to the genus Areca.              The Pandani present much greater diffi
 culty in their   determination ; and           I do not      yet feel in a position to fix
definitely the number        of species, although          I rather incline to the idea that
there are   only  two    true    species.     My collection of the plants of the island
now numbers about 450 species, of which about three fourths are Phaeno-
gams.     I  have made observations with the view of discriminating between
the  indigenous and introduced vegetation, but there are several plants
regarding which       I  am doubtful.         I have not yet succeeded in finding any
marine Phamogams ; hitherto, however,                   I  have not devoted much time
to the marine flora.         There are no tree ferns on the island ; at least                I
have seen     none, and, as far as        I  can learn, none of the inhabitants have
seen any.      Ferns are represented by about two dozen species ; mosses
and   freshwater     algae are not abundant, but lichens are very numerous,
both as   species   and    as individuals.         This flora is by no means so exten
sive as  I  had expected ; but the survey of the island just concluded by
the officers of the
                         ' Shearwater ' shows the island is
                                                                         only about half the
size it was previously         supposed to be, it being only 11 miles long by 4
miles   broad.     The island is a volcanic one, consisting of a succession of
lava-flows, radiating from one or more foci in the centre of the island,
and now worn away so as to form a series of more or less parallel ridges,
separated by deep ravines.             These lava-flows are composed chiefly of a
dark compact basalt, not unfrequently                   becoming porphyritic, and com
monly exhibiting a marked columnar structure ; and                         I have counted as
many as twelve such flows, lying one above the other, separated severally,
either by beds of conglomerate, or by beds of laterite, or variously coloured
clayey beds.       Granite and sandstone do not occur in the island. At the
east and at the west ends of the island occur the only non-volcanic rock
in the island, namely coralline limestone, extending in huge sheets over
many acres of land, and also occurring in detached patches on the top of
the basalt, often nearly a mile from the sea.                         On the northern and
southern sides of the         island   it  does    not   occur  ;  but  on the southern side
may be seen some raised beaches, marking upheaval there, as does the
coralline limestone at the east and west sides.                      Zeolites are common in
 the basalt in many places, as also several other minerals.                        The whole
rocks of the island        are    permeated by         iron.    This    report  is very brief ;

but I have abstained      from entering into details regarding the botany and
geology of the island, leaving that for the full report to be given in on
my return.     I  trust, however, the above is sufficient to show that have  I
made some progress towards accomplishing              the objects for which   I was
sent out here.

     Since my first communication to the Royal Society
                                                                      " On the relative
 Duration of the Component Parts of the Radial Sphygmograph-Trace in
 Health" (P. R. S. vol.xviii. p. 351), it has not been my good fortune to find
 any similar observations by other physiologists, either in favour of or in
 opposition to my statements.           From that time my attention has been
 continually directed to similar phenomena; and the employment of
 similar methods has led to results which seem to have an important
 bearing on the problem of the action of the heart.                 It is evident that a
  thorough knowledge of the nature of the pulse in the arteries, when
  combined with that acquaintance with the anatomical mechanism of the
 heart and arteries that can be arrived at from post mortem examination,
  is sufficient basis for a fairly thorough study of the circulation of the
 blood.      It  has been my endeavour, by the employment              of the sphygmo-
  graph as constructed       by M. Marey, to obtain an amount of information
  from the curves which it produces, sufficient to generalize on the nature
  of the cardiac action in some of its details which have not as yet attracted
  attention.       The results will be stated in the form of propositions.

  ventricular systole at the heart and the closure of the aortic valve does
 not vary when the pulse-rate is constant, and varies as the square root          of
 the  length of the pulse-beat —being found from the equation an/=20 n/x,
 where    x= the pulse-rate, and y=the ratio borne by the above-named part
 to  the whole beat.
    This law, in a somewhat modified form, was enunciated by myself in a
                                '
paper published in the            Journal of Anatomy and Physiology ' (vol. v.
p. 17),    where the peculiarities of the curves taken in the lying posture
misled me as      to the point of commencement of the ventricular systole,
and    led me to state that posture had an effect on the duration of the
systole.     Such, however, is not the case ; for, while lying, the weight of
the   heart is apparently sufficiently great to neutralize the effect on the
trace    of the auricular      contraction,     and to make the thus taken trace
deficient   in the rise which at other times results from that contraction.
At all events     if this assumption be made, it is found that the lengths of
the   different parts of the beat are not influenced           by posture, and they
agree    exactly with the above-stated law.
    The   following are measurements made since the publication of the
original paper,     which tend fully to confirm the above statement : —

142                        Mr. A. H. Garrod       on the
    Prop.  II.  The length of the interval between the commencement                 of
the primary and the dicrotic rises in the radial artery is constant          for any
given pulse-rate, and varies as the cube root of the length of the pulse-
beat — being found from the equation x\j'=A1^ x, where #=the pulse-
rate, and y'= the ratio borne by the above-named part to the whole beat.
    This law was enunciated in the paper before referred to as read before
this Society by myself, and published in its ' Proceedings' (vol. xviii.
p. 351).      Since that paper was read a fresh series of measurements
have strongly confirmed its accuracy, and practice in manipulation has
diminished my limits of experimental error so far that a difference of
5 per cent, from the calculated results is rarely found.
    The following Table contains some of the more recent results and one
or two more careful measurements of old traces : —

     Prop.  III.  The length of the interval between the primary and the
 dicrotic rises follows the same law in the carotid and posterior tibial that
 it does in the radial artery.
     That such is the case as far as the femoral and posterior tibial
arteries are concerned is shown by Dr. Galabin in a paper " On the
 Secondary Waves in the Pulse," recently published (Journal of Anat.
 and Phys. 2nd series, No. xiii.).        It is not necessary, in proving this
law, to undertake any large series of measurements ; for if all those

    Corollary. —The length of the interval between the primary and
secondary rises being exactly the same in the carotid, radial, and pos
terior tibial arteries, which are three vessels at very different distances
from the heart, it is evident that the length of this interval is constant
throughout   the  larger arteries, and must be of the same duration at the
origin of the aorta that it is in the radial artery at the wrist.
                                                                         M2

141                       Mr. A. H. Garrod      on the
   The corollary to Proposition III. leads to theoretical results of con
siderable importance ; for as the duration of the different elements of
each beat in the radial artery is the same as that in the commencing
aorta, by superposing the sphygmograph-trace upon the cardiograph-trace
at any given pulse-rate, a comparison can be made between the duration
of the different physiological changes going on in the heart and those
going on in the commencing aorta ; in other words, the time during
which the ventricular and arterial systoles are continuous can be ascer
tained with precision by an indirect method, which alone is possible in
the human subject.
    Taking the equations given in Prop. I. and Prop. II., the length of the
systolic portion of each beat in the cardiograph- and sphygmograph-
traces may be calculated with facility for any value of .v. From the
 equations above given, namely,      xy=20 Vx and #y=47^J/#, it is found
 that the length   of the arterial systole is shorter than the cardiac, as
 would be expected, because the cardiograph-trace is an indication of the
 movements in the muscular walls of the heart, and not of the contained
 blood, and because a certain tension must be reached by the intraven
 tricular blood at the commencement of the systole before it can push
 open the aortic valves.
    The sphygmosystole being therefore shorter than the cardiac systole, it
 becomes a question, when an attempt is made to superpose them exactly,
 as to whether they correspond at the commencement or the end of the
 cardiosy stole.   This is easily answered ; for independent observations
 show the points in both at which the semilunar valves of the aorta close.
 These points in the traces must evidently be simultaneous, which is
 therefore the same thing as saying that the interval between the greater
 cardiosystole and the shorter sphygmosystole is at the commencement of
 the cardiosystole.    This interval, the existence of which is well indicated
 in Marey's cardio-aortic tracings from the horse, may be termed the
 tyspasis (the time during which the ventricles are raising the pressure of
 their contained blood) ; and the following Table, obtained from the two
  equations just mentioned, gives its length at different pulse-rates : —
                       •0018753'   at #= 36 approximately.
                       *00132986' „ a,- = 49
                       •000931'     „ # = 64
                       •00004199' „ # = 81
                       •0003766' „ #=100

                       •000000'     „ #=170
     From this Table it is evident that the syspasis varies considerably
  with different rapidities of pulse, decreasing rapidly with increase in the

                                     Circulation of the Blood.                             145

                                                                     fairly
conceived to be very near the limit of cardiac rapidity in man.
   That this interval (the syspasis) should vary so considerably in length
with differeut pulse-rates is not easy to explain at first sight ; never
theless a careful review of the different processes which are in operation
in the heart at the time has suggested to me an explanation which seems
reasonable.         It
                depends on the fact that the extreme shortness of the
diastole makes any variation in its length have a marked influence on the
amount of blood which enters the capillaries of the walls of the heart,
and consequently   influences the amount of work which the muscular
fibres of the ventricle have to perform in emptying their interstitial
vessels before they can commence contracting on the blood in their con
tained cavity.  Experiment shows that the rapidity of the pulse does not
depend on the pressure of the blood in the arterial system* ; conse
quently the length of the syspasis is not influenced by the arterial blood-
pressure, which is the same thing as saying that the force of the cardiac
contraction varies directly as the blood-pressure ; for then the muscular
power of the ventricular walls to overcome the intramural distention,
varying with it, prevents its duration from being modified.
   Ithas been my endeavour to show elsewhere t that the force of the
heart'scontraction is modified by the length of diastole, varying as its
square root.  Such being the case, it is evident that the length of the
syspasis      must vary with that of the diastole, though not to the extent
that     is found to occur.  But the diastolic period being always so short,
it is evident that the longer               it   is,
                                                  the more thoroughly does the heart-
tissue get permeated                 with blood, in way which can have little or no

   After the completion of the cardio-sphygmograph tracing above re
ferred to,    it was my endeavour to obtain satisfactory double sphygmo-
graph tracings from arteries at different distances from the heart. Two
or three unsuccessful attempts suggested the plan which has proved suc
cessful.     It was soon evident that there is only one artery, other than the
radial, which      it is possible to manipulate with any             degree    of facility,
especially when the experimenter is the subject of experiment.                        This
artery is    the  posterior tibial  at  the  ankle,   where   it  runs   in  the  interval
between the internal malleolus and the tuberosity of the os calcis, just
before   it gives off the internal calcaneal branches. On myself, this artery
is as superficial and as easily reached as the radial ; in the sitting posture
it is quite under command when the foot is crossed over the opposite
knee  ;  it is considerably further from the heart than the radial ; and to
obtain as great a difference as possible, the right wrist was on all occa
sions the one experimented on, the wrist and the ankle being, as far as
can be estimated on the living body, 29 inches and 52£ inches respec
tively from the aortic valves.
   Before going further       it will be necessary to consider the sphygmograph-
trace from    the posterior  tibial artery at   the  ankle.    Wolff *     has  published
the results of his observations on the dorsalis pedis artery ;                and as they
correspond with those from the ankle trace of the posterior tibial, they
may be recapitulated.          He remarks that the pulse at the foot has a
general resemblance to that at the wrist, it differing in the primary
ascent being less abrupt and the summit less acute. In the descent the
secondary undulation is remarkably insignificant.                     The other minor
undulations      are less constant.      My observations confirm the above with
respect    to  the  general similarity between the two pulses, the greater
obliquity of the primary rise, and the less constant character of the minor
undulations ; the secondary rise has, however, never struck me as pecu
liarly insignificant, though it       has   peculiarities,  to   be mentioned      imme
diately.

 ordinary sphygmograph,                 differs from that at the wrist in more than one
 point.   The primary rise, as previously mentioned, is less abrupt ; the
 following fall is more considerable, and is not broken by the notch
 nearly constantly seen in wrist traces of this rapidity. The secondary
 rise starts        from a lower level and is well marked,
                                                      reaching its climax
 considerably nearer the next primary rise than in the wrist trace. There
   however, another feature in the early part of the secondary rise in
 is,
 the ankle                 deserves special attention because of its general
                   trace, which
 occurrence.            As
                        well known, in wrist traces the secondary rise com
                              is
  mences promptly and       quite uniform in character, but in ankle traces
                                   is
  there    nearly always
          is                 short horizontal continuation of the curve im

                                   an abrupt, though not considerable, change
in   direction.  This horizontal portion of the trace       not of any con     is
 siderable length, being in     pulse of 70
                                         a     minute about one eighth of the
                                                                 a

 longer and more gradual than the primary.         Though described above as
 horizontal, this short interval between the two undulations           not so              is
always, being frequently slightly oblique, sometimes in one direction,
sometimes in the other.       When its curve      downwards (that is, when

       Results arrived at from the study    of  the  simultaneous wrist ami
                                 ankle tracings.
   In employing the tracings obtained from the above compound instru
ment, two objects were kept in view— -first, to find the interval between
the commencement of the primary rises in the wrist and ankle curves ;
and secondly, to observe whether or no the superposition of the one trace
upon the other verified or falsified the statement made in Prop. III.,
that the lengths of the different parts of each element of the curve were
the same in the two arteries.
   The following Table contains the measurements of the lengths of the
intervals between the commencement of the primary rise in the wrist and
ankle tracings at different rapidities of pulse, from which it is clear that
this interval varies very slightly within the range that can be obtained,
and that the tendency is for it to be very slightly longer in the slower
pulses.

   It being possible to estimate with considerable accuracy the distance
from the aortic valves of the spots on the arteries at which the instru
ment is usually applied, it becomes a point of interest to determine from
the facts arrived at the rapidity with which the primary undulation
travels from its origin (the heart) to the peripheral vessels.         The radial
artery at the wrist and the posterior tibial artery at the ankle are, as
 nearly as can be determined, 29 inches and 52| inches respectively from

therefore be said that the compound sphygmograph -trace            entirely in              is

        The interval between the commencement of the primary pulse-rise
in the radial and that in the posterior tibial artery less than would be       is
estimated from the time taken by the same wave in travelling from the
aortic valve to the radial artery.

the different component parts of the cardiac revolution, as ite different
elements are there shown in their actual relations one to the other.

         The following Papers were read : —
<?
     I. "    Remarks     on a New Map       of the Solar Spectrum."             By
 c/LA J-         Norman     Lockyer,     F.R.S.      Received    November       13,
            1874.
        I beg  permission to lay before the Royal Society a portion of the new
     map of the solar spectrum referred to in one of my former communi
    cations.
        It  consists of the portion between w. 1. 39 and 41 .
        I  have found it necessary, in order to include all the lines visible in
    my photographs in such a manner that coincidences may be clearly
    shown, to construct     it on four times the  scale  of Angstrom's "    Spectre
    Normal."
        The spectra of the following elements have been photographed        side by
    side with the solar spectrum and the coincidences shown : —
                    Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Ce, U, Cr, Ba, Sr, Ca,    K, Al.
        The wave-lengths of new lines in the portion of this spectrum at       pre
    sent completed have been obtained from curves of graphical interpolation.
    Instead of the reading of a micrometer-scale, a photographic print of the
    spectrum has been employed in the construction of these curves, the
    wave-lengths of the principal lines being taken from an unpublished map
    of the ultra-violet region of the solar spectrum, a copy of which has been
   kindly placed at my disposal by M. Cornu. The photograph of the solar
    spectrum from the ultra-violet to beyond F, kindly given to me by Mr.
   Rutherfurd, has also proved of great service in the present work.        I have,
   in fact, up to the present time, only been able to excel this photograph in
   the region about H.
        From the extreme difficulty of carrying on eye-observations      upon   the
   portion of the spectrum now completed, Angstrom's map is, of course,
   very incomplete about this region.      The few lines mapped differ slightly
   in some cases from the positions assigned by Cornu ; but the wave-lengths
   given by the latter observer generally fall into the curve without breaking
   its symmetry,      and these positions have therefore been adopted.         The
   advantage possessed by the photographic method over eye-observation
   may be estimated from the following numerical comparisons :—

    The purification of the various metallic spectra has at present been
 only partially effected ; but    I   have seen enough already to convince me
                                                       I
 of the extreme rigour with which the principle have already announced
 may be applied, while, at the same time, there are evidences that the
 application of it may lead to some results not anticipated in the first
 instance.
    My object in laying these maps before the Society, and presenting this
 ad interim report of progress, is to appeal to some other man of science,
 if not in England, then in some other country, to come forward to aid in
 the work, which    it is improbable that I, with my small observational
 means and limited      time, can carry to a termination.           I  reckon that,
 having regard to routine solar work,       it will require    another    year before
the portion from H to G is completely finished, even for the metals the
spectra of which are shown in the maps now exhibited.                 When this is
done there will still remain outstanding all the ultra-violet portion, the
portion from G to F (both capable of being photographed by short expo
sure), and the whole of the less-refrangible part (which both Draper and
                                                                      o2

Rutherfurd      have shown       can be reached by long exposure                with the
present processes).
    I cannot but think, moreover, that when the light which the spectro
scope has already thrown upon molecular action shall be better known,
and used as a basis for further inquiry, methods of photography greatly
exceeding the present one in rapidity, in the less-refrangible portion of
the spectrum, will be developed and utilized in the research.
    The map is being drawn by my assistant, Mr. Raphael Meldola (to
whom my thanks are due for the skill and patience he has brought to
bear upon the work), in the first instance, with more especial reference
to the positions, thicknesses, and individualities of the lines ; the
final revision will consist of an absolute intensity reproduction of the
photographs.
II.    " On the Spectrum              of Coggia's Comet."                 By William
       Huggins, D.CL., LL.D., F.R.S., For. Sec. R.A.S. Received
       November 13, 1874.
                                        [Plate 6.]
    In  the years 1866, 1868, and 1871*             I had   the honour to communi
cate  to the Royal Society some observations with the spectroscope of five
small comets, including Encke's comet at its return in 1871.
    These observations showed that a great part of the light of these
comets was not reflected solar light, but light emitted by the matter of
the comets. Further, the coincidence which was found to exist, in the
case of three of the comets, between the three bright bands into which
their light was resolved by the prism and the spectrum of some com
pounds of carbon appeared to indicate the presence of that element, in
some form, in the cometary matter.               The comet now visible, which was
detected by M. Coggia, April 17, 1874, is the first bright comet to which
the spectroscope has been applied.             The following spectroscopic observa
tions of this comet were made from July 1 to July 15.
    When the slit of the spectroscope was placed across the nucleus and
coma, there was seen in the instrument a broad spectrum, consisting of
the three bright bands which were exhibited by Comet II., 1868 1, crossed
by a linear continuous spectrum from the light of the nucleus.
                                                            I
    In the continuous spectrum of the nucleus was not able to distin
guish with certainty any dark lines of absorption, or any bright lines
other than the three bright bands.
    Besides these spectra, there was also present a faint broad continuous
 spectrum between and beyond the bright bands.
     When the slit was moved on to different parts of the               coma, the bright

  1875.]                   Spectrum   of Coggia's  Comet.                   155
 bands  and the faint continuous spectrum were observed to vary in relative
 intensity.
    When the slit was brought back past the nucleus on to the commence
 ment of the tail, the gaseous spectrum became rapidly fainter, until, at a
 short distance from the nucleus, the continuous spectrum predominated
so strongly that the middle band only, which is the brightest, could be
 detected on it.
    We have presented to us, therefore, by the light of the comet three
 spectra  : —
    1. The spectrum of bright bands.
    2. The continuous spectrum of the nucleus.
    3. The continuous spectrum which accompanies the gaseous spectrum
in the coma, and which represents almost entirely the light of the tail.
                         1. The Spectrum of Bright Bands.
    The three bright bands were obviously similar in position and character
 to those which were observed in Comet II., 1868.           In that comet the
 bands could not be resolved into lines ; but in the spectrum of the comet
 now under observation, on some occasions, especially during the early
 part of July, the three bands were partially resolved into lines.          The
 resolution of the bands was seen most distinctly at the boundary of the
 coma, where the continuous        spectrum was very faint.
    The bands appeared to me to be brighter relatively to the continuous
 spectrum during the early part of the time that the comet was under
 observation.
    On July 7, the bands were compared directly with the spectrum of the
 induction-spark taken in a current of defiant gas.              I  suspected a
 small shift of all three bands towards the more-refrangible end of the
 spectrum.
    July 8. —  I made some     measures of the want of coincidence of the less-
 refrangible edge    of the  middle  and brightest band with the corresponding
 part of the band in the spectrum of the blue part of a small oil-flame.
 Afterwards     I  found that the collimating lens had shifted during the
 taking of the measures.        I  repeated the observations on July 13.     On
 this day   I estimated the shift of the brightest band to be about | of the
distance of b3 to 6s. The other bands appeared to be similarly displaced
in relation to the bands of the terrestrial spectrum.        The estimation of
the amount of displacement was rendered more difficult by the circum
stance that the cometary band was not so bright at the less-refrangible
limit as was the band in the spectrum of the oil-flame.              With this
exception,    the relative    brightness  of the different parts  of the bands
agreed with the corresponding           parts of the bands in the terrestrial
spectrum.
   On the supposition of the identity of the comet's bands with those of
the spectrum of carbon, the shift which was observed would indicate a

 relative motion of approach of the comet and the earth of about 40
 miles per second, a velocity nearly double that of their actual relative
 motion.
    According to     a table   of the comet's motion, kindly furnished to      me by
 Mr. Hind, F M.S., the comet was approaching the earth on that day with
 a velocity of about 24 miles per second.          The part of the earth's orbital
 motion in the direction of the comet may be disregarded, as it was less
 than a mile per second.
    In  the foregoing observations the slit was placed on the brightest part
 of the envelope, close in front of the nucleus.             Was any part of the
 shift due to the motion of the matter within the comet ?                If the mea
 sures taken on     July  8, when the lens was found to have shifted, could
 be regarded as     trustworthy, they would indicate      a slightly larger shift on
 that day.
    In connexion with the question whether the bright bands were fur
 nished by a vapour containing carbon in some form, it is of importance
 to notice that the bright line near 6 which accompanies the three bands
 in the spectrum of carbon and its compounds appears to be absent in the
 spectrum of the comet.          I took some pains to satisfy myself that this line
 was not to be detected       in the comet's spectrum.       If it had been present
 with the same relative brilliancy which it possesses in the terrestrial
 spectrum, I should have been able to see it easily.             The relative faint-
ness or entire absence of this more-refrangible band                 might find   its
explanation possibly      in  the  low  temperature   of the  cometary matter.
    If the  bands are to be considered as due to carbon, we have to inquire
 in what form the carbon exists in the matter of the comet.             In my paper
 on Comet     II., 1868, 1 pointed out that though some comets have been
exposed    to  an intense degree of solar radiation, and though carbon might
exist possibly in some condition more easily volatilized than those with
 which we are acquainted on the earth, " still, under the most favourable
 of known conditions, the solar heat to which the majority of comet* are
 subjected would seem to be inadequate to the production of luminous
 vapour of carbon."       I  then stated that the necessity for a very high tem
perature would be diminished if we were to conceive of the existence in
the comet of a compound of carbon and hydrogen which could furnish
those bands without undergoing decomposition.
    The remarkable connexion of the orbits of comets with those of swarms
of meteors, together with the presence of hydrocarbons in many
meteorites, would seem to suggest the probability that, if carbon be present
in comets, it exists in combination with hydrogen.
    I stated, in the paper quoted above, that the spectrum of bright bands
was also obtained from cyanogen.            In the case of the hydrocarbons, the
spectrum    of  bands   was accompanied by the lines of hydrogen ; and when
cyanogen was employed, the known complex spectrum of nitrogen was
present.      A    spectrum     essentially  the  same,  but   less complete, was

    1875.J                Spectrum   of Coggia's    Comet.                         157
 obtained, together      with the known lines of oxygen, when carbonic acid
 and carbonic     oxide were employed.
                   2. The Continuous Spectrum      of the Nucleus.
     I was  not able to satisfy myself of the existence in the continuous
 spectrum of the nucleus     of any dark lines, nor of any bright lines, other
  than the three bright bands which have been described.
    I found that the presence of the bright bands increased therelative bright
 ness of the middle part of the linear continuous spectrum, so as to give an
 apparently smaller relative amplitude to the red and violet parts of the spec
 trum. This was particularly noticed to be the case during the first week of
J  oly. When some breadth was given to the spectrum by means of a cylin
 drical lens, the bright bands were clearly distinguished in         it,
                                                                    and then the
relative brightness of different parts of the continuous spectrum was more
nearly that of an ordinary incandescent body.          The blue end of the con
 tinuous spectrum appeared to fail abruptly        little beyond G, and
                                                   a                          was
                                                                               I
not able to trace the spectrum beyond this point.          I  took this circum
stance at first to show the absence of the violet rays, and consequently
a  low temperature in the nucleus.      Afterwards, when the solar spectrum
was reduced to about the brightness of that of the comet,            observed
                                                                     I              a
similar apparent abrupt termination of light at the same part of the
spectrum, which     istherefore a phenomenon due to the eye of the observer.
Although     it is probable that the violet rays are absent, or at least not
present with any great intensity in the light of the nucleus, this observa
tion of the apparent failure of the spectrum       alittle beyond      G
                                                                      cannot,       by
itself, be accepted as     trustworthy proof that such       really the case.
                                                             it is
                          a
    When the nucleus was examined in the telescope,          appeared as well- a
defined minute point of light of great brilliancy.         I suspected at times
a  sort of intermittent flashing in the bright point.        The nucleus sug
gested to me an object on fire, of which the substance was not uniform
in   composition, so that at intervals    it burned with       more vivid light.
                                                                a

860, was l"-8.       On July 13th the measure was nearly double, viz. 3";
bat at this time the point of light was less defined.        On July 15th the
nucleus appeared elongated towards the following side of the comet, at
an angle     of about 40° to the comet's axis.
    The nucleus appeared  of an orange- colour.   This may be due' in part
to the effect of contrast with the greenish light of the coma.     Sir John
Herechel described the head of the comet of 1811 to be of a greenish or
bluish-green colour, while the central point appeared to be of a pale ruddy
tint.   The elder Struve's representations of Halley's comet, at its appear
ance in 1835, are coloured green, and the nucleus         coloured reddish
                                                               is
yellow.   He describes the nucleus on October     thus, " Der Kern zeigte

comet of 1862      : — " Die Faroe   des  Strahls erscheint mir gelbrothlich    ; die
des umgebenden Nebels         (vielleicht aus Contrast) mattblaulich. . . . Die
Farbe der Ausstromung erscheint mir gelblich; die Coma hat blau-
liches   Licht."
     3. The Continuous Spectrum which accompanies         the Gaseous Spectrum.
     This spectrum was observed in every part of the coma; near its
boundary, and in the dark space behind the nucleus, the continuous
spectrum became so faint as to be detected with difficulty, at the same time
 that the bright bands were distinctly visible.
     The greater brightness of some parts of the envelopes and of the coma
 appeared to be due for the most part to the presence of a larger quantity
 of the matter which gives a continuous spectrum.               When the slit was
 placed on these brighter parts of the comet, the gaseous spectrum did not
 become brighter in the same degree, but there was an increase in the
  brightness of the continuous spectrum.
      Behind the nucleus, the bright bands became fainter relatively to the
  accompanying continuous spectrum, until the brightest band only could
  be detected.      The more distant parts of the tail give probably a con
  tinuous spectrum only.
      In the coma there was seen occasionally a remarkable inequality in the
  brightness of the continuous spectrum between the bands.                 On some
  occasions the light between the first and second band was bright, while
  in the other parts of the spectrum the light was faint.
      On several evenings    I satisfied   myself that polarized light was present
  in every part of the comet.           I   do not think that the proportion of
  polarized light exceeded ^ of the       total light. The polarization, as exhi
  bited by the partial extinction of       one of the images formed by a double-
  image prism, appeared      to  be more    marked in the tail. It must be remem
  bered that such would appear to be the case to some extent even if the
  proportion were not really greater, because the same proportional dimi
  nution in a faint object is more appreciated by the eye. Still there was
  probably a relatively large proportion of polarized light in the tail.
      The reflected solar light would account for a large part of the continuous
  spectrum.      To what source are we to ascribe the remaining light which
   the prism resolves into a continuous spectrum ?            Is it due to reflection
   from discrete particles, too large relatively to the wave-lengths of the
   light for polarization to take place ? or is it due to incandescent solid
   particles ? From the coexistence of the band-spectrum, we can scarcely
   think of distinct masses of gas dense enough to give a continuous
  spectrum.
      The difficulty which presents itself in accounting for sufficient heat
   to maintain this matter and the nucleus in a state of incandescence has
   also to be encountered in respect of the gaseous matter which emits the
   light which is resolved into the bright bands.

    The solar radiation to which the comet was subjected would be inade
quate to account for this state of things directly.       Is there chemical
action set up within the comet by the sun's heat ?      Is the comet's light
due to electricity in any form excited by the effect of the solar radiation
upon the matter of the comet ? Are we to look for the source of the
light to the friction of the particles of the cometary matter which has
been thrown into violent agitation by the comet's approach to the sun ?
   The comet was unfavourably situated for examination from my obser
vatory, as it was seen on a background of sky illuminated by the lights
of London ; and as it approached the horizon, it became partially concealed
by the chimneys of some neighbouring houses. Nearly the whole of the
time that the comet was visible was consumed in the observations with
the spectroscope ; and a few sketches only were made of the appearances
presented by the head of the comet in the telescope.
   The two sketches which accompany this note (Plate 6) were made on
July 13 and 14. On the latter evening the fainter parts of the coma,
which are wanting in the sketch, were rendered invisible by the bright
background of sky. Two of the phases presented by the intersection of
the envelopes are shown in the sketches.         The .narrow black channel
behind the nucleus passed on the right-hand side of the nucleus (as seen
in the telescope), where it terminated in a small round extension, pre
senting something of the appearance of a black pin, with its head by the
side of the nucleus.
III. "On        Acoustic Reversibility."       By   J. Tyndall, D.CL.,
              LL.D., F.R.S.     Received December 31, 1874.
    On the 21st and 22nd of June, 1822, a Commission appointed by the
 Bureau of Longitudes of France executed a celebrated series of experi
 ments on the velocity of sound.     Two stations had been chosen, the one
 at Villejuif, the other at Montlhéry, both lying south of Paris, and 11'6
 miles distant from each other.     Prony, Mathieu, and Arago were the
 observers at Villejuif, while Humboldt, Bouvard, and Gay-Lussac were
 at Montlhery. Guns, charged sometimes with 2 lbs. and sometimes with
 3 lbs. of powder, were fired at both stations, and the velocity was deduced
 from the interval between the appearance of the flash and the arrival of
 the sound.
    On this memorable occasion an observation was made which, as far as
 I  know, has remained a scientific enigma to the present hour. It was
 noticed that while every report of the cannon fired at Montlhery was
 heard with the greatest distinctness at Villejuif, by far the greater
 number of the reports from Villejuif failed to reach Montlhery. Had
 wind existed, and had it blown from Montlhery to Villejuif, it would

                                                                               [Jan.   7,
have been recognized as the cause of the observed difference ; but the air
at the time was calm, the slight motion of translation actually existing
being from Villejuif towards Montlhery, or against the direction in which
the sound was best heard.
   So marked was the difference in transmissive power between the two
directions, that on the 22nd of    June, while every shot fired at Montlhery
was heard     "           " at
                  a merveille  Villejuif, but one shot out of twelve fired at
Villejuif was heard, and that feebly, at the other station.
   With the caution which characterized him on other occasions, and which
has been referred to admiringly by Faraday*, Arago made no attempt to
explain this anomaly.               His words are : — " Quant aux differences          si
remarquables d'intensite   que le bruit du canon a toujours presentés
suivant qu'il se propageaient du nord au sud entre Villejuif et Montlhery,
ou du sud au nord entre cette seconde station et la premiere ; nous ne
chercherons    pas aujourd'hui a l'expliquer, parce que nous ne pourrions
offrir au lecteur que des conjectures denuees de preuves"t.
  I    have tried, after much perplexity of thought, to bring this sub
ject within the range of experiment, and have now to submit to the
Royal Society a possible solution of the enigma.         The first step was
to ascertain whether, the sensitive flame referred to in my recent
paper in the Philosophical Transactions          could be safely employed
in experiments on the mutual reversibility of a source of sound and
an object on which the sound impinges.            Now the sensitive flame
usually employed by me measures from 18 to 24 inches in height, while
the reed employed as a source of sound is less than a square quarter
of an inch in area. If, therefore, the whole flame, or the pipe which
fed   it,were sensitive to sonorous vibrations, strict experiments on rever
sibility with the reed and flame might be difficult,          not impossible.
                                                                     if
Hence my desire to learn whether the seat of sensitiveness was so
localized   in the flame    as to render the contemplated           interchange of flame
and reed permissible.
  The flame being placed behind                a  cardboard screen, the shank of a
funnel passed through           a   hole   in the cardboard was directed upon the
middle of the flame. The sound-waves issuing from the vibrating reed
placed within the funnel produced no sensible effect upon the flame.
Shifting the funnel so         as to direct    its shank upon the root of the flame,
the action was violent.
   To augment the precision of the experiment, the funnel was connected
with glass tube
      a            feet long and half an inch in diameter, the object
                      3
being to weaken by  distance the effect of the waves diffracted round the
edge of the funnel, and to permit those only which passed through
the glass tube to act upon the flame.
   Presenting the end of the tube to the orifice of the burner (6, fig. 1),

or the orifice to the end         of the tube, the flame was violently agitated
by    the sounding-reed, E.          On shifting the tube, or the burner, so
as   to concentrate the sound on a portion of the flame about half an

inch above      the orifice, the action was nil.        Concentrating the sound
upon the      burner itself about half an inch below its orifice, there was no
action.
    These experiments        demonstrate the localization  of " the  seat of sensi
tiveness," and they prove the flame to be an appropriate instrument for
the contemplated experiments on reversibility.
    The experiments proceeded thus : — The sensitive flame being placed
close behind a screen of cardboard 18 inches high by 12 inches wide, a
vibrating reed, standing at the same height as the root of the flame, was
placed at a distance of 6 feet on the other side of the screen.                 The
sound of the reed, in this position,          produced  a strong  agitation  of  the
flame.
    The whole       upper half of the flame was here visible from the reed ;
hence the necessity of the foregoing experiments to prove the action of
the sound on the upper portion of the flame to be nil, and that the waves
had really to bend round the edge of the screen so as to reach the seat of
 sensitiveness     in the neighbourhood of the burner.
    The     positions of the flame and reed were reversed, the latter being
 now     close behind the screen, and the former at a distance of 6 feet
 from     it.  The sonorous vibrations were without sensible action upon
 the flame.
    The experiment        was repeated and varied in many ways.          Screens of
 various sizes were employed ; and instead of reversing the positions of the
 flame and reed, the screen was moved so as to bring, in some experiments
 the flame, and in other experiments the reed, close behind it.           Care was
 also   taken that no reflected sound from the walls or ceiling of the labora
 tory, or from the body of the experimenter, should have any thing to do
  with the effect.       In all cases it was shown that the sound was effective
  when the reed was at a distance from the screen and the flame close

in the larger experiments of 1822.                        Happily an incidental observation of
great significance comes here to our aid.    It was observed and recorded
at the time that while the reports of the guns at Villejuif were without
echoes,  aroll of echoes, lasting from 20 to 25 seconds, accompanied every
shot at Montlhery, being heard by the observers there.     Arago, the
writer of the Report,  referred these echoes to reflection  from the
clouds, an explanation           think we are entitled to regard as pro
                                          whichI

clouds to be only a mile distant, the sound and its echo would have
been separated     an interval of nearly ten seconds.

strong reason to question             the hypothesis         of   the illustrious  French
philosopher.
    And considering the hundreds of shots fired at the South Foreland,
with the attention specially directed to the aerial echoes, when no single
case occurred    in which echoes of measurable duration did not accompany
the report of the gun,         I think Arago's statement that at Villejuif no
echoes   were heard when the sky was clear must simply mean that they
vanished with great rapidity.                Unless the attention were specially
directed to the point, a slight prolongation of the cannon-sound might
well escape observation ; and it would be all the more likely to do so if
the echoes were so loud and prompt as to form apparently part and parcel
of the direct sound.
    I should  be very    loth to transgress here the limits of fair criticism, or
to throw doubt, without good reason, on the recorded observations of an
eminent man.        Still, taking into account what has been just stated, and
remembering      that the minds of Arago and his colleagues were occupied
by a totally   different problem (that the echoes were an incident rather
than an object of observation),          I think we may justly consider         the sound
                                          "
which he called " instantaneous              as one whose aerial echoes did not dif
ferentiate themselves from the direct sound by any noticeable fall of
intensity, and which rapidly died into silence.
    Turning now to the observations at Montlhery, we are struck by the
extraordinary duration of the echoes heard at that station.                  At the South
Foreland    the   charge habitually         fired   was    equal   to the largest of those
employed by the French philosophers ; but on no occasion did the gun-
sounds produce echoes approaching to 20 or 25 seconds' duration. It
rarely reached half this amount.                 Even the syren-echoes, which were
more remarkable and more long-continued than those of the gun, never
reached the duration of the Montlhery echoes.                     The nearest approach to
it was on the 17th of October, 1873, when the syren-echoes required
 15 seconds to subside into silence.
    On this same day, moreover (and this is a point of marked signi
ficance), the transmitted sound reached its maximum range, the gun-
sounds being heard at the Quenocs buoy, which is 16£ nautical miles
 from the South Foreland.           I  have already stated that the duration of the

air-echoes indicates         the atmospheric depths              from which they come*.
 An optical analogy may help us here. Let light fall upon chalk, the
light is wholly scattered by the superficial particles ; let the chalk be
powdered and mixed with water, light reaches the observer from a far
 greater depth of the turbid liquid. The solid chalk typifies the action of
 exceedingly dense acoustic clouds ; the chalk and water that of clouds of
 moderate density. In the one case we have echoes of short, in the other
 echoes of long duration.         These considerations prepare us for the infer
 ence that Montlhery,         on the occasion referred            to, must have been sur-

rounded by a highly diacoustic atmosphere ; while the shortness of the
echoes at Villejuif shows the atmosphere surrounding that station to
have been acoustically opaque.
  Have we any clue to the cause of the opacity                                     ?   I think we       have.
Villejuif is close to Paris, and over it, with the observed light wind,                                      was
slowly wafted the air from the city. Thousands of chimneys to windward
of Villejuif were discharging their heated currents ; so that an atmosphere
non-homogeneous in a high degree must have surrounded that station.
At no great height in the atmosphere the equilibrium of temperature
would be established.    The non-homogeneous air surrounding Villejuif
is experimentally typified by our screen with the source of sound close
behind   it,
           the upper edge of the screen representing the place where
equilibrium of temperature was established in the atmosphere above the
station.  In virtue of its proximity to the screen, the echoes from our
sounding-reed would, in the case here supposed, so blend with the direct
sound as to be practically indistinguishable from   as the echoes at Vil     it,

 as  to form an acute angle with each other. At the end of one is the
 vibrating reed r ; opposite the end of the other, and in the prolonga
 tion of P O, is the sensitive flame /, a second sensitive flame             (/)  being
 placed   in the  continuation     of  the axis of M  N.   On   sounding  the reed,  the
 direct sound through M N agitates the flame/'. Introducing the square of
 calico ab at the proper angle, a slight decrease of the action on/1 is
 noticed, and the feeble echo from a b produces a barely perceptible agitation
 of the flame/.       Adding another square, cd, the sound transmitted by
 ab impinges on ed ; it is partially echoed, returns through ab, passes along
 PO, and still further agitates the flame/. Adding a third square, «/,
 the reflected sound is still further augmented, every accession to the echo
 being accompanied by a corresponding withdrawal of the vibrations from
f   and a consequent stilling of that flame.
    With thinner calico or cambric it would require a greater number of
layers to intercept the entire sound ; hence with such cambric we should
have echoes returned from a greater distance, and therefore of greater
duration.        Eight layers of the calico employed in these experi
ments, stretched on a wire frame and placed close together as a
kind of pad, may be taken to represent a very dense acoustic cloud.
Such a pad, placed at the proper angle beyond N, cuts off the sound,
which in its absence reaches /', almost as effectually as an imper
vious solid plate* : the flame /' is thereby stilled, while             /  is far more
powerfully agitated than by the reflection from a single' layer.              With the
source of sound close at hand, the echoes from such a pad would be
of insensible duration.           Thus    close at hand do    I  suppose the acoustic
clouds surrounding Villejuif            to have been, a similar shortness of echo
being the consequence.
    A  further step is here taken in the illustration of the analogy between
light and sound.           Our pad acts chiefly by internal reflection.             The
sound     from    the  reed    is a   composite    one, made    up  of partial  sounds
differing in pitch.         If these sounds be ejected from the pad in their
pristine proportions, the pad is acoustically white ; if they return with
their proportions altered, the pad is acoustically coloured.
    In these experiments my assistant, Mr. Cottrell, has rendered                    me
material assistance.
   * January 13th. — Since thia was written I have sent the sound through fifteen
lavers of calico, and echoed it back through the same layers, in strength sufficient to
agitate the flame.    Thirty layers were here crossed by the sound.

   The object of the memoir is to notice certain forms into which the
primary elliptic functions admit of being thrown, and to discuss the iden

in some of the physical properties of iron caused   its temporary immer                by
sion in hydrochloric and sulphuric acids.    This change    at once made                          is
evident to any one by the extraordinary decrease in toughness and break

the metal slowly regains its original toughness and strength.       With                                                a
view of ascertaining the cause and degree of this change,        have from                            I
time to time made a number of experiments, some of which were carried
out on a large scale in an iron-works where quantities of sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids are used to remove the coating of oxide from iron wire,
preparatory to drawing it. Many of these experiments have been already
described in    somewhat desultory form in the Proceedings of the Lite
                   a                                                               '

Dec. 30th, 1873, Jan. 13th, March 10th and 24th, 1874.
   As mentioned before, first noticed that iron wire became more brittle
                                   I
after   afew minutes' immersion (half      minute will sometimes suffice)
                                                                     a

being bent once on itself, while before immersion      would bear bending               it
on itself and back again two or three times before breaking.       But per
haps the most remarkable phenomenon was, that          while still hot from             if,
the effort of breaking, the fractured part was wetted,  appeared to froth.                   it

   J 875.]        Hydrogen and      Adds    on Iron and Steel.                169
 copious bubbles of gas being given off from the whole surface of the
  fracture for 30 to 40 seconds, or even longer, making the water on the
 fractured surface appear to boil violently.      This frothing is increased by
 any thing that augments the heat produced by fracture; in fact it is
 necessary that the fracture be more or less warm to cause the escape of
 bubbles ; for if the wire be nicked and broken short without generating
 any heat, few or no bubbles will be seen. By further experiment         I found
 that other acids, such as acetic, had the same effect on iron as those first
 used ;  and it became evident that any acid which liberates hydrogen by
 its action on iron is able to produce them.          Nitric acid, which under
 usual conditions does not liberate hydrogen by its action on iron, is, how
 ever, without effect.   The frothing, the diminution of toughness, and all
 other changes caused by immersion in acid are, as a rule, only temporary ;
for after an exposure to a temperature of about 16° C. for three days, or
of 200° C. for half a day, the wire will be found to have regained its ori
ginal toughness, and no bubbles, or any sign of evolution of gas, will be
seen, as before, on moistening the fracture. The bubbles also cease to be
visible long before the wire has recovered its original toughness or elas
ticity.    Immersion in water, particularly if warm, hastens the restoration
of toughness, and numerous bubbles may be seen to arise from the iron
when first immersed.      If a little caustic soda, or other alkali, be added to
the water in which the iron is laid, its recovery is still further hastened,
as it neutralizes a film of acid which seems to adhere to the surface of all
iron which has been attacked by acid.
     It seems at first remarkable that steel does not froth when fractured
after immersion in acid, under the same conditions as will produce a vio
lent evolution of gas with iron ; and yet the action of acids on steel is
more rapid, more marked, and more permanent than on iron. The decrease
in toughness is such that a piece of steel which, previous to immersion
in hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, would stand bending on itself and back
 two or three times, will break short off like a pipe-stem when bent. So
 great is the influence of acid, in fact, that 10 minutes' immersion in dilute
 sulphuric acid will sometimes cause a coil of highly carbonized tem
  pered cast-steel wire to break of itself into several pieces while in the
 liquid.
     The amount of carbon in the steel appears, moreover, to be connected
 with the action of acid ; for in mild Bessemer steels, containing about
 0-20 to 0-25 per cent, of carbon, the change is a very little more marked
 than in iron, even frothing being apparent after prolonged immersion.
 With an increased percentage of carbon the action, however, is more
 marked and of longer duration.          Half an hour's immersion in hydro
chloric acid will make a piece of steel containing, say, 0-60 per cent,
of carbon break with a much darker-coloured         fracture, and render it bo
brittle that no amount of exposure to the air or heat will ever completely
restore it.   On hardened and tempered steel the decrease in toughness
                                                                   p2

produced by immersion in acid is greater and more rapid than with the
same steel in a soft state.
   Suspecting that the absence of frothing on the surface of steel after
immersion in acid might arise from the bubbles of gas given off being
so small as to be invisible to the naked eye,    I  examined the moistened
fracture of a piece of steel under a microscope with a power of 250 dia
meters.     My expectations were fulfilled, for numbers of minute bubbles
were seen to rise from parts of the moistened fracture.       It appears that
the fibrous and open structure of iron allows any gas which has been
occluded in its substance to pass more easily to the surface of the fracture
than will the close, unfibrous, homogeneous structure of steel ; conse
 quently the evolution of gas will not be so rapid with steel as with iron.
 Moreover the fracture of steel presents an almost infinite number of small
points, all favourable to the rapid evolution of small bubbles invisible to
the naked eye.      Iron wire, on the other hand, breaks with a fibrous
mossy fracture, which will retain the small bubbles until they have grown
sufficiently large to be visible to the naked eye.     Hence the frothing in
iron and its absence in steel.
   The following experiments were made to ascertain if there was any
 appreciable increase in weight in iron which frothed over the same iron
when in its usual state. The pieces of iron and steel wire, after immer
sion in acid, were well washed in cold water, and when dry weighed, this
being the weight when the metal contained the gas.         Subsequently they
were heated several hours in an oven to restore them as far as possible,
and again weighed.      The result of the last weighing, in every instance,
must always have been a little too large, as it was found impossible to
prevent a thin film of rust forming on the surface of the metal when being
heated in the oven. Notwithstanding this, the results showed in every
case a gain  in weight after immersion in acid. After five hours' immer
sion in acid the average gain in weight for mild steel, charcoal-iron, and
common iron was in
              Hydrochloric acid                    -028 per cent.
              Sulphuric acid                       *036     „
   The steel gained considerably the most — a result well worthy of notice ;
for we shall see that the tensile strain and elasticity of steel are far more
affected by the presence of absorbed hydrogen than iron under like con
ditions — probably in part because more gas is occluded by steel than iron
(a conclusion which the greater increase in weight of steel, in compari
son with iron, bears out), and in part owing to the different molecular
structure of steel.
   I hope at some future time to ascertain, if possible, if this gain in
weight is entirely due to occluded hydrogen, or whether also to absorp
tion of acid to a greater or less extent.
   Having examined in detail      some of the effects   of immersion in acid

1875.J            Hydrogen and Acids         on  Iron and Steel.                 171
upon iron and steel, we will now more closely consider               them with the
object of discovering the cause.
    It might at first sight be thought that the frothing could be explained
on the supposition that by the action of acid, iron is thrown into what
may be called the " active state," in opposition to the so-called passive
state caused by nitric acid, and that in this " active state " it is able to
decompose water at the ordinary temperature, forming oxide of iron and
bubbles of free hydrogen.           The facts, however, do not bear out this
theory, as the bubbles are still seen if oil be employed instead of water ;
and no matter how numerous the bubbles, the closest examination fails
to show any formation of oxide.          Again, the frothing is greater from the
long   end  than  from   the  short  end of the piece of wire, whereas, if due to
oxidation, it should be the same at both ends.
    Now the following facts make it certain that hydrogen is either the          sole
cause of the changes produced in iron by some acids, or is inseparably
connected therewith : —
    1st.  Only those acids which evolve hydrogen by their action on iron
produce any change in iron and steel, nitric acid (which does not
liberate hydrogen except under particular conditions) having no effect.
    2nd.   It is difficult to collect the bubbles which form the froth on the
moistened fracture of a piece of iron in sufficient quantity for analysis ;
but by putting a coil of wire, previously steeped in acid, into hot water
under a bell-jar, the bubbles of gas evolved by the iron may be collected,
and    will be found to burn with the characteristic flame of hydrogen.
    Hence it is probable that iron and steel, when placed in hydrochloric,
 sulphuric, or other acid, absorb some of the nascent hydrogen generated
 by the action of the acid, thus forming what, for lack of a better term,
 may be called an alloy* of iron and hydrogen.            This alloy may be com
 pared to that formed when zinc is amalgamated with mercury ; and just
 as in process of time the mercury disconnects itself from the zinc,
 appearing    in globules on its surface,      so hydrogen gradually      disengages
 itself from the iron — a movement which is greatly facilitated by heat, as
 ia natural to expect.
     The analogy may be carried still further ; for as amalgamated zinc is
 made brittle in consequence of the pores or interstices between the mole
 cules of the metal being filled up by mercury, motion of one molecule over
 another being then impeded, so in like manner iron becomes brittle when
 its pores are filled up by condensed hydrogen gas ; and naturally, when
 the hydrogen or mercury is driven out of the molecular interspaces,
 movement of the molecules on one another is less impeded, and hence the
 former toughness or elasticity is restored.
     Nor is amalgamated zinc the only analogous case ; for the following
 remarkable experiment lends further probability to the theory, by show
  ing how rapidly the absorption of zinc by iron may take place, attended
             * By the term alloy I mean a solution of one metal in another.

172                Mr. W. H. Johnson       on the   Action of        [Jan. 14,
with similar results,    as  regards increased brittleness, to those which
accompany the absorption of hydrogen.          It also shows how rapidly, by a
slight change     of temperature,  zinc  may    be disengaged from the iron,
thereby causing it to regain its former toughness.
    A piece of galvanized iron wire, of good quality, such that when cold      it
could be bent several times on itself and back again before breaking, was
raised to a red heat so quickly that the coating of zinc was melted and only
a small portion vaporized.      On attempting to bend it whilst still red-hot,
it broke off sharp, offering very little resistance to fracture.   The fracture
was of a uniform blue-grey colour, as though the zinc had penetrated into
the interior of the iron.      •When cold, the same piece broke with all ite
former toughness and with a long fibrous fracture.          The wire was again
heated till the coating of zinc was completely vaporized, and then it was
found to be so tough that it was impossible to break at a red heat. Wire
in red-hot molten zinc will often break short, though the part out of the
 metal remains quite tough.
    It is remarkable that this experiment will not succeed with all kinds
 of iron, some not being made thus " red short by zinc.
                                                     "
    By way of testing the theory that occluded hydrogen is the cause of
 the change in the properties of iron after its immersion in acids, the
 writer determined to dispense with acid altogether, and endeavour to pro
 duce the same result by subjecting pieces of iron to the action of nascent
 hydrogen.
    " With this view two pieces of iron wire -07 inch diameter were con
 nected respectively with the zinc and copper plates of a battery of 80
 Daniell's cells, and immersed in a vessel of Manchester town's water at a
 distance of   1 inch apart.   On closing the current, bubbles of hydrogen
 were given off from the wire connected with the zinc plate of the battery,
 but none from the wire connected with the copper plate, the oxygen libe
 rated there apparently forming oxide of iron, which in 12 hours formed
 a muddy deposit at the bottom of the vessel.         After 24 hours the surface
 of the wire connected with the zinc plate was unchanged ; but on moisten
 ing the fracture bubbles were given off, just as if it had been immersed
 in acid. The other wire, though much oxidized and eaten away, did not
 give off bubbles when broken, and had not become brittle.
     " A variety of experiments made in the same
                                                       way with pieces of wire
 varying from 3 to 20 inches long, and immersed 5 to 24 hours in water,
 yielded similar results.    It was found, however, that when the wire con
 nected with the zinc plate was of steel, no bubbles were visible to the
  naked eye on wetting the fracture with the tongue, precisely as in the
 case of steel after immersion in acid.    Twenty-four hours in a warm room
 restored the iron to its original state, and no bubbles were then seen on
 breaking and moistening the fracture.
     " The water in the last experiments was then
                                                        replaced by an aqueous
  solution of caustic soda, when, after two hours, the moistened fracture of

1875.  J          Hydrogen and Acids on Iron and Steel.                       173
the  wire connected with the zinc pole of the battery was found to bubble.
Twenty-two hours' longer immersion, the battery working all the time,
caused the bubbles to be more abundant ; the toughness of the wire
was also diminished and its surface blackened.                  The wire at the
positive pole was, however, unchanged, either on the surface or in
toughness   "*.
    From this we see that not only is acid not indispensable for the pro
duction of, at all events, the major portion of these changes in iron, but
the latter can be equally well produced in an alkaline solution.
    The apparatus remaining unchanged, the soda was next replaced by
hydrochloric acid, l-20 sp. gr.        On then immersing the iron-wire elec
trodes   for only 2 or 3 seconds, the negative electrode, where hydrogen
was given off, was found to froth freely when the fractured extremity was
wetted, as much, in fact, as after 15 minutes' immersion when the cur
rent was broken.      Half an hour's immersion failed to produce any similar
change on the positive electrode where no hydrogen was liberated.             The
absence of effect on the positive electrode is all the more>emarkabIe, as a
piece of wire of exactly the same quality, and immersed an equal time in
the same liquid, but unconnected with the battery, had become brittle
and frothed when broken.         It thus appears that neither oxygen nor chlo
rine are, under these conditions, occluded by iron, or if occluded, that
they produce no sensible change in its physical properties.
    Nascent hydrogen having been shown to produce these effects, a trial
was next made to ascertain if any similar change could be produced in iron
by leaving it in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas.           With this object a glass
tube £" in diameter was filled with pieces of bright iron wire -fe" in dia
meter, and a current of hydrogen passed through for periods of 1, 2, and
8 hours respectively, but without any perceptible change in the wire. The
wires were then placed in a bottle three fourths full of water, and hydrogen
made to bubble violently through the water for an hour, but still without
any effect.    It would thus appear that hydrogen is only occluded in the
 nascent state by iron in the cold.          Possibly, however, absorption may
 take place if the surfaces are chemically clean. The late Dr. Graham, in
 his valuable papers on the occlusion of hydrogen, showed, several years
ago, that when red-hot iron, palladium, or platinum are allowed to cool in
 an atmosphere of hydrogen, this gas is occluded by them in large quan
tity ; and in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' 1868, xvi. p. 422, he
mentions that the best way of charging any of these metals with hydrogen
 is to make the metal act as the negative electrode in acidulated water for
 a battery of 6 Sunsen's cells — a fact unknown to the writer when he made
 experiments.
    Though the absorption of hydrogen by iron is no doubt the cause of the
 frothing and climinution of toughness attendant on the immersion of iron
 in  hydrochloric and sulphuric      acids, there are some      phenomena which
                   * Proo. Lit. and Phil. Soc. Manch. 1874, p. 130.

174                 Mr. W. H. Johnson        on the    Action of        [Jan. 14,
cannot be explained by it alone, but which seem to show that the occlu
sion of hydrogen is accompanied by the absorption of a minute portion of
the acid by the pores of the iron.
  In proof of this the following well-established facts are adduced : —
  1st. Iron much sooner regains its natural state after immersion in
hydrochloric  than in sulphuric acid, though at first both may have equally
affected    as judged by diminution of toughness.
            it,                                         It may be thought
that some portion of the less  volatile sulphuric acid adhering to the sur
face of the iron, even after prolonged washing, will account for it. This
cannot be the case however    ; for the wire may not only be repeatedly
washed in water, but even coated with lime-water, dried, and finally re
duced in diameter two thirds by drawing several times through       steel   a
die, processes which must surely remove any surface-coating of acid; and
yet    will take longer to recover its original toughness
      it                                                    cleaned in
                                                                   if
sulphuric acid than in hydrochloric acid.
  2nd. The pieces in the last experiment immersed in hydrochloric acid
will become spotted with rust on the surface some days before those im
mersed in sulphuric acid.
   If the supposition that acid   isabsorbed by the iron be correct, this           is
only what we should expect   ;  forit   only natural to suppose that the most
                                       is
volatile acid, viz. hydrochloric, will come to the surface first.
   We know, moreover, that water             can   by   great pressure be forced
 through considerable thicknesses of cast iron.           Why, then, should not a
 liquid pass into the pores of wrought iron        ?
    As further proof of the presence of acid in iron, have found that
                                                               I
 blue litmus-paper was slightly reddened when moistened by      drop of a
 water which had been carefully placed on the fracture of  piece of iron
                                                                   a
 •45" in diameter, previously immersed in sulphuric acid several hours,
 and then washed in water.       The drop of water in this case did not
 moisten  the  sides of the fracture, where some trace of acid might be
 present.
    The occlusion of hydrogen by iron when immersed in acid solutions
 enables us satisfactorily to account for some of the difficulties experienced
 in depositing copper, silver, tin, or other metals from their solutions in
 acid in electrotyping or otherwise.     Generally any coat of appreciable
 thickness slowly shells off, leaving the surface of the iron bare in
                                                                         places,
 and so making the coating of no avail as      preventive of oxidation.
                                               a                            The
 cause    obvious
           is       ;the hydrogen occluded whilst the iron         is
                                                                  being cleaned
  in bath of vitriol or hydrochloric acid, and subsequently imprisoned by
      a
 the coat of metal, must escape, and in so doing forces its way out, loosen
 ing or carrying away some portion of the superficial covering of the metal.
 If, however, the iron, after being cleaned in acid, boiled in caustic-soda
                                                          is
 solution,   process which effectually expels the occluded hydrogen,

 ing of copper or other metal may then be electrically deposited which will
 not shell off in the least.  This      is

Professor Reynolds, in a paper read before the Lit. and Phil. Society of
Manchester, Feb. 24th, 1874, an abstract of which appeared in the
'Journal of the Chemical Society,' June 1874, p. 546, and other journals.
The Professor states that         I
                                did not attribute the frothing of iron after
immersion in acid to the escape of hydrogen, but to the action of acid.

part of the hydrogen produced by the action of the acid on the iron may
be absorbed by the iron, its nascent state facilitating this. And when the
iron is heated, by the effort of breaking           it,
                                              the gas may bubble up through
the moisture on the fracture."      This shows that in my first paper com     I
prehended the true nature of the phenomenon.

     In
      the earlier part of this paper some few of the changes in the pro
perties of iron produced by occluded hydrogen have been examined. The
degree of this change    has not always been possible to determine. In the

case of the diminution   of toughness, for example, no exact and easily
applied test has yet been devised by which we can obtain with precision
  numerical result expressing the relative toughness of any two samples              ;
consequently we must be content with less definite results. This difficulty
is fortunately not met with in the examination of the change in elasticity
and tensile strength   for the breaking-weight and maximum elongation
                         ;
of any number of samples can be pretty easily ascertained, with great
accuracy, and numerically expressed, thus making comparison easy.
   Bearing in mind the numerous uses of iron and steel, and the proba
bility that at times hydrogen may be occluded in them, altering their
strength in a way little anticipated, seemed of some importance to de

termine these changes and the more so, as any experiments of this kind
could not fail to throw some light on the molecular arrangement of the
metal in different qualities of iron and steel,    subject in itself of much
                                                             a
interest.  With this object upwards    of 350 experiments    have been made
at various times with     very accurate machine, by which any weight could
                             a
be brought to bear on  the  wire to be tested without the least jar — very     a
important point, though difficult of attainment, in experiments
                                                                    on tensile
strength.    The elongation at any moment could also be easily read off.

   rature of the pieces tested will alter the result considerably.            In order
   also to obviate, as far as possible, errors arising from the irregularity and
   absence   of perfect homogeneonsness of structure, even in the most care
   fully prepared iron and steel, the number of tests has been multiplied as
   much as possible and the mean only given/
       The mode of experiment was as follows : — After immersion in acid, the
   pieces were wiped and then tested, this giving the tensile strain and
   elasticity when containing occluded hydrogen ; subsequently they were
   heated on hot plates or in ovens, as the most ready method of expel
   ling the hydrogen, to a temperature considerably below that required
   to anneal them ; and when cold, the breaking-strain &c. of the iron,
   which had now recovered its natural state, was again ascertained by
   testing.
       It might be thought that tests of iron in its natural state could be best
   made by experimenting on it before immersion in acid.               Results so ob
   tained cannot, however, be fairly compared with tests of the same piece
   made after immersion      in acid, as the action of the acid somewhat reduces
   the diameter of the iron.
       The following results are the means of 30 tests made on annealed and
   bright iron wire respectively — first, after being one hour in hydrochloric
   acid, and, secondly, after being heated 12 to 48 hours to drive off the
   hydrogen.

     Thus the tensile strain of annealed iron wire appears to be affected to
  twice the extent that bright wire is by immersion in acid for same length
  of time. The reverse is the effect on the elongation.
     Longer immersion in acid causes the iron to take up more hydrogen,
  and makes the change much greater, as the following experiments show.

   of the wire being considerably increased by the occlusion of hydrogen ;
   but when a portion of this hydrogen is expelled by heat, the elasticity, as
   measured by elongation at the moment of fracture, falls remarkably, as
   much as 4-7 per cent, in annealed and 0-64 per cent, in bright steel.
   When the hydrogen is completely expelled, the elasticity, however, rises,
   being then greater than before immersion in acid.
       The following experiments on hardened and tempered cast-steel wire
   containing about three times as much carbon as the mild steel, show an
   extraordinary diminution in the tensile strain when containing occluded
   hydrogen ; this, however, is regained or even surpassed when the hydro
   gen is expelled by heat.

      The change produced by occluded hydrogen must have an important
   influence on the stability of all iron and steel structures ; for as the
   rusting of iron is mainly attributable to the action of the carbonic acid in
   the air, it is probable that the hydrogen liberated when the acid attacks
   the metal is occluded by the iron or steel, with consequent diminution
   of tensile strength and elasticity.            In some cases, where rust has spread
   very rapidly,     the    writer   has  noticed   a decided diminution of toughness ;
   but, as a rule, it is difficult to detect any change, as probably the hydrogen
   is present in very small quantity ; also when it has reached a certain per
   centage its tendency to escape from the metal will balance the force of
   occlusion.
                                       Electric Conductivity.
       Several experiments have been made to ascertain if there is any altera
   tion in the electric conductivity of iron wire when contaiuing hydrogen.

     Professor Stewart kindly allowed me the use of the Owens College
apparatus, with which soma of the following results were obtained : —

 Resistance of 6 feet bright charcoal-iron wire after 6 hours in dilute HC1=
       114-3, or, allowing for iron eaten away by acid                         109-4
     The wires were somewhat eaten away by the acid, so allowance had to
 be made for the increased resistance due to decreased sectional area ; this
 is made in the column to the right.
     About 50 feet of hard bright iron wire, after 24 hours' immersion in
 dilute sulphuric acid, gave a resistance of 2-94 ohms, and 2-92 ohms after
  the occluded hydrogen had been expelled by heat.
      The above results, though far from uniform, are sufficient to show that
  there is an increase in the resistance of iron wire when it contains
  occluded hydrogen.         I  hope soon to make further experiments on this
  subject.    It  is worthy   of  remark that Professor Graham found the resist
  ance of palladium containing occluded hydrogen was increased about
  25 per cent.        He also discovered that a palladium wire first elongated
  when charged with hydrogen, and then contracted when the hydrogen
  was withdrawn to less than its original length.          The writer has detected
   a very small and similar change in the length of annealed iron wire
   under like condition, but has not yet observed           it in bright iron wire,
   though he does not despair of doing so.
                                   Diffusion of Hydrogen.
      A  number of experiments were made by allowing one half of a piece
   of bright iron or steel wire to be acted on by dilute acid, and thus to
   occlude hydrogen while the other half was protected from this action,
   with a view of ascertaining if the occluded hydrogen could spread along
   the interior of the iron. Great difference was observed in the behaviour
   of iron and steel ; the fibrous structure of iron wire allows the hydrogen
   occluded in the part acted on by acid to spread into the other part, di
   stinct traces of hydrogen being observed 17 centims. from the part affected
   by acid. The close unfibrous structure of steel, on the contrary, seems to
   oppose this altogether, it being questionable if the hydrogen spreads 2 to
   3 centims. beyond the part immersed in acid.
      When that part of the iron wire which was protected from but still
   affected by the acid was broken and the fracture moistened, the bubbles
   of gas arose almost exclusively from the centre of the fracture, while
   from the part immersed in acid they arose equally from the whole sur
   face, and   took less time to attain their maximum.

  I. " On    the Origin and Mechanism of Production of the Pris
        matic (or Columnar)        Structure of Basalt."       By Robert
        Mallet, F.R.S. Received December 12, 1874.
                                  (Abstract.)
     The author having briefly traced the history of geological opinion on
  this subject, from before the period at which the controversy at which
 the igneous or aqueous origin of basalt might be viewed as settled, and
  having stated the views of some of the more prominent British authors
 on this subject of recent date, points out that, up to the present, no clear
 and definite theoretic views have been enunciated to account for prismatic
 structure in basalt, and that it is impossible to gather, with any distinct
 ness, from systematic writers, whether prismatic structure be due to con
 traction by cooling alone, or whether the structure is due to preexisting
 concretionary or crystalline arrangement of the integral particles of the
 mass, or to this coacting with enormous external pressures, the origin of
 which is left perfectly vague, or to some play of successive and joint
 actions of all these various forces.
     Prof. James Thomson, in a paper read some years ago, and since
 repeated at the late Belfast Meeting of the British Association, has pro
 posed views, in some respects new, tracing prismatic structure to con
 traction by cooling only, and has expressed entire doubt as to the part
 supposed to be played by concretionary spheroids pressed together.
 Prof. Thomson's views, however, are still far from complete, and the mode
 assigned by him to the production of cup-shaped cross joints in the prisms
fails to account for the phenomena.
    The aim of the author is to point out in this paper that all the salient
 phenomena of the prismatic and jointed structure of basalt, as observable
in nature, can be accounted for upon the admitted laws of cooling, and
contraction thereby, of melted rock possessing the known properties of
basalt, the essential conditions being a very general homogeneity in the
mass cooling, and that the cooling shall take place slowly, principally
from one or more of its surfaces.
    Thus, taking the simple case of a tabular mass of molten basalt, whose
top surface is level, the depth being great and the other two dimensions

indefinitelygreater than that, and assuming the material at one tem
perature initially, homogeneous and isotropic, and that cooling takes
place from the top surface only, he, on these data, proceeds to con
sider the phenomena that will successively result by contraction   in
cooling.
  While the mass remains at its upper part still plastic by heat, contrac
tion will be met byinternal movements and subsidence of the top surface,
and no cracking or splitting can take place until the material there has
become rigid enough to break under tensile strain.   He points out that
this degree       of rigidity, or " splitting temperature," is not reached until
the top       surface has fallen to between 900° and 600° Fahr.
  At this temperature the cooling surface begins to separate, by fracture
penetrating perpendicularly to                   it,
                                 into smaller surfaces. These must be
similar and equal  in area, and such as that their edges in contact can
make up    continuous superficies.
              a                     To relieve the orthogonal strains in
the cooling surface, and to meet the above conditions, only three geo
metric figures         for the separating surfaces are possible — namely, the equi
lateral triangle, the square, and the regular hexagon.
    The author then             inquires why the last of these       is   normally the form
found in nature.               He traces this to the law of least action which governs
the play      of all natural forces whose final result          is   produced by the least
possible      expenditure        of force.       He shows that, in   a   contracting        surface
splitting up   into equal areas, the expenditure of work will, for the equi
lateral triangle, the square, and the regular hexagon, be approximately as
the numbers 1-000, 0-680, and 0-519.      This economy of force decides the
hexagon   as the  form found in nature.  The diameter of the hexagon, which

by is   relation that subsists between the coefficient of contraction of the ma
        the
terial and that of its extension at rupture by a tensile force at the splitting
temperature.    This decides the diameters of the separate prisms. The
splitting    contraction proceeds into the mass always in a direction per
               by
pendicular to the cooling surface   and at any instant the splitting

In the case assumed, the prisms formed are straight and vertical.        When
the splitting has proceeded to some distance within the mass, the further
cooling of each prism takes place, not only from the top, but from the
sides and the more important conditions influencing the latter in nature

  182                 Mr. R. Mallet     on the Grigin of the        [Jan. 21,
  which tend to cause     the outer portions of the prisms to tear asunder at
 intervals   in length dependent, like the diameter of the prisms themselves,
 upon the relation subsisting between the coefficient of contraction and of
 extensibility at rupture of the material.
     The prism contracts not only in its length, but in its diameter ; trans
 verse fracture at its surface, when it occurs, is therefore due to the
 resultant of two orthogonal forces, the one parallel to the axis of the
 prism, as already referred to, and the other in a plane transverse to the
 axis.    These two forces are proportionate, the first to the length of the
 prism    from   a preceding joint or from its extremity, the second approxi
 mately to the semidiameter of the hexagon or mean radius of the
  eouche ; and the resultant of these two, at any point taken round the
 prism, is oblique to the axis and tending towards it in direction.        As
 fracture in a homogeneous solid always takes place transverse to the line
 of strain, so the fracture producing a transverse joint takes place
 oblique to the sides of the prism — the obliquity becoming less as the
 fracture advances towards the axis of the prism, so that when com
 plete it is cup-shaped, the convex surface of the fracture always point
 ing in the same direction as that in which the splitting of the prism
 itself is proceeding.
     This solution, which is believed to be the first ever presented which,
 resting upon admitted laws, completely accounts for the production of the
 very remarkable cup-shaped joints, is verified and illustrated by several
 diagrams, showing the mode of production of these joints and the
 modifications of their curvature produced by varied conditions in the
 cooling.
    It is further shown that the partial or complete detachment of certain
 fragments, frequently observed to be partially or wholly detached from
 the cusps of the concave side of these joints at and near the solid angles
 of the hexagon, is a consequence necessarily resulting from the mode of
 production of the joints themselves.       The author then points out that,
 in the case of very slender prisms, other (and mechanical) conditions
 besides those of differential cooling enter into the production of the cross
joints, which are at more considerable and irregular distances apart,
and in planes of fracture often nearly transverse to the axis of the
prism.
    He also discusses the modifications produced in the prisms themselves,
and in their cross joints, by heterogeneity in the mass of basalt itself —
as, for example, by a more or less previously developed cleavage in the
basalt in planes transverse to the axis of the prism, or by the presence of
heterogeneous substances imbedded in the mass. To these latter, and to
differences in conductivity or in the cooling energy at different points of
the cooling surface, are chiefly to be ascribed the divergences from the
normal hexagonal form of the prisms as occasionally observed, the author
remarking that where such divergences occur they disappear, and the

   1875.]                Prismatic Structure of Basalt.                         183
  normal hexagonal     form is returned to in such a manner as to require only
  the minimum expenditure of work.
     The conditions producing greater or less interspaces between the
  prisms, which may vary from point to point of the same mass, are pointed
  out, as also those which cause the spaces between successive joints in
 adjacent prisms to coincide in successive planes, transverse to their axes
  or the contrary.
     The author then proceeds to discuss the various positions       in space, and
 relatively   to each    other, which the axes of the prisms must assume,
  dependent on the general law, as already stated, that the axes of the
  prisms, however produced, are always normal to successive isothermal
 couches  or planes at the splitting temperature, taken in succession within
  the mass.
    If the mass be tabular, as already assumed, and cooling take place only
 from the top surface, the prisms       will be straight and vertical, extending
 from top to bottom nearly       of the tabular mass, and being separated from
 the bottom     on which it rests by a more or less thick layer of irregular
 angular fragments, or of badly conducting material, tufa, scorisB, &c., the
 convex surfaces of the cross joints all pointing downwards.      If the mass cool
 both from the bottom and the top, the prisms, vertical and straight, will
 split upwards and downwards, and meet in an irregular intermediate
 stratum of angular fragments, the convex surfaces of the joints of the
 lower prisms pointing upwards, and the respective lengths of the upper
 and lower ranges depending on their relative rates of cooling.              If the
 tabular mass cool also from one or more of its sides, as by an abutting
 wall of rock, prisms will be produced with their axes perpendicular to that
 wall, and will be separated from the vertical ranges of prisms by an
 inclined stratum of angular fragments.         Also, if the basalt fill a crevasse
producing     a  dyke,  the prisms   formed  by cooling will be generally trans
verse to the plane of its walls, and meet somewhere towards the centre in
a stratum of more or less irregular fragments, due in all cases to the irre
gular contractions       at the extremities of the prisms breaking up their
mass there into wholly irregular forms.           If the upper and cooling sur
face have a curved convex contour, the prisms will be taper and convergent
from the surface of the mass ; and, on the contrary, if the cooling surface
have a concave contour, or rest upon a concave bottom, the prisms will
be divergent from the interior of the mass, the natural law of economy of
work limiting the length or amount of taper in either case and the
length of the prisms, and at a certain length of prism a new range of
larger diameter partially or wholly then commencing.            The convergence
or divergence are simple consequences of the general law, that the split
ting takes place always normal to the isothermal couches which are at
the   splitting temperature.
    The author then proceeds to develop and illustrate by diagrams some
of the varied and curious combinations which are observable in Dature,
     vol. xxni.                                                         Q

and due to the more or less combined play of these conditions.  He then
proceeds to develop, as a consequence of the general law, the production
of curved prisms, or those with apparently bent axes, which are observed
in almost all basaltic countries.   If the cooling mass of basalt be in one
of its vertical sections of such a form that successive isothermal couches,
taken in descending order, are not parallel to the original cooling surface,
as they are in all cases of straight and parallel prisms, but divergent
gradually from the cooling surface and from each other, then the lines of
splitting of the prisms, always normal to these couches, must be curved in
one direction.   This will be true whether the isothermal couches be plane
surfaces divergent from a thinner to a thicker part of the mass, or whether
they be curved surfaces arising from the mass reposing on a curved
bottom and diverging in like manner.      This explanation of the produc
tion of curved prisms, without the necessary intervention of external
mechanical forces having bent into curves prisms originally formed
straight,    is,
             the author believes, here for the first time presented.   He
shows that great difficulties exist to the supposition that curved prisms
are ever the result of the bending of prisms originally straight by
extraneous mechanical effort.    The author having thus shown that all the
salient phenomena presented in nature by the forms, jointings, positions
of the prisms, &c. of columnar basalt are accounted for as consequences of
contraction in cooling, submits that this solution given by him must be
the true one. He, however, proceeds to examine at some length the
different views of those who have imagined that prismatic and jointed
basalt has resulted from the squeezing together,  bysome wholly imaginary
external force, of spheroidal masses more or less resembling those known
as " onion stones," or so-called concretionary   spheroids, such as those
imagined by Mr. Gregory Watt.     The author submits all points of the
subject to  searching examination, and points out that, upon the only
                a
probable suppositions that can be made as to the prearrangement of
such spheroids, no extraneous force of compression could produce
prisms at all, but must squeeze the spheroids instead into rhombic dode
cahedrons.

 distinct. The paper     is chiefly a record of observations made by  this method.
 The author shows     : —
    1. After a horizontal section of the cornea has been sealed up for about
 24  hours, the stellate branched cells are seen to consist of a mass of pro
 toplasms, sharply defined on every side, except where it is continued for
a scarcely perceptible distance into the processes.           The nucleus is flat
tened.     The processes        become very fine, glistening, and thread-like
almost immediately        after leaving the cell, and, by dividing and anasto
mosing with the processes of other cells, form a rich and very delicate
network.
    2. It sometimes     happens, although only in rare instances, that, in gold
preparations,  fine  dark    lines extend between the nuclei, and correspond in
outline and course with the processes seen in the aqueous humour ; and it
is then evident that they are surrounded by the dark-coloured tracts which
form the ordinary network seen in gold preparations, and which corre
spond, in outline and varying degree of development in different animals,
ages, and pathological conditions, with the corneal spaces.
   3. Similar appearances to those described in paragraph 1 are seen in
sections of cornea which have been 5 to 10 days sealed up in a 10-per
cent. solution of common salt.
    4. The quadrangular and long narrow flat cells shown by the author
(o exist in the cornea, by means of a saturated solution of potash, are also
rendered visible by the above method.              They are best seen in oblique
sections, from which, after        2 to 5 days, they fall out singly and in rows.
A row of the long narrow cells is often seen to terminate in quadrangular
cells at either end.        These cells have a perfectly hyaline appearance;
their nucleus has a very faint yellowish tinge, and projects beyond the
surface of the cell.
    In exceptional instances, in the uncut cornea of the frog, the long
flat cells may be seen, after several days' maceration, lying on the primary
bundles.
    5. In tendon, flat masses of cells are found, on the third to fifth day,
lying on the edge of the preparation and free in the fluid.          The cells are
accurately fitted to each other, after the manner of an epithelium.             In
the tendo    Achillis of the frog they are seen of three sizes : — (a) large
cells, corresponding to the flat cells seen on the surface by nitrate of
silver ; (6) smaller quadrangular cells, similar in size to those described
by Ranvier, and which have been described by the author as investing the
secondary and tertiary bundles in double layers ; and (c) long, narrow,
flat cells, similar to those described by the author as being isolable by
potash, and as covering the primary bundles.
    The masses of the cells of the surface, and of the secondary and ter
tiary bundles, can be usually seen to consist of a double layer separated by
a very thin transparent medium.
    6. The perimysium and neurilemma are respectively represented by a
                                                                     <J2

double layer of quadrangular and hexagonal cells, identical in general
appearance with an epithelium.        Between the two layers there is a thin
transparent    medium.
    7. From the neurilemma of the sciatic nerve of the frog, when cut in
narrow longitudinal strips, after a few hours, branched cells of different
types of form are seen isolated in the fluid near the cut edges.          These
cells are of    two   well-marked   general types.   In  one  a  small  smooth-
contoured elongated mass of protoplasma is continuous at both ends with
a fine long thread-like fibre ; in another an irregularly contoured, but
generally somewhat elongated, mass gives off numerous sharply defined,
very fine glistening fibres in all directions.      Sometimes a protoplasmic
centre terminates at one end by a single fibre, and by two at the other.
 These fibres are often of great length, and the protoplasmic mass can
sometimes only be found by carefully tracing them whilst moving the
object-glass.
    8. Fibrillary tissue is seen to be composed of uniform flat, ribbon-like
bands, whose breadth approaches the diameter of a human red blood-
corpuscle.     These are seen in their simplest form when extruded from the
 neurilemma of the sciatic nerve of the frog, which takes place within
 24 hours' maceration.       From their position in this membrane they form
 part of the transparent medium which exists between the two layers of
 quadrangular    cells.    They are mostly marked by a puckered appearance
 transversely.
    In skin and tendon, after a few days' maceration in the sealed fluid,
 the fibrillary tissue is seen to be composed of extremely fine but sharply
 contoured fibrillae, arranged in parallel bands, which are of the same
 breadth as the soft ribbon-like bands which are isolable from the neuri
 lemma.
    The respective appearances in the neurilemma and in tendon indicate
 extremes in the condition of this tissue, and represent, according to the
 author, primary bundles of connective tissue.
    9. The primary bundles of the cornea are seen only exceptionally by
 this method, but can be demonstrated with great precision by sealing up
 a frog's cornea    in  a mixture of equal parts of half-per-cent.  solution of
 chloride of gold and concentrated acetic acid.
    10. In nerve-bundles, after 24 hours' maceration in aqueous humour,
 some of the medullated fibres may be seen to have their contour broken
 transversely by straight hyaline spaces. The author assigns this appear
 ance to the peculiarity of structure described by Ranvier.
     11. The breadth and appearance of the rods of the frog's retina are
 nearly identical with those of the primary bundles of the neurilemma.
    The transverse markings described by Max Schultze as being produced
by the action of osmic acid on the rods and cones, resemble the transverse
 puckerings in the primary bundles.        In both rods and primary bundles,
 after prolonged maceration in aqueous humour, the free ends of each indi

  yidual element bend     in one direction until they join, and the substance of
  the ring thus    formed   undergoes in both a similar and peculiar process
 of disintegration.       Trout these facts the author infers that the rods
 and cones of the retina are composed of fibrillary tissue in its simplest
 form.
     12. Transverse    sections of muscular fibre, when examined at intervals,
 show varying appearances, only a small minority of such preparations
 being successful.      Successful preparations show one or more of three
 appearances :   —  (a) primary bundles, corresponding to Cohnheim's fields ;
 (b)  groups of these (secondary bundles), the aggregate of which fill up
 the space bounded       by the sarcolemma ; (c) a threadwork of fine fibres
 surrounding the primary bundles, in meshes.
    13.  Examination of connective tissue, in various stages of inflamma
tion, yields   strongly confirmatory evidence in favour of the interpretation
 given   by the author to the appearances above described.

       F.R.S.       Received November 18, 1874.
    The question of ventilation, and the amount of fresh air required to
keep an inhabited air-space in a sweet and healthy condition, has been
much discussed of late years, and very fully treated of by various writers ;

much so that they are almost practically impossible in ventilation inquiry.

the latter can be easily and certainly determined, we may take          as a              it

general diffusion being admitted, we can easily calculate the amount of

the average amount of COa in such an air-space, from which we can then
calculate the amount of air required to keep    in that condition.

    The plan followed in all was to take the observations chiefly at night,
when the rooms or wards were occupied, and when fires and lights (except
the lamp or candle used for the observation) were out.               In this way all
disturbing sources of COa were avoided, except in the occasional rare
instances of a man smoking in bed or the like.                On first entering the
room from the outer air the sensation was noted and recorded just as it
occurred to the observer, such terms as " fresh," " fair," " not close,"
" close," " very close," " extremely close," &c. being employed *. Most
of these notes were made by myself ; but a good many were also made by
my assistants, Sergeant (now Lieutenant) Sylvester in the earlier, and
Sergeant H. Turner in the latter experiments.             The air was then collected
(generally in two jars or bottles, for controlling experiments), and set
aside with lime-water for subsequent analysis, and the temperatures of
the wet- and dry-bulb thermometers noted. About the same time samples
of the external air were also taken, and the thermometers read. In this
way any unintentional bias in the record of sensations was avoided, and
this source of fallacy fairly well eliminated.
    In some of the earlier observations the CO, in the external air was not
observed as constantly in connexion with the internal observations, partly
because the importance of this was not so clearly perceived then, and
partly from want of apparatus, the jars used being very bulky and not
easy of carriage.       It might therefore be argued that the combination-
weights   of the earlier  experiments should be less in calculating the ave
rages.     I do not think, however, that this would amount to any sensible
difference in the result, as the external COa ratios adopted from single
experiments accord fairly with the mean ratio of the outer air t. In each

pressure, as ill some cases the reading of the barometer was not taken ;
the difference, however, would not exceed on an average 1 per cent.                 The
vapour and humidity were calculated from Glaisher's Tables.
    Although the records of sensation are various in terms,           I have thought
that they might      be advantageously      reduced to five orders or classes, as
follows — :
    No.  1.  Including such expressions as

          ciably different sensation from the outer air.

          " not very foul," "     a  little smell," &c, indicating the point at
          which organic matter begins to be appreciated             by the sense      of
          smell.
    No. 3. " Close," indicating the point at which organic matter begins to
          be decidedly disagreeable to the sense of smell.
    No. 4. " Very close," " bad," &c, indicating the point at which organic
          matter begins to be offensive and oppressive to the senses.
    No. 5. " Extremely close," " very bad," &c., indicating the point at
          which the maximum point of differentiation               by the senses is
          reached.
    Where there was      a slight smell of tobacco no change in the record was
 made ; but where the smell of tobacco was strong, the observation was
 generally referred to the next order, both because the presence of the
 tobacco-smoke indicated slow change of atmosphere, and also because
 the sense of closeness must have been considerable to make itself felt
 along with the tobacco. Hence such a remark as
                                                              " rather close," which
                                                            "
 properly belongs to No. 2, is referred to No. 3, close," if accompanied
 with a strong smell of tobacco.
    The total number of observations for the temperature, vapour, and
 humidity in the inhabited spaces amounts to 247*, and of carbonic-acid
 analyses to 473.      Where the latter are in pairs they are linked by a
 bracket.     In each case the external and internal observations and their
 differences are given, and the arithmetical means of all are taken.              In the
 differences which     represent the quantities due to respiratory impurity,
 the mean error, error of mean square, and probable error (both of a single
 measure and of the result) are calculated, and the limits shown between
 which the range would lie in each case.           The values are also given as the
 reciprocals of the squares of mean error and of probable error of result,
 and their ratios to No. 1 as unity. The modulus is also calculated from
 the mean error and error of mean square, and the ratio of the two results

 space, but the means are given at the end of the Table of Carbonic Acid.

              not sensibly different from the external air.
    1. Temperature.     — The experiments were made during both winter and
summer, so        that there is  a good deal   of variation   in the external tempe
rature, and the mean is some degrees above the mean annual temperature
of this country (southern         part of it), viz. 57°-47. The mean in the inha
bited air-spaces is 62°-85, or 5°-38 higher.          This is a moderate difference,
and shows a good average temperature for dwelling-rooms.                     The maxi
mum range is 10° (57°-89 to 67°-81), calculated from the error of mean
square, the actual extremes being 77° and 53°.
    2. Vapour       and Humidity. — As the external temperature varied con
siderably, so also did the amount of vapour, the mean being 4-285, equal
to about 80 per cent, of humidity.             The internal observations showed a
mean of 4"629, or 73 per cent, of humidity, being an excess of vapour of
0"344 of a grain, and a lowering of relative humidity equal to 7 per cent.
    3. Carbonic Acid. —The mean external carbonic acid was 0-4168, a
little above the usual amount.           The mean in the inhabited air-spaces was
0-5998, or an excess of 0-1830, the mean error being 0-0910.                   The pro
bable error of a single observation is 0-0831, so that the truth would lie
between 0-2661 and 0-0999 ; whilst the probable error of the result is
only 0-0078, the range being between 0-1908 and 0-1752 ; we are there
fore entitled to say that the limit of impurity, imperceptible to the sense
of smell, lies at or within 0-2000 volume of COa per 1000 as a mean.
From these data, then, we may lay down as conditions of good ventilation
the   following     : —
    Temperature about 63° Fahrenheit.
    Vapour shall not exceed 4-7 grains per cubic foot.
     Carbonic acid shall not exceed the amount in the outer air by more
            than 0-2000 per 1000 volumes.

 still above the mean temperature of this climate) was rather lower than
 in the previous one, viz. 54°-85, whilst the internal observations gave a
 mean      of 62°-85 (the same as in No. 1), or a difference of 8°.

  lowering    of  humidity being    about  7-6 per cent.
     3. Carbonic Acid.     —  The mean amount in the outer air was 0*4110 per
  1000   volumes,     in the  inhabited air-spaces 0-8004, or a mean difference
  (respiratory impurity) of 0-3894.         The range for the probable error of
  result  lies  between    0-4057  and  0-3731.

 mean of our climate, viz. 51°-28.          The mean in the inhabited air-space
 was 64°- 6 7, or a mean excess of 12°-91.
     2.  Vapour and Humidity. — The vapour in the outer air was 3-837, and
 in the inhabited air-space 4-909, a mean difference of 1-072 grain per
 cubic fopt.      The drying of the air amounted to a lowering of the humidity
 by 11-56 per cent.
     3. Carbonic Acid. — The carbonic acid in the outer air was 0-3705 per
 1000 volumes, rather below the average.            In the inhabited air-spaces it
 was 1-0027, or       a mean difference of 0-6332 due to respiratory impurity,
 the range for the probable error of result being between 0-6477 and
 0-6167.

 the following conditions are reached : —

internal 65°-15, or a mean difference of 13°-87.
    2. Vapour and Humidity. — The mean vapour in the outer air was
3-678 grains, and in the inhabited air-spaces 5-078, or a mean difference
of 1-400 grain per cubic foot.           This corresponds to a lowering of the
humidity by 8°-58 per cent.
    3. Carbonic Acid. — The mean amount in the outer air was 0-3903 per

exactly the average amount.           In  the inhabited    air-spaces it was 1-2818,
showing       an excess due to respiratory impurity of 0-8817 per 1000
volumes, the range       for the probable error of result being between 0-9202
and 0-8432.
    The extreme      point of differentiation by the     senses is thus reached when
the   following conditions are found : —
    Vapour 5-100 grains per cubic foot.
    Carbonic acid in excess over the amount               in the outer air beyond
           0-8500 per 1000 volumes.
    It will at once be seen that the figures in No. 5 differ but little from
those in No. 4, and that the probable limit of differentiation by the senses
is reached     in No. 4. The number of recorded observations in No. 5 is
also very                                  I
              few comparatively ; and think it would therefore be better to
group     the two together, as below.
        Nos. 4 and 5 combined, being the probable limit of possible differen
              tiation by the senses.
    1.   Temperature. —In the outer air 51°-43, in the inhabited air-spaces
 65°12, or a mean difference of 13°-69.
    2. Vapour      and Humidity. — The vapour in the outer air was 3-729,
inside 5-108, or a mean difference of 1-379 grain, corresponding to a
lowering of relative humidity of 8-92 per cent.
    3. Carbonic Acid. — In the outer air 0-3928, in the inhabited air-spaces
1-2461, or a mean difference due to respiratory impurity of 0-8533, the
range for probable error of result being between 0-8717 and 0-8349.
    We may therefore,         I  think, say that when the vapour* reaches
5-100 grains       per cubic foot, and the C0a        in excess   0-8000 volume per
1000, the maximum point of differentiation             by the senses is reached.
    *  It  is to be understood that the amounts    of vapour stated in these cases are in
 reference to a mean temperature   of about 63° F.

   By referring         to the Tables it will be seen that there is a regular
progression as         we pass from one order to another.                   The following

   The progression is complete in the carbonic acid, although there are
slight retrogressions in the temperature and vapour of No. 5. Taking
the last two combined, we have

   We have now the progression complete throughout.                         Adopting four
orders, then, we shall find the regularity of progression sufficiently note
worthy in the vapour and carbonic acid, the two products of respiration.
It is less regular in the temperature, as might indeed be expected, from
the varying condition of the external air.

 Here the amount of vapour is exactly the actual excess                 in No.   1, and the
 amount of carbonic         acid somewhat       in excess ; the mean, however,            be

   Here we see that there is a diminution of value pretty regular up to
No. 3, when there is a rise in No. 4 and No. 5 in the temperature, a rise
in No. 4 and a fall in No. 5 in the vapour and humidity, whilst the fall is
progressive throughout in the carbonic acid.
   In each case the result of the combination of 4 and 5 gives a number
which takes its proper place after No. 3, except in the temperature.

   Here we see much the same order preserved, except that in two eases
 marked * (No*. 4 and 5, temperature, and No. 2, vajwur) the amounts
exceed No. 1. It is also observable that in the vapour, humidity, and
 carbonic acid No. 3 is superior to No. 2.       In every case the combined 4
 and 5 series is superior to the two singly, being nearly their sum.
   In all the Tables it may be observed that the humidity is somewhat
irregular in relation to the amount of vapour.        This may be understood
from the fact that   it is a complex quantity, depending partly on the amount
of vapour, and partly on the temperature.
   If we now seek to get a general expression of the relative values of all
the observations in each order, we may take the product of their values
by the different methods.

    Here we see a greater       irregularity, No. 3 showing a superiority over
 No. 2, due probably to the greater          number of individual observations in
 the former case.

But the discrepancy       in the ratios of the values from the probable error,
where   No. 3 exceeds No. 2, is due to the irregularity in the humidity
column ; and as this is not an independent quantity, but dependent on
the temperature and vapour, we may legitimately omit it.               We shall then

at No. 4 in both instances, i. e. with and without the humidity.             There is

    We have now       a series   of ratios which follow a regularly descending
 scale, very much in      the   order  we might have expected a priori, seeing
that the sense of smell is naturally less acute as the organic matter
increases in amount.          But it is of less consequence to determine the
 position of the higher orders in the scale, except as a measure of the
 general value of the observations throughout the inquiry, the really
 important point being the very great superiority of the first order, parti
cularly as regards the carbonic acid.            This is an additional argument for
its adoption as the limit of admissible impurity in good ventilation.
    The amount of fresh air necessary to keep the impurity down to the
particular limit would be according to the following formula,
where d is the delivery of fresh air in cubic feet per head per hour, e the
amount of carbonic acid expired per hour by one inmate, and p the limit
of respiratory impurity taken as carbonic acid per cubic foot.                If  we take
e  to be 0*6 of a cubic foot in a state of complete repose, such as during
sleep, we are rather under Pettenkofer's                 estimate, but considerably
above Angus Smith's.          The following Table gives the amounts necessary
for the three estimates : —

    I think   that the general opinion is that Angus Smith's results give too
 low an     estimate, and that O600 is really the lowest that can be with
safety  admitted.
   The existing      Army Regulations contemplate a delivery of 1200 cubic
feet per head      per hour in barracks ; but practical inquiry has shown that
this amount is generally fallen short of.           The result is that the life of
the soldier, at least during his sleeping-hours, is passed in a No. 3 air
space, or one in which the organic impurity is decidedly disagreeable to
the senses.    Previous to 1858 he did not even get this moderate amount
of air ; so that his life was spent in an air-space in which the organic
matter was      offensive and oppressive to the senses.  If we adopt (as proposed
already) 0-2000 per 1000 of COa as the limit of impurity, then 3000 cubic
feet per head per hour is the amount which must be delivered, on the
supposition that «= 0-600, or 3525 if e=0-705.
   We may say,       in conclusion, that the experimental data already quoted
fairly justify the adoption of the following conditions : —
                  Conditions as the Standard of good Ventilation.
   Temperature      (dry bulb) 63° to 65° Fahrenheit,
                    (wet bulb) 58° to 61°
   N.B. The temperature should never be very much below 60°, but it
may be    found difficult to prevent its rising in hot weather.              In any
case the difference between the two thermometers ought not to be less
than 4°,    and ought not to exceed 5°.
    Vapour ought not to exceed 4-7 grains per cubic foot at a temperature
of  63 F., or 5 grains at a temperature of 65° F.
   Humidity (per cent.) ought not to exceed 73 to 75.
   Carbonic Acid. Respiratory impurity ought not to exceed 0-0002 per
foot, or 0-2000 per 1000 volumes.
   Taking the mean external air ratio at 0-4000 per 1000, this would
give a mean      internal air ratio of 0-6000 per 1000 volumes.
    By considering separately the conditions found in barracks and in hos
pitals, or among healthy and among sick men, a point of some interest
and   importance seems to be indicated — namely, that more air is required
for the  latter than for the former to keep the air-space pure to the senses.
This is due either to the greater quantity of organic matter or to a dif
ference    in its quality and nature.      The following results are found from
the data     in the Tables : —
                                                                Barracks.   Hospitals.

   Assuming the average carbonic acid per head to be 0-6 of         a cubic foot,
these amounts indicate a supply of air as follows : —
                                                          Barracks.      Hospitals.

   Stated in round numbers, therefore, we may say that while a barrack-
room may be kept sweet with 3000 cubic feet, it will take 4000 to
keep a hospital ward containing ordinary cases in the same condition.
Much more would, of course, be required during times of epidemic or
the like.
   There is less regularity in the higher orders ; but if the whole of the
observations,    other than No. 1, are taken together,    we find a similar
indication  : —

   A comparison may also be made by attaching a numerical value to each
order, which we may do by making the mean carbonic acid of No. 1 unity,
and finding its ratio to the others thus : —

   The progression is pretty regular, and the mean difference is 1-22,
which differs but little from the individual terms.

           The spectroscopic observations described          in this paper were made with
       instruments belonging        to the Royal Society, and in accordance with
       certain suggestions which had been made to the author                by a committee
       appointed     in consequence of a letter of his to Sir Edward Sabine,
       President, dated 13th February, 1866. In view of his residence at a
       considerable     height above the sea-level, and of the exceedingly clear
       atmosphere     prevailing at some periods of the year, it was suggested that
       the locality was peculiarly favourable for a determination of the lines of
       the solar spectrum due to atmospheric absorption, and that, for this pur
        pose, the solar spectrum when the sun was high should be compared with
                                                                              e2

the spectrum at sunset, and any additional lines which might appear in
the latter case should be noted with reference to Kirchhoff's map.
    Accordingly the author set to work with the spectroscope first supplied
to him, and in the autumns of 1868 and 1869 mapped the differences in
question from the extreme red to D. These results appeared in the
'                                   '
  Proceedings of the Royal Society for June 16, 1870, and the map of the
spectra, sun high and sun low, of the region in question forms plate 1
of the 19th volume.
    The instrument first supplied to the author was found in practice to
 be of insufficient power to permit of ready identification    of the lines
 seen in the spectrum of the sun when high with those represented in
 Kirchhoff's map ; and a new spectroscope of greater power was supplied
 to him, which reached him at the end of the year 1871.            Observa
 tions for a continuation of his map had, in the mean time, been taken
 with the old instrument in the autumns of 1870 and 1871, and the spec
 trum mapped from D to F, in continuation of the former map. But the
new instrument proved so superior to the old, that the author deter
mined to map the whole spectrum afresh from observations made with
it,using the former maps merely as skeleton forms.  The observations
with the new instrument were carried on in the autumns of 1872 and
1873, and the map now presented     the result.
                                      is
   Observations were also made to ascertain whether any of the lines
which came out when the sun       low, especially those which are also
                                 is
seen, but narrower and less conspicuous, when the sun    high, could be
                                                          is
due, not to specific atmospheric absorption, but to the general weakening
of the light, causing parts of the spectrum already weakened by solar
absorption to appear dark when    a general weakening of the light was
superinduced, though they had appeared bright when the light was
strong.   For this purpose the spectrum of the sun when high, as seen in
the usual way, was compared with the spectrum when the intensity was
artificially reduced in various ways. The best comparison was obtained
by taking advantage of   a    natural phenomenon.    At Mussoorie, late in
the autumn, a haze, visible at sunset, extends over the low country,
and grows day by day in height, till       causes the sun virtually to set
                                           it
in haze while still 3° or more above the horizon, whereas in the clear
season it   isvisible till
                       it   attains
                                 a   depression of 1£°. The result of the
comparison was, that none of the additional lines were discovered to
have any other origin than selective atmospheric absorption.

        ceived April 28, 1874*.
    The fact that water expands in becoming ice, and that the latter thus
floats upon the water, can scarcely have escaped the observation or in
ference   of the acute intellects of a remote antiquity. Its conditions, when
more carefully examined in modern times, pointed out the strange and,
as it has been called, anomalous fact that water can be cooled 7° or 8°
below its freezing-point without becoming solid, and that between its
 maximum density at about 39° Fahr. and its freezing-point at 32° Fahr.,
 or within the narrow range of 7° Fahr., it expands in the large ratio of
 915 :  1000.
    Standing thus alone amongst observed phenomena in nature, it seems
to have     suggested to many experimenters the question whether other
bodies when liquefied by heat might not also expand when becoming solid
by refrigeration.       I  have not attempted to trace with minuteness the
history of past inquiry upon this subject, many loose uncertain state
ments as     to which have for at least a century continued to perplex scien
tific literature. Reaumur appears to have been the first who gave currency
to the statement that cast iron, bismuth, and antimony all expand in con
solidating.      The like fact has been alleged or left to be inferred with
respect   to  the  following substances by the authorities named : —
    Silver, Persoz.
    Copper,    Kars ten.
    Mercury and Gold,       as inferred by Nasmyth and Carpenter.

   Iron and Furnace-slags,     by experiment of Heunter and Snelus, as
       quoted by Nasmyth      and Carpenter.
   But of this list the only body, in addition to water, that really appears
proved to expand in consolidating is bismuth ; and even this the author
cannot affirm upon the basis of his own experiments, but accepts the fact,
at least provisionally, as true upon the uncontradicted statements of many
chemical authors, and upon the positive assurance which he is permitted
to mention by Dr. John Tyndall that he is satisfied of its truth.    With
respect to all the others, it is the object of this communication to show
that the evidence in support of the alleged fact of expansion by refrige
ration is illusory and insufficient, and to offer with respect to cast iron,
and also with respect to iron furnace-slags, experimental proof of the
untruth of the statement.
    Certain connected but only collateral facts, having regard to so-called
anomalous changes of volume due to temperature, will not be referred to
here — such, for example, as the anomalous expansion of Rose's fusible
metal, which expands progressively, like other bodies, till it attains the
temperature of 111° ; it then contracts rapidly by added heat to 150°, when
it is densest (Graham's ' Elements,' vol.    i.,
                                            and Gmelin's 'Handbook       the
                                                                       '),
circumstances being here probably due to the successive segregation in
the mass of alloys differing from each other in constitution, dilatability,
and fusing-points.   Or, again, the facts observed with respect to the ex
pansion or contraction in volume shown by certain salts when crystallizing
from their solutions, the whole of the conditions as to which have not
been as yet made quite clear.  The statement that antimony expands in
consolidating, as made  by Reaumur,   has been negatived by Marx.     The
like statement with respect to silver and copper appears to rest on no
better foundation than the observation as stated by Persoz,
                                                            " that pieces
of solid silver float upon the melted metal, showing that silver expands
in solidifying like water " (Gmelin's Handbook,' vol. vi.). As to gold,
                                        '
there appears no authority whatever for its expansion on consolidation.

Moon,' Nasmyth and Carpenter, p. 24), which, as we shall see further
on, affords no grounds for conclusion on the matter.       Reaumur's state
ment with respect to cast iron appears to have rested upon nothing more
than the fact that he had observed certain pieces of cold cast iron to float
upon cast iron while in fusion. Until lately this subject generally at
tracted but little attention, for  had very few, and these mere technical,
                                   it
applications;  and to the higher physicist they presented but little interest,
because the loosely stated facts, even  ifaccredited, did not in the slightest
degree tend to elucidate or explain the remarkable and perhaps still iso
lated facts as to water and ice.    Accordingly, with little or no exami
nation, the statements given for facts       by
                                            the older authorities have been

 it comes into fusion," or that of Kerl (' Metallurgy of Iron,' Crookes and

 space   after cooling    than   when   in the liquid  state ; it contracts   in such a
manner that, at the commencement of its solidification,             it first expands so
 as  to be able  to fill up the smallest depressions and cavities of a mould, but
after solidifying it contracts"— a loosely worded statement, which in
 various forms may be found in a great number of authors upon metal
lurgy and technology.            So likewise   the statement often repeated, that
the value    of antimony in type-metal          consists in its causing the latter to
expand upon consolidation            and so perfectly fill the matrix, is presented,
so   far as the author's reading goes, without the slightest experimental
proof of its truth, and appears to rest simply upon Reaumur's statement
with respect to antimony itself, which, as already mentioned, has been
controverted by Marx.             This subject, however, has now assumed greater
importance,     since    it  has   recently been made by Messrs. Nasmyth and
Carpenter the foundation upon which they rest their theory of lunar
volcanic action, as presented to us by the surface of our satellite ; and the
object of    the present communication is to show that, as regards the two
most     pertinent of the substances adduced by these authors, viz. cast iron
and iron furnace-slag, the facts entirely fail in support of their theory.
    First, then, as to cast iron. It is not a fact that all cast iron in the
solid state will float upon all cast iron in liquid fusion, though such might
be inferred from the broad and loose statements of authors.                 Even in the
limited form in which the statement is made by Nasmyth and Carpenter —
viz. " that -when a mass of solid cast iron is dropped into a pot of molten
iron of identical quality the solid is found to float persistently                 upon
the molten metal, so persistently that when it is intentionally thrust to
the bottom of the pot it rises again the moment the submerging agency
is withdrawn" (' The Moon,' p. 21) — is not quite exact.
    It is a fact that certain pieces of cast iron in the solid and cold state
will float on certain descriptions of cast iron in liquid fusion ; but whether
the solid pieces shall float or not float in any given case is dependent at
least    upon the following conditions, and probably upon others not yet
ascertained     : —
    1st.   Upon the relative specific gravities of the solid and of the fused
cast    iron both referred to the temperature of the atmosphere. Under the
commercial name of cast iron is comprehended a wide range of com
 pounds of iron with other substances, which compounds differ greatly in
 their physical as well as their chemical qualities, and have a range of
 specific gravity of from nearly 7* 7700 for the whitest, most rigid, and
 dense, down to little more than 6-300 for those which are darkest, softest,
 and most porous.           The total dilatation at the fusing-point of the denser

    212                Mr. R. Mallet     on the alleged Expansion.
    cast irons is known to be somewhat greater than that of the less dense      ;
    but as the increase in volume may not be sufficient to equalize the spe
    cific gravity of a very dense iron when in fusion with that of a very light
    iron when cold, so it is obvious that a piece of cold cast iron might be
   so selected in reference to its specific gravity, as referred to that of
   another sort of cast iron     in fusion, that the former should either sink or
   swim upon the latter by mere buoyancy, were that free to act alone.
       2nd. Assuming the cold and the molten cast iron originally identical
   in qualities, whether a piece of the former shall float or not float upon
   the latter depends not only upon buoyancy as above, but also upon the
   form of the piece of cold metal — that is to say, on the relation, all other
   things being the same, that subsists between its volume and its surface.
       3rd. The force, whatever be its nature, which keeps the piece of cold
  cast iron floating is of sufficient energy to overcome a considerable want of
  buoyancy in the cold iron under certain conditions, so that it may float
  upon molten cast iron whose specific gravity, as such, is much less than
  that of the colder iron which floats upon it. Messrs. Nasmyth and
  Carpenter assume, without any sufficient proof, that solid cast iron floats
  on liquid iron of the same quality in virtue of buoyancy alone, and pro
  ceed to state that
                        " the inevitable inference from this is that in the case
  of cast iron the solid is specifically lighter than the molten, and there
  fore that, in passing from the molten to the solid condition, this substance
                                    "
  undergoes expansion in bulk (' The Moon,' pp. 20, 21).
      I  proceed to prove that this view is altogether contrary to fact. The
 determination of the specific gravity of cast iron in its molten condition
 is a problem of considerable difficulty, and can only be solved by indirect
 means ; we cannot ascertain its specific gravity by any of the methods
 ordinarily employed, nor can any are-
 ometric method be used, as any hydro-                     Fig. 1.
 meter or solid of known specific gra
 vity at common temperatures, when
 dipped into liquid cast iron, changes
 its volume as well as gets incrusted
 with adherent cast iron or its oxides,
 &c. By an indirect method, and by
 operating upon a sufficiently large
 scale to eliminate certain sources of
 error, the specific gravity of molten
cast iron may, however, be approxi
mately ascertained with considerable
accuracy.        The method adopted by
the author was as follows : — A
conical      vessel, of the form    shown
in figure     1, was formed  of wrought-
iron      plate   by welding up only,

                   of various Substances on Solidification.                           213
the walls      of the vessel being about    | in. in   thickness.•1        It
                                                                        was per
fectly smooth      in the inside,and the plane of            the lip of the open
neck     wascarefully made   parallel to the plane           of the base.   This
vessel weighed, when empty, 184-75 lbs. avoirdupois.      The orifice of
the neck being levelled as the vessel stood upon the platform of the
weighing-apparatus, it was filled up to the exact level of the neck with
water at a temperature      of   Fahr., and again weighed. Deducting the
                                 60o,5
weight of the empty vessel, the weight of its contents of water was found
to be 94-15 lbs. avoirdupois.   From the known volume and weight of the
imperial gallon of distilled water, the capacity of the vessel was therefore
at 60°   Fahr. =2605*5 cubic inches.       As   a check upon the results, both
as   to weight     and    capacity, the water was measured into the vessel
from accurate glass standards       of volume. The water employed was that
from the well at Messrs. Maudslay, Sons, and Field's Engine •Works,
Lambeth, where these experiments were conducted, and to whose liberality
the author owes the means of having performed them.           The specific
gravity of this well-water did not very materially exceed that of distilled
water,  being about 1-0004 ; but if we apply the necessary correction, the
weight of the contents of the iron vessel of distilled water at 60° Fahr.
is 94-112 lbs. avoirdupois.   The vessel being emptied, carefully dried and
warmed, and stood upon a hard rammed bed of dry sand with its neck
perfectly level as before, was now filled perfectly level to the brim with
molten cast iron.    As the temperature of the vessel itself rapidly rose by
contact with the large mass of molten iron within            it,
                                                          and by its dilata
tion had its capacity enlarged, so the top surface of the liquid cast
iron within it rapidly sank, fresh additions of molten iron being constantly
made to maintain its top surface level with the brim.    This was continued
until the whole of the exterior of the vessel was seen to have arrived at               a
clear  yellow heat, beyond which no increase to its temperature took place.
At about twenty minutes after the molten iron was first poured into the
vessel, this point was reached, the feeding in of additional iron being dis
continued a few minutes previously.       The whole being left to cool for
three days,   the vessel full of the now  cold  and solid cast iron was again
weighed on deducting, as before, the weight of the empty vessel, the weight
         ;
of the cast iron which filled       was found to be 645-75 lbs., which, with
                                     it
certain corrections to be yet noticed, was the weight of cast iron which,
when in the molten state, was equal to the capacity of the conical iron
vessel in its expanded state due to its exalted temperature.          We have
now to determine what was the capacity of the vessel in this expanded
state.   The temperature at which cast iron melts may be admitted as
about 2400° Fahr.     ;but as iron tapped from the cupola         always above
                                                                      is
its melting-point, we may admit that        it was poured into the vessel at
2600c or 2700° Fahr., the surplus heat in the cast iron, whose mass was
about four times that of the wrought-iron vessel which contained         being  it,
given off in the first instance to heat the latter. The temperature at which

214                Mr. R. Mallet       on the alleged Expansion
wrought iron presents to the eye a clear yellow visible in daylight may,
in accordance with the views of most physicists, be taken as between the
fusing-points of silver and of gold, or at 2000° Fahr.     The mean coeffi
cient of linear dilatation for 1° Fahr. of wrought iron has been determined
between the limits of zero and 212° by Laplace, Smeaton, Troughton, and
Dulong, the average of the four being 0-00000699 for                  1° Fahr.   ;   and
this is certainly below the truth for the whole range of             temperature     up
to fusion, as the rate of expansion of all fusible bodies appears to increase
with the temperature.      Rinmann has determined the linear dilatation of a
bar of wrought iron, when raised from 60° Fahr. to a white or welding
heat, to be      of its length, or -0125 ; and taking the total range of tem
perature here at 2400°, we have a mean coefficient of linear dilatation
=0-0000052 for 1° Fahr. This is a still smaller coefficient than the pre
ceding ; the author has, however, preferred to adopt it in order to avoid
any pretence to exaggerate in his own favour the results arrived at. Ap
plying, then, Rinmann's coefficient to the dimensions of the cone at 60°
Fahr., and to its temperature (2000° Fahr.) when at the maximum, we
are enabled to deduce the true capacity of the cone when expanded to the
utmost and filled with molten iron, viz. =2691-77 cubic inches. The
iron conical vessel was now cut off by a circular cut at the base and
another up and down the side of the cone, and separated from the conical
mass of iron that had filled it ; the interior surface of the iron vessel was
found in several places about the lower part of the cone in perfect contact
with that of the cast iron which had filled it ; but in other portions very
slightly distant from    it,   as judged by the sound     of   a   hammer   upon the
sides of the vessel before     it   was cut off.   The cast iron was not    adherent
to the vessel anywhere.   The cast-iron cone being thus laid bare, had                 a
                                  "

by   two planes,   each passing through the
axis and meeting at an angle of about
60°.   The conical mass proved per
fectly sound and free from cavities
or blow-holes anywhere, except very
near the summit or neck, where there
was found to be a hollow or cavity                 I
accidentally   left during the feeding (as         [
above described).     By measurement the
volume of this cavity was found to be =
5-5 cubic inches   assuming this cavity
                   ;
filled with iron of the same quality as the
cone, the weight of the latter would be in
creased by 1-43 lb., making thus the corrected total weight of the solid cone
of cast iron = 647-18 lbs. From the wedge-shaped piece cut out from
the cone at half its altitude, and about halfway between the axis and cir
cumference of the sector, a piece was cut out, the
                                                   specific gravity of which,

taken by the usual methods, proved to be 7"170, which           may be taken as
the mean     specific gravity at 57° Fahr. of the whole of the cast iron that
filled the cone.     Reverting now to the conical vessel which contained at
60° Fahr. 94-112 lbs. of distilled water, its capacity being 2605-5 cubic
inches-- this capacity was enlarged by expansion when filled with molten
iron to 2691-777 cubic inches, so that the conical vessel when cold,         if it
had had    the same capacity as when filled with liquid iron, would have
contained 97"224 lbs.     of distilled water. We have now all the elements
necessary   for calculating the specific gravity of the cast iron which filled
the cone   in its molten state, because we have the actual weights of equal
volumes of distilled water and of molten iron.           The final results, then,
are, that whereas the cast iron which filled the cone had when cold (57°
Fahr.) a specific gravity, as above given, =7"170, the same cast iron in
its molten state, as poured into the cone, had a specific gravity of only
6-650 — in this case thus proving that the density of cast iron in its liquid
state is not greater but, on the contrary, very much less than that of the
same cast iron at the temperature of the atmosphere.              The quality of
cast iron employed in this experiment was the fine, bright, close-grained
metal usually employed by Messrs. Maudslay, Sons, and Field for their
engine-castings, and consisted of

It  may be   taken as a typical or medium example of all good grey cast irons.
I have   not been enabled to repeat this experiment with the white, rigid,
and crystalline cast irons, such as are employed for projectiles and other
purposes ; but as it is a recognized fact amongst iron-founders that these
irons expand in the range of temperature between solidity and liquidity
much mart than do grey irons, so we may justifiably conclude that the de
crease of specific gravity by fusion of these hard cast irons would be in even
a greater ratio than that shown by the above experiment on grey iron ; and
generally the author feels himself justified in concluding that it is not
true that any cast iron is denser in the fused than in the solid state.      Cold
cast iron, therefore, does not float upon liquid cast iron of the same
quality by reason of its buoyancy, but in virtue of some force which tends
to keep it upon the surface of the molten metal in opposition to a very
considerable want of buoyancy or tendency to sink by greater density on
the part   of the solid iron, which is, by the preceding results,       ^   of its
weight, whatever      that may be, and is probably even greater than this in
the case of hard white cast irons.        The author's chief object has been
thus far rather to prove that the cause assigned by the writers already
mentioned is not the true cause of the floating of solid upon liquid cast
iron of the same quality.          What is the nature of the force which pro-

216               Mr. R. Mallet    on the alleged Expansion
duces this curious phenomenon and often in direct opposition to gravity,
is a different and a much more delicate and difficult inquiry, which he
must leave to physicists to fully investigate. The following experimenls,
however, may be placed on record as tending to afford some little dawn
of light upon the subject.
    The following experiments were made with pieces of iron cast from
cast iron of the same quality as that which filled the experimental cone,
placed upon or immersed in molten cast iron of like quality with them
selves, so far as such can be secured by
                                              " tapping " at nearly the same
time from the same cupola charged with the same materials.
    Before proceeding to describe these, it will be necessary to deduce from
the cone experiment a mean coefficient of total cubic dilatation for the
whole range between 60° and 2400° Fahr. for the grey cast iron em
ployed in these experiments.       The total dilatation was, as we have seen,
such as reduced the specific gravity of the cast iron when cold ( = 7-17)to
6-65 when in fusion. The cubic dilatation was therefore in the inverse
ratio of these numbers, or as 1000 : 1078 ; and dividing this increase in
 volume by 2340° Fahr., the total range of temperature, we obtain for
the mean coefficient of cubic dilatation of this grey cast iron for 1° Fahr.
 = 0-0000333, or approximately for its mean coefficient of linear dilata
tion °'Q0^ = 0-0000111.        These coefficients are nearly double those ob
tained by Roy and by Lavoisier for a range of temperature of 180° Fahr.,
viz. between 32° and 212°, which is quite what we should expect, as          the
coefficient of dilatation in all bodies increases with the temperature.
    •We have seen from what precedes that two forces at least are concerned
in the phenomenon of cold cast iron floating upon the same when liquid,
 viz. : —
    A. Buoyancy or its opposite, dependent upon the relation        between the
 actual specific gravity of the cold metal and that of the liquid metal upon
 which it is placed, and whose absolute power for any given difference of
 specific gravity depends upon the volume only of the floating mass.
     B. A repulsive force of some kind tending to repel the surfaces in contact
 of the hot and cold metals. Whatever be the form of the floating solid,
 this   repulsive force can only be effective m producing flotation upon
 such surfaces of the floating solid as are parallel to the surface of the
 liquid metal, or at least so circumstanced that repulsions upon one sur
 face, or part of a surface, are not equilibrated and nullified by repulsions
 upon others in the opposite direction.      Thus if a parallelopiped float with
 one of its surfaces parallel to that of the liquid metal, the repulsions
 upon its immersed vertical sides, taken two and two respectively, are in
 opposite directions, and therefore nullified, and the bottom or horizontal
 surface is alone effective in producing flotation.      So also if a cylinder
 float with its axis horizontal, the ends are ineffective, as is also all that
 portion of the cylindric surface immersed which is above the level of
 the horizontal diameter of the cylinder.

    These preliminary explanations will enable us better to interpret the
following experiments.
    Experiment 1. An irregular piece, believed to be of hard and dense
cast iron, and also a ball of about 2| in. diameter, believed to be of close-
grained grey iron : both sunk to the bottom when thrown into the ladle
of liquid iron, and remained for some time at the bottom ; both, however,
reappeared upon the surface when they had acquired a temperature suffi
cient to have fused off portions of their respective masses.
    [In every fresh-lined ladle of liquid cast iron there are circumferential
 ascending and central descending currents in the metal, produced by the
gases evolved from the lining, as hereafter fully explained.           It is no doubt
chiefly to these ascending currents that the heated ball in Experiment 1
owed its ascent to the surface ; for if the heating took place in perfectly
motionless cast iron, there seems no reason why the place of the sunken
ball should change up to the moment of complete fusion*.]
    Experiment 2. Two parallelopipeds, each 2" x 2" x 6", were cast of close
grey iron ; one of these was placed cold upon the surface of a large ladle
of liquid iron of like quality ; the other was heated as hot as it would
bear without distortion, viz. to nearly a bright yellow heat, in a forge-fire,
and then placed upon the surface of the liquid metal. Both pieces floated,
and, as nearly as could be judged, both to the same height above the
liquid, namely O1808 in. The volume of the cold piece being 24 cubic
inches, the ratio of the immersed to the emergent portions was as 9;6 to
 1, the effective surface upon which the repulsive force could act in pro
 ducing floatation being 12 sq. in.         Assuming that the heated piece has
 been raised from 60° Fahr. (the temperature of the cold piece) to 2000°
 Fahr., and applying the mean coefficient of cubic dilatation as above given
 to this range of temperature, viz. 2000°-60°=1940° Fahr'., we find that
 its volume was enlarged to 24-75 cubic inches, or =-fa of the volume
 when cold ; and taking the specific gravity of the cold piece to have been
  7-17 (see ante), that of the hot piece would be reduced to 7•10 ; the effec
  tive repellent surface was slightly enlarged in the hot piece, and the im
  mersed volume was to the emergent volume as 9-66 : 1. The buoyancy
  of the heated piece had been increased, or, more correctly, its negative
  buoyancy had been decreased, as compared with that of the cold piece, but
 yet it has sunk deeper into the liquid iron in proportion to their re
  spective volumes.      We may therefore be justified in concluding that the
  repellent force which kept both pieces afloat is diminished in energy in
 some proportion as the difference in temperature between the liquid metal
  and the piece floating upon it is diminished, and that where the liquid
  and the floating pieces are alike in quality of metal, both the negative
  buoyancy and the repellent force must both disappear at the instant that
 the floating piece itself becomes liquid by heat abstracted from the molten
 metal.

218               Mr. R. Mallet     on the alleged Expansion
    Experiment 3. Two cylindric pieces of the same grey cast iron and of
the same diameter (=2-375") were gently placed with their axes hori
zontal upon the surface of the molten iron, the one being at 60° Fahr.,
the other at about 300° Fahr.     ; they both floated with a segment of the
cylinder whose versed sine was 031 in. emergent. The volume of either
cylinder was 22*15 cubic inches, and the emergent was to the immersed
volume as    1 : 8-4.  The effective repellent surface in  each case (or cylin
dric surface below the horizontal diameter) was 18-65 sq. in. ; but if we
suppose, as in fact we have done, that the repellent force, whatever be its
nature, acts everywhere perpendicularly to surfaces of contact of the
solid and liquid, then the effective repellent surface here is only the differ
ence between the immersed surfaces of the cylinder below and above the
horizontal diameter, or 9'3 sq. in. From this we may perhaps conclude
that the repellent force is mainly dependent upon the extreme upper parts
of the range of temperature between the liquid and the cold body, inas
much as an augmentation in temperature of the latter of 300°, or about
 $•
    of the entire range between solidity and fusion of the cast iron, pro
duces no very sensible alteration in the tendency to float of the pieces.
    Experiment 4. Three circular disks of the same grey cast iron, each of
6" diam. by 0-375" in thickness, were provided each with a slender iron
wire eye, cast into the centre of one surface, so that by a hooked wire
they could be gently laid upon the surface of the liquid iron of their own
quality. The lower surface and edge of one disk were left as it came clean
from the sand, those of another were rusted by wetting with solution of
 sal-ammoniac, and those of the third were ground smooth and polished by
the grindstone.       When the three disks were in succession laid upon the
surface of the molten iron, they all floated alike as nearly as could be
judged, each sinking to one half the thickness of the disk, so that the
immersed was to the emergent volume in the ratio of equality.                We
 may conclude from this that the condition of the metallic surface of the
 solid cast iron has no material influence upon its flotation.
    Experiment 5. Two circular disks, provided with eyes as in experiment 4,
were prepared, the one being 6 in. in diam. by 0'375 in thickness, and the
other 3 in. in diam. by 1*5 in. in thickness.       The respective volumes of
 these two disks are the same, but the circular flat surfaces respectively
 are as 4 to 1. The surfaces of the two disks being as they came from the
 sand-mould, they were placed gently upon the surface of the molten iron :
                                                                  '
 both floated with the same portion in altitude emergent.           The larger
 and thin disk had, as stated in experiment 4, its emergent and immersed
 volumes in the ratio of equality [or the emergent was to the whole volume
 as 1:2].     In the smaller and thicker disk, the emergent volume was to
 the immersed volume as 1 to 7.          [Or the emergent volume was to total
 volume as to 1 : 8 ; but 2 : 8 : : 1 : 4, or the emergent volumes are to the
 total volumes in each case respectively proportionate to the lower or re
 pellent surfaces of the disk.]

      Now the effective repellent surfaces are here those of the lower circles
of the respective    disks, and these surfaces are to each other in the ratio
of   (the larger) to \. Whatever be the nature, therefore, of the repel
      1
lent force, it seems to be proportionate to some function of the effective
surface as already         defined, and not to the immersed volume of the solid
castiron which floats upon a liquid less dense than itself.
      In all these experiments the
                                mass of the molten cast iron was large in
proportion to the pieces placed upon                    it,
                                        and the surface was kept    care                        by
ful skimming almost perfectly free                   or oxide. A good deal

of difficulty exists in observing the phenomena in such experiments as
these, owing to the glare and heat of the molten metal.       Whatever light
these five experiments     may throw upon the nature of the force which
produces    flotation, the subject must as yet be viewed as very incomplete.
There are some facts of which no complete explanation can be offered
without further experimental study such as, for example, that
                                                    ;                piece of               a
cold cast iron which floats on liquid iron of its own quality        forcibly              if
thrust to the bottom and rapidly and at once released, rises again rapidly
to the surface with all the appearance of        buoyant body, which
                                                                  a      cer                    it
tainly cannot be.
     From what precedes, however, we may summarize as follows —                             :

     These conditions    kept in view may clear up many phenomena at first
apparently       anomalous.

effect.]
  The following experiments were made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich,
with   view to ascertain whether any sensible expansive force could be

(about 53° Fahr.), were both heated in an oven-furnace.              One of these

 within an inch of the surface of the molten metal, and the whole sur

   The object of heating and cooling the empty shell was to ascertain
what amount, if any, of permanent enlargement it might suffer, it being
a well-known fact that all solids of revolution of cast iron, and generally
of all metals of sufficient rigidity, become permanently enlarged by being
heated red-hot and permitted to cool. This arises from the fact that
the outer couches of the solid (a sphere for example) are the first heated
and expanded, and have to draw off more or less from the less-heated
mass within.      Tangential thrusts and radial tensions are thus produced
in the material of the outer couches which disappear, or even become
reversed, as the progress of heating reaches the interior of the mass ; but
in the subsequent cooling the entire train of forces is reversed, the ex
terior couches lose heat by dissipation first, and have to accommodate by
tangential tensions their dimensions to the still hotter interior, the final
result being that when the whole has cooled the dimensions are greater than
before the solid was heated. A 32-lb. spherical shot, which is rather more
than 6 inches in diameter, can be thus permanently increased -fa of an
inch in diameter by a single heating.       It is obvious that the increase will
be much less in a spherical shell than in a solid sphere, and the less as

the shell is thinner*.         On inspecting the Table and curve fig. 5, it will
be seen    that the empty shell had its diameter thus permanently enlarged
by 0-008 of an inch ; and had it been heated to as high a temperature as the
filled shell, we may allowably conclude that this enlargement would have
reached 0-01 of an inch. The filled shell has had its diameter increased
by the decimal 0"-ll ; and if we deduct from this the amount of perma
nent enlargement due to heating only, equal to that of the empty shell,
we have the decimal 0-ll — 0-01 =0-10, which has to be otherwise ac
counted for.       This shell was at a bright red heat visible in clear daylight
 when filled with the liquid iron, which occupied the spherical cavity and
about 0-43 in height of that of the fuse-hole.             The temperature of the
shell visibly rose by the heat communicated from the liquid metal, and in
30 minutes after it was filled had attained its maximum, the surface being
then at a bright yellow heat in daylight when the first measurement of
enlarged diameter was made.            The successive measurements were taken
for orthogonal diameters in the direction normal to the fuse-hole by
means of finely graduated steel beam calipers capable of being read to
0-002 of an inch or even less ; the dimensions set down in the Table are
the means of each pair of orthogonal diameters. The shell was thus
heated at the commencement, and before consolidation of its liquid con
tents had taken place to any considerable extent, to within probably 200°
or 300° Fahr. of the temperature of the cast iron within. The shell and
its contents are therefore at the commencement very nearly in the same
condition as though the whole were a sphere of molten iron without any
more or less rigid envelope, if such could exist.            Reverting to what has
been said above as to the train of forces called into play in a cooling
sphere, let us consider what has taken place here. As the heat is dissi
pated from the exterior of the molten mass, being transmitted through
the shell, one^couche after another of the molten metal in contact with
the inner wall of the shell consolidates, the thickness constantly advan
cing towards the interior, where the metal is still liquid. If each of these
couthes in consolidating expanded in volume, such expansion must con
spire, with the contraction constantly going on by the abasement of tem
perature, to produce compression in the central and as yet unsolidified
portion of the mass.         If, on the contrary, each eouche as it solidifies con
tracts in volume (and, as is the fact, by a larger coefficient of contraction
for equal small ranges of temperature before and after solidification), then
the effect must be that, after the solidified crust has attained a certain
thickness and sufficient rigidity, the further progress of contraction of
the central portions as they successively solidify must be met by their
tending to draw off from the solidified shell, or, in other words, by a
drawing-off from each other of the particles of that central portion of

224              Mr. R. Mallet     on the alleged Expansion
the sphere which last solidifies.     Now the latter is exactly what has hap
pened : a portion   of the  exterior and first solidified crust, reaching about
an inch and half inwards from the interior of the shell, was found to have
a specific gravity  of 7-150 at 57° Fahr., while a portion taken close to the
centre of the sphere had a specific gravity of only 7'037 ; and this specific
gravity would have been still lower (or, in other words, the central part
of the sphere would have been still more " spongy ") had it not been fed
by drawing downwards a portion of the liquid iron which partially filled
the fuse-hole, the portion so drawn down being estimated by the volume
of the cavities left at 0-400 of a cubic inch ; so that but for this the
specific gravity of the central spongy sphere taken at 3" diameter would
have been reduced to 6*776.
    If we  reduce this central spongy mass of 3" diameter and of the last-
mentioned specific gravity to a density as great as that found for the ex
terior crust, namely 7-150, the sphere of 3" diameter would be reduced
to one of 2"-138 ; and it is easy to see that in that case the external
diameter of the whole sphere of metal and of the containing shell would
have been less in a corresponding proportion, and that thus the final
dimensions of the shell would have returned to what they were at the
commencement, less the permanent enlargement, as measured by that of
the empty shell.     If  there existed, on the other hand, any sensible ex
pansion in volume of the metal in consolidating, not only would a central
" spongy " portion be
                           impossible and the central be the densest part of
the whole sphere, but an enlargement of the entire mass and of the
covering shell stretched by    it must have occurred,    so large as to be wholly
unmistakable.
    [The importance of the facts elicited from this experiment cannot be
too forcibly laid before the reader.        Had the sphere of molten iron,
losing heat from its exterior, expanded in volume as couche after couche
it solidified from the exterior, the solidification constantly advancing in
wards, then the central portions of the sphere when ultimately solidified
must be found to be the densest portions of the whole mass ; the opposite
of which was found to be the fact, the central portions of the experi
mental sphere being, as stated, the least dense portions of the whole mass.
This alone seems conclusively to negative the supposition of any expan
 sion in volume in cast iron in consolidating.          On examining the curve
fig. 4 in connexion with the Table, it will be remarked that between
the hours 1.50 and 2.45 there is an irregularity in the progress of con
traction which shows itself by a hump upon the curve which might be
 assumed to indicate a less rate of contraction within this epoch ; and it
 might be further assumed that this apparent reduction arose from the
 conjoint action of general contraction and partial expansion operating
 together within some part of the mass ; but this view, which the writer
 believes would be entirely incorrect, appears sufficiently negatived by the
 following considerations : —

                  of various  Substances   on Solidification.             225
    1.  Between the hours 1.50 and 2.45 but one caliper measurement
 was made, namely at 2.15, and upon this one measurement both the
existence and the amount of this anomalous part of the curve depend.
An error in this single caliper measurement amounting to 0-006 of an
inch was sufficient to have produced it ; and as the limit of reading of
the beam calipers was to a limit of 0-002 or possibly 0-001 of an inch,
a mistake in the measurement at 2.15, or a misreading of only the decimal
 •004 or -005 at most, is sufficient to account for the anomaly.
   2. The hump on the curve does not necessarily indicate expansion, and
from the early time of its occurrence, viz. only 1 hour 25 minutes from
the commencement of cooling, it seems highly improbable that it could
arise from partial expansion then commencing, while as yet a very large
proportion of the entire mass must have been still liquid.
   3. If this anomalous part of the curve were really due to expansion, it
must have much more extensively affected the lower prolongation of the
curve, and have shown itself there in a form that would have unmistakably
declared its origin.
   4. On examining the curve fig. 5 a slight anomaly may be remarked
in the rate of contraction of the empty shell, due no doubt to some
slight error in the third measurement, or that at 1.50 p.m. In this in
stance it would be impossible to ascribe the anomaly to expansion of any
sort.
   The dotted line A (fig. 4) may therefore be viewed as completing the
curve of contraction.
   The curve fig. 6, representing the volume of the filled shell at successive
epochs of cooling, is deduced from the Table (p. 221), assuming the suc
cessive volumes to be proportionate to the cubes of the diametric measure
ments, the curve being a mean drawn through the several points of
observation.]
   The supposition upon which Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter's theory
rests may be divided into two distinct propositions.
    1st. That cast iron is of greater density in the molten than in the solid
state.
   2nd. That cast iron in the act of consolidation expands in volume.
 These propositions are " not identical, although the second is involved in
the first. The first proposition has been already disposed of, and the
last recorded experiments appear conclusively to disprove the second.
   The phenomena described by Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter, and
their explanation of the circulating currents observable in large and nearly
cylindrical ladles of molten iron, appear at first sight so confirmatory of
their views as to the greater density of cast iron in the molten than in
the solid state, that it seems necessary here to present the true explana
tion of the facts, which, so far as they are here relevant, may be best
given briefly in the words of these authors : —
   " When a ladle of molten iron is drawn from the furnace and allowed

226                      Mr. R. Mallet on the alleged Expansion
to stand at rest, the thin coat of scoria or molten oxide which forms on
the surface of the metal is seen, as fast as it forms at the circumference
of the ladle, to be swept by active convergent currents towards the centre,
where it accumulates in a patch.    As the fluid metal parts with some of
its heat and the ladle gets hot by absorbing                   it,
                                                  this remarkable surface-
disturbance becomes less energetic."   This arises from " the expansion of
that portion of the molten mass which         in contact with the compara
                                                      is
tively cool sides of the ladle, which sides act as the chief agent in dispers
ing the heat of the melted metal careful observation will show that the

motion in question   the result of an upward current of the metal around
                               is
the circumference of the ladle, as indicated by the arrows A, B,   in the            C
accompanying sectional drawing
            "
of the ladle [fig.    the figure in
                           7;
the margin    essentially the same
                    is
as thatof these authors].    " The
upward current of the metal can
be seen at the rim of the ladle,
where      deflected into the con
          it   is
vergent horizontal direction, and
where   presents an elevatory ap

It    difficult to assign to this any

cause but that of expansion and
consequent reduction of specific
gravity of the fluid metal in con
tact with the sides of the pot, as,
according to the generally enter
tained idea, the surface-currents above referred to would                     be   in the con
trary direction to that which they invariably take, t. e. they would diverge
from the centre instead of converging to it."
   The facts, so far as they are above described, are generally correct, but
the explanation given       not the true one.

molten mass and determine the direction of its currents ; and it will be
obvious, on inspecting the figure, that these currents will be most powerful
round the outer circumference of the mass, where each unit of its top sur
face has a larger     proportion of lining in proximity to it than at the cen
tral parts of the mass, where downward currents are the necessary con
sequence of those produced upwards at the circumference.              The organic
matters mixed with the lining are carbonized, and give forth the elements
of water as well as nitrogen.         The clay, which is a hydrous silicate of
various earthy bases, gives forth its water and some of the oxygen of the
peroxide of iron which most clays contain.           More or less carbonate of
lime is almost always interspersed, and this gives forth carbonic acid and
water.      The gases thus streamed forth act mechanically by their ascent
and also chemically upon molten iron, the water being decomposed, oxi
dizing portions of the iron and forming scoria, which is again more or
less reduced by contact of the hydrogen and nitrogen when the latter is
present.      These rapid combinations and decompositions are no doubt the
main cause of those singular vermicular startings referred to by Messrs.
Naamyth and Carpenter, which are familiar to every iron-founder, but
which are entirely distinct from the ascending and descending currents
 due to the ascent of the evolved gases.        That this is the true explanation
 is supported by the following facts : — 1. After a large ladle has stood full
 of molten metal for some hours, and time has been given thus for the
 whole of the gaseous contents of the lining to be driven off, the ascending
 and descending currents       cease to be perceptible, and  if any currents at all
 can be discerned they are in the opposite directions.           2. If, after this,
 such a ladle be emptied of its contents, the lining remaining untouched
 and only coated with a thin shell of adherent cast iron [and oxides and
  silicates of iron], and the ladle being again filled with molten iron, no
  such currents as at first are produced in the molten mass, the lining
  having been previously exhausted of its gases and vapours.             That the
  currents described by Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter are not due to dis
  sipation of heat from the mass through the sides of the ladle is evident
  from the following considerations : —
      A 10-ton ladle, which is about 4| feet by 3 feet in depth, loses heat so
   slowly that after standing for six hours the molten metal is still fluid
  enough to make castings.        Let us suppose it filled into the ladle at a
  temperature     of 2800°  to  2900° Fahr., and that after six hours it is still
  200° above the temperature of solidification of cast iron, or at 2600°.
  The molten mass has thus lost 300° of heat in 360 minutes, or -0138 of
  a degree per second.       We may assume this at any instant as represent
   ing  the difference  in temperature between two vertical columns, one at
  the centre and the other at the circumference of the molten mass.            The
   linear dilatation of cast iron for one degree of Fahrenheit being 0,0000111,
   as deduced from its total cubic dilatation between 60° Fahr. and the tem
   perature of fusion at which it was poured into the cone, as given in this

    228             Mr. R. Mallet    on the alleged Expansion
    paper, and assuming the depth of the colder of these columns, whether
   that be at the circumference or not, to be, as stated, 36", that of the hotter
   column will be 36-0000005514, and the difference between these two
   measures the force which     alone can produce circulating currents in the
   mass by differences of temperature     due only to cooling.    This is equally
   true whether it be the colder column that is dilated, as supposed by
   Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter, or the hotter one, as is the fact.        And
   if we consider the viscidity of molten cast iron, it is perfectly obvious
   that the circulating currents referred to by Messrs. Nasmyth and Car
   penter cannot be due to so insignificant a cause.
      Want of attention, or careless interpretation of the many and some
  what complicated conditions thus seen to be involved in the cooling of a
  solid by dissipation of its heat from its exterior, has caused many seri
  ous misapprehensions on the part of experimenters as to the supposed
  expansion of metals in volume when consolidating.           Thus, even in the
  case of bismuth, it has been supposed a conclusive proof of its expan
  sion that a mass cooling in an open crucible exudes from its interior
  upon its top surface cauliflower-like excrescences ; but although the author
  does not here deny or affirm any thing as to expansion being a fact in the
  case of bismuth, it is nevertheless obvious that such excrescences might
  arise merely from the grip of the crucible itself, or even of the exterior
  portions of the metal already solidified contracting upon and so squeez
  ing out portions of the still liquid interior.
     It is stated on good authority that a distinguished artillery officer, in
  former years at the head of the Laboratory, Woolwich Arseual, satisfied
 himself of the reality of the expansion
 of cast iron -in consolidating by the                   Fig.  8.
 following     experiment : — An elon
 gated projectile was cast, with its axis
 vertical, in a very thick and massive
 mould of cast iron, the mould being
 cold or nearly so ; the molten metal
 was    introduced    through a narrow
 aperture    applied at the base of the
 projectile,  as  in fig. 8, the neck  or
 "gate" being knocked off the in
 stant the mould was filled.      As the
 cooling rapidly proceeded, portions
of the still fluid metal were forced
 out at the place where this neck
was detached ; and the conclusion was
come to that the exterior being al
ready solidified such excrescence could
only arise from expansion of the contained liquid metal as it solidified
in succession. What really did take place, and is the true
                                                                   explanation

                       of various   Substances    on Solidification.                229
of the facts, is, that when a very thick iron mould of this sort is suddenly
heated by pouring molten iron into its interior, as the heat abstracted
from the latter can only pass into the material of the mould at a rate
determined by its conductivity, so the interior part rapidly becomes
raised to a temperature enormously higher than the exterior portions,
which for a time remain almost cold. The expanded interior walls of
the mould push inwards as towards the points of least resistance, and so
actually diminish the capacity of the mould for a time, the inner surfaces
of which press upon the consolidating crust of metal within        and so    it,
squeeze    out in part its liquid contents, just as water might be squeezed
from an india-rubber bottle*.
   It seemed desirable to obtain some experimental results in reference to
the objects of this communication with lead. It has never, so far as the
author    is aware, been even suggested that this metal expands in consoli
dating.     Its coefficient of dilatation        by
                                              heat    enormously greater than
                                                          is
that of cast iron, being, according to the determination of Lavoisier and
Laplace, between 32° and 212° Fahr. =0-0000474 of its volume for one
degree Fahr.    ; so that, taking its fusing-point at 617° (Rudberg), and
assuming the coefficient constant for the entire range from 60° to 617°
(which    is  much below the truth), its dilatation when in fusion would
be=0-0264 of its volume, and the specific gravity of lead at 60°=ll-36                    ;
that of liquid lead must be below 11-07.        Indeed this enormous amount
of dilatation   is impressed upon any observer who sees the rate at which
the lead in casting       common bullet sinks into the neck of the mould,
                           a
and the comparatively large cavity which always exists in the ball when
cut in two.      From its low temperature of fusion and the suddenness
 with which lead passes from the solid to the liquid state without
 any phase of intermediate viscidity, and only          brief one of crystalline
                                                           a
 brittleness, and the facility with which its surface can be kept free from
 dross or oxide, this metal presents        " crucial " example for experiment

gently upon the surface, after a moment's hesitation slowly went to the
bottom.       Another disk of 6" diameter, by rather less than an inch in
thickness, remained a few seconds longer on the surface and then sunk
to the bottom ; both disks, while they floated, had their top surfaces but
very slightly elevated above that of the liquid lead.        One of the disks
being gently     lowered into the liquid lead vertically and edgeways, at once
went to the bottom.
    4th. Two disks, each 6" diameter, the one 0*57 inch and the other
0- 4 inch in thickness, being gently laid flat upon the surface of the
molten lead, floated, and with an emergent portion sensibly greater than
that of the disks in experiments 2 and 3, and remained floating until about
 1- 25  of the radius had been melted away all round, when they slowly
 sunk in the liquid, as was proved by the slow disappearance of the slender
 iron wire cast into the middle of the disk for the purpose of lowering.
 The thinner of these two disks floated rather longer than the thicker.
     5th. A plate of sheet or laminated lead, clean from the rolling-mill, of
 about 0"*5 in thickness and about 10" square, being gently placed flat
 on the surface of the liquid lead, floated, its top surface being nearly
 level with that of the liquid. After about ten seconds a piece was melted
 off from one of the edges, when the plate canted in the opposite direction
 and sunk.
     6th. Plates of about 0"*18 thick floated much in the same manner as
 the preceding.      The temperature of the solid lead employed was in all
 cases about 70° Fahr.
     It  follows from these experiments that, as in the case of cast iron, the
 solid does not float upon the liquid lead through buoyancy, that, on the
 contrary, the negative buoyancy is very marked, and that the repellent
 force, whatever be its nature, by which flotation is produced is dependent
 upon the effective surface as compared with the volume of the solid.
     They present also a corroboration of the view that the repellent force
 upon the unit of effective surface is greater as the difference of tempera
  ture between the solid and liquid metal is so.

                     of various Substances       on Solidification.                  231
    I proceed to some remarks upon the experiments referred to at the
commencement of this paper, and quoted by Messrs. Nasmyth and Car
penter, as to the floating of pieces of solidified iron furnace-slag upon the
same slag when        in the liquid state. It is a fact that blast-furnace slags
cooled below the point at which they become rigid do very generally
float upon the same slag in its molten state.            It is equally true that the
basic silicates which constitute the chief part of terrestrial volcanic lavas
float upon the surface of these when molten.                But these admissions do
not suffice in any degree to support the conclusion deduced by Messrs.
Nasmyth and Carpenter, that basic silicates, whether as furnace-slags or
lavas, are denser in the molten than in the solidified state, nor that these
bodies in the act of solidification expand in volume or decrease in density
in any manner, irrespective of the formation or enlargement of cavities
or gas-bubbles within them. The experiments of the author upon the
total contraction of iron furnace-slags for the entire range of tempera
ture between that of the blast-furnace and the atmosphere, made at the
Barrow Iron- Works, and fully described in the author's paper on " The
Nature and Origin of Volcanic Heat and Energy," printed in Phil.
Trans, for 1873, leave no doubt as to the following facts : —
    1st. That the density of such slags at 53° Fahr. is to their density
when molten and at the temperature of the blast-furnace as 1000 : 933,
or, taken at the melting-point of slag, as 1000 to 983 — molten slag being
thus very much less dense than the same when solidified.
    2ndly. That no expansion in volume whatever occurs in such slags at
or near the instant of solidification.
    The experiments of the author above referred to were made by filling
 cast-iron slightly conical moulds with the slag run direct from the blast
furnace, and permitted to consolidate and cool therein, by which per
 fectly solid slightly conical blocks were obtained. From the method em
 ployed, and the very large scale upon which these experiments were con
 ducted, it is impossible that any expansion in volume at or near the point
 of consolidation,     if even of a very minute amount, could have occurred and
 yet have escaped notice*.           It is only necessary for the author here to
 point out that the floating of crusts of slag or lava is not due to the cause
 assigned by Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter; nor is it his intention to
 enter at any length into what are the causes             of such floating      when    it
 occurs.
    The following remarks, however, may            be made    : — It is impossible to
 obtain a moderate-sized fragment of solidified slag or lava free from air-
 bubbles, and from involved or superficial cavities, which tend to float the
 mass when thrown upon its own material in the melted state.                       Those
 who have attentively watched large volumes of slag issuing from the
 blast-furnace     are aware that it comes         forth carrying      with it a large
    •                                     the author begs to refer to his paper at length.

2H2                  Mr. R. Mallet        on the alleged Expansiun
volume of gaseous matter minutely diffused, which is pretty readily sepa
rated, and is characterized by a white vaporous cloud floating thinly over
the issuing stream ; if the slag be cooled rapidly, the gaseous or vapori-
zable bodies present become confined and render the mass vesicular, while
if cooled more slowly, and with               a free surface for the escape of these,
the mass solidifies more solidly, often as solidly as a block of granite*.
    Independently of the buoyancy that is produced by the veaicularity of
rapidly cooled slags, it is highly probable that relatively cold and solid
slag, whose buoyancy is negative, may yet float on molten slag, whose
density is less than its own, in virtue of that same repellent force which,
as we have seen, acts under           like conditions in the case of metals.
    With respect to acid silicates, or slags analogous to glass (which, how
ever, are not referred to by Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter), the author
again refers to the results given in his paper (Phil. Trans. 1873). These,
and indeed the circumstances             attending          the production     and destruction
of the well-known " Rupert's drops," incontestably prove that these sili
cates also are less dense in the molten than in the solid state, and that
they contract violently at or near the instant of consolidation.
    The author has more than once heard the opinion expressed by those
engaged about blast-furnaces, that their slags do expand in consolidating,
based upon a misinterpretation of the following frequently occurring cir
cumstance : — When the large parallelopipeds of slag (5 to 6 feet square by
2 to 3 feet thick) are stripped from the iron square frame which formed
their edges, and are being removed upon the iron waggons on which they
are cast, and still, as often happens, in a very hot state, or even with a
still liquid or viscous interior, though rigid externally, it occasionally
happens that such a block
bursts asunder, and with a sud
denness        which    is   sufficient
sometimes to scatter danger
ously some of the liquid inte
rior ; or if the fracture be not
so sudden, and the         interior  be
in a viscous condition, the latter
may continue for a considerable

 into any detail      to prove that the phenomena are due to the contrac
 tion of the already solidified exterior upon the         unyielding interior of the
 mass ; the     former becoming fractured by its own grip, and its material
being highly elastic, often yields with apparently explosive violence like
a suddenly broken spring (see fig. 9, which shows the appearance of one
of these fractured and        slowly exuding blocks).
    [The  following     remarks    may be made, in addition to those preceding,
in contravention of the supposed expansion of slags or lavas in consoli
dating.     It is well known that masses of mud when dried by the sun
crack, the    fissures penetrating nearly perpendicular from the surface and
separating     into more or less symmetrical prisms. Blocks of starch after
desiccation present        similar   phenomena, which      are also frequently  seen
exemplified by the uppermost           beds  of argillaceous limestone (or calp) of
Ireland when       first laid  bare  from its detrital covering. In all these cases
there can be      no doubt that the phenomena are due to the shrinkage of
the mass in drying. But shrinkage or contraction by cooling and consoli
dation ought to present us with like results ; and these we see actually
manifest    in the splitting-up of basalt into columnar prisms whose long
axes are    always found perpendicular to the surface by which the heat of
the mass was dissipated.            Such columnar separation is not confined to
basalt ; instances of it are abundant in lavas of every age, the surfaces
of the    prisms in these being sometimes straight, sometimes curved.
Although much remains yet to be investigated before all the circumstances
attending the splitting-up of masses of basalt or lava can be said to be
fully understood,         yet enough is already known and clearly explained to
make    it certain that it is due to contraction of these materials as they
 cool, and    that this form of splitting-up is wholly incompatible with that
 of any   fissuring that could arise from the refrigeration of a mass the
volume of every part of which expanded in consolidating.]
    As in what precedes the hypothesis upon which the lunar volcanic
 theory of Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter rests is proved to be without
 foundation, it seems needless to enlarge upon the incongruities and con
 tradictions which the theory itself presents when fairly applied to such
 knowledge as we have of the volcanic features of the moon, or still more
 when applied, as it must be were it true, to those of our earth, [assuming
 the materials of our earth and satellite analogous in their physical and
 chemical    properties — an assumption made by these authors throughout
 their work, though without any attempt to support it by proof].

  I. "   Remarks      on Professor Wyville Thomson's Preliminary
        Notes    on the Nature of the Sea-bottom procured by the
        Soundings Of     H.M.S. ' Challenger.' " By William B. Car
        penter, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S. Received Dec. 29, 1874.
     The extreme interest of two of the questions started      and partly dis
 cussed in Professor Wyville Thomson's communication           will be deemed,
 I trust, a sufficient  reason for my offering such contributions as my own
 experience   furnishes   towards their solution.
     The first of these questions is, whether the Ghbigerina, by the accumu
 lation of whose shells the Globigerina-ooze is being formed on the deep-
 sea bottom, live and multiply on that bottom, or pass their whole lives in
 the superjacent water (especially      in its upper stratum), only subsiding
 to the bottom when dead.
     Having previously      held the former opinion, Prof. Wyville Thomson
 states that he has now been led to adopt the latter, by the results of Mr.
 Murray's explorations of the surface and sub-surface waters with the tow-
 net — which    results concur with the previous observations of Miiller,
 Haeckel, Major Owen, and others, in showing that Globigerincr, in com
mon with many other Foraminifera, have a pelagic habitat ; while the
 close relation which they further indicate between the surface-fauna of
 any particular locality and the materials of the organic deposit at the
bottom, appears to Prof. Wyville Thomson to warrant the conclusion
that the latter is altogether derived from the former.
     Now without in the least degree calling in question the correctness of
these observations,    I  venture to submit, first, that they bear a different
interpretation ; and second, that this interpretation is required by other
facts, of which no account seems to have been taken by Prof. Wyville
Thomson and his coadjutor.           In this, as in many other instances, I

                                                           '
    1875.]       Sea-bottom procured by         H.M.S.       Challenger.'         235
   believe   it will prove that the truth lies between two extreme views.
   That the Globigerina live on the bottom only is a position       clearly no longer
   tenable ; but that they live and       multiply in    the upper waters   only, and
  only sink to the bottom         after death, seems to me a position no more
  tenable than the preceding        : and  I shall now adduce the evidence which
 appears to me at present to        justify the conclusion (I refrain from express-.
  ing  myself   more   positively, because    I consider the question still open to
  investigation), that whilst the Globigerince are pelagic in an earlier stage of
  their lives,   frequenting the upper stratum of the ocean, they sink to
 the bottom whilst still living, in consequence of the increasing thickness
 of their calcareous shells, and not only continue to live on the sea-bed,
 but probably      multiply there — perhaps there exclusively.
     That there is no a priori improbability in their doing so, is proved by
 the abundant evidence in my possession of the existence of Foramini-
                                                                                      '
feral life at abyssal depths. The collections made during the ' Porcupine
 Expeditions      of 1869 and 1870 yielded a large number of those Arenace
ous    types which construct their
                                           " tests " by the cementation of sand-
grains     only to be obtained on the bottom ; and these were almost the
only Foraminifera, except Globigerince            and Orbulince, which came up in
the 2435 fathoms dredging.              Again, many Foraminifera, both arenace
ous    and shelly, were brought up from great depths, attached to shells,
Btones,     Ac, that must have lain at the bottom. Further, among the
" vitreous " Foraminifera, the most common
                                                        deep-sea types, except those
of the Globigerine family, were Cristellarians with shells so thick and
massive as      to  be  (it may be safely affirmed) incapable of being floated
by the animals        which   form them ; while among the " porcellanous " Fora
minifera, the Biloculince and Triloculinoe were equally distinguished by a
tnassiveness of shell, which seemed to forbid the idea that they could have
floated subsequently to that stage of their lives in which this massive-
ness    had been acquired.
     Of the existence of living Globigerince in great numbers in the stratum
of water immediately above the bottom, at from 500 to 750 fathoms
depth,     I  am able to speak with great positiveness.

the surface or sub-surface stratum, and was merely preparatory to the
deposit of the shells on the sea-bed, there should have been a corre
spondence in size and condition between the floating shells and those
lying on the bottom immediately beneath them ; whereas no contrast
could be more complete, the impression given by the superficial aspects
they respectively presented having been fully confirmed by subsequent
careful investigation.
    Prof. Wyville Thomson      and  Mr. Murray, who notice this contrast,
attribute it to the death  of the shells which have subsided to the bottom —
being apparently unaware that the observations of Dr. Wallich, with
 which my own are in entire accordance, leave no reasonable ground for
 doubt that it is a consequence of their continued life.             For it is clearly
 shown, by making thin transparent sections of the thick-shelled Globi-
gerinas (an operation which needs a dexterity only to be acquired by long
 practice, and which is much facilitated by an ingenious device invented,
 by   Dr. Wallich *), that the change of external aspect is due to the
 remarkable exogenous deposit (a rudiment of the " intermediate skeleton
                                                                                      "
 of higher Foraminifera) which is formed, after the full growth of the
 Globigerina has been attained, upon the outside of the proper chamber-
 wall — so completely masking its pseudopodial orifices, that Prof. Huxley at
 one time denied their existence.      This deposit is not only many times
 thicker than the original chamber-wall, but it often contains flask-shaped
 cavities opening from the exterior, and containing sarcode prolonged into
 it from the sarcodic investment of the shell. Illustrations of this curious
 structure are given by Dr. Wallich in figs. 17 and 18 of Plate vi. of his
 'North-Atlantic Sea-bed;' and        I here subjoin a representation of it,
 kindly given me by Dr. Wallich twelve years ago, which further shows
                                              Section of Shell of Globigerina, showing
                                           the distinction between the original proper

                                           cavities in the latter opening externally

  sheet of my ' Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera ' comprising
 the Globigerine family passed through the press, but which        I  have my
 self subsequently confirmed in every particular) it seems an almost inevit
 able inference that the subsidence of the Globigerina to the bottom is the
 consequence, not of their death, but of the increasing thickness and
 weight of their shells, produced by living action. As long as the number
 of segments continues to increase, the carbonate of lime separated by the
 sarcodic body from the circumambient water goes to form the walls of
 additional chambers; but when this chamber-formation          ceases (which
 usually occurs when the shell consists of either 12 or 16 segments), it
is applied to thicken the walls of the chambers already formed ; and
from the rapid subsidence of the Globigerina taken up from the sea-
bottom when thrown into a jar of sea-water, it seems to me inconceiv
able that they can be floated by their animal inhabitants when once the
eiogenous deposit has attained any considerable thickness.
    That the Globigerina which have subsided to the bottom continue          to
live there, is further indicated by the condition of the sarcodic contents
of their shells.     In any sample of Globigerina-ooze that      I   have seen
brought np by the dredge      or the  sounding-apparatus, part of the shells
(presumably those of the surface-layer) were filled with a sarcode body
corresponding in condition with that of Foraminifera known to live on
the sea-bed, and retaining the characteristic form of the organism after
the removal of the shell by dilute acid.         As Dr. Wallich pointed out
(' North- Atlantic Sea-bed,' p. 139), the sarcode of these is viscid, and
inclined to coalesce again when crushed ; the shell has a vivid but light
burnt-sienna colour, and sarcodic bosses, like retracted pseudopodia, are
distinguishable upon its exterior.                         I
                                        The only misgiving ever bad in regard
to the living condition of the Globigerince presenting these characters,
was caused by the absence of any pseudopodial extensions;              and this
 source    of doubt has been now removed by the statement of Prof.
 Wyville Thomson, that no pseudopodia have ever been observed by Mr.
 Murray to be put forth by the Globigerina captured in surface-waters. —
 In the same sample will be found shells distinguishable from the pre
 ceding by their dingy look and greyish colour, by the want of consistence
 and viscidity in their sarcode contents, and by the absence of any external
 sarcodic investment ; these are presumably dead.         Other shells, again,
are entirely empty ; and even when the surface-stratum is formed of
 perfect Globigerina, the character of the deposit soon changes as it is
 traced downwards.        " The sediment," as was correctly stated by Prof.
 Wyville Thomson, " gradually       becomes  more compact   ; and a slight grey
 colour (due, probably, to the decomposing organic matter) becomes more
  pronounced, while perfect shells of Globigerina almost disappear, frag
 ments become      smaller, and calcareous mud, structureless     and in a fine
  state of division, is in greatly preponderating proportion" ('Depths of
 the Sea,' p. 410).      These facts seem to me to mark very strongly the

238                Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the Nature of             the         [Feb. 4,
distinction between the living surface-layer and the dead sub-surface
layer, and to show that there is nothing in the condition of the Deep
Sea that is likely to prevent or even to retard the decomposition at the
dead sarcode bodies of Globigerina.    We know that oxygen is present in
Oceanic water, even to its abyssal depths, in sufficient proportion for the
maintenance of Animal life ; and what suffices for this, must be adequate
to promote the decomposition of organic matter.       There    moreover,  is,          a
significant indication of the undecomposed condition .of the sarcode
bodies of the Globigerina of the surface-layer, in the fact that they serve
 as food to various higher animals which             live on the same bottom.        This
was first pointed out by Dr. Wallich, who found that the contents                      of
the stomachs of the Ophiocomce brought up in his 1260 fathoms sounding,
consisted of   number of fresh-looking Globigerince more or less broken
                   a
up, minute yellow amorphous particles, and few oil-globules
                                                          a   North-            ('
Atlantic Sea-bed,' p. 145). And have subsequently verified his state
                                        I
ment in many other cases           *.
     It     seems to me clear, from the foregoing   facts, that the onus probandi
rests on those who main tail            that the Globigerina do not live on the
bottom   and such proof
             ;                  is
                            altogether wanting.  The most cogent evi
dence in favour of that proposition would be furnished   the capture,   by
floating in the upper waters, of the large thick-shelled specimens which
are at present only known as having been brought up from the sea-bed.
And the capture of such specimens would only prove that even in this
condition the Globigerina can float     would not show that they cannot
                                            ;   it
also live on the bottom.
   That the Globigerina not only live, but propagate, on the Sea-bottom,
is   indicated     by
                the presence (as already stated) of enormous multitudes
of very young specimens in the water immediately overlying it. And
thus all we at present know of the life-history of this most important
type seems to lead to the conclusion, that whilst in the earlier stages                 of
their existence they are inhabitants of the upper waters, they sink to the
bottom on reaching adult age, in consequence of the increasing thickness
of their shells, that they propagate there (whether                by
                                                            gemmation or
sexual generation    not known), and that the young, rising to the surface,
                        is
repeat the same history.
I   now proceed to show that the relation between the surface-fauna and
the bottom-deposit    by no means as constant as Prof. Wyville Thomson
                         is
and Mr. Murray affirm     to be.

      may be taken as proved that there    no want of Foraminiferal life

he fishes on the Faroe Banks chiefly live on the Ophiocotna  which swarm there, these
again on the Globigerina, whilst the Globigerina seem to draw their sustenance from
the organic matter universally diffused
                                           through sea-water, making     a very dilute

   that the   " white mud " of the Levant is mainly               a Foraminiferal deposit ;
   I  found a similar mud covering the bottom along the                 Tripoli coast ; Mr.
  J. Grwyn Jeffreys has dredged Foraminifera in abundance in the Bay of
  Spezzia, Captain Spratt in the iEgean, Oscar Schmidt in the Adriatic, and
 I myself at various points in the Western basin along the northern coast
 of Africa.        That Foraminifera, especially Globigerince, abound in its
 surface-water at Messina, is testified by Haeckel in the passage cited by
 Prof. Wyville Thomson ; and when it is considered how large an influx
 of Atlantic water is constantly entering through the Strait of Gibraltar,
and is being diffused throughout                 the Mediterranean basin, and how
favourable is its temperature-condition,               it can scarcely be doubted that if
the doctrine now upheld by Prof. Wyville Thomson were correct, the
deposit of Globigerina-shella . over the whole bottom-area ought to be
as abundant as it is in the Atlantic under corresponding                   latitudes.    Yet
I found the deeper bottoms, from 300 fathoms downwards, entirely
destitute of Globigerine as of higher forms of Animal life ; and this was
not my own experience only, but was also that of Oscar Schmidt, who
made a . similar exploration of the Adriatic.               In my first visit to the Medi
                           '
terranean, in the             Porcupine' (1870), many hundredweight of the fine
mud brought up by the dredge from great depths in the Western basin
were laboriously sifted, and the siftings carefully examined, without
bringing to light more than a stray drift-shell here and there.                      And in
my second visit, in the
                                  '

                                                    (1871),   I examined all the samples
of bottom brought up by the sounding-apparatus                      from great depths in
the Eastern basin, with the same result — giving all the more care to this
examination,         because Cap't. Nares (probably through not having kept
separate in his mind the results of the deeper and of the shallower
soundings which he had previously made in the Mediterranean) assured
me that     I  should find minute shells imbedded in the mud.
     I can see no other way of accounting for the absence of Globigerina-
ooze from the bottom of the Mediterranean,                   save on its shallow borders,
than by attributing it to the unfavourable nature of the influences affect
ing the bottom-life of this basin          : that is to say, the gradual settling-down
of the fine sedimentary             deposit which forms the layer of inorganic mud
everywhere spread over its deeper bottom, and the deficiency of oxygen
and excess of carbonic acid which              I  have shown to prevail in its abyssal
waters giving them the character of a stagnant pool — these influences
acting either singly or in combination.
     Another fact of which Prof. Wyville Thomson is fully cognizant, and
to which he formerly attached considerable importance as indicative of
the bottom-life of the Globix/erina, is unnoticed in his recent communica
tion :    I refer to the singular limitation of the Globigerina^ooze                  to the
"                  "
     warm area        of the sea-bed between the North of Scotland and the
 Faroe Islands.          It will be recollected by those who have read my

 100 to 150 fathoms, has the temperature of the warm flow coming up

at a depth of 600 fathoms, it falls so suddenly in the cold area be
                                                                       "            "

to 29°*5.      Now on this " cold area

the bottom consisting of sand and gravel, and the Foraminifera brought
up from it being almost exclusively those which form arenaceous tests.
The " warm area," on the other hand, is covered with Globigerina-ooie to
an unknown depth, its surface-stratum being composed of perfect shells
filled with sarcode, whilst its deeper layers are amorphous.                   Near the
junction of the two areas, but still within the thermal limit of the
" warm," sand and Globigerina-ooze are mingled — this being peculiarly
noticeable on the         " ifo&mia-ground," which yielded a large proportion
of our most noteworthy captures in this locality.                 Now if the bottom-
deposit is dependent on the life of the surface-stratum,                    why should
there be this complete absence of Globigerinarooze over the

the condition of the surface-stratum being everywhere the same? I
was myself formerly disposed to attribute it to the depression of bottom-
                                                                                  '

be accepted.         And I     can see no other way of accounting for it than by
attributing     it to the drift of the cold underflow, carying away the Globi-
gerince that are subsiding through it towards the deep basin of the Atlantic,
into which I believe that underflow to discharge itself.                  Prof. Wyville
Thomson,       however, denies any sensible movement to this underflow,

continuing to speak of it as " banked up by the Gulf-stream*, which
    * See his ' Depths of the Sea,' p. 400. That there is a lateral pressure of the one
flow against the other, just as there is a lateral pressure of the Labrador Current
against the Gulf -stream on the North-American coast (producing the well-known " cold
wall "), is sufficiently obvious from their relative distributions on the bottom of the
channel.    But it seems to me perfectly clear that the effect of this pressure is simply
to narrow the glacial flow, and at the same time to increase its velocity.        The most
westerly point to which we traced it was near the edge of the Faroe Banks ; and
there (as Prof. Wyville Thomson himself pointed out to me at the time) the movement
of the bottom-water was evidenced by the rounding into pebbles of what was elsewhere
 angular gravel. But it is even more conclusively shown by a comparison of the two
 serial soundings taken in the " cold area

 glacial stratum flows tip a slope in the former position (just as the cold under-stratum
 does in the Florida Channel), which it could not do unless it were in movement. That
 we did not trace the outflow of this cold stream into the great basin of the Atlantic,
 was simply, as    I  believe, because we were prevented from ascertaining the bottom-
 temperature on the line which        I erpected that flow to take after surmounting the
 ridge.

ing example of want of conformity between the surface-fauna and the
bottom-deposit         consequently remains to be accounted for on his hypo
thesis.
     The other      of Prof. Wyville Thomson's         principal conclusions, as to
which      I  have rather     a suggestion     to offer than an objection to take,
relates to the origin of the
                                     " red clay " which he found covering large
areas in the Atlantic, and met with also between Kerguelen's Island and
Melbourne.         Into this red clay he describes the Globigerina-ooze as gra
duating, through the
                             " grey ooze " ; and he affirms this transition to be
essentially dependent on the depth of the bottom.
                                                                    " Crossing," he says
" from these shallower
                              regions occupied by the ooze into deeper soundings,
vie
     find universally that the calcareous formation gradually passes into,
and is replaced by, an extremely pure clay, which occupies, speaking
generally,     all depths below 2500 fathoms, and consists almost entirely of
a   silicate  of the red oxide of iron and alumina                               The mean
maximum         depth at which the Globigerina-ooze occurs, may be taken
at about      2250 fathoms ; the mean depth at which we find the trans
 ition grey ooze is 2400 fathoms ; and the mean depth of the red-clay
 soundings       is about 2700 fathoms                             We were at length
able," he continues,        " to predict the nature of the bottom from the depth of
the   soundings     with absolute certainty for the Atlantic and the Southern
Sea."      And from these data he considers it an indubitable inference
"
   that the red clay is essentially the insoluble residue, the ash, as it were,
of the calcareous organisms which form the Globigerina-ooze after the
calcareous matter has been by some means removed."                      This inference he
considers to have been confirmed by the analysis of several samples of
 OloUgerina-ooze,
                         " always with the result thata small proportion of a red
sediment remains, which possesses all the characters of the red clay."
Prof. Wyville Thomson further suggests that the removal of the calcare
ous matter may be due to the presence of an excess of carbonic acid in
the bottom-waters, and to the derivation of this water in great part from
 circumpolar freshwater ice, so that, being comparatively free from car
 bonate of lime, its solvent power for that substance is greater than that of
 the superjacent waters of the ocean.            He might have added probability to
 his hypothesis if he had cited the observations of Mr. Sorby as to the
 increase     of solvent power for carbonate of lime possessed by water under
 greatly augmented pressure*.
      Greatly struck with the ingenuity of this hypothesis,              I  turned to Prof.
  Wyville     Thomson's     tabular   statement   of  the   facts   in  detail  ; and must
 own to a great feeling of surprise at the want of conformity of these
 details    with the assertions of universality and certainty of prediction
 which      I  have italicized in the above extracts.              Thus in the deepest

      It is clear, then, that no constant relation exists between depth and
 the nature of the bottom.            If  not only eight ordinary soundings whose

      Now if this " red clay had the character of an ordinary river-silt,
 it would be quite conformable to my Mediterranean experience to regard
 it  (as  Prof. Wyville Thomson himself was at first disposed to                do) in the
 light    of- a derivative     from the land,      diffused   through   the ocean-water
 and slowly settling-down over particular areas, to which it might be de
 termined by the prevalent direction of the bottom-flow, which would
 greatly depend in its turn upon the ridge-and- valley conformation of                  the
 sea-bed.       And the presence of a small proportion of this material in              the
 ordinary      Globigerinar-ooze,  whilst, where it is deposited in quantity, there
 are neither entire Globigerina nor their disintegrated remains, would be
 perfectly consistent with the known destructive effect of the slow sub
 sidence of a muddy sediment on many forms of animal life*.
     But   I  agree with Prof. Wyville Thomson in thinking that the remark
 able uniformity of this deposit, coupled with its peculiar composition, in
 dicates a different derivation       ;  and the suggestion      I have to  offer is based
on its near relation in composition, notwithstanding its great difference
in appearance, to GJmKonite — -the mineral of which the green sands
that occur in various Geological formations are for the most part com
posed, and which is a silicate of peroxide of iron and alumina.
     It is well known that Prof. Ehrenberg, in 1853t, drew attention to
the fact that the grains of these green sands are for the most part, if not
entirely, internal casts of Foraminifera — the sarcodic bodies of the animals
having been replaced by glaueonite, and the calcareous shells subsequently
got rid of, either by abrasion or by some solvent which does not attack
their contents. It was soon afterwards shown by Prof. Bailey (U. S.)
that in certain localities a like replacement is going on at the present

   occupied by mineral      deposit, which, when the shell has been dissolved
  away by dilute acid, presents a perfect internal cast of its cavities.                  By
  the application of this method to Mr. Beete           J ukes's Australian dredgings,
  my   coadjutors, Messrs.      W. K. Parker and T. Rupert Jones, obtained a
  series  of internal casts of most wonderful beauty and completeness, on
  which    I have based my interpretation of the organic structure of Eoxoon
  Canadense.      Having myself examined in the same manner a portion of
  the  Foraminiferal sand dredged by Capt. Spratt in the iEgean (kindly
 placed in my hands by Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys),                       I have found that it
 yielded a great variety of these beautiful models, not only of the bodies
 of Foraminifera, but also of the sarcodic network which interpenetrates
 the calcareous network of the shell and spines of Echinida*.
    Alike in Mr. Jukes's and in Capt. Spratt's dredgings, some of these
 casts are in green silicates and some in ochreous, corresponding precisely
to the two kinds of fossil casts described by Prof. Ehrenberg.                           The
difference     I presume to depend upon the degree of oxidation of the iron ;
but as these casts are far too precious to be sacrificed for chemical ana
lysis,   I  cannot speak with certainty on this point.
    As it is only in certain limited areas of the sea-bottom that this replace
ment of the sarcodic bodies of Foraminifera by mineral deposit is met
with, it has always seemed to me next to certain that there must be some
peculiarity in the composition of the sea-water of those areas (produced,
perhaps, by the outburst of submarine springs highly charged with ferru
ginous silicates) which gives to them a capability that does not exert
itaelf elsewhere ; and this now seems yet more probable from the circum
          that, notwithstanding the vast extent over which the ' Challenger

brought       up from 98 and 150 fathoms in the region of the Agulhas
 Current and in one or two other localities.               It is a fact of peculiar in
 terest, moreover, that the calcareous shells should have here disappeared,
 just as they have done        in ordinary green sand          ;   and this, too, although
 the   depth was so small as altogether to forbid                the idea that their dis
 appearance is due to any solvent process brought about by the agencies
to which Prof. Wyville Thomson attributes the removal of the calcareous
 deposit generated by Globigerine          life.
     Now in the residue left after the decalcification of Capt. Spratt's dredg
 ings,   I  noticed a number of small particles of red clay, some of them pre
 senting     no definite  shape,   whilst others approximated sufficiently closely

                                                        " internal casts" to induce me
 to surmise that these also had been originally deposited in the chambers
  of Foraminifera     — their    material being probably very nearly the same,
     * Of these  I hope to be able, ere long, to giye a detailed account, in illustration of
 the similar   models of the animal of Eozoon obtained by the decalcification of its ser

          I
origin, should       be   disposed to  extend     the   same    view to the red clay of
the 'Challenger' soundings; for a strong a priori improbability in the
                                   " ash " of the shells themselves is created
supposition that this is the                                                          by
the fact that we have no knowledge (so far as               I   am aware) of the pre
sence of any such ash in calcareous organisms of similar grade.                    It is
certainly not proved by the analyses of Globigerina-ooze quoted by Prof.
Wyville Thomson         ; since this (supposing       it to be free from any extrane
ous admixture) may have contained many shells partially or completely
filled with such deposit.        The only analysis that could prove it would
be that either of shells of floating Globigerince, which may be presumed
to be alive, or of those found in the surface-layer of the Globigerina-ooie,
which (whether living or dead) have their chambers filled with sarcode.
    I submit, then, that if the red clay is (as           I  am disposed to believe) a
derivative of the Globigerina-oaze, its production is more probably due to
 a post mortem deposit in the chambers of the Foraminifera than to the
 appropriation of its material by the living animals in the formation of
their shells. That deposit may have had the character, in the first in
 stance, of either the green or the ochreous silicate of alumina and iron,
 which constitutes the material of the internal casts, and may have been
 subsequently changed in its character by a metamorphic action analogous
 to that which changes felspar into clay.             That the presence of an excess
 of carbonic    acid would have an important share in such a metamorphosis
 appears from the fact, long since brought into notice by Sir Charles Lyell*,
 of the disintegration of the granite in Auvergne and of the gneiss in the
 alluvial plains of the Po where subject to its influence.                And the same
 agency (especially when operating under great pressure) would be fully
 competent to effect the removal of the calcareous shells, as was distinctly
 pointed out nearly thirty years ago by Prof. W. C. Williamson in his clas
 sical Memoir on the Microscopic Organisms of the Levant Mudt. This
 seems to me the most probable mode of accounting for their disappear
 ance from a deep-sea deposit, where no mechanical cause can be invoked.
 But in shallow er waters, where the          same excess of carbonic acid does not
 exist, and the aid of pressure is wanting, but where a movement of water
 over the bottom is produced by tides and currents,                I am disposed rather
 to attribute the disappearance of the shells to mechanical abrasion,
 having noticed, in Capt. Spratt's jEgean dredgings, that many of the
 shells were worn so thin that the coloured mineral deposit in their in
 terior could be seen through them — which was, in fact, what first drew
 my attention to its presence. This is the explanation                 I  should be dis
 posed to give of the disappearance of the shells from the green sand
                         '

    The 'Challenger' left Port Nicholson on the 7th of July, 1874, and
proceeded under sail along the east coast of New Zealand.                   On the 8th
we rounded and trawled in 1100 fathoms, lat. 40° 13' S., long. 177° 43'
E., with a bottom-temperature of 2° C. and a bottom of soft greenish
ooze.     Many animals were brought up by this trawl resembling closely
those which we had taken at a corresponding depth in other portions of
the southern sea.         On the 10th we again trawled and sounded in 700
fathoms about 40 miles to the east of East Cape.
    We then continued our course northwards towards the Kermadec
 Islands, and on the 14th we took our usual series of observations mid
 way between Macauley and Raoul Islands in the Kermadec group.                       At
this station we trawled at a depth of 630 fathoms ; and we were greatly
 struck with the general resemblance between the assemblage of animal
 forms brought up in the trawl and the results of a good haul in about
 the same depth off the coast of Portugal or North Africa.                  Among the
 more interesting objects were a very large and splendid specimen of a
 Hexactinellid sponge allied to Poliopogon, several other fine sponges
 referred to the same group, and three or four examples of two species of
 Pentacrinus new to science, resembling generally P. asteria, L., from the
 Antilles.     We trawled on the following day in 600 fathoms, 45 miles to
 the north of Raoul Island, with nearly equal success. On the evening of
 Sunday the 19th we arrived at Tongatabu and called on the principal
 missionary, Mr. Baker, from whom we received every possible attention
 during our short stay. After spending two days in visiting different
 parts of the island, we left Tongatabu on the 22nd of July, and after
 taking a few hauls of the dredge in shallow water we proceeded towards
 Kandavu in the Fijis. On the 24th we stopped off Matuku Island and
 landed a party of surveyors and naturalists ; and while they were taking

 referred to, he indicated the probability " that many of our European Greensands,
 and other siliceous strata, however barren of such structures they appear, may
 hare once contained multitudes of calcareous microscopic organisms, some of which
 hare been removed qfter the consolidation of the strata, leaving either hollow casts, or
 having had the cavities subsequently filled with silica."

 observations   and exploring on shore we trawled in 300 fathoms, and
 procured among other things a fine specimen of the Pearly Nautilus
 (Nautilus pompilius), which we kept living in a tub for some time in
 order to observe its movements and attitudes.
    On Saturday, the 25th of July, we arrived at Kandavu, on the 28th we
 went to Levuka, and on the 3rd of August we returned to Kandavu,
 where we remained until the 10th.
    At Fiji the civilian staff were occupied in examining the reefs and
 generally in observing the natural history of the islands ; and in this we
 received all friendly assistance from H.M. Consul Mr. Layard and from
 Mr. Thurston, minister of King Cacobau. During our stay, a mixed
 party of naval and civilian officers went in the ship's barge to Mbaw and
 visited the king.
    Between New Zealand and the        Fiji group only two soundings were
 taken to a greater depth than 1000 fathoms.       Of these, one, at a depth
 of 1 100 fathoms off Cape Turnagain, New Zealand, gave a bottom of
 grey ooze and a bottom-temperature of 2° C. ; and the second, at 2900
 fathoms, lat. 25° 5' S., long. 172° 56' W., midway between the Kerma-
 decs and the Friendly Islands, gave
                                          " red clay " and a temperature of
 0°-5 C.    Four serial temperature-soundings were taken ; and the distri
bution of temperature was found to correspond, in its main features, with
what we had previously met with in oceans communicating freely with
 the Antarctic sea.
    The dredgings, which, with the exception of one near the New-Zealand
coast, were all at depths varying from 300 to 600 fathoms, yielded a
great number of very interesting forms ; but, as         I have already re
marked, they tended to confirm our impression that, even at these com
paratively moderate depths (at all depths, in fact, much greater than a
hundred fathoms), while species differ in different localities, and different
generic types are from time to time introduced,     the general character of
the fauna is everywhere very much the same.
    On the 10th of August we left Kandavu and proceeded towards Api,
one of the least known of' the New Hebrides, where there is as yet no
permanent missionary station.      On the 12th we sounded and trawled in
1350 fathoms, with a bottom of reddish ooze; we sounded again on the
15th in 1450 fathoms, with red clay; and on the 18th, after passing
through the channel between Makuru and Two-Hill Islands, we stopped
off Api in 25 fathoms, close to the edge of the reef and opposite a landing-
place.
   In   order to ensure, as far as we could, the good-will of the natives,
Captain Nares had given a passage to eleven Api men, who had been
employed for a three-years' term in Fiji, under the arrangement        which
exists there for the regulation of Polynesian labour. Two or three      of us,
with an armed party, took the returned labourers ashore ; and          as the
natives (although they appeared somewhat mistrustful and were all      armed

with clubs,     spears, and bows with sheaves of poisoned arrows) were
sufficiently friendly, nearly all the officers landed and spent a few hours
rambling about the shore. It was not thought prudent to go far into
the  forest, which was very dense and luxuriant and         came  close down to
the beach.
   The natives were almost entirely naked, and certainly bore a very
savage and forbidding aspect.            One of them was manifestly greatly
superior to the others, and appeared to exercise a considerable influence
over them.        He wore trowsers and a shirt and a felt hat, and could
speak   English    fairly. He recognized me, at once, as having seen me at
the sugar-plantation in Queensland, where he had been for the usual
three-years' engagement, and showed me, with great pride, a note from
his former employer, saying that the bearer was anxious to return to his
service, and that he would willingly pay his passage-money and all
expenses, in case of his being given a passage to Brisbane.           I had been
paving some attention to the South-Sea labour question, and had formed
a very strong opinion of the value to the inhabitants of these islands of
the opportunity given them, by this demand for labour, of testing their
capacity to enter into and mix with the general current of working men,
and thereby possibly avoid extermination ; and          I was greatly pleased to
see the   result in this instance.
   From the island of Api we shaped our course to the north-westward
towards Raine Island, m a breach of the great barrier reef not far from
the entrance of Torres Strait.         On the 19th of August we sounded, lat.
16° 47' S., long. 165° 20' E., at a depth of 2650 fathoms, with a bottom
of " red clay and a bottom-temperature of l°-7 C. (35° E.). A serial
                 "
temperature-sounding          was taken to the depth of 1500 fathoms ; and it
was found that the minimum temperature (l°-7 C.) was reached at a
depth of 1300 fathoms, and that consequently a stratum of water at that
uniform temperature extended from that depth to the bottom.
   Serial temperature-soundings          were taken on the 21st, the 24th, the
25th, the 27th, and the 28th of August in 2325, 2450, 2440, 2275, and
 1700 fathoms respectively ; and in each case the minimum temperature
of 1°•7 C. (or a temperature so near it as to leave the difference within
the limit of instrumental or personal error of observation) extended in a
uniform layer, averaging 7000 feet in thickness, from the depth of 1300
fathoms' to the bottom.
   It will be seen by reference       to the chart that on our course from Api
to Raine    Island   we   traversed  for a distance of 1400 miles a sea included
within a broken barrier, consisting of the continent of Australia to the
 west, the Louisiade archipelago, the Solomon Islands, and a small part
of New Guinea to the north, the New Hebrides to the east, and New
 Caledonia and the line of shoals and reefs which connect that island
with Australia to the south. The obvious explanation of this peculiar
 distribution of temperatures within this area, which we have called, for

convenience of reference, the
                                   " Melanesian Sea," is that there is no free
communication between this sea and the outer ocean to a greater depth
than 1300 fathoms, the encircling barrier being complete up to that
point.
    The  " Melanesian Sea " is in the belt of the S.E. trade-winds, and     the
general course of a drift-current which traverses its long axis, at an
average rate of half a knot an hour, is to the westward ; evaporation is,
as it is usually throughout the course of the trade-winds, greatly in
excess    of precipitation, so that  a large amount   of the surface-water is
removed.      This must, of course,  be replaced, and it is so by an indraught
of ocean-water over the lowest part of the barrier, at the proper tempera
ture for that depth.       We had previously found a temperature of l°-7 C.
at a depth   of  1300   fathoms  on the 16th, the 19th, and the 21st of June
between Australia and New Zealand, on the 1 7th of July in lat. 25° 5'
S., long. 172° 56' W., and earlier on the 10th of March in lat. 47° 25' S.
The bottom within the Melanesian Sea may be described generally as
" red clay," with a small but varying proportion of the shells of Foramini-
 fera, sometimes whole, but more usually much broken up and decomposed.
 In one or two soundings the tube showed curiously interstratified de
 posits, differing markedly in colour and in composition.        The trawl was
 sent down on the 25th of August to a depth of 2440 fathoms.                The
 animals procured were few in number — some spicules of Hyalonema, a
 dead example of Fungia symmetrica, two living specimens of a species of
  Umbelltelaria (which appears to differ in some respects from the Atlantic
 form), and a very fine and perfect Brisinga, also living. The existence of
 animal life is therefore not impossible in the still bottom-water of such
 an enclosed sea   ; but, as we have already seen in the Mediterranean, the
 conditions do not appear to be favourable to its development.          On the
 29th of August we trawled in 1400 fathoms, about 75 miles to the east
 of Raine Island, with somewhat greater success. This might have been
 anticipated, as the depth was not much greater than that at which the
 free interchange of water was taking place, and diffusion and intermix
 ture were no doubt much more rapid than at the bottom
    On the 31st of August we visited Raine Island, which we found to
 correspond in every respect to Jukes's description in the " Voyage of the
 '       "
   Fly.'     We observed and collected the species of birds which were
 breeding there.      In the afternoon we dredged off the island in 155
 fathoms, with small success, and proceeded towards Port Albany, Cape
 York, where we arrived on the 1st of September.
    We left Somerset on the 8th, and proceeded across the Arafura Sea
 to the Aru Islands, reaching Dobbo. on the island of Wamma, on the 16th.
 We found no depth in the Arafura Sea greater than 50 fathoms, and the
 average depth was from 25 to 30 fathoms.          The bottom was a greenish
 mud, due apparently to a great degree to the deposit from the great
 rivers of New Guinea and the rivers falling into the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Animal life was not abundant.         Many of the animals seemed dwarfed,
and    the fauna had somewhat       the character   of that of a harbour or
estuary. The specific gravity of the surface-water was unusually low,
falling on the 23rd, off Dobbo Harbour, to 1-02505, the temperature
reduced to 15°-5 C., distilled water at 4° C. =1.
    After spending a few days shooting Paradise-birds and getting an
idea of the natural history of the island of Wokaw, we left Dobbo on
the 23rd and proceeded to Ke Doulan, the principal village in the K.6
group. We then went on to the island of Banda, where we remained a
couple of days, and thence to Amboina, which we reached on the 4th of
 October.
    On the 26th of September, after leaving the Ke Islands, we sounded
 and trawled in 129 fathoms.       The trawl brought up a wonderful assem
blage of things, including, with a large number of Mollusca, Crustacea,
 and Echinoderms of more ordinary forms, several fine examples of unde-
 scribed hexactinellid sponges, and several very perfect specimens of two
 new species of Pentacrinus.      Temperature-soundings     were taken on the
 28th of September and on the 3rd of October, at depths of 2800 and
 1420 fathoms respectively   ; and on both occasions the minimum tempera
 ture (3° C.) was reached at a depth of 900 fathoms, indicating that the
 lowest part of a barrier inclosing the Banda Sea, bounded by Taliabo,
 Buru, and Ceram on the north, the Aru Islands on the east, Timor and
 the Salwatty Islands on the south, and Celebes and the shoals of the
 Flores Sea on the west, is 900 fathoms beneath the surface.
    From Amboina we went to Ternate, and thence across the Molucca
 passage into the Celebes Sea, by the passage between Bejaren Island
 and the north-east point of Celebes.      On the 13th, we trawled and took
 serial temperatures  near  Great   Tawallie  Island. The trawl brought up
 several specimens of a very elegant stalked halichondroid sponge new to
 science, and the thermometer gave temperatures sinking normally to a
 bottom-temperature of 2°-04 C.        On the following day we sounded in
  1200 fathoms, with again a normal bottom-temperature of l°-9 C. It
 seems, therefore, that the Molucca passage communicates freely with the
 outer ocean ; it does so at all events to the depth of 1200 fathoms, and
 most probably to the bottom, if it include greater depths.
     In the Celebes Sea we had two deep soundings — on the 20th, to 2150
 fathoms, and on the 22nd, to 2600 fathoms.          On both occasions serial
 temperature-soundings were taken, and on both the minimum tempera
 ture of 3°-7 C. (38°-7 F.) was reached at 700 fathoms.          A passage of
  this depth  into  the Celebes   Sea  is therefore  indicated, very probably
  from the Molucca passage.         This temperature corresponds almost
 exactly   with  that taken   by Captain Chimmo in the same area. We
 trawled on the 20th ; and although the number of specimens procured

 the usual deep-sea fauna.

    We reached Zamboanga on the 23rd, and on the 26th we passed into
the Sulu Sea and trawled at a depth of 102 fathoms.            On the 27th we
sounded to 2550 fathoms, and took a serial temperature-sounding.              A
minimum temperature of 10° C. was found at 400 fathoms ; so that the
Sulu Sea must be regarded as the fourth of this singular succession of
basins, cut off by barriers of varying height from communication with
the ocean.      This observation in the main confirmed those of Captain
Chimmo in the same locality.           The minimum temperature reached was
the same in both, but we appear to have found it at a somewhat higher
 level.
    We arrived      at Ilo Do on the 28th, and proceeded by the eastern
passage to    Manilla,   which we reached on the 4th of November.
    The collections have been packed and catalogued in the usual way,
and will be sent home from Hong Kong.             We have had an opportunity
during this cruise of making a very large number of observations of great
interest.    I believe   I may say that the departments under my charge are
going on    in a very satisfactory    way.

        I. " On    the Structure and Development of Myriothela."
         By  Prof. Allman, F.R.S. Received February 5, 1875.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The   endoderm    of the body is composed of numerous layers of large
spherical cells composed of clear protoplasm, enclosing a nucleus with
some brown granules «nd refringent corpuscles.             Externally it is con
tinued in an altered form into the tentacles, while internally it forms
long thick villus-like process^ which project into the cavity of the body.
Towards the free ends of these processes there are abundantly deve
loped among the large clearer cells, smaller, easily isolated spherical cells,
filled with opaque brown granules.            Where the endoderm passes into
the tentacles   it loses its large clear-celled condition, and consists of small
round cells, so loaded with opaque granules that the axis of the tentacle
appears nearly white under reflected light.
    The free surface of the endoderm carries, at intervals, long, very slender,
sluggishly vibrating cilia, and is overlaid by a thin layer of homogeneous
protoplasm, which on the villus-like processes becomes especially distinct,

  and which here develops minute mutable pseudopodia, which are being con
  stantly projected and       withdrawn. Indeed the vibratile cilia appear to be
  but a   modification of these pseudopodial processes of protoplasm.
     Interposed between the endoderm and the ectoderm is the fibrillated
  layer.    It is  extremely well developed, and consists of longitudinal mus
  cular fibrillae,   closely adherent to the outer surface of a structureless
 hyaline      membrane — the      " Stiitzlamelle" of Reichert.     The fibrillated
 layer, with ita supporting       membrane, is so strong as to remain entire in
 a section of the animal after the tissues on both sides of it have been
 broken down.
     The ectoderm is composed        of two zones, a superficial and a deep. The
 superficial    zone consists mainly of two or three layers of small round
 cells   containing yellowish granules.        Among these cells the thread-cells
 may    be seen,    lying chiefly near the outer surface of the body. Two
 forms of thread-cells       may be here distinguished — one ovate, with the in-
 vaginated     tube occupying the axis ; the other fusiform, with the invagi-
 nated tube oblique.
     The deeper zone       of the ectoderm consists of a very remarkable tissue,
 composed      of peculiar membraneless cells, each of which is prolonged into
 a  tail-like process, so that the cells assume a claviform shape.         In most
 situations, where this tissue is developed, the processes from several such
 ceDs unite with one another, so as to form branching, somewhat botrylli-
 form groups,       whose common stalk can be followed into the fibrillated
 layer.     The author is thus enabled so far to confirm the observations of
 Kleinenberg on cells of apparently the same significance in Hydra.               In
 Myriothela, however, these cells do not, as in Hydra, reach the surface.
 With the exception, apparently, of their condition in the transitory arms
 of the Actinula or locomotive embryo, they form everywhere a deep zone
 interposed      between the muscular       layer and the superficial layer of the
 ectoderm.        This zone is designated by the author as the zone of
.chviform tissue. Though it is in intimate association with the fibril
 lated layer, the author did not succeed in tracing a direct continuity of
 the individual fibrillae with the processes of the cells, as described by
 Kleinenberg in Hydra.
     The author adopts, as a probable hypothesis, the views of Kleinenberg
  respecting the caudate cells of Hydra, which he regards as representing
 a nervous system.         "While the deep layer of ectodermal cells in Myriothela
  would thus constitute a nervous layer, the superficial layer would repre
  sent an epidermis ; and since recent researches justify us in regarding
  the ectoderm and endoderm of the Ccelenterata as respectively repre
  senting in a permanent condition the upper and lower leaf of the blas
  toderm     in the development of the higher animals, we should thus find
  Myriothela offering no exception to the general law, which derives both
   epidermic and nervous tissues from the upper leaf of the blastoderm.
      The structure of the tentacles is in the highest degree interesting.         In
                                                                      x2

their narrow stalk-like portion, the condition of the endoderm departs
widely from that of this tissue in the tentacles of other marine hydroids ;
for it pcesents no trace of the septate disposition so well marked in these.
It is, on the contrary, composed of a layer of small cells loaded with
opaque granules and surrounding a continuous wide axile cavity.
   It is, however, in the terminal capitulum of the tentacle that the
structure of these organs departs most widely from any thing that has
as yet been recognized in the tentacles of other hydroids. Here  very               a
peculiar tissue isdeveloped between the muscular layer and the proper
ectoderm, where     takes the place of the zone of claviform tissue.
                     it                                                                 It

of the tentacle, and      composed of closely applied exceedingly slender

prisms, with their inner ends resting on the muscular lamella, to which,
the prisms are perpendicular, the whole structure forcibly suggesting the
rod-like tissue associated with special sense-apparatus in higher animals.
It appears to be but modification of the tissue which elsewhere forms

   Extending in radiating direction from the convex surface of this rod-
                a
like tissue, towards the external surface ef the tentacle, may be seen
numerous firm filaments, each of which, making its way among the
cells of the ectoderm, terminates distally in      a very delicate transparent
oviform sac, which carries, near its distal end,            minute styliform
            Within this sac, and completely filling    it,   is a

with firm transparent walls, and having immersed in its clear refringent

Under pressure, the contained cord may be sometimes forced out through
the smaller or distal end of the capsule.       Notwithstandmg the obvious
resemblance of these bodies    to thread-cells, their significance     withoutis,
doubt, something entirely different.      Indeed their resemblance to the
Pacinian bodies of Vertebrata       too strong to be overlooked.
                                    is                                Their as

 to assign to them, with certainty, their exact function, we feel compelled
to regard the whole system, including the bacillar tissue to which their
 stalks can be traced (and which      only
                                     is        locally modified portion of the

nervous zone, or zone of claviform tissue), as an apparatus of sense. It
 would almost seem to represent form of sense-organ, in which sight and
                                     a
 touch show themselves in one of their earliest phylogenetic stages, in which
they have not yet become fully differentiated from one another.          This           is
 the only known instance of the existence in       hydriod trophosome of any
                                                   a
thing which may with fair reason be regarded as special apparatus of sense.

    The male and female sporosacs are borne by the same trophosome.
    The generative elements, whether male or female, originate in a special
cavity (gonogenetic chamber), which       is formed in the substance of the
endoderm of the sporosac.

    In the female, the primitive plasma becomes gradually differentiated
 into a multitude of cell-like bodies having all the characters of true ova
 with their germinal vesicle and spot.       They are entirely destitute of
 enveloping membrane.
   These bodies next begin to coalesce with one another into numerous
 roundish masses of protoplasm, which develop over their surface minute
 pseudopodial retractile processes.
   The masses thus formed still further coalesce with one another ; and
 there results a single spheroidal plasma mass, through which are dis
persed numerous small spherical vesicles, mostly provided with a nucleus.
 These vesicles appear to be nothing more than the nucleolated nuclei of
the coalesced ovum-like cells.
   About the time of the completion of this last coalescence, the resulting
plasma mass, enveloped in an external, very delicate, structureless mem
brane, is expelled, by the contraction of the sporosac, through an aper
ture formed by rupture in its summit.
   Immediately after its expulsion, it is seized, in a manner which for
cibly suggests the supposed action of the Fallopian tube on the mammalian
ovum at the moment of its escape from the Graaffian follicle, by the
sucker-like extremities of certain remarkable bodies, to which the author
gave the name of elaspers, which are developed among the blastostyles,
and resemble long filiform and very contractile tentacles.
   It is apparently now that fecundation is effected ; for the plasma be
comes again resolved into a multitude of roundish masses.          This phe
nomenon may be regarded as representing the yelk-cleavage of an
ordinary ovum. Reasons are assigned for believing that it is through the
agency of the elaspers that fecundation takes place ; and the elaspers are
compared to the hectocotylus of Cephalopods, and to certain organs by
which fecundation    is effected among the Alga.
   The mulberry-like mass thus formed, surrounded by its structureless
membrane, which has now acquired considerable thickness and forms a
firm capsule, continues to be held in the grasp of the elaspers during cer
tain subsequent stages of its development.        An endoderm and ectoderm
with a true multicellular structure become differentiated, a central cavity
is formed by excavation, and the germ becomes thus converted into a
spheroidal non-ciliated Planula.      This, after acquiring certain external
appendages,    ultimately  escapes, by the rupture of the capsule, as a free
actinuloid embryo.
   The actinuloid, on its escape from its capsule, is provided not only
with the long arms already noticed by Cocks and Alder, but with short
 scattered clavate tentacles.   The short clavate tentacles become the per
manent tentacles of the fully developed hydroid ; the long arms, on the
other hand, are purely embryonic and transitory.
    The long embryonic arms originate in the spheroidal Planula.        They
 are formed by a true invagination, and at      first grow inwards  into  the

body-cavity   of the Planula.    It  is only just before the escape of the
actinuloid from its capsule that they evaginate themselves aud become
external.
   After enjoying its free existence for one or two days, during which
it moves about by the aid of its long arms, the embryo fixes itself by
its proximal end, the long arms gradually disappear, the short permanent
tentacles increase in number, and the essential form of the adult is soon
acquired.

      December 9, 1874, observed on the Himalaya Mountains,
      Mussoorie, at May-Villa Station, Lat. 30° 28' N., Long.
      78° 8* E., Height above Sea 6765 feet."— Note No. I.                   By
      J. B. N. Hennessey, F.R.A.S. Communicated by Prof.
      Stokes, D.C.L., Sec. R.S. Received January 2, 1875.
                                                May Villa, 9th December, 1874.
    Naturally sharing in the great interest excited by the transit of Venus,
 which occurred this forenoon, 1 proposed that     I should   observe the event
 with the equatoreal of the Royal Society, which Gapt. J. Herschel, R.E.,
in his absence from India, had temporarily placed at my disposal ; and the
project meeting with liberal support from Col. J. T. Walker, R.E.,
 Superintendent, Great Trigonometrical Survey of India,         I  was enabled,
through his kindness, to provide myself with four chronometers, a good
altazimuth, a barometer, thermometers, and other articles of equipment
necessary for the undertaking.      My especial object in view was to observe
the transit from a considerable height • and this condition was easily
 secured through the circumstance that    I was located only 14 miles from
 Mussoorie, on the Himalaya Mountains.         No doubt a station on these
mountains would be very liable to an envelope of mist and cloud at the
time of year in question ; but, on the other hand, were really good weather
to prevail, I  should enjoy the advantages of an exquisitely clear atmo
sphere, such as   I have never experienced save on the Himalayas.           Add
to this, the journey, as already stated, was merely an ordinary ride, the
necessary equipment for my purpose was at hand, and though failure
would involve a waste of no inconsiderable preliminary labour, this latter
I  was willing to incur if need be.                  I
                                      Arguing thus, selected a station some
6500 feet above the sea, and proceeded to find my latitude, longitude, and
height, to observe for time, and to rate my chronometers. My numerical
results will be communicated very shortly in a second note. The remarks
here made are restricted chiefly to what    I saw with the equatoreal.
   The telescope of the equatoreal has a 5-inch object-glass, with about
60 inches focal length, and is driven by an excellent clock.       The eye-end
may be fitted at will with an eyepiece of 55, 85, 125, 200, or 300 power,

  1875.]               Transit of Venus across the Sun.                    255
  or -with a spectroscope mounting     a single  simple prism. The polar axis
  may be shifted for latitude.        The equatoreal was set up and adjusted
 in an observatory-tent, of which the canvas top was removed during
 observation.
     I  found from actual trial that the most suitable eyepiece for both
 ingress (sun's altitude 2° 24' to 7° 29') and egress (sun's altitude about
 26°) was that of 125 power ; accordingly this eyepiece alone was employed
 at the contacts.    It was, however, impossible to adopt the same dark glass
 for both the higher and lower altitudes, without sacrificing definition on
 one of the two occasions.                     I
                               Accordingly selected for ingress two glasses
 which, combined, gave a neutral or bluish field ; and for egress   I changed
 one of these for a deep-red glass, so that the field now presented a mode
 rately deep red. The glasses were quite flat, and lay against one another
 in intimate contact, giving excellent definition.       I may here add that,
 thanks to Manrakan, artificer, GL T. Survey, the clock behaved with per
 fect regularity ; nor was there the smallest instrumental disappointment
 throughout the work.      As regards procedure during transit, my friend
 Mr.   "W". H. Cole, MA.., counted seconds audibly from the journeyman
 chronometer    placed before him   ;  while Baboo Cally Mohun Ghose, com
 puter, took up a position by my side, noting down such remarks as the
 phenomena, viewed through the equatoreal, elicited from me. Nor, as
 we stood informed, were the events to be recorded few in number. At,
for instance, ingress, internal contact, the light between the cusps was
to vary suddenly ; the cusps were to meet. Then came " the pear-drop,"
" the ligament ; " what should be its length, what its breadth in terms of
Venus's diameter, what its shape? when would it break? and, lastly, which
of the known descriptions would it resemble ? Primed on these points,
we settled on a programme which should include them all, and time after
time we went through the necessary rehearsals for perfecting ourselves in
our parts.     So much for what we had to expect, and now for a few words
on the weather.
    I  moved up to my mountain-station on the afternoon of December 1.
The day following     I was busy fixing my station, adjusting instruments,
Ac. Up to this the sky had been sufficiently clear ; but from the 3rd
there set in an alternation of weather, which, without running into
extremes, kept me in a state of miserable suspense, to say nothing of the
additional watching and toil in observing for time. This state of affairs
appeared drawing to a climax, when the 8th December arrived, and the
clouds looked blacker, while the mist, which generally precedes snowfalls
here, began as usual to settle down on the internal and still more lofty
ranges of hills. About 2 p.m. on this day there were a few drops of rain
or sleet, so few that they might almost have been counted ; and later on,
as the sun began to set, the heavy cumuli evolved themselves      into strati,
which, spreading their even canopy over us, left something like decimal 0
of sky visible ; and this at 10 o'clock at night ! At 4 next morning, Dec. 9,

when again reported on, the sky was without speck or cloud ; the air was
 still, and so clear, so brilliantly clear, that even the most exacting of
 observers could not have desired more favourable circumstances for view

 ing the coming transit. In brief, enjoyed most exquisitely clear weather
 during my observations — such weather as occurs not frequently even at
 Mussoorie.
     I  now proceed to describe the phenomena of the transit. In doing so
 I  shall have occasion to speak of Venus as she appeared across the sun's
 limb, when one portion of her own limb is seen against the sun, and the
 other remains against the sky.                                 I
                                       The former portion shall call Venus's
sun-limb, or Vn, the latter Venus's sky-limb, or Vk.                   I
                                                              Again, shall require
 to mention a ring of light around Vk, which          I  shall indicate by 1^, the
 corresponding ring     around    Vn being  understood    by L.. Another point is
 this : any one who has watched, say the sun's limb, especially at a low
altitude and with high power, must be aware of the turmoil or ebullition
which there appears, very much as if the limb was being boiled.               I shall
 denote this kind of turmoil by " boiling."
     Ingress. — With the telescope well and carefully adjusted for focus,           I
 watched for the coming first external contact, but to no purpose ; for             I
 did not detect Venus's limb until after it had made an indentation on the
 sun's limb.     The latter boiled sensibly, but by no means violently. It
appeared jagged, and as if with minute spikes projecting inwards, all of
which were well defined in the bluish field. Watching V„ found it also I
boiling slightly, but in a manner somewhat different to the sun's limb.
The appearance was that of boiling vapour coming round from the face of
Venus, turned towards the sun and overlapping V„ ; moreover this boil
ing was not restricted to the edge of V„, but extended 2" or 3" beyond,
thus forming a kind of boiling annul us*, in which there were minute
sparkling specks dancing and shifting about, appearing and disappearing ;
the edge V, was seen through the boiling.           So much for that portion of
Venus seen against the sun.
    Ingress (continued). — At 8| minutes before the first internal contact
took place,    I happened to look closely into the spot where that part of
Venus against the sky lay ; and, to my great surprise,            I  found that this
portion of her disk was easily visible, because it was edged by a narrow
                                    I
ring of light, or 1^. At first saw 1^ for only about 10° or 15° on either
side of the point where the chord of Venus's track would cut Vk — or, more
definitely stated, this light-ring did not reach either way to the sun's
limb ; but within the next 50*       I saw the ring distinctly round the whole
sector of Vk, from edge to edge of the sun's limb, as shown in the rough
sketch t accompanying.        The light-ring was only moderately bright, like
   * This cannot be shown in the sketch accompanying, for its presence became visible
cbiefly through the movements taking place.
       I
   t must apologize for the roughness of my sketch.    I  am, however, writing against
time to catch the outgoing mail ; and of drawing-materials  I possess nothing more at

diffused   light   ;   and at first   I estimated          this annul us at 3" in breadth.    It
was probably brightest about the                 point where the chord      above named cut

    The annular ring of light could be distinguished, in continuation, around the limb
          on the sun; but as this continuation was rendered visible chiefly by the
          movements taking place in        it,        is

the bright edge (1^) transited across the sun's limb. Of course this latter
estimate was based on recollection of the width of Lk, and not on any
visible fact  ;    for   as 1^ came on the sun's disk, the lesser          light of the former
merged into the greater light of the latter. On the whole,                      I   am of opi

258                     On the Transit of Venus across the Sun.                   [Feb.   11,
but   I watched for any such event in vain. Venus glided resolutely on
wards, and the streak of light she was leaving behind grew wider and still
wider, until at last, when a belt of light representing 10 or 15 minutes lay
between her and the sun's limb,                 I
                                       exclaimed (and                 I
                                                           believe much to the
disappointment   of  all concerned), "  there is no pear-drop and no ligament."
We watched Venus for some half an hour after this, and then turned to
the spectroscope.
   The Spectroscope.        —The            of spectroscope for eyepiece cannot
                                       substitution
be effected in this instrument without a considerable amount of adjust
ment.     •When this had been performed, and we had taken a hasty break
fast,  Ifirst placed the slit across the centre of Venus's disk, and found that
it gave a black band all along the length of the bright solar spectrum,
». e. Venus's face turned to us reflected no light.                   I
                                                           next placed the slit
tangential to Venus's disk.      This gave a faint glimmer of narrow light in
place of the black band, t. e. this glimmer was slightly brighter than the
solar spectrum on which it appeared.                       I
                                               looked intently for Venus's air
lines ; but, so far as the feeble dispersion of the prism would show, the
lines seen across the glimmer from Venus's edge were identical in all
respects with the solar lines.              I
                                      repeated these experiments as long as
time permitted, and then, with artificer Manrakan's help, reverted
to the adjustments for mounting the eye-end and eyepiece employed at
ingress.     As already stated, it was now necessary to substitute a dark-
red glass in place of one of those used at ingress.
   Egress. — The field now was red, and, if any thing, slightly too dark to
show faint light ; the definition was intensely sharp.        Again    watched    I
with the utmost care as Venus approached her second internal contact ;
but neither pear-drop           nor ligament, nor any other connexion or shadow,
appeared between her limb and that           of the sun, until at last the two fairly
touched*.         Of course       I
                        again looked for the light- ring around Venus's
sky-limb      ;   and   I certainly
                         saw                it,
                                 though faintly, 5m after the above con
tact.  Some time later, when   once more searched for the light-ring, it
                                         I
was invisible, nor did        I       again see     it,   nor yet the disk of Venus, against
the sky.
   Before concluding this note,   take the liberty of adding
                                          I                   few words,      a
of no little importance, from the only letter on the transit which has as
yet reached me.   It from Colonel Walker, who was at Dehra Doon,

the valley below, some 10 miles south of my position, and at a height                      of
about 2200 feet.    He observed the phenomena of the transit with                           a
very tolerable telescope, by Solomons      believe), of,  fancy, some

     (1) In view of the light-ring 1^, and of the peculiar boiling annulus
  around Vn, which may be called L„,        I  have no doubt that L„ was, in fact,
  a continuation of the light-ring L*, which latter, beyond all question, was
 plainly visible;     and   under these circumstances      it may  be urged that
  Venus is surrounded by an atmosphere which at the time was made visible
  to the extent of 2" to under 4" in breadth.
     (2) As a matter of fact, the pear-drop and the ligament were visible at a
 height of 2200 feet, but at 6500 feet the ligament was invisible.             The
 influence generally of height of station, from this evidence, appears unde
 niable ; but the phenomenon still remains to be accounted for definitely.
 If, however, an effective atmosphere of x breadth around Venus be con
 ceded, this atmosphere may be supposed to stop a certain amount of
 direct light from the sun, producing a slight shade around Venus corre
 sponding to the breadth x. This shade would,           I conceive, be quite invi
 sible when its outer edge is backed by the sun's bright light ; but could
 we contract the sun to a diameter equal to that of Venus plus twice x,
 and make Venus and the sun concentric, it appears likely that we should
 see a shaded annulus right round Venus between her limb and that of the
 sun ; further, that the annulus would appear darker at low than at
 higher altitudes, and would become invisible when the observer was
 raised   above a sufficiency of the earth's atmosphere.             Should these
 suggestions prove tenable, the ligament seen would break when the
 outer edge of the shade, corresponding to x, transited across the sun's
 limb.
    (3) Solar light shining through Venus's atmosphere, if any, produces
 no alteration in the lines of the solar spectrum, so far as the dispersion
 of a single simple prism can show.          Also Venus's face, turned towards
 us, reflects no light during transit, subject to the same instrumental test.

    After detection of the white lines 1650 and 1658 (Kirchhoffs scale) at
Mussoorie in November 1873,          I  discovered two other such lines before
leaving   that   station  of   observation,  viz. 2009 and 2068 (about).       On
 20th November, 1873,        I  packed up the spectroscope, taking particular
care that the prisms should not shift from the position                they then
occupied.
    On 28th November,          1873, I  set up the spectroscope    in the Dome
Observatory at Dehra, in the valley below,           the  prisms retaining their
former position, and my recollection of the white lines seen at Mussoorie

being still quite vivid.      I now found that 1650 and 1658 were distinctly
seen ; but they were no longer nearly of the pure white colour they pre
sented at the higher station, while what may be termed the gloss about
their whiteness, which induced me to describe them as resembling
" threads of white silk held in the light," had quite disappeared ; indeed
they were now so decidedly greenish as not to invite attention.        White
line 2068   I  now could hardly see, and 2009 was invisible, notwithstand
ing that  I  was quite familiar with the positions they occupied, and had
made careful notes on the subject.
   After this     I  released the prisms     and turned them about variously,
without producing        any alteration  in the white lines as they were now
seen.

    It appears that there is little difference between the physiological
 effects of the crotaline or viperine and the colubrine virus. The mode
in which death is brought about is essentially the same in all ; though
there* are evidences, even when allowing for individual peculiarities, that
the action is marked by some points of difference sufficiently characteristic
to require notice in detail.
    We have already expressed our belief that death is caused by the
cobra-, Daboia-, and Z/i/rfropAw-poison, 1st, through its action on the
cerebro-spinal nerve-centres, especially on the medulla, inducing paralysis
of respiration ; or 2nd, in some cases (where the poison has entered the
circulation in large quantities and has been conveyed more directly to the
heart) by arrest, tetanically in systole, of cardiac action, probably owing
to some action on the cardiac ganglia ; 3rd, by a combination of the two
previous causes ; 4th, by a septic condition of a secondary nature, and
which, being more essentially pathological in its bearings, the details were
not considered suitable for discussion here.
    There is reason to believe that death is caused in the same way by the
OotaZiw-poison also ; and it appears, from the experiments recently per
formed in Calcutta, by Dr. Ewart and the members of the Committee
appointed by Government, upon Psetidechis porphyriacus, or the black
snake, and Hoplocephalus curtus, or the tiger-snake of Australia, that
their  *virus causes death  in the same  manner.   These reptiles   had been
sent from Melbourne to Calcutta for the purpose of investigation and
comparison.      ( Vide Committee's Report, p. 58 et seq., Appendix.)
    But though the actual cause of death is essentially the same, the phe
nomena which precede and accompany it differ in some degree according
to the nature of the poison, the quantity and site of the inoculations,
and the individual peculiarities of the creature     inoculated,  as may be
seen in the experiments herewith recorded.
   The condition     of an animal poisoned by the rattlesnake-venom, then,
essentially resembles that of one subjected to the influence of the
colubrine or viperine poison of Indian snakes : —
   Depression, hurried respiration, exhaustion, lethargy, unconsciousness,
nausea, retching, and vomiting (vide experiment on cat, Exp. IX.).
   Muscular twitchings, ataxy, paralysis, and convulsions (the latter pro
bably chiefly, though not entirely, due to circulation of imperfectly oxy
genated blood, the result of impeded respiration), and, finally, death.

  1875.]                 Action of the Crotalus-poison, §c.                           263
     Hemorrhages or hemorrhagic extravasations and effusions, both local
 and general, occur in all varieties of snake-poisoning.
     But we observe (and in this our observations are in accord with those
  of Weir Mitchell) that there is a greater tendency to both local and
  general haemorrhage and extravasation of blood and of the colouring-
  matter of the blood, especially as observed in the peritoneum, intestines,
  and mesentery, and also probably to a more direct               action    on the cord
  (vide  Experiments     L, HI., V., VI., VII., IX., XI., XIV., XV.), than in
  poisoning by either cobra or viper (vide Experiments IV., VII., XIII.,
  XVI., XVLL, XX.).
     The viscera and other tissues, after death, are found congested and
  ecchymosed, and in some cases to a great extent, seeming to show that
  either a preternatural fluidity of blood or some important change in the
 vessels, favouring its exudation, has occurred.
     But with regard to the blood itself we have observed that              it does form
 a  coagulum after death, generally, if not invariably ; as we have noted to
 be the case, though not to the same extent, in the blood of animals that
 have succumbed to the Daboia-virna*.
     With reference to the coagulation or non-coagulation of the blood in
 cases   of snake-poisoning, we observe that the following conclusions have
 been arrived at by Mr. Bichards and the Calcutta Committee (vide p. 45
 of their Report).
     " We now propose to deal with the physical changes produced by
 snake-poisoning       on the blood.       From observations which have been made
 by Mr.     Eichards and ourselves, we have arrived at the following con
 clusions.
     "  The blood appears         remain                death under        circumstances
                               to          fluid after                the
 noted below: —
     "  1st. When a large quantity of the cobra-poison has been directly in
 jected into the circulation, as, for example, into an artery or a veint.
     " 2nd. In cases where animals or men have been poisoned by the bite
 of vipers, such     as the   Eussell's viper.
     " 3rd. In all   cases  of snake-bite, whether from the poisonous colubrine
 or viperine genera, in the human subject +.
     " The blood undergoes either partial or complete coagulation under the
following conditions : —
     " 1st. When a small quantity only of the cobra-poison has been
injected into a vein or an artery.
     "2nd. In cases where the lower animals have been bitten by the
 cobra.
     " Why     the admixture of a large and quickly fatal injection of the
 cobra-virus into the circulation of animals should produce comparatively

permanent fluidity of the blood or interfere with its ordinary coagulability
soon after removal from the body or after death, and why the injection
of a smaller and more slowly fatal quantity should interpose no obstacle
to its speedy coagulation, are questions extremely difficult to account for
or explain.     We can only state the fact that, in the one case, coagulation
occurs speedily, and in the other this coagulation is retarded or altogether
prevented by some cause at present unknown."
   The following experiments were made on the physiological action of the
virus of the rattlesnake, with the view of comparison with that of the
cobra and Daboia.
    We are indebted to Dr. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, for      a supply of
the virus.     He was good enough to send about six grains of the dried
poison   of  Crotalus — the species not named, but it is believed to be of
 Crotalus durissus.
    The dried poison supplied is said to be about 6£ years old, and was
dried in July or August at the natural temperature, and has since then
 been preserved in a phial.           It was tried by Dr. Mitchell and found
 active three years ago.
    It has the appearance of fractured         fragments of dried gum-arabic,
of rather    a darker    yellow colour, but otherwise    resembling   the dried
cobra-virus    sent from   Bengal.
                                    Experiment   I.
   June 9th,    1874. — *015    gramme of the dried CrotaZiw-poison diluted
with 1 cub. centim.     of  distilled water was hypodermically injected into
 the thigh of a full-grown guineapig at 11.30 a.m.
    Restlessness and muscular twitchings of the body generally soon com
 menced ; these passed away, but the animal became sluggish, in which
condition it remained all night, and died at about 9 A.M. the next
morning.
    The injected limb became much swollen, infiltrated, and discoloured
with sanguineo-serous effusion.
    The intestines were not ecchymosed ; there was much sanguinolent
fluid and also blood effused into the abdominal areolar tissue.
    No convulsions were observed ; but as the animal was not seen during
a  short  time previous to death, they cannot be said positively not to have
occurred; nor is it known if the heart ceased to beat at the moment when
apparent death took place.
                                    Experiment  II.
   A  few drops of watery solution of Crotalus--poison, of same strength,
were injected under the skin of a guineapig's thigh at 12.16, noon.
   12.17. Marked twitchings of head and hind legs, very similar to those
produced in some of the cases of cobra-poisoning.

  poison were      carefully weighed and diluted, each with ten drops of dis
  tilled   water.    Two full-grown guineapigs of equal weight were then
  selected.
      The solution   of  CVotaZus-poison  was injected into the peritoneal cavity
  of guineapig    No.   1 at 1.52 p.m.
      1.55.  Muscular twitchings of head and neck.
      2 P.H. Startings and twitchings continue.

 which occur at intervals of 5 or 6 seconds cause paiu.

     3.55. Dead in 2 hours and 3 minutes.
     3.56. Electrodes in cord cause twitching of muscles of the back, and
very     slightly in those of the legs : the cord was evidently all but para
lyzed. Muscular fibre contracts freely to direct stimulus of current.             The
intestines were ecchymosed and congested.              There were effusions of red
serum into the peritoneal cavity, and much ecchymosis of peritoneum
and subperitoneal and intra-muscular areolar tissue.                Peristaltic action
continued faintly.

 it continued to contract, especially the auricles, for part (not the whole)
 of the time.
    The blood removed from the heart-cavities and vena cava rapidly
formed a firm coagulum in a glass receiver.
    The electrodes applied to the sciatic showed that the nerve-trunk, as

    2.20. Electrodes     in cord.    Spinal cord and nerves paralyzed ; muscles
contract     freely  to direct   stimulus   of current.    Heart distended with
blood.      Blood, when removed, formed rapidly a firm coagulum.            Intes
tines, peritoneum, and subperitoneal areolar tissue congested and ecehy-
mosed. Sanguinolent effusions into peritoneum, but not so well marked
as in the CrotnZiw-poisoning.             Peristaltic action of bowels ceased
rapidly.

the cobra-poison is more energetic than that of the rattlesnake.              Both

succumbed in 20 minutes to the cobra-poison, while the other survived
the inoculation of the rattlesnake-poison for 2 hours and 3 minutes.

    Examined under the microscope nearly 2 hours after apparent death,
the white corpuscles appeared natural; the red corpuscles not in
rouleaux,    and very much crenated, though a few retained their natural
contour.
    The blood was natural to test-paper.

    Jane YJth, — \ of  a grain ('015 gramme) of dried cobra-poison, dissolved
 in 1 cub. centim. of water, was injected into the jugular vein of a large
 white rabbit, of the same size as in the previous experiment, at 2.55 p.m.
     The rabbit passed at once into violent convulsions, and was apparently
 dead before it could be removed from the board, within one minute. The
 cord was immediately exposed, artificial respiration having also been
 begun.    Electrodes applied, with strong current ; no reaction ; the cord
 was perfectly paralyzed.
     Thorax examined at 2.59.      Heart had ceased to contract.    Ventricles
 moderately contracted.       Auricles distended with blood. Phrenic irri
 tated, quite paralyzed.     Diaphragm, when directly irritated by current,
 contracts very faintly, whilst the neighbouring muscles contract vigo
 rously.   Peristaltic action goes on. Electrodes applied to vagus appear to
 accelerate peristaltic action ; applied to splanchnic, they diminish it.
     3.7. Ventricles of heart have now contracted firmly.
     3.15. Blood taken from heart and great vessels has coagulated, but
 not firmly.    The clot is small, and the serum very red.
     3.15. Electrodes to sciatic ; no reaction.       Blood examined under
 microscope ; no aggregation in rouleaux, no crenation of corpuscles.
 Blood neutral to test-paper.
     We have in former papers remarked that when the cobra-poison was
 injected into the jugular vein directly and caused almost immediate
 death, that the fatal result was due to cessation of the heart's action by
 arrest in systole, and such was partially the case in the last experiment
 (VII.), made for the purpose of comparison with Crotalus; but in
 experiment VI. death was not so caused, for the heart continued to
  contract for about 28 minutes after apparent death, which was probably
  due to the sudden and total annihilation of the functions of the
  medulla and cord, no reaction to a strong current occurring when the
  electrodes were applied immediately after apparent death.
     In this instance of CVoinZus-poisoning it is also to be remarked that the
  coagulability of the blood was destroyed, whilst in that by cobra-virus it
  was only partially so.
     It appears from the results of this experiment that the direct inocu
  lation of large doses of the virus, whether viperine or colubrine, into the

  circulation have the power in some cases of annihilating almost instanta
  neously the   irritability of the cord and medulla, as in others they have of
  arresting the heart's action.

congested and much ecchymosed.                 Deep red gelatinous effusion all
about the     roots   of  the lungs.    Heart contracting.     Electrodes applied to
phrenic caused vigorous contraction of diaphragm.
    2.50. Heart ceased to contract 3 minutes after respiration had ceased.
    2.52. Electrodes in cord ; do not cause contraction of limbs.
    2.54. The sciatic nerve, when irritated, conveys impressions; muscles of
legs contract.        Blood from the heart and great vessels did not form a
coagulum, and remained permanently                fluid. Red corpuscles of blood
were much crenated.
    Death in this case appeared to be caused through the medulla.

    Jutie 17th. — Found dead this morning early    ; pupils contracted.
    Electrodes applied ; no reaction  in either cord or nerves on either side
 to the st rongest current.
    The frog may have been dead     some hours.
                                Experiment   XI.
    June loth. — At 3 p.m. same day a solution of CrotaZu*-venom was
 injected into the dorsal lymph-sac of a frog, the aorta having been pre
viously ligatured, so as to prevent the poison from affecting the trunks
or peripheral extremities of the sciatic nerves.
    3.40. The frog seems quite unaffected.
    June 16th. — 12.30, noon. Frog dead ; not rigid ; mouth open.
    Irritation of cord with strongest current does not cause contraction of
legs. Irritation of sciatic with coil at 24 causes twitchings of gastro
cnemius.
    Neither of these two experiments give any definite results, as the
period intervening between death and examination of the condition of the
nerve-centres was not determined exactly.
    The results of the following experiments show that the local as well as
the general effect of the cobra- and CVoiaZiw-poisons, t. e. colubrine and
viperine, is to cause haemorrhage, ecchymosis, and sanguinolent effusions
into the areolar tissue, not only at the seat of inoculation and its neigh
bourhood, but also in the mucous membranes and other vascular parts.
It   is obvious also that the CrotaZiw-poison acts more energetically in
this respect than the cobra-poison, and that this is perhaps one of the
most marked distinctions between them.
                               Experiment   XII.
    August 6th, 1874. — A cat was chloralized, and part of the mesentery
placed under the microscope on the warm stage.          CrofaiZiw-poison, dilu
ted with water, was then applied to the mesentery, and it« effects watched.
The white corpuscles were observed to cling in quantities to the walls of
the vessels, and as the current of blood hurried through them, some masses
of pale matter, like aggregation of white corpuscles, were observed to
                                                                          pass

   place, and  to the naked eye the mesentery became discoloured by patches
   of ecchymosis in the course of the small blood-vessels, like the foliage on
   the branches   of a tree.
      There could be no doubt that the local action   of the poison had  a marked
  effect in producing extravasation of blood.
                                   Experiment  XIII.
     A similar experiment was repeated on another part of the mesentery
  of the same     cat with cobra-poison, exactly as the Ootaitw-poison         had
  been applied in the previous experiment.          This was carefully watched,
 but no extravasation        took place ; there was a marked difference in the
 result of the   application of the two poisons, at all events     as far as these
 two   experiments were concerned.
                                  Experiment   XIV.
    August 12th, 1874. — A cat was chloralized        at 2.30 p.m.     Mesentery
 exposed   and placed under microscope on warm stage.
     Oofaitw-poison applied to mesentery ; circulation soon diminished          in
 some vessels    but continued vigorously in others. Isolated extravasated
 patches soon made their appearance of a triangular form, others followed
 and coalesced with these until a network was formed in the course of the
 vessels all over the field.    The extravasation soon became general, the cir
culation still continuing slowly.
                                   Experiment  XV.
    A fresh portion of mesentery of          same  cat exposed.    Intestines  be
coming cold and       circulation now very languid.
    Cobra-poison applied.
    No apparent effect produced; but the circulation is very languid,
indeed has almost ceased, so that the results of this experiment are not
conclusive.
                                  Experiment   XIV.
    August 14th,     1874. — A   cat was chloralized, part of mesentery with
drawn, and placed under microscope on warm stage.
    Dried cobras-poison dissolved in a salt solution, '75 per cent., applied to
the mesentery at 4.10 p.m.
    4.14. Circulation is languid, almost ceased in some vessels.
    4.18. Slight extravasation taking place where the poison has been           in
contact.
    4.20. Extravasation rather more obvious.

the circulation before applying the poison.         Blood flowing languidly.

movement      of the blood.

      Another portion of the same mesentery had cobra-poison applied, but
   after half an hour there was no sign of extravasation.
                                  Experiment   XYIII.
      A fresh piece of mesentery exposed of       same cat, and diluted Crotalus-
  poison    applied at 4.52  p.m.
      The circulation was rather languid at the time, and apparently became
  more languid.
      At 4.58 no extravasation had taken place, the blood flowing very lan
  guidly.
      5.15. Circulation still going on, but very slowly    ; no extravasation  ; it
  soon after ceased.
                                   Experiment   XIX.
     At 5.20    p.m. a fresh portion of the mesentery was exposed ; to one
  part  cobra-  and to the other CVotaZus-poison was applied, and the effect
  was watched with the naked eye.
     5.45.   No extravasation visible.
     At 6.15 P.M. slight extravasation equally visible on both.
                                   Experiment   XX.
     August 25th, 1874. — At 2 p.m. a young cat was chloralized.         The me
 sentery was drawn out and a part treated with cobra-poison, another part
 with CrotaZiw-poison.
     At 5 p.m. On examination, that under the influence of the Crotalus-
 poison was found deeply congested and reddened with blood, extravasated
 in the course of the small vessels, forming a well-marked redness to the
 naked eye. Under the microscope the red corpuscles were seen in numbers
outside the vessels.       Circulation still going on vigorously.      That part
treated with cobra-poison       was   barely altered, but, on close examination,
slight patches of extravasation were seen in the course of the vessels.
    The difference was well marked between the two — the extravasation
produced by Crotahis-\euom           being well marked, that by cobra-venom
scarcely perceptible.      In both cases the microscope showed red corpuscles
outside the vessels.
    These experiments show that CrotaZi«-poison causes haemorrhage            and
hemorrhagic effusions more than the cobra-poison does.

                    Influence of Cobra-poison on Ciliary Action.
     June 29th, 1874. — Ciliated epithelium from the frog's mouth was treated
  with a solution of cobra-poison and examined under the microscope.
     At 1.35 p.m., when examined, the action of the cilia was vigorous.
     At 1.45 it was much, diminished.
     At 1.55 it had entirely    ceased.
                                 Experiment   XXII.
    Ciliated epithelium placed under microscope ; one part was treated with
 water, the other with the poisoned solution.
    At 2.10 p.m. ciliary motion vigorous in both, perhaps more so in that
 subjected to the poisoned solution.
    2.18.  Non-poisoned cilia active. Poisoned cilia very feeble.
    2.20. Non-poisoned cilia still active.       Poisoned cilia very feeble.
    2.24. Non-poisoned cilia active.        Poisoned cilia very languid.
    2.30. Non-poisoned cilia still active.          Poisoned cilia have entirely
ceased to act.
   It is evident from this that the poison first stimulates and then destroys
the   activity of the ciliary action.
                                 Experiment   XXIII.
    August 14th. — Frog's blood placed in salt solution, -75 per cent., at 1.25
p.m. on warm stage, and then subjected to the action of cobra-poison.
    At first the amoeboid movements of white corpuscles went on vigo
rously.     At 2 p.m. they had ceased, or very nearly so, in all that appeared
in the field.
    2.30.   All  movement had entirely ceased.        The red corpuscles seemed
more flattened, the nucleus more visible, and the edges better defined,
assuming a pointed and more oval form than usual.
                                 Experiment   XXIV.
   August     25th, 1874. — Newts' blood examined under           | object-glass  on
hot stage,    white corpuscles moving slowly.        Cobra-poison applied, but no
perceptible change observed.
    The following communications          were received from     Mr. C. Darwin on
the action     of some of the same cobra-poison on vegetable protoplasm : —
    " Tou will perhaps like to hear how it acted on Drosera.               I made a

from an adder's fang.
    "   I also   immersed three leaves           in 90 minims of the solution          ;   the ten
tacles soon became            and the glands quite white, as if they had
                            inflated

                                 felt sure that the leaves were killed ; but
after 8 hours' immersion they were placed in water, and after about 48
hours   reexpanded, showing that they were by no means killed.       The
most surprising circumstance             is,
                                that, after an immersion of 48 hours, the
protoplasm in the cells was in unusually active movement. Now, can you
inform me whether this poison,                    if     diluted,   arrests    the movement         of

I observed more clearly, this time, that the solution makes the secretion
round the glands cloudy, which have never before observed. But here
                                         I
comes the remarkable point after an immersion of 48 hours, the proto

your papers whether you have tried its action on the cilia and on the
colourless corpuscles of the blood.  If the poison does arrest their move
ment,    it   will show that there    profound difference between the pro

strongest current.

     At the same time (1.25 p.m.) the gastrocnemius from the other leg of
the same frog immersed in water.              Did not immediately contract like
that placed    in  the  poisoned   solution.
     1.30. Contracts strongly to current at 15 c. m. of Du Bois Reymond's
coil, more    than the poisoned muscle at 11, at the same moment.
     1.45. Contracts distinctly at 11, whilst the poisoned muscle has lost
all irritability.
    From this it is evident that the poison first stimulates the muscular
fibre to contract, but rapidly afterwards destroys its irritability.

    The gastrocnemii       of a frog were again treated in the same way as in
the previous     experiment, with precisely the same results.

 ficial respiration with atmospheric air, it was thought expedient to as
 certain if the more complete oxygenation by the undiluted gas would be
 more efficacious, as it seemed might be possible ; accordingly the following
 experiment was made on the 24th           April, 1874.

 injected into a rabbit with the hypodermic syringe.
    Symptoms of poisoning were rapidly manifested.              A tube had been
 previously introduced into the trachea, and respiration was commenced
 as soon as poisoning was manifest.
    Artificial respiration, with oxygen contained in a large bag, was steadily
 continued for two hours, but with no better effect than in other similar
 cases where atmospheric air was used for the same purpose.                At the
 expiration of two     hours,    apparent  death had   occurred ; the heart con
 tinued to beat for about two minutes after the respiration ceased.
    Beyond a very florid condition of the blood, there was no obvious
difference between the effect of oxygen and that of common air.             It did
not indeed appear that, as far as the effects produced by the poison were
concerned, it differed in its action from common air.
                                   Experiment  XXX.
    November 1874. — A      little cobra-poison, dissolved in water, was added to
water containing       some    cells scraped from the mantle of a freshwater
mussel.       Among these was a large ciliated cell, which, before the addi
tion  of  the   poison, had been been moving slowly, although its cilia were
moving actively.       Immediately after the addition of the poison the cell
began to spin round on its own axis with extraordinary rapidity.                In
about three or four minutes its motions began to be languid, the ciliary
motion ceased, the cell itself elongated, contracted, and then slowly
resumed its former shape and became perfectly motionless.
                                  Experiment  XXXI.
    Water from the interior of a freshwater mussel, and containing
two specimens of Paramecium in active motion, was examined. They
were rotating with great rapidity. A little cobra-poison diluted with
water was added. Three minutes after the addition one was discovered
with both the cilia and cell-body perfectly still. The cilia of the other
were still, but the cell-body was contracted.           In about half a minute
more it expanded to its normal size and then remained perfectly still.
                                 Experiment   XXXII.
    A  piece token from the mantle of a freshwater mussel was placed on
the slide and examined at the end of about half an hour.            Active ciliary
motion could be observed both in the fringe of the mantle itself and in
several specimens of Paramecium.              A little dilute poison was added.
At first   the ciliary motion seemed increased, but in about two minutes it
became slower, and       in six had become very languid, and in ten minutes
stopped altogether in the specimens of Paramcecium, but still continued
in some of the cilia of the mantle.

    A little dilute cobra-poison was added to a piece of the mantle of a fresh
 water mussel.        The cilia began immediately to move much more rapidly.
 This was watehed for some time.          Ciliary motion not affected, or at all
events not arrested,       after more than half an hour.
                                 Experiment   XXXIV.
    December     10th, 1874. — A piece of the gills of a freshwater mussel
placed under the microscope and a little cobra-poison added at 10.40 p.m.
The cilia were extremely active.
    At 10.55 still active.
    11.5. Several ciliated amoeboid      masses are now quiet instead of rolling
over and over as they did, but the        cilia on their surface are still moving.
    11.15. The cilia on these Infusoria have now nearly all stopped.              A
few are moving        slowly, whilst those on the gills are but little affected.
    11.55. Cilia on the gills are still quite active.      Those on the ciliated
bodies    still moving, rather more actively than before.
    1.30.   Cilia on gills have become much more sharply outlined.           Many
are   standing still, though many still move briskly.
                                  Experiment   XXXV.
    To another specimen a strong solution of cobra-poison was added at
10.50.
    1.30.   Cilia still moving.
                                 Experiment   XXXVI.
    A third specimen was laid in an almost syrupy solution of dried cobra-
poison at      11.28.
    At 11.40 no effect observable.
    1.30.   Some have stopped, but numbers are still moving quite briskly.
    In this case the poison       seemed not4 to have "any action on the ciliary
motion.
                                 Experiment   XXXVII.
    January     Gtli, 1875. — At 3.40 some diluted    cobra-poison added to Val-
 lisneria.      Circulation going on vigorously.        About      grain in three
 drops   of  water.
    3.58. The movements are unchanged.
    5 p.m. Movements         going on as before.
                                Experiment   XXXVIII.
    Added some solution of cobra-poison at 4 p.m. to another specimen of
  Yallisneria.
    4.10. No change.
    4.45. Circulation goes on vigorously.
     4.55. Perhaps rather less brisk in their movements.

     The results of    these experiments     show that cobra-virus must be regar
 ded as, to a certain extent, a poison to protoplasm, seeing that it arrested
 with rapidity the movements in Infusoria* {vide Experiments XXX.,
 XXXI., and following). Still it cannot be regarded certainly as a very
 powerful one, for the cilia of the freshwater mussel continued to move
 for many hours in a strong solution of cobra-poison ; though in other
 experiments the action was apparently arrested even in weaker solu
 tions of the poison.         In the case of cilia from the frog's mouth, the
 results were more definite, but action was not invariably destroyed.                 The
 results of the action of the poison on the amreboid movements                     of the
 blood-corpuscles are not very definite.              In  the case of Ycdlismria, the
 circulation in the cells went on with               undiminished vigour after the
 application    of the poison for two hours.

  referred   to and   described   in  the fourth of these Reports, published in
  1856. This map has remained in my possession up to the present time —
 a reduced copy, very far from perfect and printed in chromo-lithograph,
 having alone been published by the British Association.
     As this map, therefore, is unique, was the result of very great labour,

        The profound researches of Weierstrass, of Riemann, of Clebsch, and

elliptic functions — in the latter we investigate the properties of the inte
grals themselves        ;    in the former we investigate the properties of certain
           equations, involving these integrals, and with more than one
differential
variable.  How the values of the integrals themselves are to be found
from these equations    difficult to see, and at all events must be subject

280                Prof. W. G. Adams on the Forms, of             [Feb.   25,
The Bakebian Lecture was delivered by Prof. W. G. Adams,
   M.A., F.R.S., " On the Forms of Equipotential Curves and
      Surfaces and Lines of Electric Force."          The following    is an
      Abstract : —
  This paper contains an account of certain experimental verifications
of the laws of electrical distribution in space and in a plane conducting
sheet.                                                                          (
   The potential at any point of an unlimited plane sheet due to a charge
of electricity at any other point of the plane at distance r from it is pro
portional to the logarithm of the distance, and the potential due to two
or more charges at different points of the plane is the sum of the poten
tials due to the several charges ; so that when there are two points in a
plane conducting sheet connected with the poles of a battery, as there
are equal currents flowing at those two points, one into and the other
out of the sheet, the potential at any point of the sheet is proportional
to the difference of the logarithms of its distances from the two points
or electrodes where the current enters and leaves the sheet.
   The potential is constant for a series of points if the difference of the
logarithms of the distances of each of those points from the electrodes
remains constant, i. e. if the ratio of the distances of each of those points
from the electrodes remains constant.
   The curve joining this series of points is an equipotential curve.
   If r and r, are the distances of any point in the curve from the two
electrodes, and   c a   constant, then
                                         r=crv
Hence the equipotential curves are circles with their centres on the line
joining the two electrodes ; and the lines of force which cut the equipo
tential curves at right angles are also arcs of circles passing through the
two electrodes.
   The lines of force may be regarded as distinct from one another, but
as filling up all the space on the conductor between the two electrodes ;
and the distribution would not be altered if we conceive of them as
divided from one another like separate wires conducting currents side by
side. By taking out any space bounded by lines of force, we shall increase
the quantity flowing along the other lines of force, but shall not alter the
distribution of the current among them. Hence we may cut out a disk
from an unlimited sheet without altering the form of the lines of force,
if the boundary of the disk be arcs of circles passing through the two
electrodes ; so that for a circular disk with the electrodes on the edge of
it, the equipotential curves are circles having their centres on the straight
line joining the electrodes.

     The forms of the equipotential        may be traced out experimen
                                                      curves
tally by           attaching two battery-electrodes to
                                             a disk of tinfoil, and having
two similar electrodes attached to a delicate galvanometer ; one of these
electrodes being fixed at a point through which the equipotential curve is
to be drawn,              the other may be moved          from point to point to trace out the
successive points, so that no                  current may pass through the galvanometer.
A comparison of the experimental results with the theory shows                                  a com
plete agreement.
     Inlarge square sheet 310 millims. in diameter, with the electrodes
             a
126 millims. apart, the curves in the centre and near the electrodes,
which are drawn by pricking fine holes through the tinfoil on a sheet of
paper below,               accurately circular, and mostly coincide with
                            are very
circles, until the points are so far from the centre that the form of the
equipotential curves is affected by the edge of the disk. In a circular disk
with the electrodes on the edge subtending                        60° at the centre, the experi
mental curves are shown to be accurately arcs of circles,                         with their centres
on the line           joining the electrodes.
    In an unlimited sheet, when there are several electrodes by which
currents           enter and    leave the sheet, the potential             at any point is
where        r,   r, r"
               . . . are the distances to the electrodes   of one kind, and
rv    r,',arer"
              the  distances to  the electrodes of the other  kind. Taking
the case of one positive electrode at the centre and four negative elec
trodes round     at the corners of
                        it            square, the curves are traced and are
                                                     a
seen to be the same as the curves at the corner of        square sheet with   a
a positive electrode at the corner and two negative electrodes on the
edges   ;the curves are also the same for square sheet with       positive
                                                                  a                        a
electrode at the corner, and one negative electrode along the diagonal.
    The equation for these equipotential                    curves    is
and    is        derived,   in the
                             of the limited sheets,
                                     case               considering that, toby
every electrode on the limited sheet, there corresponds an equal and like
electrode at each of the electrical images of that electrode formed by tho
edges of the sheet.    If we trace the curves for this arrangement of elec
trodes in the unlimited sheet, the edges of the limited sheet will be some
of  the lines of force   and so we may divide the sheet along these edges,
                                ;
without altering the form of the equipotential curves.      Where an elec
trode and its images coincide in position, the index of        equal to one       r   is
more than fhe number of images.

                   Prof. W. G. Adams on the Forma of                [Feb. 25,
 If  the four points He on a circle, and the complete quadrilateral be drawn
 through them, the circles which have their centres at the intersections of
 opposite sides of the quadrilateral, and which cut the first circle at right
angles, will also cut orte another at right angles.       One of these circles
is shown to be an equipotential       curve for the four electrodes, and    the
other is a line of force.
    Hence,   if we cut the unlimited     sheet along the edge of this latter
circle, we shall not alter the forms of the equipotential curves ; and within
it we shall have   one electrode  of each kind, the others being their electric
images, the product of the distances of an electrode and its image from
the centre -being equal to the square of the radius of the disk. If an
electrode is at the edge of the disk, then the electrode and its image    coin
cide, and the equation to the equipotential     curve is
    When one pole is at the edge and the other is at the           centre of    a
circular disk, since the electric image of the centre is at        an infinite
distance, the equation to the equipotential     curves is
                                     »•*=«•,.
This is an interesting case, as showing that the equipotential curves do
not always cut the edge of the disk at right angles.       The curves around
the centre of the disk are nearly ellipses of small eccentricity, with one
focus in the centre ; but on placing one tracing electrode at a distance
from the centre
                                =(3-2V2)",
between the electrodes, where a is the radius, there is great uncertainty
in determining the form of the curve on the opposite side of the centre
of the disk.
    This is explained by the fact that the electrodes were 1 roillim. in
diameter, and a difference of distance of 1 millim. between the electrodes
near this point corresponds to a large portion of the disk oh the other
side of the centre — this portion including an area of about 500 square
millims. in a circle 36 millims. in radius, t. «. about one eighth of the
whole area of the circle.    Oil placing one of the galvanometer-electrodes
at the extremity of the diameter through the battery-electrodes and
tracing with the other, it is found that the equipotential curve through
that point cuts the edge of the disk at an angle of 45°, and that there
are two branches cutting one another at right angles.
    These peculiarities are explained on tracing the curve

corresponding to this case.      The extremity of the diameter is a point
through which two branches of the curve pass at right angles to one
another.
    The forms of the equipotential surfaces and lines of force in space may
be determined experimentally      by taking a large vessel containing a con

 ducting liquid and placing   two points, the ends of two covered wires, for
 battery-electrodes, at a given depth in the liquid and away from the sides
 and ends of the vessel, taking similar covered wires, immersed to the
 same   depth, for galvanometer-electrodes.
     For two electrodes, the equipotential surfaces                   will   be surfaces     of revo
lution around the      straight line joining them, and so will cut any plane,
drawn through       this straight line or axis, everywhere at right angles.
     Hence we may suppose sections of the   liquid made along such planes
without   altering the forms of the equipotential surfaces. This shows
that we may place our battery-electrodes at the side of a rectangular box
containing the liquid, and with the points only just immersed below the
surface of the liquid; and the equipotential surfaces will be the same as if
the liquid were of unlimited extent in every direction      about the elec
trodes.
  We shall obtain the section of the equipotential surface by taking for
galvanometer-electrodes two points in the surface of the liquid, keeping
one fixed and tracing out points of equal potential with the other.
   The potential at any point in space, due to two equal and opposite
electrodes, is

These surfaces    are cut at right angles by the curves cosfl— cos^=c,
which are also the magnetic lines of force, 0 and            being the angles <j>
which the distances from the electrodes make with the axis.           That the
lines of force in    vessel of finite size should agree with the lines of force

axis should everywhere be     line of force

vessel coincide very closely with certain lines of force, either when the
electrodes are at the ends, or when there are two electrodes within the
vessel, and   two supposed electrodes at their electrical images at an equal
distance outside the ends    of the vessel.

23 V          On Equipotential                     Curves and Surfaces, $c.        [Feb. 25,
  A   rectangular box was taken, and the battery-electrodes attached to
pieces of wood, which could be clamped at the centre of the end of the
box, and could be brought to any required point in the line joining the
middle point* of the end of the box.  The galvanometer-electrodes were
attached to ~p pieces which rest on the ends and side of the box, and
the position of the electrodes was read off by a millimetre-scale                    placed on
the ends and sides of the box.
  In the sulphate-of-copper experiments, covered wire with the end ex
posed was immersed to half the depth of the liquid ; in the experiments
with sulphate of zinc, the zinc electrodes were just immersed below the
surface of the liquid. The close coincidence between the experimental
curves traced out and the theoretical                     curves   and surfaces in    space is
shown by a comparison of the numbers given in the paper for several of
the curves which have been traced out ; it also shows that, by reversing
currents alternately, it is easy to keep the polarization                   very small,   and of
constant amount, on the galvanometer-electrodes.
   When the electrodes are parallel lines extending throughout the depth
of the liquid, the equipotential surfaces are cylindrical, and their sections
are given by the equation
                           log   (rr'   . .   .)-(log r, r' ...) = log f,
where there are several positive and several negative electrodes, r.r' ...
Ac. being measured from the points where the electrodes cut the plane
of the section.
   Hence the forms of these equipotential                     curves   are the same       as in a
plane sheet ; so that the forms traced out                    in tinfoil will   be the same        as
the corresponding forms in space for line electrodes.   These forms may
be traced out in sulphate of copper with copper electrodes, or in sulphate
of zinc with amalgamated zinc electrodes ; and for these experiments,
with cylindrical and other vessels, the polar coordinates may be mea
sured directly.    One of the battery-electrodes is made the origin of
coordinates, and a lath, or brass wire, resting on the edges of the vessel
has a slot along      it,
                       the origin being at one end or at some point
                                                                                           of of
                                                                         the
slot. In the slot      sliding piece of wood or ivory which carries one
                      is
                       a                                                 the
galvanometer-electrodes, and the lath         capable of turning about the
                                                         is
battery-electrode on which              it
                                   placed.   Around this electrode
                                              is                        gra           is   a
duated circle for measuring the angles about the origin, and, on the sides
of the slot,is    millimetre-scale for measuring the distances from the
                  a
origin.
  The other galvanometer-electrode may be fixed in manner which             a                      is
most suitable in each case.
  The Jesuits of these investigations show how closely the experimental
determination of equipotential surfaces and lines of force agrees                              with
the theory of electrical distribution in space.

  "On     the Physiological Action          of the Chinoline and Pyridine
        Bases."      By John G. M'Kendrick                   and James Dewar,
        Edinburgh. Communicated by J. Bcrdon Sanderson, M.D.,
        F.R.S. Received June 11, 1874*
     It is well known that when either quinine, cinchonine, or strychnine
 is distilled with caustic potash, each of these substances yield two
 homologous series of bases, named the pyridine and chinoline series.
 It has also been shown by Anderson and Greville Williams that bases
 isomeric with these are obtained by the destructive distillation of coal or
 from Dippel's oil.    Greville Williams has also pointed out that chinoline
 obtained from coal-tar differs in some respects from that got from cincho
 nine.    It would be a subject of physiological interest to ascertain (1) the
 physiological action of the various members of the series ; (2) whether
 there was any difference in this respect between the members of the
 series obtained from cinchonine and those got from tar ; and (3) whether,
 and if so, how, both as regards extent and character, the physiological
 action of these bases differed from that of the original alkaloid.il bodies.
 We have for some time been engaged in this research ; and the results
 we now beg leave to lay before the Society.
                         I. Method of the       Reseabch.
    The bases in both series are difficult to separate from each other ; but
 this has been done, as far as possible, by repeated fractional distillation. The
 substance first examined was chinoline obtained from cinchonine.               It was
employed both as sulphate and hydrochlorate, dissolved in water,and intro
duced by subcutaneous injection into the animal. The strength of the solu
tion employed in this and in all other instances was one part of the base to
twenty parts of water.         Its physiological action was tested on frogs,

mice, rabbits, guineapigs, cats, dogs, and man ; but as the effects were
found to be similar in all of these instances, the majority of the observa
tions were made on rabbits.        After having noted the effects of chinoline,
we next studied, by the same method, the action of hydrochlorates of the
bases distilling off at higher temperatures, including such bases as lepidine,
dispoline, tetrahiroline,   &c. We then examined t he pyridine series, begin
ning   with  pyridine  itself, and passing upwards to bases obtained at still
higher boiling-points, such as picoline, lutidine, &c. Lastly, the investi
gation was directed to the action of condensed bases, such as dipyridine,
parapicoline, &c. ; and the effects of these substances were compared with
those produced by the members of the chinoline series and among them
selves.    So far as we could observe, there was no difference as regards
physiological action between bases obtained from cinchonine         and others
got from tar.
       II. Phtsiological Effects of Htdeociilobate of CnnroLnrB
                                  (C3H7NHC1).
   The administration, by subcutaneous injection, of 1| grain for every
1 pound of weight into a healthy rabbit produced the following effects : — In
four or five minutes the animal appeared to become drowsy, was unwilling
to move ; but when pushed, locomotion was not affected. Both the pul
sations of the heart and the respiratory movements were slightly increased
in frequency at this stage.         The drowsiness increased, and in a few
minutes more the animal sank on its abdomen and remained motionless,
with the eyes widely opened. It was now gently turned over on its
back or side, and it remained in that unnatural position.           Still later,
there was complete anaesthesia.         At no period was there any hyper
esthesia. Reflex functions were also in abeyance so far that they
could not be excited by pinching or pricking, but irritation by a
Faradic current caused feeble movements. The animal appeared to be
unconscious of loud sounds.          The pupil was normal as regards size,
and it contracted readily when exposed to a strong light. The reflex
movements of the eyelid were not lost until the animal was in a state of
deep stupor from an overdose.        The respirations were now much fewer in
number, and of less depth than normal. The heart still acted vigorously,
but the pulsations were decreased in number by about one sixth. After
remaining motionless in that condition for a period of three or perhaps
four hours, the rabbit slowly recovered, raised its head from the table,
 began to move about, and frequently ate food placed before it.               It
 recovered completely from the dose above indicated, without any bad
 symptom supervening.          A dose of 2 or 2 1 grains per pound weight was
 usually lethal. If, at the end of three hours, the animal showed no indi
 cations towards recovery, it apparently sank in a state of profound insen
 sibility, the heart-pulsations became feebler, and the respirations more
 and more shallow, until they were barely perceptible.           Death ensued

   292          Messrs.   J. G. M'Kendrick and        J. Dewar on
  without convu!s;ons.      The temperature of the body fell 6° to 8° below
  the normal.    An examination of the body, made immediately after death,
  showed the following appearances : — (1) The vessels on the surface of
  the brain were somewhat congested ; the substance of the brain itself did
  not exhibit any increase of vascularity     ; (2) the lungs were congested,
  more especially along the borders ; (3) the heart was in a state of diastole
  and full of dark-coloured blood ; (4) the veins in the mesentery and the
  larger vessels on the intestine were much congested ; (5) the liver showed
  numerous minute ring-like congestions, indicating congestion of the portal
  system ; (6) the kidneys and other abdominal and pelvic viscera were
  normal in appearance ; and (7) the urine in the bladder contained no
  albumen or sugar.
     From these symptoms and post mortem appearances, and from special
  methods of experiment, we draw the following conclusions regarding the
  action of hydrochlorate of chinoline.
     1. Action on the Nervous System. — The action is chiefly, if not altoge
  ther, on the nerve-centres, and not on the nerves or on their peripheral
 terminations.    When the sciatic nerve is irritated by very feeble Faradic
 currents, it manifests no diminution of sensibility, and the muscles sup
 plied by the nerve contract with apparently their normal energy.         The
 nerves of a frog killed by hydrochlorate of chinoline show all the pro
 perties of nerves obtained from a non-poisoned animal. The sympathetic
 system of nerves is not usually affected to any appreciable extent, as evi
 denced by the normal condition of the pupil, the absence of dilatation of
 the vessels in the ear (consequent on paralysis of the vaso>-motor system),
 and by the fact that, in an animal deeply under the influence of chinoline,
 the phenomena following section and irritation of the sympathetic in the
 neck of a rabbit take place to the same extent and in the same order as
 in a non-poisoned animal.      In several instances we have observed dila
tation of the vessels of the ear and slight contraction of the pupil ; but
 these, from their rare occurrence, appear to be exceptional.     No change
was observed in the action of the pneumogastric nerve, so far as could
be ascertained by the effect on the heart produced by Faradic irritation
of that nerve. We have observed no symptoms leading us to suspect
irritation, or paralysis, of the centres in the cerebellum, or in the ganglia
at the base of the brain '; but in lethal doses the respiratory centres in
the medulla oblongata become gradually affected, as shown by the dimi
nution of the respiratory movements both in force and frequency. The
motor columns of the spinal cord do not lose their power of conduction
from the encephalon to various parts of the body, because, on irritating
with a weak Faradic current the end of the cord in a rabbit decapitated
while deeply under the influence of the substance, powerful convulsive
movements ensued.        The reflex activity of the cord is much weakened,
inasmuch as it cannot be excited by pinching or pricking ; but it is not
entirely lost, because it may be excited by Faradic stimulation ; and it has

                 the Action    of the Chinoline and Pyridine Bases.                 293
 been observed        in several experiments that strychnine, subeutaneously in
 jected into a      rabbit prostrate with hydrochlorate of chinoline, is followed
 by its   usual physiological effects. It appears, therefore, that the sub
  stance    acts chiefly on the sensory and motor centres in the cerebral
 hemispheres,        weakening or removing all consciousness of external im
 pressions     and   also all voluntary acts.
     2. Action on the Respiratory and Circulatory Systems. — In the first in
 stance the action          of the heart and the respiratory movements are
 increased,      but afterwards they are much diminished, and death appears
 to be the     result of these processes becoming weaker and weaker, until
 they cease     altogether.     The increased action observed, at first, is probably
 due to   the excitement of the animal consequent on the injection of fluid
 beneath     the skin.      So soon as the substance acts through the blood on
 the  nerve-centres, the action of both systems is weakened.                 We regard
 this weakening         as due to an action on an encephalic centre,        for the two
 following reasons : — first, because irritation             of the sympathetic     and
pneumogastric           nerves in the neck of a rabbit,          completely   under  the
influence       of hydrochlorate        of  chinoline,    produces acceleration     and
retardation        of the heart's action respectively,         as occurs  in  a healthy
animal    ;   and secondly, when the heart of a frog was treated, according
to Coats's       method, with serum containing 3 per cent, of chinoline, no
effect was      observed.     These experiments seem to indicate clearly that the
substance acts on the encephalic centres, and through them on the heart
and respiratory organs.             The action of the heart finally ceases, probably
by its   textures being supplied with only venous blood.
    3. Action      in lowering   the  Temperature of the Body. — It was found, in
three   instances in which minute differences of temperature were observed
at  intervals of one minute, during a period of one hour before and one
hour after the subcutaneous injection of hydrochlorate of chinoline, that
the   substance produced a gradual and uniform fall of temperature to the
extent of from six to eight degrees below the normal.                   In all of these
instances      the animal recovered from the effects, and, during recovery, the
temperature slowly rose to its normal limit.                This action we regard as of
considerable        importance.      It is probably to be explained by interference
with nutritional changes between the blood and the tissues, and also by
the diminution, both in frequency                   and depth, of the respiratory
movements.
      III.    Action of Htdbocbxobates of the Higheb Bases of the
                                     Chinoline Series.
              1. Bases obtained by distillation      between  200° and 280° C.
                                   Lepidine  SfC., C10 II„ N.
     These bases produced the same general action as chinoline, with the
exceptions        (1) that the dose required to produce a state of complete
stupor was somewhat smaller than in the case of chinoline, and (2) that,

29i            Messrs.   J.  G. M'Kendrick and        J. Dewar   on
after a state of stupor had been produced, the animal was less likely to
recover, while it was observed that, frequently, before death, there were
jactations of one or other of the limbs and convulsive twitchings         about
the mouth.
         2. Bases obtained by distillation between 280° and 300° C.
                            Dispoline S[C., CH Hn N.
   It was now observed that the symptoms following subcutaneous injec
tion were considerably different from those of chiuoline.         One grain for
each pound weight of the rabbit produced, in'about five minutes, apparent
uneasiness, side to side movements of the head, with a tendency occa
sionally to move backwards.        This condition continued for three or four
minutes, when     the  animal   lay flat on its abdomen with its legs out
spread.    It was not in a state of complete unconsciousness. There waa
no anaesthesia.    In  several instances there were compulsive       twitchings
of the limbs, grinding of the teeth, and a slight tendency to opisthotonos.
The lethal dose was smaller than in the case of chinoline.          The effects
were a longer time in appearing, and they had more of a spinal than of
a cerebral character.
                3. Bases obtained by distillation above 300° C.
                          Tetrahiroline $c, C,3 H„ N.
   These were found      to be still more active.      A dose of f of a grain
per pound weight produced,        in  eight  or ten  minutes after it had been
subcutaneously injected, violent convulsions, and was almost invariably
fatal. During the first five minutes after the introduction of the poison,
no marked symptoms were noticed.            At the end of this time, the animal
became uneasy, ran forwards       in an excited manner, and then fell over on
its side. The convulsions which ensued were similar to those produced
by the action of large doses of quinine or cinchonine.            They did not
resemble the tetanic    spasms produced by strychnia, as they were not
excited by peripheral irritations ; but they had an epileptiform character,
consisting of irregular jactations of the limbs, crunching of the teeth,
movements of the eyeballs, pawing movements of the fore limbs, Ac.
The animal     seemed to be semiconscious       throughout.   It  was still sus
ceptible to pain.
   A consideration    of the effects just described indicates that, as we
ascend from the lower to the higher members of the chinoline series of
bases, the physiological action becomes modified as follows : —
   1. The action on the sensory centres of the encephalon becomes            less
marked, until in the highest group there is no unconsciousness, but         only
slight stupor.
   2. The actions of the motor centres of the encephalon and spinal         cord
are not affected in the lowest group, but become gradually more              and

                the  Action of the Ghinoline and Pyridine Bases.                   295
  more involved       as we proceed upwards,        until, in the highest group, we
  have substances      producing powerful convulsions.
     3.  The lethal dose is smaller for the higher than for the lower mem
  bers  of the series.
             IV. Action of Htdbochlobates of the               Bases  in the
                                    Pyridine Series.
    The physiological action of the bases of the pyridine series was next
 examined      in the following order : —
                                  1. Pyridine, C3H3N.
    The hydrochlorate of this base produced no effects, even in doses of
 C  grains per pound weight, other than slight excitement and acceleration
 of the pulse and of the respiratory movements.                 The animal, judging
 from its   gait and demeanour, appeared to be in a state analogous to in
 toxication.      It recovered without any bad effects.
                                  2. Picoline, C„ H7   N.
    The substance was employed both in the form of the base dissolved in
 water and as a hydrochlorate.           The salt was found to be more active
 physiologically than the base, but the kind of action was the same. The
general effect was to produce, with a dose of 3 grains per pound weight,
in the first place, general       excitement and a     full bounding pulse.       This
state was     followed by a drowsy condition, which did not pass, with even
a dose    of 6 grains per pound weight, into complete stupor.               The rabbit
tould always be readily aroused.             •While in the drowsy condition, the
pulse   fell  in  frequency    and  volume,  and  the respirations became feebler*.
                                 3. Lutidine, C7H9     N.
    The effects       were similar to those produced by picoline, only more
marked.        A   dose of 3 grains per pound weight produced deep stupor,
from which the animal could not be aroused.                 It remained in this con
dition   for a period of from two to three hours. The pulsations of the
heart were much reduced           in volume, but only slightly in frequency ; but
it was clearly observable that the respirations were much less deep than in
the natural condition, and they were reduced in frequency by about one
third.     In   a case   of death from a lethal dose of 4 grains per pound,
there was venous congestion           in all parts of the body, but the heart was
still feebly pulsating.        It was observed that the blood had a peculiar dark
chocolate-brown appearance. Examined with the spectroscope, it showed
the two bands        of oxyhemoglobin.
    * The results we have obtained differ
                                           considerably from those described by H. Vohl
and H. Eulenberg in their paper on the " Physiological Action of Tobacco when used
as a Narcotic, with especial reference   to the Constituents of Tobacco-Smoke," Archiv
Puarm.    [2] cxlvii. 130-166.

                                4. Collidine,  C3HUN.
    Collidiue was still more active      in its effects.    •With a dose of 1|  grain
per pound        weight, the animal rapidly sank into a state of profound
stupor, from which it could not be aroused.              Anesthesia was complete.
The pulsations of the heart and the respirations became more and more
feeble, until death ensued in about 20 minutes after the dose, apparently
in consequence of failure of respiration.           There were no twitchings or
convulsions.       The subcutaneous injection into a rabbit of 1-S0th of a
grain of strychnine was followed by the usual physiological effects of that
substance.
     5. The Higher Pyridine Bases obtained by distillation          above 200°   C,
                          such as Parvoline, C3 H„ N, &c.
    These were found to be still more active         ; but the effects   were of the
same nature as those         just described.    The lethal dose was found       to  be
about    J  of a grain per pound weight.      In two or    three minutes the   animal
sank on its abdomen        ; when pushed could move with difficulty ; respira
tions were rapid and irregular.           It then lay on its side, and in four or
five minutes died, apparently in an asphyxiated condition. There were
no convulsive spasms or twitchings.            This substance was lethal in much
smaller doses than the lower bases of the chinoline series.
    The pyridine series of compounds thus showed a gradual increase in
activity of physiological action.            The lowest of the series produced
merely    excitement    from irritation   of the encephalic nervous centres, while
the highest produced paralysis of these nervous centres.               There was no
irritation of the spinal cord causing] increased reflex activity. Death
ensued from gradual failure of the respiratory movements leading to
asphyxia.        The action of the higher pyridines was thus somewhat analo
gous    to  the  lowest of the chinoline series, with this exception, that the
pyridine compounds tended to cause death by asphyxia.                    It is to be
noted also that the higher bases of the pyridine series were lethal in
 somewhat less than one half of the dose required to destroy life              by the
lower members of the chinoline series.
     V. Action of Htdbochlobates of tub condensed Bases of tee
                                   Pyridine Series.
    Considering      the close analogy in chemical composition between the
polymeric      bases  of pyridine and certain natural bases, such as nicotine,
 it became      of importance to examine the physiological action of these
 bases,    which   were prepared, according to Anderson's method, by the
 action    of sodium on pyridine, picoline, &c. The following were the
 effects observed after the subcutaneous injection of 1 grain per pound
 weight into a rabbit : — The animal remained quiet for a period varying
 from four to eight minutes, when it suddenly appeared uneasy, ran for
 wards as on tiptoe, with the back arched, and, falling on its side, became

                  the  Action of the Chinoline and Pyridine Bases.               297
   violently convulsed.        The convulsions continued, almost without intermis
  sion, for three       or four minutes, when death ensued. So far as could be
  observed, consciousness was         not lost until immediately before death. The
  character of the convulsions resembled that of those produced by cinchonine
  or quinine, except that the tendency to backward movements, with the
  fore legs extended,        was not so marked ; they also resembled those pro
  duced by     salts of the higher members of the chinoline series, but they
 were more severe than in the latter.              The hydrochlorates of two con
 densed bases of this kind were employed — the first made from pyridine,
 and the     other from picoline. The formulae for these are : — hydrochlorate
 of dipyridine, C10 H10 Na 2HC1 ; and hydrochlorate of dipicoline, or para-
 picoline, C1a H14       Na 2HC1.     The latter was found to   be the more active
 of the   two, but the actions were identical in character.
                                VI. Genehal Conclusions.
     1.  There is a marked gradation in the extent of physiological action of
 the members         of the pyridine series of bases, but it remains of the same
 kind.     The lethal dose, however, becomes reduced as we rise from the
lower to the higher.
     2.  The higher members of the pyridine series resemble, in physiological
action, the      lower members of the chinoline series, except (1) that the for
 mer are more         liable to cause death by asphyxia, and (2) that the lethal
dose    of the pyridines is less than one half that of the chinolines.
     3.  In proceeding from the lower to the higher members of the chino
line series, the physiological        action changes in character, inasmuch as the
lower members appear to act chiefly on the sensory centres of the ence-
phalon and the reflex centres of the spinal cord, destroying the power of
voluntary or reflex movement ; while the higher act less on these centres,
and     chiefly on the motor centres, first as irritants, causing violent con
vulsions, and afterwards producing complete paralysis.                 At the same
time, while the reflex activity of the centres in the spinal cord appears to
be so    far inactive as not to be excited by pinching or pricking,       it may  be
readily roused to action by strychnine.
    4.   On comparing the action of such bases as         C9 H7 N (chinoline) with
C, H1a    N (parvoline),        or C8 H„ N (collidine) with C8 H15 N (conia from
hemlock),       or Ci0 H10    Na (dipyridine) with C10 Hu Na (nicotine from to
bacco),    it is   to be observed that, apart from differences in chemical struc
ture, the physiological activity of the substance is greater in those bases
containing the larger amount of hydrogen.
    5. Those artificial bases which approximately approach the percentage
composition of natural bases are much weaker physiologically,              so far as
can be estimated by amount of dose, than the natural bases ; but the kind
of action is the same         in both cases.
    6.   When the bases of the pyridine series are doubled by condensation,
producing dipyridine,            parapicoline,  &c., they  not only   become   more
    vcl. ran,                                                         2 a

active physiologically, but the action differs in kind from that of the
simple bases, and resembles the action of natural bases or alkaloids
having an approximately similar chemical composition.
   7. All the substances examined in this research are remarkable for     not
possessing any specific paralytic action on the heart likely to        cause
syncope ; but they destroy life, in lethal doses, either by exhaustive   con
vulsions or by gradual paralysis of the centres of respiration, thus    caus
ing asphyxia.
   8. There is no immediate action on the sympathetic      system of nerves,
although there is probably a secondary action, because, after large doses,
the vaso-motor centre, in common with other centres, becomes involved.
   9. There  is no appreciable difference between the physiological    action
of the bases obtained from cinchona and those derived from tar.
   The physiological action of the substitution derivatives of these     sub
stances will be related in a further communication.

   These observations       were made on board the yacht ' Fox,' under the
 command     of Sir  Leopold M'Clintock, during his successful search for
the remains of the Franklin Expedition.

III. " On        the Determination, at Sea, of the Specific Gravity of
        Sea--water."        By J. Y. Buchanan, Chemist on board H.M.S.

     In the investigation of the physical condition of the ocean the accu
rate   determination of the specific gravity of the water holds a first place.
The tolerably numerous observations which have been made in this
direction, in a more or less connected manner, are sufficient to prove that
the density of the water varies, not only with the latitude and longitude,
but also with the distance from the surface of the source from which it
is taken.      This difference of density depends partly on an actual differ
ence in saltness, and partly on a difference in temperature of the water.
The amount of effect due to each of these causes can be precisely stated
when we know the effect of one of them, the sum of the effects of the
two being given by our observations.           Hence, to determine the saltness,
we eliminate the effect of temperature by reducing the results to their
value at one common temperature.             It is also necessary that the means
of obtaining the water should be of a reliable character.           In estimating,
therefore, the trustworthiness of the results, we must consider, first, the
means used for collecting the water ; second, those used for determining
 the relation between its weight and volume ; third, the determination of

its temperature ; and fourth, the reduction of the results to their value
at a common temperature.     These divisions of the subject are treated
in their order.
   The samples of water are collected either in an ordinary canvas bucket
                                 "
or in one of two kinds of metal water-bottle," according as it is to be
taken from the surface or from depths below it. The use of the ordinary
hand-bucket needs no explanation.        When water is to be obtained from
the bottom,  the   " slip
                          "
                            water-bottle  is used.  This instrument is a                            g

hitherto been able to observe, they lie between the extremes 1-02780 and
1-02400         ;   the results, therefore, to be of any value, must be correct, at
least to one          in the fourth decimal place. In mentioning these extremes,
it most be observed that they refer to oc«an-waters, and not to the mix
tures of fresh and salt water to be found in bays and estuaries, where
waters of all degrees of saltness may be found.   The instrument selected
was the hydrometer ; and the purpose which it was to serve being of so
very special a nature,                    I
                         preferred to have a special instrument made for
it,to making use of the hydrometer ordinarily supplied by the instrument-
maker.    It has large body and fine stem, the relation in size of the one

For oceanic waters the hydrometer is always used with the table and
 either No.   IV. or No. V. weight.
    When the mechanical part of the construction of the instrument was
 finished, with the exception of the closing of the top of the stem (which,
instead, was widened into a funnel-shape        large enough to receive the
ordinary decigramme weights), the calibration of- the stem was effected by
loading the stem with successive weights, and observing the consequent
depressions in distilled water of known temperature.        This done, the top
was sealed up and the instrument carefully weighed.            The expansion
of the body with temperature was determined in a similar manner by
reading the instrument in distilled water of various temperatures.         The
coefficient of expansion of the glass was then found to be 0-000029 per
degree Centigrade.
    For using this instrument    at sea about 900 cubic centimetres of water
 are taken, and the containing cylinder placed on a swinging table,       in a
position as near the centre of the ship as possible.     The observation  with
 the hydrometer, loaded with the necessary table and weight, is then
 effected in the ordinary way, the accuracy of the readings being but little
 affected by rolling ; pitching, however, is found to have a distinctly dis
 turbing effect, and, when it is in any way violent, it is advisable to store
 the specimen of water till the weather improves.       The precautions to be
 observed in making these observations at sea must be sought for in the
paper.
    The temperature of the water, at the time of observation, is determined
 by one of Geissler's
                       " normal " or standard thermometers, graduated into
 tenths of a degree Centigrade ; and it is essential for the accuracy of the
 results that the water, during the observation of the hydrometer, should
 be sensibly at the same temperature as the atmosphere, otherwise the
 changing temperature of the water makes the readings of both the hydro
 meter and the thermometer uncertain.        At low temperatures (below 10°
 or 12° C.) a tenth of a degree makes no sensible difference in the result
 ing specific gravity ; but at the high temperatures always found at the
 surface of tropical seas, rising sometimes to 30° C, the same difference
 of temperature may make a difference of 3 to 4 in the fifth decimal place
 of the resulting specific gravity.
     Having obtained the specific gravity of the water in question at a tem
 perature which depends upon that of the air at the time, it is necessary,
 in order that the results may be comparable, to reduce them to their value
 at one common temperature.        For this purpose a knowledge of the law
 of expansion of sea-water    with  temperature is necessary. This had been
 determined with sufficient accuracy for low temperatures by Despretz and
 others  ; but as the temperatures at which specific-gravity  observations are
 usually made are comparatively high, their results were of but little use,
 directed as they were chiefly to the determination of the freezing- and
 maximum-density points.       When the late Captain Maury was developing

1875.]                  Specific Gravity of Sea-water.                    305
his theory of oceanic circulation, owing to difference of density of the
water in its different parts, he found the want of information on this
important subject. At his request, the late Professor Hubbard, of
the National Observatory, U.S., instituted a series of experiments, from
which he was enabled to lay down a curve of the volumes of sea-water at
all temperatures, from considerably below the freezing-point to much
above what obtains even in tropical atmospheres.         The results are pub
                     '
lished in Maury's Sailing Directions,' 1858, vol. i. p. 237, and have evi
dently been carried out with great care. The composition of different
oceanic waters varies, even in extreme cases, within such close limits, that
the law of thermal expansion is sensibly the same for all of them ; of this
Hubbard's experiments afford satisfactory proof. In the Table which gives
the results of all his experiments he takes the volume of water at 60° F.
as his unit. In order to avoid much useless calculation,       I  have been in
the habit of reducing my results to the same temperature (15°-56 C),
while, for a like reason,    I have retained the specific gravity of distilled
 water at 4° C. as the unit. The choice of a common temperature to
 which the results should be reduced, and of a unit of specific gravities, is
 a purely conventional matter ; and in choosing the above-mentioned ones,
in the first instance   I was moved solely by a desire to save calculation.
 For  every water, however, there is one temperature to which it would be
 natural to reduce its specific gravity — namely, the temperature which the
 water had when in its place in the ocean ; and in this sense all my results
 during the cruise have been reduced. Hubbard's Table of the change of
 volume of a mass of sea-water with change of temperature enables us
 very easily to reduce any observed specific gravity from the temperature
 of observation to any other temperature, say 15°-56 C. In the paper
 it is transcribed from the ' Sailing Directions.' In the following
 Table the volumes for every Centigrade degree from — 1° C. to + 30° C.

In   system of rectangular coordinates, let observed specific gravities be

   In all these reductions the unit remains the same — namely, the specific

  as 14°     C,   16°  C, and so   forth.     In   order to reduce results from their
  value, the      unit being water at 4°     C,   to their value the specific gravity of
  distilled water at any other temperature            being unity, it is only necessary
  to divide the result by the specific gravity of distilled water at this tem
  perature, the unit being water at 4° C.              Let x' be the specific gravity of
 a sea-water reduced to 15°-56, and let it be required to convert it into its
  value when the unit is water at P.             Let c be the specific gravity of dis
  tilled water at f, that at 4° C. being         unity, we have then for the specific
 gravity      with new unit
                                     y =  - x' or x'=oy'.
 Similarly, if any other water be taken of the specific gravity x" at 15°-56,
 its value at 15°-56 C, water at t° being unity, will be
                                    y"= -x" or x"=cy".
And,     just   as before, we get the general         equation to a system of lines,
which, when          the origin is the point (a, a), is
                                      y=\x+

Now in Table           L the extreme values of v are 0-99792 and 1-00420, and
for temperatures below 22° C. the extreme values               of c are 0-99789 and 1.
For any value of c, between tnose extremes, the line expressed by equa
tion (2) must coincide with one represented by equation (1).                    By com
paring, then, the values of v in Table I. with those of c in any Table of
the expansion of distilled water,               the lines which represent specific
gravities at 15°-56,        their unit being water at any temperature         t, may be
found which correspond to isot hernials represented by equation (1). For
instance, the value of c for 15°-56 is 0-99910, and in Table I. the value of
»   for 11° C. is also 0-99910.       For   these values, then, equations (1) and (2)
represent identical lines.         Hence, to reduce any observed specific gravity
to its     value at 15°-56      C, water
at 15°-56      C. being unity, the same
construction is made as for re
ducing to 11°       C, the unit  remain
ing the same        ; only the intersec
tion of the        line parallel to the
axis    of y with the isothermal to
11° C.     is taken, and the ordinate
of the    point is the specific gravity
at 15°-56      C, water at 15°-56 C.
being    unity.
     In  a  precisely similar manner
we find      the equation to the iso
thermal for specific gravities re
duced to      any temperature t, water

    Thus for <=<'=11° C. we have t/=0-99910, c = 0-99966, whence
 t)c=0-99876.       Now in Table L 0-99878 is the value of v for the isothermal
 for 9° C. Hence to reduce observed specific gravities to their values at
 11° C, water at 11° C. being unity, is equivalent to reducing it to 9° C,
 water at 4° C. being unity, the isothermal for which is given in the cbart.
    To take an example, let the specific gravity of a water be observed at
 20° C. and found to be 1-0247.             Finding 1-0247 on the axis of y, we
 draw through it the line A B parallel to the axis of x. Through the
 intersection of A B with the isothermal for 20° C, the line C D is drawn
 parallel to the axis of y. The ordinates of its points of intersection with
 the other isothermals          are the specific gravities at these temperatures,
 water at 4° C. being unity ; they are at 15°-56 1-02575 (both by the inter
 section with the isothermal and with the axis of x), at 11° 1-02665, and
 at 9° 1-02685.       When the unit is the specific gravity of distilled water
 at 15°-56, the specific gravity at 15°-56is 1-02665, or the same as at 11°,
 water at 4°    C being unity. When the specific gravity of distilled water
at 11° C. is unity, the specific gravity at 11° C. is 1-02685, or the same
as at 9° C, when water at 4° is unity.
    During the course of the cruise          a considerable number of waters have
had their specific gravities determined at different temperatures.             The
results when reduced to the common temperature of 15°-56 C. agree,
as a rule, within 5 in the fifth decimal place, the greatest difference
being 14.
    When the specific gravity of the same water is determined with the
 same hydrometer and table, but with different weights, the mean dis
crepancy in the results is 5, and the maximum 10 in the fifth decimal
place.
    As an absolute test of the trustworthiness of the results,        I  landed my
balance, and determined the specific gravity of the water of Hong-Kong
harbour, in the usual way, by weighing it in a specific-gravity tube, and
reducing it to its value at 15°-56 both by the graphical method, already
described, and arithmetically, using the factors found in the two Tables
of expansion of sea and distilled waters.              I found its specific gravity
reduced arithmetically to be 1-02391, reduced graphically 1-02394.              De
termined on board by means of the hydrometer and reduced graphically,
it was 1-02397.         The true specific gravity must therefore lie between
1-02391 and 1-02397. . Taking, therefore, into account the results of the
application of those different tests of accuracy,         I think the trustworthi
ness of the method is fully established.

                         *
         Received February 6, 1875.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The author, referring to observations recorded in his previous papers,
distinguishes in the cornea primary bundles of fibrillary tissue, which are
covered by elongated flat cells, layers of quadrangular flat cells (which
are analogous in appearance and relative position to the layers of cells
 described by him as investing the secondary and tertiary bundles of
 tendon), and the stellate cells.       To these he now adds a description of
 parallel chains of spindle cells, each cell having two processes, one at
 each end of the spindle, by which it is joined to its fellows on either side.
 These cells are coextensive with the cornea-substance, and are present in
 every interspace of the primary bundles, and, consequently, layers in
 different planes cross each other at an angle.
     They can be occasionally seen in thin vertical sections of the fresh
 frog's cornea, treated in osmic acid ; and from such preparations a cell
 with its terminal processes can be sometimes isolated.          They are more
 easily seen in similar sections which have been 15-30 minutes in half
 per cent, solution of chloride of gold and then sealed up in concentrated
 acetic acid and examined 24—48 hours afterwards.
      They have no anatomical continuity with the stellate cells.
      In  the fresh frog's cornea examined entire in serum, the structure,
 looked at through the anterior epithelium, can be seen to be broken up
 by clefts, the borders of which have a double contour.             These clefts
  extend from the epithelium to a varying depth into the fibrillary tissue.
  They are arranged sometimes concentrically, and sometimes in waving
  lines which give off branches which are narrower as they approach the
  centre of the cornea.       The double- contoured borders are not parallel to
 the median plane of the cornea, and can          be traced only by changing the
  focus.
      From the existence of these clefts the author infers a division of the
  cornea-substance      into compartments equivalent to the secondary and
  tertiary bundles of tendon.
       In  inflammation   the clefts are much widened, and their finer ramifica
  tions become visible.      In  preparations of inflamed cornea different tracts

  310                      Dr. G. Thin on Traumatic                   [Mar. 11,
  of cornea-substance bounded by the clefts are coloured of different shades
  by chloride of gold, the difference affecting the fibrillary tissue, and more
  markedly the spindle cells.
      The serous contents of the interspaces of the inflamed cornea differ
  iu character from those of the healthy cornea, inasmuch as the former
  show, more abundantly, the dark granular substance which results from
  the reduction of the chloride of gold.
      In a very early stage of inflammation (after a few hours) the disten
  sion of the narrow spaces between the primary bundles and of the wider
 and more yielding spaces between the lamellae, <»rresponding to the
 larger bundles, favours the action of chloride of gold ; and preparations
 can thus be obtained by this reagent which show that the two kinds of
 flat cells which cover the respective surfaces are arranged after the
 manner of an epithelium.        The cells thus seen can be identified by their
 size, contour,    and arrangement as those which are isolable from the
 healthy cornea by warm saturated solution of caustic potash, and which
 can be seen in preparations sealed up in aqueous humour.
     A similar distension occasionally permits the demonstration         of the
 layers covering the secondary bundles of tendon.
     That the successful gold reaction, in such cases, is probably due solely
 to the distension of the interspaces, is inferred from the fact that, in the
 tendo Achillis of frogs which have died from disease and have been some
 hours in water after death, the author has obtained gold preparations
 showing not only the cells of the secondary bundles (Ranner's cells), but
 also small groups      of the long narrow cells which      cover the primary
 bundles.
     In  the cauterized frog's cornea, examined in blood-serum after twelve
 hours' inflammation,     portions of the primary bundles are found lying
 loose on the surface.      These detached portions have a nearly constant
 length, a uniform breadth, sharply defined even borders, are sometimes
 puckered transversely, occasionally show a faint appearance of longi
tudinal fibrillation, and are sometimes cut transversely, at one or more
 points, by straight hyaline lines.    They resemble accurately the primary
 bundles of the neurilemma of the sciatic nerve and the rods of the retina
of the healthy frog.
     They stain deeply in gold preparations, and are then always puckered
transversely.
     In gold preparations of the inflamed frog's tongue, isolated primary
bundles, identical in appearance and breadth with those of the inflamed
cornea, are to be found.
    The depth of staining by gold shows that the constituent elements of
the primary bundles undergo a chemical change in inflammation.
    The author has studied, by means of chloride of gold, the effects of in
flammation in the quadrangular and in the long flat cells which cover
the bundles in the interior of the cornea, but chiefly in frog-corne® sealed

up in blood-serum, the latter method being found more certain to give
available preparations.
    The only appearance observed, anterior to a complete destruction of
the cell, was a division of the nucleus into two or more parts: In
serum preparations the products of the division assumed the form of
circles of highly refractive particles.        Similar particles were sparsely
scattered in the substance of the cell.
    The area of any one circular product of this division was always much
smaller than that of the undivided nucleus.
    In regard to the stellate cells, the author questions the correctness of
the accepted theory, which implies an identity of the cell and its pro
cesses with the visible protoplasm.          He considers that the refractive
particles, which constitute what is visible in the cellular protoplasm, are
suspended in a fluid, similarly to the pigment-granules in the pigment-
cells as described by Mr. Lister. The phenomenon described by German
investigators as
                    " Zusammenballen " of the cell-processes, he attributes
to a collection    of the protoplasmic     particles in the centre of the cell,
similar to that which takes place in concentration of pigment.              This
 opinion   is  borne   out by  a comparison   of  gold and  osmic-acid  prepara
tions. In conditions in which, by the former process, an isolated glo
 bular body is seen, osmic-acid preparations show that the anastomosis of
the thread-like processes remains complete. Beasoning analogically from
 the results obtained by gold in other tissues, he infers that it is what
 may be described as the contents of the cell and processes which stain by
that method.
    Treatment by osmic acid is the only reliable method by which he has
 obtained satisfactory preparations showing the stellate cells in the in
 flamed cornea.       The advantages of this mode of treatment are much
 enhanced by subsequent staining with red aniline, which especially differ
 entiates the protoplasm and processes.          Subsequent staining   by hema
 toxylin renders the nuclei visible.
     The only change, except that of destructive disintegration, observed by
 the author as a consequence of inflammation in the stellate cells, consists
 in the anastomosing processes being, in gold preparations, occasionally
 represented by fine darkly stained lines, on which are a series of small
 globular swellings placed at short regular intervals, giving any one pro
 cess an appearance identical with that presented by an ultimate nerve-
 fibrilla in a gold preparation.      The same appearance is also to be seen in
 osmic-acid preparations, and is suggestive of points of communication
 between the lumen of the process and the interfibrillary space.          (This is
 the only form in which the author has seen the processes of the stellate
 cells in inflamed corneae in gold preparations.       They are usually invisible
 by that process.)
     Appearances     indicative   of a dividing nucleus were rarely seen, and
  their interpretation is doubtful.      Both in respect to the nucleus and the

   processes the stellate cells are the most stable of all the cellular elements
   of the cornea.
       Between the layers of the superficial corneal epithelium a network of
   stellate cells can be seen in serum preparations of inflamed cornea. Indi
   cations of similar cells can be seen in gold and haematoxylin         prepara
   tions of the healthy cornea.
       In inflammation the cells of this network show a very great       increase
   in size as compared with their appearance in health.
       The changes produced by inflammation in the spindle cells may be
   divided into three stages :
                                —
       (a) Preparations examined in serum show that the cell-protoplasm
   has become increased in amount, and that the cell-processes             can be
   distinctly traced. This stage can be observed after twelve hours' inflam
  mation, resulting from slight cauterization in a winter frog. The swelling
  of the protoplasm is often confined to one or more tracts of the cornea,
  one of the above-mentioned clefts separating the area of this appearance
  from that of the normal cornea.        The area extends from the neighbour
  hood of the cauterized part towards the limbus.
      (6) The swelling of the protoplasm extends along the processes from
  one cell to the other, a chain of spindle cells being often represented by
  a long column of protoplasm on •which there are very slight constrictions.
  This description' applies to osmic-acid preparations.       Deep staining with
 red    aniline and   subsequent  treatment  with  acetic acid renders the nuclei
 visible in this protoplasmic column. This stage is well seen in osmic-acid
 preparations of a rabbit's cornea which has been 24 hours inflamed by
  the passing of a thread.
      (c) With more or less increase in the amount of protoplasm, and with
 or without its presence in the processes in a granular form, nuclear
 bodies (resulting from a division of the nucleus) are seen in osmic-acid
 preparations to be contained in, or partly expelled from, the cell, which
 are identical in appearance with the red blood-corpuscles seen in the
 new vessels in the same preparations.           This identity in appearance is
further      maintained  by staining  osmic-acid preparations with red aniline,
 in which the nuclear products and red blood-corpuscles are stained a like
tint and deeper than the other elements. The author infers from these
appearances that in inflammation the nuclei become free bodies, which are
equivalent to red blood-corpuscles.
     The appearances described by Key and Wallis, Cohnheim, and others
as white corpuscles in
                           " Spindelform," are seen in osmic-acid preparations
to be spindle cells made more prominent by inflammation.
     The " spiessartige Figuren" seen in gold preparations are produced by
the protoplasm which immediately surrounds the nuclei of the spindle
cells being visible, whilst from the mode of preparation          the connecting
processes are invisible.
     White blood-cells in the inflamed cornea can       be identified with   most

certainty in osmic-acid preparations.       They are found in groups in the
wider spaces, in rows in the nerve-channels and between the primary
bundles (corneal tubes of Bowman), and in large numbers in the tracts
between the larger bundles.        They are mostly round, sometimes club-
shaped,  never   pointed  at two extremities  as an elongated shuttle-shaped
mass (that is, never spindtlformig, spiessartig).        A small minority con
sist of a double body formed by two rounded globular masses joined by
a smooth isthmus.        When stained by haematoxylin, nuclei are found in
either end, but not in the isthmus.       The author infers that we have here
a corpuscle in process of division.
   In rabbit-corneae, in which inflammation has lasted about a week, some
white corpuscles are seen with uneven contour ; and bulging outwards
from, or lying close beside, them are bodies evidently nuclear, and which
are affected by osmic acid and subsequent staining with red aniline, in a
manner identical with the1 red blood-corpuscles seen in blood-vessels in
the same preparation.      The identity of the escaped nuclei with red blood-
corpuscles is shown by a comparison of their respective size, evenness,
colour, and contour.
   The author infers a production of red blood-corpuscles in inflammation
from the nuclei of the white blood-cells.
   In observations on human blood, and that of the mouse, by staining
with hematoxylin, he has found that while the great majority of the red
corpuscles do not quickly stain in a weak solution, there are some which
at once stain a deep blue, and that there are white corpuscles in which
a narrow protoplasmic margin encloses a deep blue nucleus similar in con
tour and size to the stained red corpuscles. Amongst the red corpuscles
of the frog are a minority which are recognized as being red corpuscles
by their size, smooth contour, and absence of granulation, but in which
there is no haemoglobin, and the nucleus quickly stains blue in solution
of hematoxylin, like that of the white cells.
    Transitions occur in which a less and less capacity of staining on the
part of the nucleus takes place, pari passu with an increase in the colour
characteristic of hemoglobin in the body of the cell.        In the fully deve
loped  red  corpuscle, the nucleus  stains only after it has been for some time
in contact with a weak solution of hematoxylin.
    The author has observed in the blood of the mouse foetus the nuclei
of the nucleated red blood-cell escape from the larger cell, and then be
come indistinguishable in form and appearance from the small red cor
puscles of the mature animal present in the blood under examination.
   These observations, taken in connexion with the bodies that are formed
in the spindle cells and white corpuscles in inflammation, support, as the
author believes, the doctrine of Wharton Jones, in regard to the forma
tion of the red blood-corpuscles.
   The mode of formation of capillary blood-vessels he believes to be
identical in inflamed and in foetal tissue. In studying this subject he

has found special advantages from the use of osmic acid, with or without
subsequent staining in hematoxylin. The stages in this formation are
as follows : —
   (a) The spindle cells enlarge and contain several nuclei which can be
identified, whilst within the cell, as being of a similar nature to red blood-
corpuscles.    A current of blood-plasma from the nearest vessels passes, at
the same   time, into the interfibrillary space in which the spindle cells lie.
   (6) The nuclei escape from the spindle cells into this space,         where
they are indistinguishable in appearance from the ordinary red           blood-
corpuscles.
   (c) By a process of diapedesis the formed elements of the nearest
blood-vessels pass into this space and the circulation is established.
   Various appearances lead the author to suppose that the ftbrine of
the plasma solidifies on the outer surface of the current and forms the
substratum of the new vessel, and on this substratum the white blood-
corpuscles fix themselves and spread out as an epithelium.
  From interfibrillary spaces in the inflamed cornea, in which formation
 of blood-vessels was actively taking place, the author has isolated white
 corpuscles in various transition stages towards the appearance and shape
 of epithelium ; and, from rapidly enlarging vessels, cells which, from their
form, he believes to be transitionary to that of smooth muscular fibre.
    As the new capillary forms, the enlarged spindle cells decrease to their
ordinary size.
    In preparations of blood-serum of the frog sealed up, after a few days,
the haemoglobin may be observed to assume special forms inside the cor
puscle, or to disappear from       it,
                                   and so produce changes in the appear
ance of the corpuscle identical with those described by Arnold as taking
place in the tongue of the living animal after diapedesis.
    The above observations were made chiefly on the cornea of the frog and.
rabbit and the inflammation was mostly produced by solid nitrate
        ;

II.    "Report on Observations of the Transit of Venus                made at

       Admiral E. Ommanney, CB., F.R.S. Received February 11,
       1875.
   Owing to the kindness of Professor Auwers, of Berlin, who placed            his
heliometer at my service,  was enabled to make the following notes
                             I                                                  of
time and phenomena during the time of egress.

  1875.]                      on the  Transit of Venus.                         315
     The time was given by a chronometer marked " Wiren 34," which was
 lent to me by the celebrated astronomer, William Dollen, of Fulkowa.
     At 18h 40m M. T. the sun rose clear and brilliant over the eastern range
 of the Arabian hills on the valley of the Kile under very favourable con
 ditions of sky and atmosphere, more so on this occasion than on any
 other morning during our stay of 20 days at Luxor.                The first glance
 showed us the image of the planet Venus on the sun's disk in the pre
 dicted place, making progress in her path across the sun to the point
 of egress.
     At the first observation the borders of the planet appeared jagged and
 ill-defined, but as the altitude increased she presented a dark disk, clearly
 defined on the sun.         "When the time of internal contact approached, the
 edge   of  the   planet  and  the limb of the sun were both very distinct, and
favourable for making accurate observations.
     When the moment of internal contact drew near,            I  gave my utmost
                                                                       I
attention for observing the appearance of the black drop ; but could not
detect it, though      I  could perceive with great nicety the instant of con
tact.     The margin of the sun's limb and that of Venus were most clearly
defined to my vision.
     Immediately after internal contact a bright illumination manifested
itself on the emerged part of Venus ; this light continued bordering on the
cusp for about three fourths of the time between internal contact and
external contact at egress.
     The following are the times shown by chronometer for contacts and
phenomena       : —
                                                                   h m b

          Light on left side became fainter                      20 15 00

          Time of external contact at egress                     20 29 25
     I must remark      that  I  found it a matter of considerable difficulty to
note the precise instant of the last or external contact at egress, as the in
dentation became so extremely slight towards the planet making final egress.
     The error of the chronometer was estimated to be very nearly
-+- 15m 02*-0 by preliminary calculation ; hence
                                                       the times of contact by
my observations, corrected for mean time at Luxor, will stand thus : —

   The temperature     in the shade at sunrise was 53° F., and after transit
65°  F.
   The heliometer used by me on this occasion was constructed by Fraun-
hofer.    One of the halves of the object-glass was used, the line of separa
tion being put normal to the sun's limb at the point of contact, in order
to produce the least distortion of image in the direction of the common
diameter of the two objects.        The focal length of the instrument is
nearly 45 inches (English), the aperture 3 inches, and the power used
was 97.
    Our observatory was situated about half a mile to the southward of
Luxor, in lat. 25° 41' 40" N., as determined by Wm. Dollen and Pro
fessor Auwers, and in longitude 2h 10m 22* E., as fixed by Mahmoud Bey
in his late survey of the valley of the Nile.
III. " Preliminary       Abstract of Approximate Mean Results with
       the Invariable Pendulums Nos. 4 and 1821, in continuation
       of the Abstract published in vol. xix. of the Proceedings." By
       Captain W. J. Heaviside, R.E.         Communicated by Professor
       Stokes, Sec. It.S. Received February 15, 1875.
     Extract from a Letter from Captain Heaviside    to Professor Stokes.
                                          Dehra, N. W. P., 21st January, 1875.
   Mi deae Sin, — An      abstract of approximate results by the invariable
pendulums    was  printed under Captain Basevi's superintendence in 1870.
I  now enclose an abstract in continuation, bringing the work down to
Kew.      The formulae and factors employed by Basevi have been used in
the reductions, so that the results in the two abstracts might be directly
comparable.
   The observations at Meean Meer and at More were taken by Basevi,
and the reduction to mean sea-level for More has been computed in
accordance with a memorandum he left, in which he assumed the moun
tain masses on which More stands to compose a cylinder, having a height
of 2-92 miles and a radius of 200 miles.
   Tou will   see that the results  at Kew, from my observations in 1873,
differ by 0-38 vibration    from those obtained by Mr. Loewy in 1866.
My observations were taken in August, at a mean temperature of 65° ;
his in January, at a temperature of 54°.
   As the temperature-factor (0-48 vibration for 1° Fahr.) here employed
is larger than that which will eventually be adopted, the difference
between the two results will be still further reduced, and the agreement
will be much closer than      I  expected to obtain, when taking into con
sideration the varied travels these pendulums went through in the
interval.   * * *

I. "On           the Behaviour of the    Hearts of Mollusks under the
           influence of Electric Currents."  By Dr. M. Foster, F.R.S.,
           and A. G. Dew-Smith, B.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge.
           Received February       1, 1875.
  It has already been shown by Dr. Foster (Pfl tiger's 'Archiv,' vol. v. p. 191)
that an interrupted current applied directly to the heart of the common
snail (removed from the body) will cause an arrest of the rhythmic beat,
the heart remaining in diastole.
  The phenomena thus produced are altogether similar to those seen
when the vertebrate heart is inhibited by stimulation of the pneumo-
gastric nerve.
  This inhibition by direct stimulation requires a current weaker than is
sufficient to cause tetanus of the heart.  It may be witnessed on either
auricle or ventricle, and is the more easily obtained the more quickly the
heart is beating.- It takes place whatever be the position of the elec
trodes      ;   and we find that    it is possible thus to inhibit not        only the
whole ventricle but separate parts of a divided ventricle, provided these
can be obtained, as they sometimes can, beating with a sufficiently rapid
rhythm.
   We have found no reason to think that there exists any localized inhi
bitory mechanism (corresponding to the sinus venosus ganglia of the
frog's heart, for instance) any more than a localized automatic me
chanism.
   This inhibition by direct stimulation              is,
                                         to say the least, an unusual
fact   and the following inquiry was begun in the hope that further study
       ;
of the heart of the same animal, and those of other mollusks, might bring
to light some explanation of the matter.
   •Wo will relate first the results of our experiments with single induc
tion-shocks and with the constant current on the snail's heart, and then
pass on to the facts observed in other mollusks.
   We have in all cases removed the heart from the body, and placed                    it
in a watch-glass, in little snail's blood. It will in this condition con
                         a
tinue to beat with great regularity for hours.

1875.]        Influence of Electricity on the Hearts of Molliisks.          819
    Our reasons for always removing the heart from the body are as
follows : —
    The movements of the heart cannot be accurately observed in situ unless
the overlying thin integument is divided and the pericardial chamber laid
open. As soon as this is done the beats are seen to become very irre
gular. Every movement of the body influences the flow of blood to and
from the heart, and every marked change in the flow affects the force
and rhythm of the beat ; hence observations like those we are about to
record would be impossible with the heart in situ.
    We have been unable to find any nerve in the body stimulation of
which would inhibit the heart in the same way as stimulation of the
pneumogastrio does the vertebrate heart.
    By removal of the heart from the body, therefore,        we lose nothing
essential.
    A  graphic record of each heart-beat would of course be impossible.
In    order to obtain a satisfactory register of our observations, we
adopted the following plan. One of us acting as observer, and watching
the heart through a microscope (50 to 100 diameters), signalled, by the
sudden make and break of a constant current, each beat of ventricle or
auricle, or of both. The make and break were recorded by a magnetic
marker,    as   was also the application of the stimulus, on a travelling-
paper, on which seconds were at the same time being marked.           In this
way a little practice enabled us to register with tolerable accuracy the
rhythm of the beat, though we could not, of course, record the force or
character of each pulsation.
    Most of our observations were directed to the ventricle, and in our
remarks we have only incidentally referred to the auricle.
    We at first registered the auricular beats as well as the ventricular ; but
an increasing conviction of the independence (in an empty heart) of the
movements of the two chambers, led us after a while to confine our
attention to the ventricle.
    The application of the current was made by one of us while the other,
watching and recording the beats of the heart, was unaware of what was
being done. The faithfulness of the observations was thus materially
assisted.
    Finding the heart of the common snail more vigorous, though smaller,
than that of the edible snail, we confined our attention to the former.
    The snail's heart consists, as is well known, of a thin-walled globular
auricle,   separated by a ring of non-contractile tissue from an oval,
almost conical, fleshy ventricle.     Into the former, opposite the auriculo-
 ventricular orifice, opens the large pulmonary vein. The latter at its
 apex, opposite the auricle, narrows to the large artery, which we have
 spoken of as the aorta.     In speaking of the ventricle we shall frequently
have occasion to    distinguish the broader auricular end next to the auricle
 from the narrow aortic end, which is continuous with the aorta.             In

  320     Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the                [Mar.  18,
 removing the heart from the body, it is of importance, in order to secure
  a good rhythmic beat, that the incision should be carried through the
  aorta, and not invade the contractile tissue of the ventricle itself.
     While the auricle is a sac, with quite thin and smooth walls, the
  bundles of fibres in the ventricular walls bulge out largely into the cavity,
  and are so arranged that the ventricle has the same spongy structure as
  that of the frog and many other animals.
     Neither in the auricular nor ventricular wall can the presence of any
  nerve-cells, or collection of nerve-cells in the form of ganglia, be detected,
  whether in fresh specimens or in those treated with various reagents.
  The interlacing intricately arranged bundles of fibres are composed of a
  granular protoplasmic-looking tissue, quite unlike the ordinary muscular
  tissue of the body, and in many ways resembling the cardiac tissue of
  vertebrates.
     The walls are thickly studded with nuclei,         some  of which possibly
  belong to an external tesselated epithelium.           Other nuclei are un
 doubtedly the proper nuclei of the contractile          elements, and the re
 mainder seem to be of the nature of connective tissue.
     Of none of them can it safely    be said that they are the nuclei of nerve-
 cells.    Molluscan nerve-fibres might undoubtedly, unlike vertebrate
 medullated nerve-fibres, easily escape detection ; but Mr. A. S. Lea, of
 Trinity College, carefully examined for us the whole of both the auricle
 and ventricle without discovering any distinct nervous structures.          He
 also went systematically over the margins of both the aortic and pulmo
 nary orifices, but could find no nerves running into or out of the heart.
 In no other way could nerves become connected with the heart. And,
 opposed as it may seem to general experience, and still more to recog
 nized opinions, we are led to the conclusion that the heart of the snail
 has no nervous connexion with the rest of the body ; nay, more, that it
 has within itself no distinctly specialized nervous mechanism, but that
 its contractile elements are composed of protoplasm, arranged, it is true,
more or less in fibres, yet otherwise but slightly advanced in dif
 ferentiation.
                      The Effects of single Induction-shocks.
     A single induction-shock sent through the ventricle of the snail's heart
produces different results, according to the strength of the current em
ployed.     We have generally used the closing shock alone, or the opening
shock alone, stopping the other shock in the usual way.             Except that
the opening shock acts, of course, as a stronger stimulus than the closing
shock, we have not observed any marked difference between their effects.
     When the shock is of a certain intensity (as, for instance, when a
single Damell's cell is used with the secondary coil of a Du Bois Reymond's
induction-machine      drawn out to 5 or 10), its application is immediately
followed by a contraction.       This contraction has all the characters of a
normal beat, except perhaps that it is rather more sudden and of shorter

1875.]       Influence of Electricity on the Hearts of Mollusks.                 321
duration.      Since the eye has been our only means of judging of the cha
racters of the contraction, it being impossible to register the movements
by the graphic method, we speak with great uncertainty on this point.
    The stronger the shock the more marked, within certain limits, is the
contraction. The effect, of course, in any particular case will depend
not only upon the absolute strength of the current, but on its strength
in relation to the irritability of the heart. Thus a heart with frequent
and strong beats is affected by a weak current to the same extent as is a
heart beating slowly and feebly by a strong current.
     The contraction or beat thus produced by a single induction-shock is
 generally followed by a pause, much more evident in some cases than in
 others.    We have not been able to discover the exact conditions which
 determine the duration of the pause ; but it seems to depend much more
 on the state of the heart than on the strength of the current.                There
 appears to be no necessary relation between the amount of the contrac
 tion and the length of the consequent pause. Thus a contraction twice
 the strength of the normal beat is not invariably followed by a pause of
 twice the length of the normal diastole ; it may be more than twice as
 great, it may be hardly greater.        On this point, again, we speak with
 hesitation, from inability to measure accurately the force or extent of
 the beats.
     We have thrown in the single induction-shock at all phases of the car
 diac cycle, at the height of systole, immediately before and immediately
 after systole, in the middle of diastole, &c., but have been unable to
 detect any marked differences in the result.         It can hardly be doubted
 that, whatever     be the way   in which   the  shock   causes a contraction, the
 heart must be differently disposed towards a stimulus, according as it is
 about to make or has just made a beat ; nevertheless            we have not suc
 ceeded in observing any marked differences.
     Not only has the contraction produced by a single induction-shock             the
           characters of a normal
                                       " beat " rather than those of a
  general                                                                     simple
  muscular contraction, but,   as far as  can  be judged by     the  eye, the effect
  of the shock on the ventricle differs from the effects produced in any
  ordinary muscular fibre in the following respects.         In passing gradually
  from extremely feeble to stronger currents, there is not witnessed a
  gradual increase of effect ; on the contrary, the change is a sudden one,
  from apparently no effect at all to the production of a well-marked beat.
  This leads us to infer that the mechanism by which feeble currents pro
  duce contractions in the heart differs somewhat from that whereby con
  tractions are caused by stimulating an ordinary muscular fibre *.               The
  stronger contractions, on the other hand, produced by stronger shocks,
  seem to share more distinctly in the characters of an ordinary muscular
  contraction.

 322     Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the                  [Mar. 18,
    We have said that single induction-shocks,       below a certain    intensity,
 produce apparently no effect on the heart.
    We have thrown in single shocks, of a strength too slight to cause a
 beat or contraction, at all phases of the cardiac cycle, without being able
 to detect any variation in either the character or frequency of the beat.
 We would not venture to say that absolutely no effect is produced, but
 the effect is not manifested by any change in the rhythm which can be
 measured on our recording surface, travelling half an inch a second, or
 by any change in the beat which can be recognized by the eye.
    We have also thrown in single shocks repeated at the same phase for
 several beats in succession.       Thus we have thrown in a single weak
 shock at the height of systole as well as in the middle of diastole, daring
 several successive beats, without detecting any appreciable effects.
    Very marked, however, are the results when the weak single induction-
shocks are rapidly repeated, so that two or more shocks fall within each cycle.
    Tht application of  the shoeks  produces no contraction or beat, but is   fol
lowed by a prolongation     of the diastole.
   In  other words, a single induction-shock, too weak to produce by itself
any effect, has, when repeated within the cardiac cycle, a distinct inhi
bitory action.
   The beat which immediately follows the prolonged diastole is      a feeble one
(as are  also the beats  which    occur  when   the shocks  are  repeated many
times in succession, so as to cover the periods of more than one prolonged
diastole) ; but the inhibition is followed, as was the case with the inter
rupted current, by a stage of increased rapidity and vigour of beat— that
is to say, the inhibition thus caused has all the characters of a normal
inhibition.
   Repeated trials have shown us that, having due regard to the irrita
bility of the heart, the more feeble the current the more rapid must be
the repetition of shocks, and the greater the number of shocks given in
order to produce inhibition.
   As an instance of very successful inhibition, we may refer to fig. 1,
(p. 342), where two shocks were found sufficient to produce a very
marked prolongation      of the diastole.
   A particularly    interesting result is shown in fig. 2.         This is the
only case in which we succeeded in obtaining inhibition as the result
of one single opening shock.          The shock, however, was (in relation to
the heart's irritability) a comparatively strong one; it was just on
the verge of being strong enough to produce a contraction..           Our notes
record that at the moment of stimulation (the stimulus being thrown in
very soon after the normal beat)
                                         " a slight quiver, quite distinct from
any ordinary contraction, and limited to the neighbourhood of the elec
trodes, was observed."
   It will be noticed that after the first two shocks the heart became
habituated to the stimulus, and the last two shocks produced no effect.

 1875.]      Influence   of Electricity    on the  Hearts of Mollusks.          323
   The   "slight quiver"       recorded   in the above observations       does   not
really contradict the statement made above concerning the rapid transi
tion from a state of rest to a full though slight beat. The transition
from this quiver to a beat is quite as abrupt as that from a state of com
plete rest.
   As far   as we have seen,    inhibition may    be brought   about whether the
electrodes be placed lengthwise        (one at the auricle and the other at the
aorta) or sideways, or obliquely.
   We have not, however, paid particular attention               to the question,
whether   inhibition can be produced more easily in one direction than
another ; nor did we, in making the above observations, pay attention to
the direction of the current.
   It would seem, then, from the facts we have recorded, that the inhibi
tion produced by the tetanizing current, applied directly to the ventricle
of the snail's heart, is in reality the simple summation of the effects of
the single induction-shocks which make up the tetanizing current.
   The effect of each shock is very slight, and a single shock has rarely
the power to cause a marked prolongation of the diastole ; nevertheless
there is an effect which lasts for some time longer than the application
of the shock itself, and of such a kind that a second shock being brought
to bear on the heart before the effect of the first has passed away, has a
cumulative effect, and, in consequence, distinct inhibition is observed, if
not always with two, at least with several shocks rapidly repeated.
   Moreover this inhibitory effect, this prevention of the contraction or
beat, increases with the strength of the current employed up to a certain
limit, and then the action of the stimulus is suddenly reversed, and                a
contraction or beat is caused instead of prevented.
    There seems to us to be no escape from this conclusion, that the action
of the induction-shock on the tissue of the heart is of such a kind that,
beginning with a certain effect (inhibition), as it increases in intensity it
suddenly topples over,       so to speak, and produces       the directly opposite
effect (contraction).
    We cannot      be assisted here by the favourite     theory of a double me
chanism of inhibition and contraction, with different exhaustibilities,
even if we suppose that these mechanisms are evenly distributed all over
the ventricle.       All exhaustion is, as far as we know, gradual.            If we
 suppose    the   inhibitory  mechanism     to be  more   easily  excited  and    ex
hausted than the contractile, then in passing from weaker to stronger
stimuli we must pass through a phase in which the waning inhibition is
just sufficient      to counteract    the increasing    contraction,   when, con
 sequently,    no effect at all will be produced.     In  our results, on the con
 trary, we pass at once from the maximum of inhibition to contraction.
                        The Effects of  the  Constant Current.
    Non-polarizable electrodes (a modification of Donder's pattern) were

324      Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith            on the   [Mar. 18,
always used. The current was supplied by a single Daniell's or Grenet's
cell, the circuit being divided between the electrodes placed on the heart
and a set of resistance-coils, the resistance in which could be made to
vary from '05 ohm to 100,000 ohms, and thus a very great variety
obtained in the strength of the current passing through the heart.
   It will be as well to begin by describing the effects produced by the
constant current on the heart at rest, i. e. on hearts which, after removal
from the body, did not exhibit any spontaneous beat.
   When the ventricle alone was experimented with (the auricle having
been   removed), and the electrodes placed lengthwise, one against the
auricular end, the other against the aortic end of the ventricle, a contrac
tion or beat always took place at the making and at the breaking of the
circuit  ;  but the two contractions    differed from each other and from a
normal beat in a very distinct manner.
   The normal beat of the ventricle may be described as a gathering of
the whole mass towards       the point where the long axis of the ventricle
would     be intersected  by a transverse line drawn across the ventricle's
broadest part, accompanied by a kind of peristaltic constriction, which
travels down from the auricular to the aortic end, ». e. which begins at
the auricular and leaves off at .the aortic end, though during the greater
part of the period of the beat the whole of the ventricle is constricted.
These features of the beat may be recognized in an ordinary beat, and
become very obvious when the beat is abnormally prolonged, as when
under the influence of certain drugs (atropine &c.).        From this normal
beat the beats or contractions caused by the closing or opening of a con
stant current differ in the following way.
   The closing- or making-beat always starts from the kathode, and travels
for  a variable distance towards the anode ; the opening- or breaking-beat
always starts from the anode, and travels towards the kathode, the beat
in  each being a   kind of peristaltic contraction, the features of which are
more readily recognized when it starts from the aortic end.
   This kathodic making-beat and anodic breaking-beat make their ap
pearance with all intensities of current up to the full strength of a
Daniell's cell (beyond this we have never gone), whatever be the position
of the electrodes.    •When the kathode is at the aortic end, the beat begins
there  ;   when at the auricular eud, the beat begins at the auricular end,
and in that case differs chiefly from the normal beat in being more or
less confined to that end.     "When the electrodes are placed at the sides
of the ventricle, the kathodic side    beats at the making, and the anodic
at the breaking, whichever side each be placed.
   We have not made many observations on the auricle alone, but have
seen enough to satisfy ourselves that the same law holds good there too,
that the making-beat is kathodic, and the breaking anodic.
   We need hardly point out the remarkable analogy presented by these
facts with those resulting from the passage of a constant current through

1875.]      Influence  of Electricity   on the   Hearts of Mollusks.        325
a  nerve, and the support they thus afford to Pfliiger's hypothesis, that
the establishment of kathelectrotonus        and the disappearance of anelec-
trotonus alone set in motion a stimulus-wave.
    When the ventricle and auricle are removed together from the body,
and placed between the electrodes, so that one electrode lies at the aortic
end of the ventricle and the other at the pulmonary end of the auricle,
the ventricle behaves, as far as the make- and break-beats are concerned,
very much as if the electrodes were applied directly to the ventricle alone.
Thus when the kathode is at the auricle there is a " making "-beat at the
auricular end of the ventricle and       a  " breaking "-beat at the aorta, and
vice versd.
    We have satisfied ourselves by numerons observations that, provided
the contraction    of the auricle   causes no distension of the ventricle, the
condition of the   one chamber    of the heart has no effect on that of the
other.    Between the two is a small ring of a sort of connective tissue,
traversed, as far as we can make out, by no nerves, which affords com
plete physiological isolation of the two chambers. Thus out of the body,
empty of blood, auricle and ventricle are two independent organs. Hence
when a current is passed in the manner described through both ventricle
and auricle, each part undergoes a separate physiological polarization, the
auricular end of the ventricle becoming kathodic or anodic as the case
may be, just as if the current were applied to the ventricle alone, account
being taken of the weakening of the current through the additional re
sistance offered by the auricle. This, at least, is the only explanation we
can give of the undoubted fact, that, with some modifications to be men
tioned afterwards, the effect of the constant current is the same on the
 ventricle with the auricle attached as on the ventricle alone.
    Besides the mere occurrence of the kathodic making- and the anodic
 breaking-beat, there are several facts worthy of attention.           These we
 have studied chiefly on the     ventricle   with  the auricle attached ; but we
 see no reason to doubt that the same facts appear when the ventricle
 alone is used.
    When the period during which the current         passes 'is very short, when
 the current is very rapidly      made    and  broken,  the two contractions are
 replaced by one. This contraction or beat begins at the kathode, i. e. is
 aortic or auricular according to the position of that electrode.
    Here, again, is  a curious parallel    to the view so generally adopted in
 reference to the behaviour of nerves towards the constant current, viz.
that the establishment of kathelectrotonus is a stronger stimulus than
the disappearance of anelectrotonus.
    When exceedingly feeble currents are employed, it frequently happens
 that  a momentary     application of the current, a rapid make and break,
 produces no contraction or beat. Nevertheless such a current, if applied
  for several seconds, will give, as usual, a kathodic making- and an anodic
 breaking-beat.

  326      Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the                    [Mar. 18,
     The    absence   of a beat on a momentary      application might be explained
   by supposing that the effect of       the  too rapidly succeeding break inter
  feres with the effect of the immediately preceding make. But, on the
  one hand, we have no positive indication of the possibility of such an in
  terference (and there are reasons for thinking it extremely unlikely),
  while the normal character of the kathodic beat, when it does occur with
  a stronger current,     distinctly opposes such    a view.    On the other hand,
  a distinct interval does exist between the making of the circuit and the
  commencement of the contraction, an interval easily recognizable by the
  eye, though, in the absence of any graphic method, we have been unable
  to measure it. We conclude, therefore, that, in order to produce the
  maximum effect of even the making kathodic beat, a certain time
  is required.     This time is longer for weak currents than for strong; and
  currents sufficiently weak may be applied for a short time without pro
 ducing any beat, the maximum effect not having time to develop itself,
 though the beat does appear when the action of the same current is
 prolonged.
     Sufficient time being allowed for the production of the beat, the strength
 of the kathodic making-beat will depend otherwise entirely on the strength
 of the current (the irritability of the tissues of the ventricle being sup
 posed to be constant).
     The strength of the anodic breaking-beat depends, however, in a pecu
 liar way on the duration of the current.           Up to a certain point the more
 prolonged the action of current the stronger is the anodic beat ; but a
 limit is soon reached, after which the strength of the anodic beat is dimi
nished by further prolongation of the action of the current. We have
 not gone into this point fully, but the result is evidently connected with
a so-called
                " exhaustion " of the tissue.
     We have called the contraction which takes place at the make or break
 "  a beat."    We think we are justified in giving it this name, though it
 differs, as we have pointed out, from the normal beat in some particulars.
 Our strongest reason for doing so is as follows : —
     When the ventricle and auricle are placed between the electrodes, so
that the kathode is against the auricle and the anode against the aortic
end of the ventricle, the kathodic making-beat is followed by a second, by
a   third, and    by sometimes several beats,  all kathodic   in their features, i. e.
starting from the kathode and travelling towards the anode.                 In other
words, a rhythmic pulsation is set going at the kathodic end.
    It  is impossible to regard these beats as simple contractions caused by
the    stimulus-wave,      started, like the stimulus-wave in a nerve, by the
establishment of kathelectrotonus.         They are evidently actual beats, whose
occurrence is favoured        by the conditions   brought about by the action of
the current (fig. 10, p. 343.).
    Of these the first (the ordinary making-beat) is always (as far as we
have seen) the strongest.          The succeeding ones diminish in intensity,

and the intervals between the beats         generally become
                                                        increasingly pro
longed (see fig. 13).
   When the current is maintained for a short time only (10 seconds), the
appearance is produced as if the heart were beating during the whole time
of the passage of the current (fig. 11).
   The anodic breaking-beat           is,
                                   as far as our observations go, always single,
is  never followed by       series of beats (that         is,
                                                          of course, when the
ventricle    one which  is a
          is                incapable of spontaneous pulsation).
   We conclude that the constant current throws the tissue in the neigh
bourhood of the kathode into such           condition as
                                            a                favourable for the
                                                                is
development    of beats ; that   this effect, though taking some time for its
production, reaches its maximum very soon after the making of the cir
cuit, and thenceforward diminishes gradually.
   In the neighbourhood of the anode, on the other hand, the tissue                  is
thrown into    a  condition unfavourable for the production of beats, the
beats which have originated in the kathodic region ceasing as they approach
the anode.     The rebound, however, which follows upon the breaking of
the circuit develops    a  beat, with the occurrence of which the tissue
returns to     anormal condition of equilibrium, and no further beats
occur.
   Such are the facts which may be observed when the kathode             placedis
against the auricle, and the anode against the aortic end of the ven
tricle.
   One would naturally expect that similar results, mutatis mutandis,
would be obtained when the kathode was placed at the aortic end of the
ventricle, and the anode at the auricle.   Such, however,  not the case.
                                                                     is
   When the kathode     at the aorta there
                        is                    only kathodic making- and
                                                is        a
an anodic breaking-beat.    Between the two the ventricle, as     general  a
rule, remains perfectly quiet (see figs. 12     9). There
                                                 &           thereforeis             a
functional difference between the auricular and aortic ends of the ven
tricle.
    Led by the apparent analogy of the vertebrate heart, one might                   be
inclined to infer that there was an automatic mechanism present at the
auricular end of the ventricle, but none at the aortic end.
    This view, however,     directly negatived
                            is                    the following facts —

    The aortic end will, in active and favourable hearts, continue to beat
spontaneously for some time after being separated from the rest of the
ventricle.
    When, as we shall presently have occasion to mention,     spontaneously
                                                                     a
beating  ventricle issubmitted   to the action of the constant current, the
beats begin at the aortic end, and are frequently entirely confined to the
 aortic end when that end       made kathodic.

  The greater mass of the contractile tissue of the ventricle                      lies towards
the auricular end.         If   the ventricle were supposed to be bisected trans
versely by a straight           line drawn across           it,
                                                       and its constituent fibres
regarded as so many straight lines, representing so many forces, those
forces might be considered as applied at   point on the auricular side

that straight line.
   If we, then, suppose (we shall presently state our reasons for such                         a
supposition) that the rhythmic impulse     generated by changes in all the
                                                       is
fibres, that impulse would naturally manifest itself first, as in fact does,            it
at the auricular end.
  Moreover,          since the heart was first formed, each beat has been taking
place after   fixed normal fashion, beginning at the auricular end. Hence
                a

                                  it            may) of each part

tuated and regulated to such conditions as are involved in the normal
beat beginning at the auricular end.  One would therefore expect that,
even under abnormal conditions,     would be easier to call forth
                                              it                  beat                   a

the heart  divided into two pieces the auricular end would manifest

rhythmic beat more readily than the aortic end, though each end were
absolutely possessed of the power of rhythmic pulsation.
  This     actually the case.
           is                 The aortic end, separated from the auricular
end, will, under favourable                 beat spontaneously, but will
                                       circumstances,
not do so with the same readiness as will the auricular end.  Under the
influence of the constant current, the beats of  spontaneously beatmg

heart may be made to begin at and be confined to either the aortic or the
auricular end, but not indifferently they appear most readily at the

auricular end. Under the influence of the constant current, the heart,
otherwise at rest, may be made to beat spontaneously at the auricular
end, but not at all, or with great difficulty, at the aortic end.
   So far concerning the action of the constant current on the ventricle
at rest.
  We have already been led to anticipate                    some   of the results     gained   by
applying the constant current to      heart spontaneously beating.

  These are somewhat more difficult to analyze, on account of the greater
susceptibility of the tissue, and the greater variations in irritability result
ing from treatment.

will be followed by events the causes of which are sought for partly
in the reaction following upon the strong contraction caused                the           by
break.

 1875.]      Influence of Electricity on the Hearts     of Mollusks.       329
    To avoid these difficulties we have generally employed a current so
weak, that a momentary application of it to the beating heart produced
no appreciable result.
    During the passage, however, of such a weak current very marked
effects make their appearance.
    "Whatever the position of the electrodes, whether the current be directed
longitudinally, with the kathode at the auricular end or at the aortic end,
or transversely or obliquely, in all cases the normal beat is modified in
such a way that the contraction begins at the kathode, and is more or
 less limited to the neighbourhood of the kathode. Thus, when the kathode
is placed at the auricular end of the ventricle, the part immediately round
the kathode contracts first, and the contraction passes down in a vermi
cular manner towards the anode, sometimes a very little way, sometimes a
considerable distance.     When the kathode is placed at the commencement
of the aorta, the contractions begin at the aorta and pass upwards towards
the auricular end.
    Being thus partial, the beats may be said to be weaker than normal,
the more so the more they are confined to the kathode.        Their feebleness
 seems to be more evident with stronger currents (not so strong, however,
as to produce an initial contraction) than with weaker ones.
    We have not been able to satisfy ourselves as to any marked or constant
change in the rhythm taking place.
    These kathodic beats are succeeded, on breaking the current, by one or
more markedly strong beats of a reverse direction, beginning at the anode
and travelling towards the kathode.
    In some cases the reversal has been seen to take place during the
passage of the current, the last few beats beginning at the anode, but not
then exhibiting .the same increase of strength which is seen in the anodic
beats succeeding the breaking of the current.
    This last observation illustrates the fact that the effect of the constant
current, like that of the tetanizing current, is at its maximum effect near
the commencement, and thence declines with greater or less rapidity, the
tissue becoming insensible to the current. In this case insensibility was
 reached after the current had been passing a very short time ; and it is
interesting to remark that, though the direct effect of the current thus
became lost, the reaction caused by the action of the current in the first
part of the period was able to manifest itself by the anodic beats.
    Thus, like the initial and final beats observed when the ventricle is at
rest before the application of the currents, the apparently spontaneous
beats always originate at the kathode, are more or less confined to the
kathodic region, and, according to the position of the electrode, may be
 witnessed either at the auricular or at the aortic end.
    As with the heart at rest, however, so with the heart in spontaneous
 movement, there is a functional difference between the aortic and the
auricular ends.

330     Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the               [Mar.  18,
   This difference is most readily observed when the ventricle with       the
auricle attached is placed between the electrodes than when the ventricle
alone is subjected to the action of the current, though we have observed
the same phenomena in the latter case also.
   When the anode is placed at the aorta, and the kathode at the auricle,
a very feeble   current produces no appreciable effect, except that perhaps
the beats are rather feebler and somewhat quicker (fig. 5, p. 342).
   The   same  current, applied to the same heart in the opposite direction
(that is, with the kathode at the' aorta and the anode at the auricle),
distinctly inhibits the ventricle, so that it remains in diastole during the
whole time of the passage of the current, and resumes its beat on the
current being broken.
   This inhibition is very clearly shown in fig. 7. Here advantage was
taken of a curious secondary rhythm (fig. 6), which we have had more
than one opportunity of witnessing.         The ventricle, after a period of
quiescence, began to beat, at first feebly with long pauses, then more
rapidly and strongly.     Having reached a maximum, the beats similarly
declined, and thus a new period of quiescence was again begun. This
alternation of rhythmic beats and quiescence was observed for a loug
time.
   It will be seen  that when the constant current (which was     exceedingly
weak, inasmuch as the resistance-circuit        only offered a single ohm, or
even only a fraction of an ohm resistance) was thrown into the heart at
one of the ventricle's beating periods, no effect was produced when the
anode was at the aorta, but distinct inhibition when the kathode was at
the aorta.
   During the period of quiescence the effect of the current is very much
what we have already described as that of the constant current on a ven
tricle which has ceased beating, viz. that when the anode is at the aorta,
and when, consequently, the auricular end of the ventricle becomes
kathodic, a rhythmic beat tends to make its appearance, but when the
auricular end is made anodic, no beats make their appearance (fig. 8).
   The explanation we would give of these facts (very similar to that given
at p. 328) is as follows : —
   The current employed was a very feeble one, rendered all the more
feeble, as far as its effect on the ventricle was concerned, by the fact of
some of     it having been occupied in effecting the polarization      of  the
auricle.
   When the kathode is placed at the aorta, the auricular end of the ven
tricle becomes anodic. Hence, as we have already seen, the beats would,
if the current were of a sufficient intensity, while absent at the auricular
end, be present at and start from the aortic end.        We have already seen
that (he auricular end is more sensitive than the aortic end. Hence, with
a sufficiently weak current, as in the case in point, the auricular end being
more affected than the aortic end, the beafs are inhibited at the auricular

 end while as yet the current is unable to produce the beats at the aortic
 end, and the result is an apparent general inhibition of the whole
 ventricle.
   The inhibition thus produced                   is,
                                       as far as we can see,    distinct inhi       a
bition that is, the heart, which previously was beating regularly, stops
       ;
beating when the current        thrown into
                                     is                        it,
                                                 remains in diastole during
the short time the current continues to pass through         and resumes its  it,
beat on the current being removed.
   The occurrence of inhibition is, then, here matter of degreea      depends            ;   it
on the existence of    certain relation between the irritability of the ven
                            a
tricle and the strength of the current employed.      When      stronger cur        a
rent  isemployed, the beats, while continuing to be absent at the anode,
make their appearance at the kathode, and the heart, though beating
quite differently from the normal, can no longer be said to be inhibited.
There   isno room here for any theory of special inhibitory mechanism,

              a
was exalted at the kathode and depressed at the anode, the inhibitory
mechanism was by weak currents exalted at the anode and depressed at
the kathode. Such  view would be either simply

   This pause must be due to reaction taking place in the kathodic

  end hinders any great increase in the total force of the beats — so that the
  direct effect of the current is manifested only, if at all, in a quickening
  of the beat, while the after effect is distinctly inhibitory, to such an  extent
  as not to be obscured by the reaction, in the way of exaltation,          which
  takes place at the (anodic) aortic end. In other words, whichever its
  direction, in the one case by action, in the other by reaction, a sufficiently
  weak current leaves a balance in favour of inhibition.
     Though, by reason of the less susceptibility of the aortic end and the
   consequently slighter development in that region of a rhythmic beat,
  we are less able to judge of what is going on in that region during the
  passage of the current, we may, we venture to think, assume that the
  changes there are of fundamentally the same kind as at the auricular end-
  that is to say, that the total effect of the passage of the current would
  at this end too be greater in the direction of inhibition than of exaltation.
  A  sufficiently weak current, then, passed lengthwise through the ventricle
  in either direction, whether from aorta to auricle or from auricle to aorta,
  has an   inhibitory effect (when the period of reaction is included)     greater
  than its exalting effect.
     If we suppose such a current to be momentarily passed through the
  ventricle between any two beats, its effect therefore, as far as it went,
 would be to prolong the diastole. The effect might not be very obvious ;
 it might be so small as to escape detection by itself, but it might be made
 manifest in the following way : — The effect of the current, as we have
 in all cases seen, whether exalting or inhibitory, takes some time to esta
 blish, and lasts longer than the actual passage of the current. Hence, if
 a momentary current like the above be succeeded before the next beat by
 a second similar one, the effect of the second would be added to the first,
 and the diastole still further prolonged.      By means of momentary cur
 rents, repeated so rapidly that the effect of one had not passed off before
 the next began to tell, the diastole would be so prolonged that the inhibi
 tory effect of the rfurrent would be undeniable.
     Moreover, though we have used the longitudinal application of the
 current as a means of analyzing its effects, there is nothing to prevent a
 similar explanation being given of the inhibitory effects of a weak momen
 tary current passed transversely, or in any direction, through the ventricle
or through the auricle.       The inhibitory effect of the longitudinal current
 depends essentially on the fact that the total effect of the current, when
 the after effects are included, is one of depression, though it has partial
 elements of exaltation ; and this will hold good whatever be the position
of the electrodes, provided that the current be of a certain intensity in
relation to the irritability of the tissue.
     We conclude, then, that the clear and obvious inhibition brought about
by sufficiently rapid repetitions of momentary currents (such as single
induction-shocks) of a certain feebleness is due to the summation of a
number of slight inhibitions, the occurrence of each single inhibition

 1875.]            Influence    of Electricity        on the   Hearts of Mollusks.             333
 depending on the fact that the total depressing effect of the current
 on the rhythmically beating tissue is greater than the total exalting
 effect.
     It
      may seem strange to speak of a stimulus as producing a depressing
effect ; but reflection will show that it is quite what ought to be
expected.
   "We have in the foregoing contented ourselves with speaking of the
 tissue in the neighbourhood                 of the electrodes
                                                       as being                    in   a kathodic
or anodic condition             as    themay be.
                                            case    We did so                       because,   not
 having examined          the condition of the electric currents of the ven
 tricle, we hesitated in using the terms kathelectrotonus and anelectro-
 tonus.
     We know, however, that muscle is capable of being thrown, in the intra-
polar region, into an electrotonic condition, and that (quite in accordance
 with all the results recorded above) this condition lasts after the removal
 of the current. We therefore shall probably not err in supposing that
 the polarization of the cardiac tissue, which is obviously a result of the
 constant current, is more or less allied to that kind of polarization which
 we call electrotonus.
     Now the electrotonic condition of nerve or muscle differs essentially
 from the polarization of any dead matter in this, that it is essentially a
function of the vital activity of the substance polarized. May we interpret
 this as meaning that the change in muscle or nerve which constitutes the
 electrotonic condition is brought about and maintained, not solely at the
 expense of the energy of the current, but also, perhaps chiefly, at the
expense     of   the energy    of   the tissue   itself!
     If
     so, then we may argue that while in the normally beating heart all
the energy of the tissue is used for the production of the beat, when a
constant current is passed through it some of this energy, in addition to
the energy of the current itself, is used in establishing anelectrotonus
and kathelectrotonus.    There must therefore, as the result of the polari
zation, be less energy (for the time being) available for the purposes of
pulsation.
   The idea of the exalting influence of a stimulus arises naturally from
the fact that the stimulus may, if sufficiently intense, give rise to a con
traction ; and it seems at first sight contradictory that one and the same
thing should produce apparently exactly opposite effects.
     Itis very easy, however, to trace, in the beating ventricle of the snail's
heart, the transition from inhibition to the production of a contraction or
artificial beat.
     One     in this transition is shown in fig. 4.

     Here   a weakconstant current passed through the ventricle longi
tudinally from auricle to ventricle (and thus most favourable for inhibi
tion) caused, when the              passage was momentary         (i.   e.   was removed before
it   had time to produce its full effect, and thus was reduced, so to speak,

in its action much below its normal strength), simply a brief inhibition,
indicated by the greater length of the diastole marked a.
   The same current, allowed to act on the tissue a sufficient time for it to
produce its maximum effect, gave rise to a making- and breaking-beat, the
making-beat being what we have called kathodic (starting from the aortic
end in this case), the breaking anodic (starting from the auricular end).
The current was sufficiently strong while inhibiting the auricular end to
cause a kathodic beat of the aortic end.
   This same current would, if sufficiently increased in strength, have been
able to produce, on a momentary passage, the same effect as it has in the
above observation by prolonged passage, with this exception, that there
 would be one visible beat only instead of two.
   In this way, by simply varying the intensity of the current, we get
either inhibition or contraction.
   (It will be observed that in fig. 2 the kathodic beat is followed by a
pause, as is also the anodic beat ; and a single contraction produced by
the momentary application of a stronger current would show a similar
pause. These pauses may be regarded as partly due to the effects of
the contractions —that         is,
                           to what    commonly spoken of as exhaustion
                                              is                                      ;
but   itobvious, from all our preceding observations, that they are partly

due to the direct inhibitory effect of the current.)
  There is, then, no absolute contradiction in the fact of     current pro
                                                                      a

when    beat does take place, the essentially depressing effect of the cur

exhaustion.

simple inhibitory pause, and     more difficult to analyze.

                                On a Secondary Rhythm.
  We would wish to call attention to the peculiar secondary rhythm, an
example of which     shown in fig. 6. The characters of the rhythm are
                        is
very marked.    The heart, after remaining for some seconds in an appa
rently perfectly quiescent state, gives beat hardly recognizable even
                                                        a
under the microscope.    This            is
                                 succeeded                  by
                                                feeble beats, which, though
not with complete regularity, increase in force, with shortening intervals,
until   maximum
        a             reached, after which the beats decrease in force,
                         is
and the intervals lengthen, until perfect quiescence             is
                                                          again reached.
   A somewhat similar secondary rhythm has been observed in the verte
brate heart as the result of prolonged stimulation of the pneumogastric
nerve (compare Luciani, Arbeiten phys. Anstalt, Leipzig, 1873, vii.
Jahrgang, p. 113). We have noticed       several times in the snail's heart
                                                   it                                 ;

  1875.]     Influence of Electricity on the Hearts of Mollusks.           335
 and, as far as we know, the heart had in each instance been treated, in
  some way or other, by electric currents.
    We are totally unable to give any explanation of the phenomenon ; and
 though we have tried in various ways to produce it artificially at will, have
 always failed to do so.
     It suggests the curious inquiry whether, during the quiescent periods,
 the heart is absolutely at rest, or in reality executing pulsations too small
 to be visible.   We have been unable to detect any indications of such
 invisible beats, and the marked length of the first and last diastole in each
 active phase would seem to indicate that the median portion at least of
 each quiescent phase is occupied by a prolonged diastole of absolute
 quiescence.
     We might further speculate as to whether similar secondary rhythms,
 marked, not of course by absolute quiescence, but by a more or less pro
 nounced rise and fall of cardiac activity, may not exist under normal cir
 cumstances — whether they may not, for instance, be diurnal phases of the
 heart's own nutrition   ; and also as to whether the normal pulse-phase
 may not be made up of small, more rapid, oscillations, bearing the
 same relation to it as it does to the larger rhythm we are speaking of.
    Lastly, if the heart of the snail were a barrel-shaped organ, like that of
 a Tunicate, with each end equipollent to the other, instead of being a
 conical mass as it is, with a wholly preponderating auricular end, it is
 easy to see how such a- secondary rhythm as the one we have described
 would, if started at each end of the tube at different times, produce the
 well-known alternating action so characteristic of the Tunicate heart.
                 Experiments on the Hearts of other Mollusks.
    The foregoing observations on the heart of the snail were made by us
 together in the Physiological Laboratory at Cambridge.
    During a stay at the Zoological Station at Naples, in the month of
 November last, Mr. Dew-Smith made several observations on the hearts
of Sepia and Aplysia, with the view to ascertain whether they would
behave towards electric currents in the same way as the heart of the
snail.    We hoped, too, they perhaps might       be found  more convenient
for the purposes of experiment ; this hope, however, was not realized.
    In the first place the heart of the Sepia, though it will beat when
removed from the body, can be got to do so with extreme difficulty, and
then for a short time only. The observations consequently had to be
conducted on the heart in situ, and for this reason, as was explained in
the case of the snail, were robbed of much of their value.
    Moreover the peculiar shape of the ventricle of the Sepia's heart, with
it« two aorte and its two branchial sinuses, render it much less suitable
for the purpose in hand than the more compact and simple ventricle of
the snail.
    Nevertheless  the following results were arrived at : —

836      Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the              [Mar. 18,
   Cut into two,   bo as to divide one aorta and the branchial  sinus of one
side from the other aorta and the branchial sinus of the other side, each
half of the Sepias heart continued to beat rhythmically.
   Hence there cannot be a single automatic nervous centre for the ven
tricle of the Sepias heart.
   No nerve could be discovered, the stimulation of which would produce
inhibition of the heart after the fashion of the vertebrate pneumogastric.
    The interrupted current applied directly to the ventricle did, under
favourable circumstances, produce a stoppage of the rhythm, the heart
remaining in diastole and resuming its beat on the removal of the
 current.
    Mingle induction-shocks and the make and break of a constant current
appeared to produce the same effects in Sepia as in the snail, sometimes
 causing a contraction and sometimes having as a result a more or less
 distinct inhibition.
    During the passage of a constant current exactly the same phenomena
 were apparent as in the case of the snail, the beats always starting from
 the kathode and travelling towards the anode. This effect could, in fact,
 be seen even more distinctly iu the case of Sepia thau of the snail.      By
 placing the electrodes in a proper position     the course of the pulsation
 along the ventricle might be at pleasure reversed.
    In general we may, we believe, safely conclude that what we have
 found to be the case with the snail's heart, holds good also, in funda
 mental points, for the heart of Sepia.
    It was hoped that the large specimens of Aplysia which were at hand
 at the Station would prove of valuable assistance.         The difficulty of
 working with them, owing to the contractions of the body and the un
 willingness of the heart to beat out of the body, prevented, however,
 any satisfactory observations being made with them.
    As in Sepia, so in Aplysia, no nerve could be found, stimulation of
 which would cause direct inhibition of the heart.
    Three specimens of Salpa came into Mr. Dew-Smith's hands.
    In these two platinum electrodes were thrust through the body, so
 that their points came to the neighbourhood of the heart, the pulsations
 of which could be readily observed with the naked eye and counted. The
  position of the electrodes was such that a current sent through them
  would pass in large measure lengthwise through the heart.
    The effect of the interrupted current was very remarkable.      During its
  passage the  heart, which, according to wont, had previously been alter
  nating in direction after every 6 to 15 beats, continued to beat for two
 minutes entirely in one direction at a quickened rate.    No inhibition could
 be produced, even with strong currents.
    We quote this single observation      because it was the only one that
 could be made. Bad weather setting in prevented any more Salpte being
 obtained before Mr. Dew-Smith left for England ; otherwise it would

have been extremely interesting to have studied the action of the con
stant current.
                            General Considerations.
    The beat of the ventricle of the snail's heart may, we venture to think,
be regarded as a rhythmic movement of purely protoplasmic nature.
    The constituent fibres, if fibres we may venture to call them, are not
isolated like the fibres of a vertebrate voluntary muscle, but physiologi
cally continuous ; so that any change set up in any part of the ventricle
can be propagated over the whole of it in the same way that a con
traction-wave set going at any point in a striated fibre is propagated
along the whole length of the fibre, or that a contraction-wave is propa
gated from the point of stimulation along a nerveless ureter.        (Compare
Engelmann, Pfliiger's Archiv, ii. p. 243.)
    [The ease with which the entire ventricle of the snail can be completely
polarized by the constant current may be regarded as another proof of
the physiological continuity of its tissue. The want of conformity be
tween the directions of its fibres and those of the paths naturally taken by
the current in passing from one electrode to the other, forbids us to sup
pose that the effects described above can be the combined result of a
number of independently polarized fibres.]
    The changes which result in the rhythmic beat take place normally in
 all parts of the tissue, so that any moiety of the ventricle isolated from
 the rest is, under satisfactory nutritive conditions, able to execute rhyth
 mic movements. (The isolation may be mechanical, as by section, or phy
 sical, as by polarization with the constant current.)
    When the ventricle is cut in half, the two halves do not necessarily
 beat synchronously.     Each half has a rhythm of its own, which may or
 mav not be (and in nearly every instance is not) the same in both halves.
 But the rhythm of     each half is, under favourable circumstances, perfect
 and complete    ; and the same may be said of still smaller pieces.
    Now the normal beat of the entire ventricle is         a complicated    act.
 There are in it definite sequences. Certain fibres or certain parts of the
 tissue begin to contract before others, and certain parts continue to con
 tract after others have ceased to do so. The beat is not a simple con
 traction-wave passing uniformly from one end to the other, or radiating
 equally in all directions from one point, but a peculiar movement, having
 for its object the ejection of fluid from the cavity in the best possible
 manner, and is hence a coordinated movement.
     The aortic half of the ventricle, separated from the auricular half,
 starts each of its beats quite independently of what is going on in the
 ventricular half, and vice versa. When the two are physologically con
 tinuous, the changes in the one are determined by the changes in the
 other.    In order that a normal beat may be fairly carried through, the
 auricular half must not start its contraction until the aortic half is ready to

338     Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the                [Mar. 18,
carry  it on.   Otherwise  there would be not a regular beat, but an irre
gular skirmish of contractions.
   We are driven, therefore, to conclude that in the normal condition,
where the tissue is physiologically continuous, there are means of com
munication    between all parts ; so that the auricular half, for instance, on
the one hand, feels, if we may use the phrase, what is going on in the
aortic half, and, on the other, exerts an influence     on those changes in
order to accommodate them to the changes taking place in itself, and
vice vend.
   We believe that all our knowledge of protoplasm (and we might point
especially to the harmonious working of groups of cilia and ciliated cells)
favours the idea of the existence of such a consensus among the several
parte of any mass of protoplasm which acts together as a whole.            Nor
ought there really to be any difficulty in supposing such communications
to be effected by molecular movements in the undifferentiated protoplasm ;
for there must be in protoplasm many kinds of currents and internal
motions for which we have at present no names. We might further
urge that there must be in undifferentiated protoplasm the rudiments of
all the fundamental functions present in the differentiated structures of
higher animals.     Thus the process by which the condition of the aortic
region of the snail's ventricle is communicated to the auricular region
seems to be the rudiment of the muscular sense.
   Adopting some such view as this, we are naturally led to what we
venture to think is a more satisfactory interpretation of the part played
by ganglia in rhythmic and automatic movements than the one com
monly adopted.
   The prevalent conception, based on the view put forward by Sir James
Paget in his well-known Croonian lecture, if we understand it aright, is
somewhat as follows : — Taking, for instance, the automatic ganglia of the
heart, motor impulses are rhythmically generated in the ganglionic nerve-
cells, as the result of the nutrition of these nerve-cells themselves, in
fluenced, according to circumstances, by afferent impulses starting from
sentient surfaces internal or external of the heart itself, or brought-from
afar by the pneumogastric or other nerves.
   These motor impulses reaching the muscular fibres call forth a beat,
the contractile   elements being, so to speak, mere passive instruments of
the nerve-cells, their condition affecting the beat only so far as its force
is concerned, inasmuch as, with the same stimulus, the contraction         will
be greater in a more irritable, and smaller in a less irritable fibre.
   Now every one must have felt a difficulty in supposing that the nutri
tion of a few minute nerve-cells should be all in all, while that of the
large mass of the continually and rapidly changing muscular tissue should
go for nothing in determining what is at least quite as important as the
force of each contraction, viz. the rate of rhythm. Moreover such a view
puts, to a certain extent, asunder what nature has evidently, by intricate

 1875.]      Influence of Electricity on the Hearts      of Mollusks.       339
ties, joined together — the force and character of the systole and the length
 of the diastole.
    We would suggest that the ganglia are not automatic in function in
the above sense, but simple coordinators.       The contractile tissue of the
frog's ventricle, arranged in bundles isolated by connective tissue, is not
physiologically continuous, though each bundle formed by the opposition
of branched sheathless muscular fibres may be continuous throughout
itself ;  and the consensus we spoke of just now cannot be effected by
molecular communications.        Hence the existence of differentiated organs,
in the form of nerves and ganglia, by means of which indications of the
condition of the isolated constituents of the ventricle (and, we may add,
of the isolated auricles and ventricle) are carried, as items of a muscular
sense, to a central organ, and thus the state of each part is made common
to all.    In  this central organ the advent and character of each beat is
determined     as the expression of the nutritive condition, not of the nerve-
cells only, but of the contractile elements as well.
   If this view of the function of automatic ganglia (which, it will be
observed, is simply a modification of Sir J. Paget's conception) be correct,
it is easy to understand why we have found no such organs in the phy
siologically continuous protoplasmic heart of the snail.
   It needs no such ganglia for the carrying on of its own rhythmic beat ;
nor does it need them to place it en rapport with the rest of the body of the
animal. The movements of the body determine the quantity of blood flow
ing to the heart ; the force and rapidity of the heart's beat is in direct ratio
to the quantity of blood distending its cavities ; and thus a harmony is
established between the movements of the body and the circulation quite
sufficient for the purposes of the snail's life, without the intervention of
that nervous regulative mechanism supplied to the vertebrate heart by
the various cardiac ganglia, the pneumogastric, and other nerves.
                                    Resume.
   We have seen that, in the region of the kathode, a condition which we
have compared with the kathelectrotonus of nerves is set up. This con
dition we will not at present venture to characterize moro closely than
to say that it is favourable to the production of rhythmic beats.        At the
anode precisely the opposite effect takes place.
   We have shown that both conditions require some time for their com
plete establishment, and that when established they at once begin to
decline.    Thus they speedily     reach  a  maximum      and more gradually
subside.
   The setting up of kathelectrotonus will, if sufficiently intense and
the maximum be fairly reached, give rise to a contraction or beat.          The
giving way     of anelectrotonus, though   with  less ease,  will also  cause  a
beat.    Both the establishment of anelectrotonus and the disappearance of
kathelectrotonus    are unfavourable to the production of the rhythmic beat.

340         Dr. M. Foster and Mr. A. G. Dew-Smith on the                      [Mar.   18,
   Thus the effect produced by m constant current at each pole is mixed,
being partly favourable and partly unfavourable to a beat.
   The total effect of the pas«age of a current, whether a contraction be
called forth or not, is unfavourable to the rhythmic beat; and when
currents too weak or of too short duration to produce a visible contrac
tion are employed, the unfavourable effect alone becomes evident.
   •When the brief passage of a weak current is followed at a sufficiently
short interval by a similar brief passage, the unfavourable effects are, in
a measure, added together ; and thus, by repetition, a cumulative result
is reached.
    Hence it is that    a single    induction-shock,  too weak in itself to pro
duce either a contraction       or such a prolongation of the diastole as can be
satisfactorily measured, will,       if repeated rapidly     enough, produce      an un
mistakable inhibition.
    How far the observations we have made, and the explanations we have
offered, can be regarded as throwing any light on the working of the
vertebrate heart and on the general theory of inhibition, must be deter
mined by further inquiries. These we have already commenced, and hope
before long to lay some of our results before the Society.
              EXPLANATION OF THE DIAGRAMS (pp. 342, 343).
   They are all to be read from right to left.
   Each figure consists (except in the case of fig. 6) of three lines. Of these, one, gene
rally the upper, indicates the application of the stimulus.
  In the case of single induction-shocks, as in figs. 1 A 2, the descent of the line indi
cates the making, the ascent the breaking    of the primary current. Inasmuch as the
making-shock was alone employed, the breaking-shock being stopped, the descent in
these figures alone indicates stimulation.
   In figs. 3-13 the ascent in the line, generally indicated by x, marks the making, and
the descent, generally marked y, indicates the breaking of the current.
   The middle line (unless otherwise mentioned) indicates the beat of the ventricle.
   In figs. 1-8 the ascent, and in figs. 9-13 the descent, marks the commencement of
the beat.
  In no case does the interval between the ascent and descent in figs. 1-8, or descent
and ascent in figs. 9-13, in any way correspond to the length of the ventricular
systole.
  The marks on the bottom line in each figure indicate seconds.

  II. " On         the Absorption-Spectra of Metals volatilized                 by the
         Oxyhydrogen          Flame."      By  J. Norman       Lockyer,    F.R.S., and
         W. Chandler Roberts, Chemist of the Mint. Received
         February 4, 1875.
      The researches which have recently been published on the absorption-
  spectra of various metals, first by Roscoe and Schuster and subsequently
 by one of us *, establish beyond all question the facts that —
      L In addition to the well-known line-spectra, ehannelled-space spectra
 are produced by the vapours of certain metals ; and,
      II. Such spectra are produced by vapours which are competent to give
 at other times, not only line-spectra, but continuous spectra in the
 blue, or blue and red.
      As the temperature employed for the volatilization of the metals in the
 experiments to which we have referred did not exceed bright redness, or
 that at which cast iron readily melts, the range of metals examined was
 necessarily limited.          We have therefore considered it desirable to extend
 these observations to the less fusible metals, as well as to ascertain
 whether the spectra of those which were volatilized at the lower tempera
 ture would be modified by the application of a greater degree of heat. For
 this purpose we have employed the flame of an oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
 This instrument, devised by Sainte-Claire Deville and Debrayt, renders
 it possible to attain high temperatures with great facility, and Stas has
 already employed their method . in the distillation of silver t . The lime
 still arranged by him has been modified in that about to be described, in
 order that the metallic vapour might be conducted into a lime tube or
 tunnel heated to whiteness, so placed that a beam from an electric lamp
 could readily traverse it.

     The apparatus employed is shown in the figure, in which A is the
 block of lime § divided horizontally by a plane through the axis of the
 tube (B B'). this tube being 16 centims. long and 30 millims. diameter.
 The receptacle (C) communicates with the centre of B B', and is open at
 the upper surface of the lime block, in order to admit of the introduc
 tion of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe (D), which is provided with a thick
 nozzle of platinum 20 millims. in diameter.                The ends of the tunnel in

   and receptacle.
      An electric    lamp (IF), in      connexion  with a 30-cell      Bunsen's battery,
       was placed   opposite one end of the tube, and a spectroscope (G) opposite
       the other.    This last instrument was by Desaga, of Heidelberg, and its
       single prism, the angle of which was 60°, was capable of distinctly sepa
       rating the D lines, at the same time that it enabled us to see the whole
        spectrum in a single field of view, an essential point in such inquiries.
        The magnifying-power      of the telescope was 7'5 linear.
           Some   preliminary experiments indicated the advisability of increasing
        the length of the column of vapour.       To effect this,  a tube 30 centims.
        long was made in a fresh block of lime, the cavity         being arranged as
        before ; in each end a short accurately fitting iron      tube, luted with a
        mixture of graphite and fireclay, was inserted ; and      the total length of
        the column thus became 60 centims.
           The lime block (C) with its fittings was then placed in the charcoal-
       furnace (E), by means of which the whole could be raised to a high tem
        perature. As soon as the block was heated to bright redness, the metal,
        the vapour of which was to be examined, was introduced into the cavity
        (C), and the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe (D) was allowed to play
        on its upper surface, care being taken to employ an excess of hydrogen.
        In almost every case the metal experimented on was rapidly volatilized
        (the exceptions being gold and palladium).      The central portion of the

lime block was raised to a white heat by the action of the blowpipe. As
the glass plates rapidly became clouded by the condensation of the me
tallic vapours, it was necessary to adopt an arrangement by which they
could be easily replaced.      We may state that, among the precautions
which we adopted in order to assure ourselves that oxides were not pre
 sent to disturb the accuracy of the results, one of the glass plates was
 removed at the conclusion of each experiment, and the presence of an
 excess of hydrogen conclusively        proved by igniting it at the open
 end.
     We were enabled at any time, by modifying the conditions of       the gas-
 supply, to introduce the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen flame. It may
 further be stated that, with few exceptions, the metals were previously
 melted in a stream of hydrogen and enclosed, until experimented on, in
 sealed glass tubes. We ascertained that the effect of oxides, and of the
 metallic rain due to condensation, was to produce a general absorption
 obviously different from the special effects of absorption which we now
  proceed to record.

                                      Silver.
     Fifty grammes of pure metal were placed in the cavity (C),        and this
  amount produced a continuous supply of vapour for about 10 minutes.
     With the smaller thickness given by the first lime block, and with a
  less powerful blast, the spectrum of silver consisted of an absorption in
  the blue which at times extended almost to the green..
      With the elongated tube and a stronger blast an exquisite channelled-
  s pace absorption was observed, the channels being far enough apart to
  render them very conspicuous in the field of view ; at the same time
  there was continuous absorption in the blue.       It was specially observed
  that there was no absorption in the red.
      It may be interesting to note that the vapour of silver when condensed
  into fine particles, escaping into an atmosphere of hydrogen, is blue by
   reflected light.

    When the temperature was so high that the spectrum of the flame was
visible, au absorption was suspected in the violet ; and the appearance
did not change on one glass end being removed.
                                      Zinc.
    Many experiments were made on this metal; but there are several
 points connected with it which require further investigation, and we
therefore reserve our remarks on the spectrum of zinc for a future
 occasion.
                                   Cadmium.
    Under both conditions of thickness the vapour of cadmium gave, in
the blue only, an absorption which was very decided ; an absorption in
the red was also noticed which had not been observed in previous experi
ments when a low temperature was employed.
                              -   Manganese.
    A small quantity of this metal was prepared with great care by Mr.
Bayly, one of the assistant assayers, and it gave a distinct absorption
in the red and blue, with evidences of a channelled-space spectrum. In
a repetition of the experiment a more distinct channelled-space spectrum
 was observed.
                                     Iron.
    The metal employed had been obtained by electro-deposition in the
manner suggested by Mr. Jacobi.         Its vapour gave a slight continuous
absorption in the blue.
                                    Cobalt
also gave a slight continuous      absorption  in the blue, but  less than in
the case of iron.
                                    Nickel.
    This metal behaved in the   same manner as cobalt, the absorption being
about equal in amount.
                                  Chromium.
    The amount of metal volatilized was very small, but    a fine channelled-
space spectrum was observed.

    In results already published it is stated that at the low temperature
antimony gives a channelled-space spectrum.          In the present experi

 ments we observed merely absorption in the blue ; and this is the only
 case in which the effects at a high temperature were inferior to those at
 a low temperature.       As the purity of the metal first employed may be
 doubted, little reliance can be placed on these exceptional results.
                                     Bismuth.
    With the greatest thickness the absorption of bismuth is strikingly
 similar to that of iodine at a dull red heat. We have first a bank of
 continuous absorption in the blue with a sharp boundary on the less
 refrangible side, and then a channelled-space absorption throughout the
 entire green part of the spectrum reaching to D.
                                      Lead.
    This metal at first caused an absorption at both ends of the spectrum ;
 shortly afterwards the whole spectrum was extinguished.          As this is a
 readily   oxidizable metal, special care was taken to prove that a large
excess of hydrogen was present.
                                    Thallium.
    We are indebted to Mr. Crookes for       a generous supply of this metal.
 The characteristic green line of thallium was observed bright, the light of
 the arc not being reversed ; and it may be interesting to note that the
 vapour of this metal was incandescent five minutes after the withdrawal
of the flame.
                                       Gold.
    A distinct   absorption in the blue and red was observed, but there were
certainly no traces of a channelled-space spectrum.        The spectral lines
 due to the oxyhydrogen      flame were  very conspicuous.    It may be noted
that the amount of gold volatilized was only 0-01 oz. ; but this quantity
of metal was sufficient to produce an abundant supply of vapour.
                                   Palladium.
    This metal caused a distinct absorption in the blue, but no effect was
noticed at the red end of the spectrum.        There was no channelled-space
 spectrum, and the lines caused by the oxyhydrogen flame were barely
visible.
                                   Selenium.
    With the greatest thickness      employed a channelled-space     spectrum
was given by selenium.
                                     Iodine.
   It  will be remembered that, according to the results already published
by one of us, iodine vapour exhibits, at a low temperature, a channelled-
spaco spectrum, and a bank of absorption in the violet.           These later
experiments showed that, at the more elevated temperature, this bank

was broken up and disappeared, leaving a continuous         channelled-space
spectrum.
   These experiments, made at the Royal       Mint, were often prolonged for
many hours consecutively.       They involved much furuace-work of a pecu
liarly trying nature ; and we have much pleasure in acknowledging
the assistance we received from Mr. Edward Eigg, one of the assistant
assayers, who conducted many of the tedious manipulations with great
skill and patience.     We should also mention that the care exercised by
Joseph Groves, senior fireman, in the preparation of the furnace and the
lime-moulds,    contributed in no small measure to the success of the
experiments   .
   It appears to us that these experiments, conducted at the high tem
perature of the oxyhydrogen flame, go far to support the conclusions
which were drawn from the experiments at a lower temperature.           First,
in passing from the liquid to the most perfect gaseous state, vapours are
composed of molecules of different orders of complexity ; and second,
this complexity is diminished by the dissociating action of heat, each
molecular simplification   being marked by a distinctive spectrum.      There
is also an intimate connexion between the facility with which the final
stage is reached, the group to which the element belongs, and the place
which it "occupies in the solar atmosphere.
III.   " On  the Liquation, Fusibility, and Density of certain Alloys
      of Silver and Copper."        By W. Chandler Roberts, Chemist
      of the Mint. Communicated by Dr. Percy, F.R.S. Received
      March 11, 1875.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author states that the most remarkable physical property of silver-
copper alloys is a molecular mobility, in virtue of which certain combina
tions of the constituents of a molten alloy become segregated from the
mass, the homogeneous character of which is thereby destroyed.         These
irregularities of composition have long been known, and reference is
made to them in the works of Lazarus Erckern (1650) and of Jars
(1774). A very complete memoir was published in 1852 by Levol, who
did much towards ascertaining the nature and defining the limits of this
molecular mobility.     He discovered the important fact that an alloy con
taining 71-89 per   cent, of silver is uniform in composition. Its chemical
formula (Ag3 Cua)     and  peculiar structure led him to conclude that all
other alloys are mixtures of this, with excess of either metal.
   The electric conductivity of these alloys was studied in 1860 by Mat-
thiessen, who doubted the accuracy of Levol's theory, and viewed them
as " mechanical mixtures of allotropic modifications of the two metals in
each other."

350              On certain Alloys      of Silver and      Copper.        [Mar. 18,
   The author then described the experiments he made with a view to
determine the melting-points of a series of these alloys.               He adopted
Deville's determination      of the boiling-point   of  zinc (1040° C.) as the basis
of the inquiry, and ascertained, by the method of mixtures, the mean
specific heat of a mass of wrought iron between 0° C and the melting-
point of silver, which, as Becquerel showed, is the same as the boiling-
point of zinc.
   The mean of three experiments, which were closely in accordance,
gave 0-15693 as the specific heat ; and        it should be pointed out that this
number includes and neutralizes         several errors which would affect the
accuracy of the subsequent determinations.
   The melting-points of severer alloys were then determined by plunging
an iron cylinder into them and transferring the iron to a calorimeter. These
melting-points varied from 840° C to 1330° C, or through a range of
490° C. The alloys which occupy the lowest portion of the curve con
tain from 60 to 70 per cent, of silver.           The results are interesting, as
they show that the curves of fusibility and electric conductivity are very
similar.
   The author states that, in studying the phenomena of liquation, the
alloys were cast in red-hot moulds of firebrick in which the metal (about
50 oz.) could be slowly and uniformly cooled.              The results showed that
the homogeneity of Levol's alloy is slightly disturbed by this method of
casting ; and, on the other hand, that alloys which contain more than
71*89 per cent, of silver hardly show signs of rearrangement when the
solidification is gradually effected. Two alloys were examined, which
contained 63 and 33-3 per cent, of silver respectively.                  Both w,ere
found to be far from homogeneous.                In the case of the former the
arrangement was influenced by gravity, the base of the casting being
rich in silver.
    The density of pure silver and of Levol's homogeneous alloy while in
 the fluid state were then determined by the method described by Mr.
Eobert Mallet*, the metals being cast in conical vessels of wrought
iron. The results obtained were as follows : —
                                              Density fluid.    Density solid.

    In  the case of silver, the mean linear expansion deduced from this
 change of density is -00003721 per 1° C, which is nearly double the
 coefficient at temperatures below 100° C.

                                                      31st December,  1874.
    Dear Sir, — It is difficult, owing to the inexactness of the charts, to
 inform you of the positions of the Astronomical Stations in whose neigh
bourhood    I have been able to work in this island.      The German Station
is in Betsy Cove, the American at Molloy Point, Royal Sound.                  The
English Stations also are in this Sound, the second being situated about
three miles N. by W. of Swain's Haulover. The first English Station is
between these last two on the mainland, six or seven miles N.W. of
Three-Island Harbour, in what will be called Observatory Bay. Two
days before the Transit of Venus, a party under Lieut. Goodridge, R.N.,
was detached from the first English Station to observe the transit from
a position which he selected near the base of Thumb Peak.              I have not
yet been able to visit Betsy Cove.
    Observatory Bay is one of the minor inlets of a peninsula comprised
between two narrow arms of the sea.           One of these runs up from the
sound, along the western flank of the hills adjacent to Mount Crozier,
several miles, and terminates at a distance of three or four hours to the
north of us, and about four miles from the inlet near Vulcan Cove. The
other arm, opening nine or ten miles away to the southward, proceeds

in   a north-easterly direction to within three or four miles of the former,
and no great distance from Foundry Branch.
    Besides the inlets of the sea, numerous freshwater lakes present
obstacles to inland travelling. Some in this neighbourhood are two or
three miles in length, but in general they are not more than a mile long.
They are usually shallow, and appear to be uninhabited by fish. The
bogs and streams in this vicinity are not impassable, but can be traversed
with ease if ordinary care be taken.
     The most salient features of the landscape are the basaltic hills, with
 irregular terraces of rock on their sides, and broken cliffs at their sum
mits.     In lieu of grass, their slopes are clothed with banks and boulder
 like clumps of Azorella selago, excepting where rich damp loam affords a
 soil suitable for the Aecena and the Pringlea. Here and there a fern
 (Lomaria) and grass (Festuca) grow in the interspaces of the other
 plants.
     The climate of Royal Sound is far warmer and drier than we were
 led to expect it would be.     In November the weather was very pleasant ;
 since then it has deteriorated, though the snow has not again covered
 the ground as it did when we first arrived.            Probably the previous
 accounts of its meteorology were based upon observations taken in parts
 of the island where bad weather prevails ; or it may be that the condition
 of the country in winter has been presumed to be constant throughout
 the year.     In one respect we were rightly informed ; for usually when
 there is no breeze   there is a gale. A calm day is an exceptional event.
  Meteorological observations are being taken in Observatory Bay on board
                 '
  the ' Volage and by the sappers on shore.
     Corresponding with the unlooked for superiority in climate, a differ
  ence is noticeable in the vegetation of this part of the island. Some plants
  which occur at both extremities of the country display, in Royal Sound,
  marks    of luxuriance.    For instance, Pringlea antiscorbutica, which is
  elsewhere apetalous, here, in sheltered places, frequently develops petals —
  some flowers in the same inflorescence possessing one petal only, others
  having two, three, or four. And the petals are not always of a pale
 greenish colour, but occasionally are tinged with purple. Again, Lomaria
  alpina, which is mentioned in the flora as rare in the neighbourhood of
  Christmas Harbour, is excessively common and very finely grown here.
  There are also more species of flowering plants and of the higher orders
  of Cryptogamia here than were found by the Antarctic Expedition at
  the north of the island ; but there are fewer species of Mosses, Lichens,
  and Algae.    Their paucity, in comparison with those of the other district,
  is probably due to the nature of the rocks on land, and to the seclusion
  of the bay from the open sea. The additions to the flora are for the
  most part Falkland-Islands species.
     In speaking of the climate, it may be mentioned that the plants of Ker-
  guelen's Island are not (as was supposed) in flower throughout the year ;

 1875.]           Natural History of Kerguelen's Island.                       353
but, probably, some of them do not cease flowering until late in the winter.
When we first arrived in Royal Sound the ground was covered with snow,
and scarcely any thing had begun to come out.              The Pringlea was far
advanced in bud, barely commencing to blossom.               The Aecena was just
beginning to burst into leaf.     About the first week in November, Festuea
Cookii came out, and, a few days later, Azorella selago. The young fronds
of the ferns were just about to unroll. In the third week of the same
month, Montia fontanel and Aecena qflinis were in flower in a sheltered
spot, and Leptinella plumosa was first found in blossom. Galium antarc-
ticum appeared about the same date. A week later, Ranunculi** hydro-
philus and a Festuea {purpurascens ?) were out, and Lgeopodium clavatum
was sprouting.       By the middle of the month, Trioida and Lyallia ker-
guelensis and also Ranunculus     crasslpes    were in flower  ; the Pringlea was
everywhere past flowering (excepting upon the mountains), and Aira
antarctica began to shoot forth its panicles.        Before the end of the month
a Carex came out ; but Bulliarda and other plants delayed still.
    A  few   species  of Mammals     have been introduced         into the island.
Mice (evidently Mus musculus, L.) are common along the coast, and have
been found by us in various places.           The Rabbits, transported by order
of the Admiralty, from the convict settlement in Table Bay have been
                              '
landed by H.M.8. ' Volage in Royal Sound.               They share with the birds
holes of the Petrels, and are (it is almost superfluous to mention) pro
pagating freely.     Their favourite food is the Aecena ; but they occasion
ally eat JPHn^fea-leaves and gnaw away the green surface of Azorella.
In the   Crozettes, whose climate and flora are said to resemble those of
this island, rabbits have become extremely abundant, and so rank and
coarse that the sealers will not eat them.         Goats are increasing in num
bers on the leeward side of the mainland.
    Whales and Porpoises occasionally enter the Sound.               Old skulls of
the latter, wanting the lower jaw, are cast up here and there on the
beaches.
    Up to the present time,     I have captured      only two species of Seals — a
female Sea-Leopard      and two males of a Platyrhine Seal. The other kinds
frequent the more open parts of the coast and islands.
   Twenty-two species of birds at the fewest, perhaps twenty-three,            fre
quent Royal Sound, viz. a Chionis, a Cormorant, a Teal, a Tern, a Gull,
a Skua, eleven (perhaps twelve) Petrels, two Albatrosses, and three (per
haps four) Penguins.                  I
                           Of these have procured eggs of the first six ;
also of six Petrels, one Albatross, and two Penguins. The Thalassi-
dromce are preparing for laying.
    Fish are rather scarce in Observatory Bay. Only three species have
hitherto occurred to us, two of which are common under stones at low
water.     The remains of a Raia have also been picked up on one of the
islands by an officer of the ' Volage ;' but hardly sufficient is left to enable
the species to be determined.       It  is allied to  R. clavata and R. radiata.

     The entomology of the island is very interesting.         Most of the larger
  insects seem to be incapable of flight.     I have found representatives of
 the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Colembola.
     The Lepidoptera comprise a species of the Noetuina (as        I suppose) and
 one of the Tineina.     Of the first   I have not yet reared     the imago ; the
 larva is a moss eater and subterranean : the adult is probably as large
 as an Agrotis of medium size.       The species of Tineina is probably one of
 the Gelechida, judging from the form of the palpi. Its larva feeds on
 young shoots of Festucce, and sometimes spins a silken cocoon for the
 pupa.    The imago, of which the sexes are alike, has acute and very
 abbreviated wings, and the posterior pair extremely minute.            In repose
 the antenna; are widely separated and almost divaricate.           When the sun
 shines the adult is active, and, if alarmed, jumps to a distance of two or
 three inches at a time.     During its passage through the air the wings
 are vibrated.
     The Diptera are represented by species of the Tipulidae and Muscids.
  There are three of the former family. One of them is a small species of the
  Cecidomyidas, which is abundant in mossy places, and presents no marked
  peculiarity. Another seems to be a degraded member of the Tipulidae.
 The antennae have six joints, the palpi two ; the wings are ligulate and very
 minute.    It possesses halteres,  and the female has the ovipositor enclosed
 in an exposed   sheath.  Although it is unable to fly, it lives upon rocks in the

 of Enteromorpha. The third species has full-sized wings ; it was caught in
 the house. The indigenous Muscddae are very sluggish in their movements,
 and are incapable of flight.     Four species are common about here. One
 of them is abundant on Pringlea, crawling over the leaves.            When it is
 approached it feigns to be dead, and, tucking up its legs, drops down into
 the axils of the leaves ; or, if it happens to be upon a plane surface, one
 need only look at it closely and it throws itself promptly upon its back
 and remains motionless until the threatened danger is over, when it
 gradually ventures to move its limbs and struggle to regain its footing.
  Its wings are represented by minute gemmules, and it possesses halteres.
 The ovipositor is extended, its apical joint alone being retracted.          The
 penis is porrected beneath the abdomen, where it fits into a notch at the
 apex of the penultimate segment. The larva feeds on decaying vegetable
 matter.    Another species occurs on dead birds and animals, as well as
 beneath stones near the highest tide-mark.       It is completely destitute of
even the vestiges of wings and halteres.         The sexual organs are con
cealed.    It and the preceding species are rather smooth. A third species,
slightly hairy, is common amongst tide-refuse and on the adjacent rocks,
which are coated with stunted Enteromorpha, on which plant, inter alia,
the larva feeds.    It has very small  triangular rudiments of wings, slightly
emarginate near the apex of the costa, and possesses halteres. The sexual
organs are not exposed. The fourth species occurs amongst grass growing

earthworm is common, and a land-snail is very plentiful amongst the rocks
on the hills. This last appears to appreciate comparative heat, for speci

    In Observatory Bay, Ccelenterata are not numerous. One or two

 to belong to the Juncaceae. Lycopodium ekivatum and L. selago are com

 worked out as yet ; but amongst them are one or two species of Cladonia,

 Agaricus (PsaUiota) arvensis, Coprinus atramentarius, and a peculiar para

II.    "Experiments to ascertain the Cause of Stratification in
       Electrical Discharges in vacuo." By Warren De La Rue,
        Hugo W. Muller, and William Spottiswoode.      Received
       February 24, 1875.
  Some results obtained in working with a chloride-of-silver battery of
1080 cells in connexion with vacuum-tubes appear to be of sufficient
interest to induce us to communicate them to the Society, in anticipation
of the more detailed account of an investigation which is now being pro
secuted, and which     it is intended to continue, shortly, with a battery of
5000 cells, and possibly with a far greater number.
  The battery used up till now consists of 1080 cells, each being formed of
a glass tube 6 inches (15-23 centims.) long and         |
                                                   of an inch (1*9 centim.)
internal diameter; these are closed with a vulcanized rubber stopper
(cork), perforated eccentrically to permit the insertion of a zinc rod, care
fully amalgamated,     (0-48 centim.) of an inch in diameter and 4-5 inches
(11*43 ceutims.) long.   The other element consists of a flattened silver
wire passing by the side of the cork to the bottom of the tube and
covered, at the upper part above the chloride of silver and until it passes
the stopper, with thin sheet gutta percha for insulation, and to protect it
from the action of the sulphur in the vulcanized corks ; these wires are
 *faof an inch (0-16 centim.) broad and    inches (20-32 centims.) long. In
                                               8

                           is
silver in powder;   this constitutes the electrolyte   above the chloride of
                                                            :

about   1inch (2-54 centims.) of the cork.      The connexion between
adjoming cells is made by passing      short piece of india-rubber tube
                                           a

over the zinc rod of one cell, and drawing the silver wire of the next
cell through it so as to press against the zinc.                 The closing of the
cells by means of a cork prevents the evaporation of water, and not only
avoids this serious inconvenience, but also contributes to the effectiveness
of the insulation. The tubes are grouped in twenties in a sort of test-
tube rack, having four short ebonite feet, and the whole placed in a
cabinet 2 ft. 7 in. (78-74 centims.) high, 2 ft. 7 in. wide, and 2 ft. 7 in. deep,
the top being covered with ebonite to facilitate working with the appa
ratus, which is thus placed on it as an insulated table.
    The electromotive force of the battery, as compared with a Daniell's
(gravity) battery, was found to be as 1-03 to 1*, its internal resistance
70 ohms per cell, and it evolved 0-214 cub. centim. (0-0131 cub. inches)
mixed gas per minute when passed through a mixture of 1 volume of sul
phuric acid and 8 volumes of water in a voltameter having a resistance of
11 ohms. The striking-distance           of 1080 elements between copper wire ter
minals, one turned to a point, the other to a flat surface, in air is -jj-j inch
(0-096 millim.) to ^-Jt-j- inch (0-1 millim.).        The greatest distance through
which the battery-current would pass continuously in vacuo was 12 inches
(30-48 centims.) between the terminals in a carbonic acid residual vacuum.
This battery has been working since the early part of November 1874,
with, practically, a constant electromotive force.
    Besides 2000 more cells like those just described, we are putting
together 2000 cells, with the chloride of silver in the form of rod?,
which are cast on the flattened silver wires, as in a battery described
by De La Sue and Miillert, but in other respects similar to the
battery above described, the glass tubes being, however, somewhat larger
in diameter ; the rods of chloride of silver are enclosed in tubes open
at the top and bottom, and formed of vegetable parchment, the object of
these vegetable-parchment cases being to prevent contact between the zinc
and chloride-of-silver rods. The internal resistance of batteries so con
structed is only from 2 to 3 ohms per cell, according to the distance of the
zinc and chloride-of-silver rods, and they evolve from 3 to 4-5 cub. centims.
(0-18 to 0-27 cub. inch) per minute, in a voltameter having                 a resistance
of 11 ohms. Their action is remarkably constant.
    For the experiments detailed below, vacuum-tubes were generally used
of about 1| to 2 inches (3-8 to      5 centims.) in diameter, and from 6 to 8 inches
(15-24    to 20-32  centims.) long ; also prolate spheroidal vessels 6 inches
by 3 inches (15-24 by 7-62 centims.).                The terminals are of various
forms, and from 4 inches to 6 inches (10-16 to 15-24 centims.) apart, and
made of aluminium and occasionally               of magnesium and of palladium,
    * Compared with a Daniell's battery, in which the zinc is immersed in dilute sul
phuric acid in  a porous cell, its electromotive force is about 3 per cent, less than the
Daniell.

 the latter showing some curious phenomena with a hydrogen residual
 vacuum, which will be described in a future paper. A tube which has
 given the most striking results is 8 inches (20-32 centims.) long, and has
 a series   of six aluminium rings varying in diameter from § of an inch to
about     1 J, of an inch (0-95 to 3-17 centims.), the thickness of the wire
 being about -fa (0*16 centim.) of an inch ; the rings are a little more than
 1   inch   (2-54 centims.) apart ; and connecting wires of platinum pass
 through the tube from each ring and permit of the length and other condi
 tions of the discharge being varied.
     At  times the terminals of the battery were placed in connexion with
accumulators of different kinds — for instance, two spheres of 18 inches
 (45-72 centims.) in diameter, presenting each a superficies of 7•07 square
 feet (65*68 square decims.), and cylinders of paper covered with tinfoil,
each having a surface of 16 square feet (148-64 square decims.); the
globe and cylinders were in all cases carefully insulated. Other accumu
lators were composed of coils of two copper wires -fa of an inch
(0-16 centim.) in diameter, covered with gutta percha, in two folds, ^
of an inch (0-08 centim.) thick. One coil contains two wires, A A' and
B B' (fig. 1), coiled side by side, each being 174 yards (159 metres) long,
another with two wires each 350 yards (320 metres) long ; of the latter
 we have two coils.
                                       Fig. 1.
    In  addition to these accumulators we have several others formed of
alternate plates of tinfoil and insulating material, such as paper satu
rated with paraffine, and also sheets of vulcanite.      These are of various
capacities and contain from 5 to several hundred square feet. The largest
has a capacity of 47-5 microfarads ; when it is discharged it gives a very
 bright short spark, accompanied by a loud snap ; the charge deflagrates
 8 inches (20-32 centims.) of platinum wire, -005 inch (0-127 millim.) in
 diameter, when it is caused to passed through it. Each accumulator
gives different results ; but for the present we shall confine ourselves to
a description      of the experiments made with the coil-accumulators.
    When the terminals of the battery are connected with the wires of a
vacuum-tube        which   permits of the passage of the current, the wires
(especially that connected with the zinc end) become surrounded with a
soft nebulous light, in which several concentric layers of different degrees
of brilliancy are seen ; in most cases there is either no indication of stra
tification, or only a feeble ill-defined tendency to stratification : the tubes

selected for these experiments were those       in which the stratification did
not appear at all.
    When the battery, already in connexion with the vacuum-tube, was also
joined, as in fig. 2, on to one or more coil-condensers (coupled to introduce
a greater length of wire) in the following manner, then immediately well-
defined stratifications   appeared in the vacuum-tube.
                                       Fig. 2.
     S Z represents the battery, V the vacuum-tube, C the coil-condenser ; one
 terminal is connected with the end A of the wire A A' , and the other terminal
  with the end B of the second wire B B'; connexions are also led to the wires
  of the vacuum-tube. The ends A and B' are left free ; and it is clear
  that the coil forms a sort of Leyden jar when thus used : an interval,
  however short it may be, must elapse in accumulating a charge which at
  intervals discharges itself and causes a greater flow in the vacuum-tuhe in
  addition to that which passes continuously.         It may be stated that the
  capacity   of the  accumulator   has  to be  carefully adjusted to prevent any
  cessation of the current, to avoid, in fact, a snapping discharge at distant
  intervals. The periodic overflows, so to speak, which increase the current
   from time to time, would seem to have a tendency to cause an interfer
   ence of the current-waves, and to produce nodes of greater resistance in
   the medium, as evinced by the stratification which becomes apparent. To
   the eye no pulsation in the current is apparent ; and in order to convince
   ourselves whether or not there was really any fluctuation in the current
   when the apparatus was thus coupled up with the battery, we made
   several experiments, and ultimately hit upon the following arrange
    ment (fig. 3) : —

   The primary wire p p' of a small induction-coil, both with and without the
iron core, was introduced into the circuit as well as the vacuum-tube V ; to
the secondary wire s s' of the induction-coil was connected a second vacuum-
tube, Va.     Under these circumstances there was no . change in tbe
appearance    of  the discharge in V, in consequence of the introduction
of the induction-coil, the terminals being still surrounded by the soft
nebulous light before spoken of : no luminosity appeared in the second
vacuum-tube    V    in connexion with the secondary wire of the induction-
coil, except on  making and breaking the connexion with the battery. At
other times there was evidently no fluctuation in the continuous dis
charge, no periodic increase or diminution of flow, and consequently
no induced current in the secondary wire s s' of the induction-coil.
   In the second experiment wires were also led from the terminals of     the
battery (all other things remaining as before) to the coil-accumulator as
in fig. 4 ; then immediately the discharge in V became stratified and
the secondary vacuum-tube Vs lighted up, clearly showing that under
these circumstances      a fluctuation in the discharge really occurs on the
appearance   of  stratification.
   The brilliancy of the discharge in Va (the induced current passes through
complicated vacuum-tubes through which the primary current cannot
pass) depends greatly on the quality and quantity of the discharge in
the primary vacuum-tube V. Under some circumstances the secondary
discharge is extremely feeble, and the illumination in Va barely visible ;
under others it is very brilliant.

than they deserve.

 I. " On    the Development of the Teeth of Fishes (Elasmobranchii
        and Teleostei) ." By Charles S. Tomes, M.A. Communicated
        by John Tomes, F.R.S. Received March 1, 1875.
                                   (Abstract.)
    It  has  usually been supposed that the whole process of the develop
 ment of the teeth in many fish might be taken to represent the earlier
 stages alone of the process as it is seen in man ; this opinion is forcibly
 expressed by Professor Owen, who, for example, says of the sharks,
 " Here is represented the first and transitory papillary stage of dental
 development in mammals ; and the simple cartilaginous maxillary plate,
 with the open groove behind containing the germinal papillae of the teeth,
 offers, in the shark, a magnified representation   of the earliest condition of
 the jaws and teeth of the human embryo."
    With this opinion, already objected to by Professor Huxley, I cannot
 concur ; still less can I concur with the statement that
                                                                 " in all fish the
 first step is the simple production   of a soft vascular  papilla from the free
 surface of the buccal membrane.*'
    The supposed open groove behind the jaws of cartilaginous fish is in
 reality closed ; that is to say, the epithelium of the jaw passes continu
 ously across on to the thecal fold of mucous membrane which lies be
hind the jaw and protects the developing teeth ; and, if the groove be
 opened, it is by the tearing through of this epithelium.
    Near to the base of the jaw, the mucous membrane is cellular and
dentine-organs are formed by its elevation into conical papilbe, without
apparent structural change ; but, higher up, the dentine-papilke assume
their characteristic forms and structure, and the residuum of the mucous
membrane at their bases becomes transformed into a fibrillated tissue.
    As the teeth become yet more advanced, the fibrillated tissue at their
bases becomes specially arranged with reference to the base of each tooth,
so as to form, in some sense, ligaments to bind it firmly in its place.
    Just as the mucous membrane of the exposed surface of the jaw is
covered by its epithelium,    so the dentine-papillae   are  covered by theirs    ;
in the latter place, however, it has undergone a special development, which
entitles it to the name of an " enamel-organ."       As was originally pointed
out by    Professor  Huxley, enamel-organs are but modified epithelium.
    The dentine-papillae are processes arising from a continuous sheet of
 mucous membrane ; the enamel-organs also are continuous with one
another, attaining to a special development where they serve as caps to the
 several dentine-papillae ; the arrangement of these enamel-organs suggests
a resemblance to the corresponding      structures described by me as existing
in the newt and in certain reptiles.
    Enamel is present in noteworthy thickness in some Elasmobranchiate
fish ; it is absent, or almost so, in others ; but enamel-organs are present
in all. The enamel-organs consist, on the surfaces directed towards the

 1875.]              Development of the Teeth of Fishes.                      3G3
dentine-papilla!, of a well-marked columnar epithelium (enamel-cells) ; and,
behind this layer, of a sort of finely fibrous tissue with branched cells, not,
however, resembling that known as the reticulum          in mammalian enamel-
organs.
   In   young specimens, before the continuity of the two structures is
interrupted by the presence of a lip, the homological identity of the teeth
and the dermal spines is well seen, the one passing into the other in an
unbroken series    ; the teeth, however, even at an early period, attain to a
much larger size than the contiguous dermal spines.
    Amongst osseous fish, my observations have been principally made upon
the perch, pike, eel, haddock, cod, mackerel, and herring.
    Allowing for differences of detail, which must necessarily result from
the varying configuration of the jaws, &c, the process is identical in all
the fish which     I  have examined, and is similar      to that which    I  have
observed in reptiles.
    From the oral epithelium there dips down a process, the terminal end
of which becomes transformed into an enamel-organ, the contiguous sub
jacent tissue coincidently becoming developed into a dentine-papilla.
    I have seen nothing which could   be called a  " free papilla ;" and it is my
conviction that free papillae at no time exist in any animal ; but it is pos
sible that Professor Owen's statement, that " in all fishes the first step is
the simple production of a soft vascular papilla from the free surface of
the buccal membrane," may have been based upon appearances such as
are met with in the haddock, in which fish (in certain situations) the
tissues surrounding, and lying over, the forming tooth-sac do become ele
vated, so that on the surface there is a papilliform eminence ; this, how
ever, is quite external to the real dentine-papilla,         and is altogether
extraneous to the tooth-sac, which does not make up one fourth of its bulk.
    The distance from the surface at which the formation of the tooth-
sac takes place seems to be variable, differing even in the same fish           in
different situations.
    The enamel-organs of the    eel and perch are peculiar, consisting    mainly
of the layer of " enamel-cells ;" over the apex of the tooth these enamel-
cells are three times as large as over its sides, the transition from cells of
 the one size to the other being abrupt, and not gradual.
    Their teeth are surmounted by terminal caps of enamel, like those of the
newts and salamanders, or those figured by Professor Owen upon the
teeth of   " Ganacrodus,"    a new genus founded        upon this solitary cha
racter :  enamel is absent from the sides of the teeth, or, if present, is in
so thin a layer as to be difficult to detect with certainty.
    Thus the one part of the enamel-organ appears to exercise an active
function, the remainder to be rudimentary; and the position of the enamel-
cells of large size coinciding with the distribution of the enamel, is, so far
as it goes, evidence in favour of the hypothesis of the formation of
enamel by direct conversion of the cells.

36I                         Mr. T. E. Thorpe       on the              [Apr.   15,
    Prof. Huxley first correctly determined the homologies of the enamel-
organ and the dentine-papilla, referring the first to the epithelium, the
latter to the derm ; the follicle, however, where it exists at all,      I  regard
as mainly a secondary development from that region of the derm which
formed the base of the dentine-germ.
   Observations upon many mammals, reptiles, and fishes lead me to
the following general conclusions as to the development of teeth : —
    (i.) All tooth-germs whatever consist, in the first instance, of two
 parts, and two alone — the dentine-papilla and the enamel-organ.
    (ii.) The existence of an enamel-organ is wholly independent of the
 presence or absence of enamel upon the teeth ; examples of this have
 been recorded by Professor Turner and by myself              among    mammalia,
and by myself among reptiles and fishes.
                                                             " papillary," " folli
    (iii.) Nothing justifies the arbitrary division into
 cular," and " eruptive" stages ; nor does any open primitive dental groove,
 or fissure, exist in any animal examined.
    (iv.) In all cases, an active ingrowth of a process of the oral epi
 thelium, dipping inwards into solid tissue, is the first thing distinguish
able ; although the formation of a dentine-papilla, opposite to its deepest
 extremity, goes on pari passu with the development of its caecal end into
 an enamel-organ.
   (v.)   A   special capsule, or follicle, to the tooth-germ may or may not
be present ; when present, it is, in part, a secondary development from
the base of the dentine-papilla,         in part, a mere condensation of sur
rounding tissue.
II.    "Researches upon the Specific Volumes of Liquids." By T.
        E. Thorpe. Communicated by Prof. Williamson, For. Sec.
        R.S.     Received March 2, 1875.
                                    (Abstract.)
                      I. On the Atomic Value of Phosphorus.
   Hermann Kopp has shown that, as a rule, the specific volume of an ele
ment is invariable when in combination.            Exceptions to the law occur,
however, in the cases of oxygen and sulphur, each of which bodies has
two specific volumes dependent upon the manner in which they are held in
union. When contained " within the radicle," as in acetyl, C3H3O, oxygen
has the value 12-2, but when existing " without the radicle," as in alcohol,
it has the smaller value, 7-8.    Sulphur, when " within the radicle,"    has the
specific volume      28-6 ; when " without the radicle," it has the       specific
volume 22-6.
   The    cause  of these variations may be thus stated m the language of
modern theory : — •When dyad sulphur and oxygen are united to an ele
ment by both their affinities, their
                                          specific volumes become respectively

 28-6 and 12-2   when they are attached by only one combining unit, their
                   ;
 specific volumes are 22-6 and 7-8.
    Phosphorus is regarded by certain chemists as invariably a triad ;
others maintain that it is sometimes a triad, at other times a pentad. In
the trichloride it is a triad, in the oxychloride and thiochloride it is a
pentad.    According to this view, the two latter compounds possess the
following constitution : —

                                CI                        CI
If,   however,     phosphorus    is invariably     trivalent,       the oxychloride       and
thiochloride must       possess the formulae
                                CI                       CI

     Itis possible to decide between the two modes of representing the
constitution of these compounds, if it be granted that the variation in the
specific volume of oxygen and sulphur is due to the manner in which
these elements are held in union.   For, if the phosphorus in the oxychlo
ride and thiochloride be quinquivalent, the oxygen and sulphur must
possess the greater of the two values, since both their combining units
are united to the phosphorus ;          if,
                                      on the other hand, phosphorus be
trivalent, the oxygen and sulphur must' possess the smaller of the two
valines.

of expansion of    P
                   Cl3,    Cls, and

consequently the chemical value of the phosphorus       and he finds that

the specific volumes of the oxygen and sulphur are almost identical with
the values given       by                         "
                    Kopp for these elements when without the radicle."
It would therefore appear that the oxychloride                    and thiochloride    must
possess the constitution

   The author concludes by discussing Buff's hypothesis, that the  specific
volume of an element varies with its chemical value and he shows that,
                                                                   ;
in the case of phosphorus, there are no reasons for the belief that this
element has   a   variable specific volume.

       Chemical Constitution of Saline Solutions."                By •Walter

       College, London.       Communicated by Prof. Stokes, Sec. R.S.
       Received March 10, 1875.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The effects of heat on absorption-spectra were recorded in the preli
                                                   '
 minary notice of this paper, published in the Proceedings of the Royal
 Sodety' for 1S74 (vol. xxii. p. 241).
    The contents of the present communication consist of : — 1st, historical
 notes ; 2nd, method of working ; 3rd, the spectrum-measurements of dif
 ferent solutions ; 4th, conclusions as to the effect of heat on coloured
 liquids, and the following deductions as to the constitution of salts wheu
 dissolved in water :—
                                         I.
    When    a simple metallic salt is dissolved in water, it is not decomposed
 in such  a way that an oxide and an acid is produced,    nor does a compound
 of the metallic oxide with the acid result.
                                        II.
     When a metallic salt is dissolved in water to form a saturated solution,
 it does not necessarily attain its maximum state of hydration.
                                       LH.
     When   a simple hydrated   metallic salt is dissolved in water to form a
  saturated  solution,  the crystalline molecule remains chemically intact,
  except in the case of certain compounds which readily part with their
 water of crystallization, when dehydration takes place to form a molecule
  of greater stability ; or, in other words, solution      facilitates chemical
 change in this as in most other cases.

 1875.]        On Attraction and Repulsion from Radiation.               373
                                      IV.
   When    a simple salt assumes one or more definite states of  hydration at
different temperatures below 100° C, the hydrated compounds A and B
will be successively produced in the liquid state if a saturated solution of
the original salt be heated to 100° C. ; or, in other words, the chemical
constitution   of the liquid is altered so that, as higher temperatures are
attained, it becomes a solution of substance A or of substance B, at
intermediate temperatures mixtures of these.
                                       V.
   The action of heat on the violet hydrated compounds of chromium is
not simply a dissociation   of water-molecules or of acid from base, but a
true decomposition, resulting in the production of a different class of
salts  with different generic properties.
   Many new salts were prepared for this work, and others were examined
with greater care than had previously been bestowed on them; from
these substances, indeed, the most important part of the results were
derived.

       Part• II.    By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.                 Received
       March 20, 1875.
                                  (Abstract.)
   This is the second part of a paper which the author sent to the Royal
Society in August 1873.       The author commences by describing improve
ments which he has made in the Sprengel pump, and in various acces
sories  which are necessary when working at the highest rarefactions.
   Continuing the description of apparatus, the author describes different
new forms which enable the phenomena of repulsion by radiation to be
observed" and illustrated.   A bulb 3 inches in diameter is blown at the end
of a glass tube 18 inches long.     In this bulb a fine glass stem, with a
sphere or disk of pith Ac.  at each end, is suspended by means of a cocoon-
fibre.   The whole is attached to the Sprengel pump in such a way that
it can be perfectly exhausted and then hermetically sealed. Besides pith,
the terminals may be made of cork, ivory, metal, or other substance.
During exhaustion several precautions have to be taken, which are fully
entered into in the paper.      To get the greatest delicacy in an apparatus
of this kind, there is required large surface with a minimum of weight.
An apparatus constructed with the proper precautions is so sensitive to
heat,  that a touch with the finger on a part of the globe near one extre
mity of the pith will drive the index round over 90°, whilst it follows a
                                                              2s2

piece of ice as a needle follows a magnet.      With a large bulb, very well
exhausted and containing a suspended bar of pith, a somewhat striking
effect is produced when a lighted candle is placed about 2 inches from the
globe. The pith bar commences to oscillate to and fro, the swing gradual]/
increasing in amplitude until the dead centre is passed over, when
several complete revolutions are made. The torsion of the suspending
fibre now offers resistance to the revolutions, and the bar commences to
turn in the opposite direction.      This movement is kept up with great
energy and regularity as long as the candle burns.
    The author discusses the action of ice, or a cold substance, on the sus
pended index.      Cold being simply negative heat, it is not at first sight
obvious how it can produce the opposite effect to heat.           The author,
however, explains this by the law of exchanges, and shows that attraction
by a cold body is really repulsion by radiation falling on the opposite
side.    According to the same law, it is not difficult to foresee what
 will be the action of two bodies, each free to move, if they are
 brought near to one another in space, and if they differ in temperature
 either from each other or from the limiting walls of the space. The
author gives four typical cases, with experiments, which prove his rea
soning to be correct.
    Experiments are described with the object of ascertaining whether the
attraction by heat, which, commencing at the neutral point, increases
with the density of the enclosed air, will be continued in the same ratio
if the apparatus is filled with air above the atmospheric pressure. This
is found to be the case.
    Various experiments are described with bulb-apparatus, in which the
 bulb is surrounded with a shell containing various adiathermous liquids
 and also with a shell of vacuum.     In all cases radiation passed through,
 producing the normal action of attraction in air and repulsion in a
vacuum.
    The author next describes   a form of apparatus      by which measurable
 results are attainable.   It consists of   a long glass tube, with a wider
piece at the end. In it is suspended a lump of magnesium by a very fine
platinum wire, the distance between the point of suspension and the
 centre of gravity of the magnesium bob being 39"14 inches.          Near the
magnesium is a platinum spiral, capable of being ignited by a voltaic
battery.     Observations of the movement of the pendulum are made
 with  a telescope with micrometer eyepiece.     With this apparatus a large
 series of experiments are described, starting from air of normal density,
and working at intermediate pressures up to the best attainable vacuum.
The results are given in two tables.
    With this apparatus it was found that     a candle-flame   brought within
a few inches   of the magnesium weight, or its image focused on the weight
and alternately obscured and exposed by a piece of card at intervals of
one second, will soon set the pendulum in vibration when the vacuum is

   1875.]             Repulsion resulting from Radiation.                 375
   very good.    A ray of sunlight allowed to fall once on the pendulum will
   immediately   set it swinging.
      The form of apparatus is next described which the author has finally
  adopted, as combining the greatest delicacy with facility of obtaining
 accurate observations, and therefore of getting quantitative as well as
   qualitative results.   It consists of a glass apparatus in the shape of an
  inverted T, and containing a horizontal glass beam suspended by a very
  fine glass thread.    At the extremities of the beam are attached the sub
   stances to be experimented on, and at the centre of the beam is a small
  mirror from which a ray of light is reflected on to a graduated scale. The
   advantage which a glass thread possesses over a cocoon-fibre is that the
  index always comes accurately back to zero.           In order to keep the
 luminous index at zero, except when experiments are being tried, extreme
 precautions must be taken to keep all extraneous radiation from acting on
 the torsion-balance.      The whole apparatus is closely packed all round
 with a layer of cotton-wool about 6 inches thick, and outside this is
 arranged a double row of Winchester quart bottles filled with water,
 spaces only being left for the radiation to fall on the balance and for the
 index ray of light to get to the mirror.
     However much the results may vary when the vacuum is imperfect,
  with an apparatus of this kind they always agree among themselves
  when the residual gas is reduced to the minimum possible ; and it is of
 no consequence what this residual gas is. Thus, starting with the appa
  ratus full of various vapours and gases, such as air, carbonic acid, water,
 iodine, hydrogen, ammonia, &c., at the highest rarefaction, there is not
  found any difference in the results which can be traced to the residual
 gas.    A hydrogen-vacuum appears the same as a water- or an iodine-
 vacuum.
     •With this apparatus the effect of exposing a torsion-balanc© to a con
 tinuous radiation is described, and the results are shown graphically. The
 effect of a short (11*3 seconds) exposure to radiation is next described,
 and the results are given in the form of a Table.
     In another Table is given the results of experiments in which a constant
 source of radiation was allowed to act upon one end of the torsion-beam
 at a distance of 140 or 280 millims., various substances being interposed.
 The sensitiveness of this apparatus to heat-rays appears to be greater
than that of an ordinary thermo-multiplier. Thus the obscure heat-rays
from copper at 100°, passing through glass, produce a deflection on the
 scale of 3-25, whilst under the same circumstances no current is detected
in the thermo-pile.      The following substances are used as screens, and
 the deflections produced (when the source of radiation is magnesium
 wire, a standard candle, copper at 400°, and copper at 100°) are tabu
lated:—
     Bock-salt, 20 millims. thick ; rock-crystal, 42 millims. thick ; dark
smoky talc    ; plate glass' of various thicknesses, both white and green  : a

glass cell containing 8 millims. of water; a plate of alum 5 millims. thick;
calc-spar, 27 millims. thick ; ammonio-sulphate of copper, opaque to rays
 below F ; ditto, opaque to rays below G.
    The author considers that these experiments show that the repulsion
is not entirely due to the rays usually called heat, t. e. to the extreme
and ultra red of the spectrum.       Experiments have been tried with the
 electric and the solar spectrum formed with a quartz train, which prove
 the action to be also exerted by the luminous and ultra violet rays. Scone
 numerical data have been obtained ; but unfavourable weather has pre
 vented many observations being made with the solar spectrum.
    The barometric position of the neutral point dividing attraction       from
repulsion is next discussed.     The position of this point varies with the
 density   of the substance on which  radiation falls, the ratio of its mass to
its surface, its radiating and conducting-power for heat, the physical con
dition of its surface, the kind of gas filling the apparatus, the intensity
of radiation, and the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere.            The
author is inclined to believe that the true action of radiation is repulsion
at any pressure, and that the attraction observed when the rarefaction is
below the neutral point is caused by some modifying circumstances
connected with the surrounding gas, but not being of the nature of air-
currents.
    The neutral point for a thin surface of pith being low, and that for
a moderately thick piece of platinum being high, it follows that at a rare
faction intermediate between these two points pith will be repelled,
and that platinum will be attracted by the same beam of radiation.
This is proved experimentally ; and an apparatus showing simultaneous
attraction and repulsion by the same ray of light is described and illus
trated in the paper.
    The paper concludes with a discussion of the various theories which
have been adduced in explanation of these phenomena.           The air-current
and electrical theory are considered to have been abundantly disproved.
 The following experiment is given by the author to show that Prof.
Osborne Reynolds's       hypothesis of the movements due to evapora
tion and condensation at the surface will not account for all the facta of
the case, and that therefore he has not hit upon the true explanation.
A thick and strong bulb was blown at the end of a piece of very diffi
cultly fusible green glass, specially made for steam-boiler gauges. In it
was supported a thin bar of aluminium at the end of a long platinum
wire.     The upper end of the wire was passed through the top of the tube
and well sealed in, for electrical purposes.    The apparatus was sealed by
fusion to the Sprengel pump, and exhaustion was kept going on for tiro
days, until an induction-spark refused to pass across the vacuum. During
this time the bulb.and its contents were several times raised to a dull red
heat. At the end of two days' exhaustion the tube was found to behave
in the same manner as, but in a stronger degree than, it would in a less

 1875.]            Repulsion resulting from Radiation.                   377
perfectly exhausted apparatus, viz. it was repelled by heat of low inten
sity and attracted by cold. A similar experiment was next tried, only
water was placed in the bulb before exhaustion.         The water was then
boiled away    in  vacuo, and the exhaustion continued, with frequent
heating of the apparatus to dull redness, for about 48 hours.             At
the end of this time the bar of aluminium was found to behave
exactly the same as the one in the former experiment, being repelled by
radiation.
   It is impossible to conceive that in these experiments sufficient con
densable gas or vapour was present to produce the effects Prof. Osborne
Reynolds ascribes to it. After the repeated heating to redness at the
highest attainable exhaustion, it is impossible that sufficient vapour or
gas should condense on the movable index to be instantly driven off by
the warmth of the finger with recoil enough to drive backwards a heavy
piece of metal.
   •While objecting to the theories already advanced as not accounting
for all the facts of the case, the author confesses that he is not as yet
prepared with one to put in their place. He wishes to avoid giving any
theory on the subject until a sufficient number of facts have been accumu
lated.    The facts will then tell their own tale. The conditions under
which they invariably occur will give the laws, and the theory will follow
without much difficulty.
                Supplement.     Received    April 20,   1875.
   Since the experiments mentioned in the foregoing Abstract were con
cluded, the author has examined more fully the action of radiation on
black and white surfaces. At the highest exhaustion heat appears to
act almost equally on white and on lampblacked pith, repelling them in
about the same degree.
   The action of the luminous rays, however, is different.      These repel
the black surface    more  energetically  than   they do  the white surface.
Taking advantage of this fact, the author has constructed an instrument
which he calls a radiometer.    This consists of four arms, suspended on
a steel point resting on a cup, so that it is capable of revolving hori-
whole is enclosed in a glass globe, which is then exhausted to the highest
attainable point and hermetically sealed.
   The author finds that this instrument revolves under the influence of
radiation, the rapidity of revolution being in proportion to the intensity
of the incident rays.
   Several radiometers, of various constructions as regards details, but all
depending on the above-named discovery, were exhibited by the author at
the Soiree of the Royal Society on the 7th inst., and numerous experiments

378          On Attraction and Repulsion from Radiation.                    [Apr.  29,

  There is, however, an incongruity in (4) ; for in this reduction the longi
 tude of Venus Station is taken east of Greenwich by 5h 12m 12*-2=H,
 the origin for Indian longitude being adopted at 5h 20m 57"*3 E. for
 Madras Observatory.         In reality, however, H refers not to the local
 meridian necessarily adopted in (2), but to a concluded meridian of origin
 adopted for the principal triangulation of the Great Trigonometrical
 Survey at Kalianpur, whereas the times (2) refer to the local meridian,
 as already stated.      Denoting the value of H corresponding to the local
 meridian by         we may find (nearly)     H,-H=    h' thus : —Let A0 denote
 the azimuth of a terrestrial point P as determined by observations to a
 circumpolar star about its elongation, and Ac the corresponding value as
 brought up by the triangulation from the concluded meridian of origin ;
 also let A0— Ac=a", and let X stand for the latitude of P; then it can be
 seen that, as   a correction to (4),

      " Appendix to Notes on Transit of Venus across the Sun."
                         Received January 11, 1875.
    After posting my Note No. I., describing the phenomena           I had ob
served at Mussoorie,      I received,  on 12th December, 1874, a communica
tion from my friend the Rev.        H. D. James, M.A., describing briefly what
he had seen at his station       of observation.   In reply I made inquiry on
some additional      points, to which he replied on 14th inst., so that his
letter  has just  reached   me.    Mr. James was located at Chakrata, on the
Himalaya Mountains, at a height of 7300 feet above the sea, in lat. N.
30° 43', long. E. 77° 54'. His station is distinctly visible from Mussoorie
on a clear day. The following facts are taken from his letters above
mentioned, and appear to deserve being recorded, more particularly from

                          Mr.   J.  B. X. Hennessey on the                  [Apr. 29,
   he cxrrnmstance that bat few observers of the transit are likely to have
  been placed at considerable heights above the sea.
     Mr. James was attended           by his son   Henry, a young gentleman with
  plenty of intelligence and       a commendable      spirit of inquiry. The instru
 ment used was a      telescope by Smith and Beck, the property of Mr. James ;
 object-glass       inches and its focal length 4 feet ; at ingress, eyepiece 60-
 power, and field a neutral tint ; at egress, eyepiece 100-power, and field
 red.     For timepiece he used his pocket-watch, which has a seconds-hand.
  The watch ~ gained considerably, perhaps a minute in 12 hours."
     Under date 9th December, 1S74, Mr. James states : —
     " When she
                    (i. «. Venus) was about halfway on (at ingress) the sun we
 both noticed a fringe of white light illuminating that rim of the planet
 which was yet on the dark sky.             When she went off we noticed the same
 fringe of light, bat for a much shorter time, and when only about one
 eighth of her had passed the sun's disk."
    His watch times of contact were as follows : —

    After receipt of the preceding,         I wrote to Mr. James, as already men
 tioned.    I stated briefly                                          I
                              that my view resembled his ; that had seen a ring

 gave him rough sketches of some of the ligaments described in 1769, and
 inquired if he had seen any thing like them.            I also asked him to describe
 the fringe of light he had observed more particularly.
    In reply, Mr. James states, under date 14th December                : —
    " When about half her orb had entered (alluding to ingress) my atten
tion was attracted to the other half yet on the dark sky : to me it was
 dark  ;  hence  I infer that   my field was not so light as it ought to have been.
 Its outline, up to this time quite invisible to me, became now illumined
with a fringe of white light.          I  then also noticed a much fainter, thinner,
edging of light on the outline of the limb on the sun's disk, which soon
ceased to be visible.       The fringe external was rather less in width than
 ^ of the planet's diameter. * * * * The light somewhat resem
bled that which we see so plainly in India lighting up the dark side of
the moon three or four days old ; but it was brighter, not diffusive as that
is, its inner edge being clearly marked.             It remained visible as long as
there was any appreciable portion of the planet beyond the sun's circum
ference.
    " As the time for the internal contact approached, that half of the
planet which was still entering appeared to lose its semicircular shape
and to become oval.         I  compared it to the thinner half of an egg ; but,
since,   I have examined several eggs, and find that my comparison would
represent a distortion greater than           I had intended.     Just before the con

edge, and could not get free, rendering it difficult to decide when the con
tact ceased.  Another impediment in the way of accurate timing was, that
the outline of Venus looked woolly and wave-like, from a very annoying
tremor in the air. Hence the notes we entered were, ' Internal contact
ceased 7h 41m 20", quite clear 7h 42m.'   As to the ligament which seemed
to knit the two edges together,                    I
                                   am disposed to attribute it solely to the
billowy motion of the planet's outline ; for it had a hairy appearance, and
sunlight could be seen through it.
   " In timing the remaining contacts there was no difficulty, for as the
sun arose Venus appeared to diminish in size, her outline becoming
sharply defined.
     " At egress the oval     did not reappear ; but just at the moment
                                 shape
of internal contact there was a sort of flickering movement, as if the
planet's edge had touched, withdrawn, and touched again.        This was
at 11* 30m 15'. At llh 33m 27", when nearly one eighth of her orb had
crossed the border, its outline was for a brief while fringed with an
edging of light.
   " The flickering movement just mentioned, evidently an ocular illusion,
induced by the eye's weariness from intent gazing, was again noticed at
11" 57° 25", when the external contact ceased."
  Writing again on 15th December,
1874, Mr. James enclosed the sketch
given in margin, remarking in his letter,
"Whatlmeant to express by 'ligament,'
was the point of connexion formed by
the boundary line itself, which appeared
adhesive and at the same time hairy.
               I
The dots have placed at the point are
within the line.       I
                   saw no ' black drop,' if
by that is intended any thing beyond and
attached to the boundary line of Venus.
I     should       therefore     have         expressed
myself more accurately                 if,   instead of
 ligament,'     had written    the point

   It will be seen that both Mr. James
and  I   observed an edging of light
around the dark limb of Venus, and
that we agree that     was quite distinct
                           it
at ingress and less plain at egress.                     I

statements which have appeared since writing my Note No. I., as to
the phenomena seen at certain stations, and pending the authoritative

that height *of station, inferiority -of instruments,    insensibility of eye
to faint lights and shadows, and other causes, are likely to conspire
towards producing a ligament (or j,«ar-drop) at the internal contacts,
provided there is an atmosphere or envelope around the planet to afford
a first cause.

II. "     On a Continuous Self-registering Thermometer."                   By
        W. Harrison Cripps.           Communicated       by Prof. Stokes,
        Sec.R.S.     Received March 17, 1875.
    The object of this paper is to explain the working of a continuous self-
registering thermometer, the detail of which X have been for some years
endeavouring to perfect, though it is only recently that      I  have brought
my instrument to the perfection necessary for practical demonstration.
    I  am aware of many imperfections in the instrument, but trust that
these will be remedied after some further experiments.           The object of
my invention is to produce a thermometer that shall not only register
the highest and lowest temperature occurring in a given time, but shall
also, by a pencil indicator, mark automatically every minute variation
occurring during the time the instrument is at work.
    This thermometer will,   I  hope, be of value for meteorological observa
 tions ; for it will show the exact variations taking place from minute to
minute during day and night, and by this means determine the exact
amount of alterations in temperature occurring simultaneously at various
places during different periods of the month or year, without the trouble
of photographic registration.
    By a simple modification of my instrument,       I believe that  I shall be
able to produce a thermometer of such form and size as shall enable the
physician or physiologist to learn with accuracy the exact hour and
minute when any alteration of temperature in the human body takes
place, and automatically to register these variations.
    As regards the barometer, many beautiful self-registering instruments
are in use ; for the lower surface of the mercurial column being exposed,
offers an easy method of producing a motive force.        In the thermometer
the case is different, for no means of communication exist between the
registering machinery and the mercury in its hermetically sealed tube.
So far as   I know, the only instrument of this kind ever suggested is the
one by Merey ; but from the fact that air is the motive force used by

 1875.]          Continuous Self-registering    Thermometer.              385
him, acting upon mercury in an open tube, his instrument must be
regarded more as a barometer than as a means of measuring the tem
perature of the atmosphere.
   My instrument is divided into two portions : — 1st, the thermometer,
which marks the degrees ; 2ndly, the clockwork, which indicates the
hours and minutes.
   The thermometer      shall be first described.  The form in which   it was
originally made, and which perhaps         serves best for illustrating    the
principle, was the following : —
   A glass bulb, rather more than an inch in diameter, ends in a glass
tube 12 inches long, having a bore of ^ inch. This tube is coiled round
the bulb in such a manner as to form a complete circle 4 inches in
diameter, the bulb being in the centre of this circle.
   Fixed to opposite poles of the bulb, exactly at right angles to the
encircling tube, are two needle-pointed pivots. These pivots work in
minute metal depressions fixed to the sides of two parallel uprights.
   It will be seen from this arrangement that the bulb with its glass tube
•will rotate freely between the uprights, and the pivots will be the centre
of a circle, the circumference of which is formed by the glass tube.
   The bulb is filled with spirit in such quantity that at 60° Fahrenheit
the spirit will fill not only the bulb, but about 4 inches of the tube.
Mercury is then passed into the tube till it comes into contact with the
spirit, and in such quantity as to fill up about 3 inches of the remaining
portion of the tube.
   The spirit is now heated to 120°, and as it expands forces the column
of mercury in front of it till the mercury comes within | inch of the end
of the tube. The tube is then hermetically sealed, enclosing a small
quantity of air.
   If the thermometer be now arranged with its needle-points between
the uprights, it will be observed that, as the spirit contracts on cooling, it
draws the column of mercury with it. This immediately alters the
centre of gravity, and the bulb and tube begin to revolve in a direction
opposite to that of the receding mercury.
   On again applying heat, and the mercury passing forwards, the bulb
regains its original position.
   By this simple arrangement, the two forces, heat and gravity, acting
in contrary directions, generate a beautifully steady rotatory movement.
   The method by which this movement is made serviceable for moving
the register   will now be described.
   A   grooved wheel, 2 inches in diameter, is fixed to one of the central
pivots, therefore revolving with the bulb.         Directly above and at a
distance    of 7 inches   from this wheel is fixed between needle-points
another    wheel of exactly similar size.    Around and between these two
wheels passes a minute endless chain.

 886       On a Continuous Self-registering       Thermometer.        [Apr. 29,
    To the chain is fixed     a tiny pencil, which will be carried backwards
and forwards between the wheels in a perpendicular line.
    This constitutes the register worked by the thermometer.
    The clockwork portion of the machine is so arranged that it causes a
vertical cylinder, 4 inches diameter and 5 inches in length, to revolve
once in 24 hours.      Round this cylinder is fixed a piece of paper 12 inches
long, 5 inches wide.      On the paper in the direction of its greatest length
are ruled 100 lines, fa inch apart, each indicating 1° Fahrenheit. Across
the paper, at right angles to these lines, are ruled twenty-four lines in
dark ink, indicating the hours ; between these three others, more lightly
marked, for the quarters.        The cylinder is so placed that, as it revolves,
the surface of the paper is fa of an inch away from the point of the
pencil register moving at right angles to its surface.
    A small striker is connected with the clockwork in such a manner that
every 5 minutes (or oftener if required) it gives the pencil a gentle tap,
thus striking its point against the paper.
    By this means all friction of the moving pencil against the paper is
avoided, and the index is marked by a series of dots.
                           I
    In the model which bring before the Society, the arrangement of the
 bulb is somewhat modified, for a spiral coil of glass tube is made to take
 its place. By this means not only is a larger surface of the spirit
 exposed to the air, making the thermometer more delicate, but also all
 fear of the mercury being drawn into the bulb is obviated.
    The last turn of the spiral coil is made as a perfectly true circle with a
diameter of 4 inches.
    The spiral within this circle is made of such a ske that each degree of
 heat applied to the contained spirit shall force the mercury fa of an inch
along the circle.
    Since the wheel moving the register equals 2 inches diameter, or only
 half the diameter of the mercurial circle, the pencil will move fa of an
 inch for each degree of heat.
                                                       I
    In some of the earlier experiments performed, found that in straight
 tubes the spirit had a tendency to pass the mercurial column without
 moving it. This, however, is not the case when the tube forms a portion
  of a circle, for the pressure of the mercury at the lowest portion of the
  segment prevents the spirit passing the mercury.
    I  trust that   I have made this description of the thermometer intelli
 gible ;  but  a glance at the working model which       I have the honour of
  bringing before the Society will at once explain the details of the
 machine.
     The Society     then   adjourned   over  Ascension    Day, to Thursday,
May 13th.

transformation of ratios into E. T. semitones and vice versd, and subse
quently found that De Morgan had given rules for the same purpose
.which are substantially the same (Camb. Phil. Trans, vol. x. p. 129).
The rules obviously depend on the form of log 2. The form of the first
rule affords little more accuracy than De Morgan's.

   Regular cyclical systems are not only regular, but return into the same
pitch after   certain number of fifths. Every such system divides the

   Intervals taken upwards                     are called positive, taken downwards,              nega

                                         Intervals formed by Fifths.
   When successions of fifths are spoken of, it is intended that octaves be
disregarded.  If the result of a number of fifths is expressed in E. T.
semitones, any multiples of 12 (octaves) are cast out.    Representing the
fifth of any system by 7+3, where 3 is the departure of one fifth
expressed in E. T. semitones, we form the following intervals amongst
others       :   —

    The seven-fifths                 semitone will be denoted by s           (=1 + 73)     ;   the five-

                                               Regular   Systems.
  The importance of regular systems arises from the symmetry of the
scales which they form.

down, leaving 12 E. T. semitones, which form an exact octave ; or,

                                              Regular Cyclical Systems.
   The importance of regular cyclical systems arises from the infinite
freedom of modulation in every direction which is possible in such
systems when properly arranged ; whereas in non-cyclical          systems
required modulations are liable to be impossible, owing to the demand for
notes lying outside the material provided.

                                a regular cyclical system
between the seven-fifths semitone and five-fifths semitone is +r units of
the system, or s— /= + r units.
   Recalling the definition of rth order .(12i= +1• units), the proposition
follows from Th.                    /3.

number of divisions in the octave in systems of any order,       introducing                             by
the consideration that each semitone must consist of an integral number
of units. The principal known systems are here enumerated :—

Casting out multiples of 12, where necessary, from n and r, we have the

or the departure of n fifths =r semitones.
   This gives rise to a curious mode of deriving the different systems.
   Suppose the notes of an E. T. series arranged in order of fifths, and
proceeding onwards indefinitely, thus           : —
                   e g d    a e b
                                   /$   c#   gt   d$ a$  /  c g  .   .  .,
and so on.      Let a regular system of fifths start from c.                   If they are
positive,   then  at each step the pitch rises further from E. T.               It can only
return to c by sharpening an E. T. note.
   Suppose that 6 is sharpened            one   E. T. semitone, so        as to become   e ;
then the return may be effected
                        at the first  b  in 5 fifths,
                        at the second 6 in 17 fifths,
                        at the third b in 29 fifths ; and       so on.
Thus we obtain         the primary       positive systems.         Secondary positive
systems may be got by sharpening Up 2 semitones ; and so on.
   If the fifths are negative, the return may be effected by depressing                  rj
a semitone in 7, 19, 31 . . .. fifths; we thus obtain the primary nega
tive systems    ; or by depressing d two semitones, by which we get the
secondary negative systems ; and so on.

large dimensions   for convenient   reproduction here : —
   Set off on the axis of abscissae the equal temperament series in order

Thus  the notes on  the positive ordinate of c are c-c#-d . . ., and so
on, each pair separated by 1 decimetre, and the notes on the negative
ordinate of   are c-b-b\>
                  c                     ....
     If we thenjoin the c on the left hand of the axis of abscissae to all the
other c's on the figure, except, of course, those on the axis, we obtain a
complete           representation of all the systems whose orders are
                 graphic
included. The rth order is represented by lines drawn to the c's in the
rth line above, the —rth by the lines drawn to the c's in the rth line
below.
   This illustration brings specially into prominence the singularity of
multiple systems, as all the multiples of any system lie on the same
straight line with              it,
                      and the representation fails to give all the notes of
such systems.
                                             Multiple   Systems.
  Multiple systems are such that the number of divisions in the octave
(kn) in any such system    multiple (k) of the number of divisions (n)
                                        is   a
of   some other system.
     Multiple systems have not been                 as yet practically
                                                          applied.
   These systems are not strictly regular       for though their fifths are all
                                                             ;
equal, yet they do not form one continuous series, but several.           They
are strictly cyclical, ». e. they divide the octave into n equal intervals.
     Theorem v.        A       multiple system, kn, may be regarded as being of order
kr, where n           is   a   system of order r.
   For, n being            a     system of order    r+7n
                                                    r,        multiple of 12 /. also
                                                                      is   a            ;
k(r+7n)       multiple of 12, which     the condition that the system kn
             is
             a                                          is
be of order kr.
   This   useful in the investigation of systems of the higher orders.
         is is
   If n     multiple of 12, the system
             a                               multiple of the E. T., and of
                                                             is   a
order zero.
   In the illustration described under Th. iv. the notes of multiple                a
system (kn) are the same as those of system n, until the latter       com               is
plete.  The rest of the representation consists simply of the same notes

396                    Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet                    on the
repeated over and over again.   To obtain the rest of the notes we should
have to change the starting-point.
     On the whole, we may regard the system kn                      as consisting       of it    dif
ferent    systems n, having      starting-points distant from each other by                        t
of the unit of the system n.
   It follows immediately that the system Ten is of the irth order ; for in
every unit of the system n there are k units of system kn ; and so in r
units of system n there are far units of system fax.
   Any system, when n is not a prime, can be regarded as a multiple
system.
  Thus the system of 59 is of the 7th order ; 118 consequently a multiple
system of the 14th order, in which point of view it is of no interest ; but,
casting out the 12 from the order, it may be also regarded as an inde
pendent system of the 2nd order, in which point of view it is of con
siderable interest.
          Formation   of Major Thirds in Positive and Negative                   Systems.
     The departure of the perfect third is —'13686.     Hence negative
systems (where the fifth is 7 S) form their thirds in accordance with
                              —
the ordinary notation of music.  For if we take 4 negative fifths up, wo
have a third with negative departure (—42) which can approximately
represent the departure of the perfect third. Thus             either the    cjf   is
third to a, or four fifths up from a, in accordance with the usage of
musicians.
   Positive systems form their thirds by          fifths down for their fifths
                                                      8                     ;
are of the form        +
                      (7 J), and    8fifths down give the negative departure
( —
    8>).    Thus  the  third  of a  should  be d\>, which      inconsistent with
                                                                       is
musical usage.       Hence positive systems require           separate notation.
                                                                      a
Helmholtz proposed         a notation for this purpose, which, however,                           is
unsuitable for use with written music.         The following notation         here          is
adopted   for positive systems   in  general      ;   not intended
                                                      it   is       to  be limited
to any one system, like Helmholta's.          In fact     may, on occasions, be
                                                                it
used even for negative systems.
                      Notation   for Positive Regular           Systems.
     The notes are arranged in series,         each containing         12 fifths, from       /$ up
to   6.   These may be called duodenes, adopting                a   term introduced         by   Mr.
Ellis.     The duodene
which     contains
                 the standard        called the unmarked duodene.
                                     c,   is                          No
distinction  made in these series between such notes as
              is                                         and d\>.  These    e$
signs refer only to the E. T. note from which the note in question                                is
derived the place in the series of fifths
          ;                                   determined by the notation.
                                                      is

                   Theory of the Division       of  the Octave.               397
Continuing the series to the right,         each note of the next 12 fifths is
affected with the mark      / (mark     of elevation), drawn upwards in the
direction of writing.    These notes join on to the unmarked duodeno as
follows : —
                           +*-/J$-/4-/g9          .....
and so on.                                                               '
   Thus /c is 12 fifths to the right of c, and the interval /c-cis the depar
ture of 12 fifths.
   The next duodene to the right is affected with the mark            //,   which
joins on to the last as before : —
                                                        *
                                /e-/b-//f$           ,
and so on.
   Proceeding in the   same way, we have notes affected         with such marks
as  ///, ////.
   Return to the unmarked duodene, and let it be continued to the left ;
the notes   in the next duodene on the left are affected with the mark         \,
(mark of depression), drawn downwards in the direction of writing. The
junction with the unmarked duodene will be
                      \c-\g-\d-^a-\e~\b-f$-c#           ....
   The next junction on the left will be
                                                .... ;
and,   proceeding   in the     same    way,    we have such marks       as   \\\,
VsNX.
   Thus o-\e is a major third determined by eight fifths down in the whole
series; and \« will have the departure (— 8i) from the E. T. note e
 derived from c.
        Notation applicable  to  all Regular   Systems, Negative as well as
                                      Positive.
    As this notation simply consists of a determination of position in a
continuous series of fifths, it may be applied to all regular systems, posi
tive or negative ; but, as it is not commonly needed for negative systems,
it is not generally applied to them.
      Formation of Harmonic Sevenths       in Positive and Negative  Systems.
    The harmonic seventh is the interval whose ratio is 7 : 4. It affords a
smooth combination, free from beats.
    The departure of the harmonic seventh from the note which gives the
E.T. minor seventh is — -31174 (Rule I.).
   Helmholtz observes that his system of just intonation affords an approxi

 mation to the harmonic seventh.                      In     fact,    if   we form a seventh by 14
 fifths down in positive systems (fifth = 7+                               f),
                                                                             we obtain   note with

   Mr. Ellis has observed (Roy. Soc. Proc. 1864) that the mean-tone
 system, which     negative, affords
                       is             good approximation to the harmonic
                                                      a

 (fifth=7— $), we obtain                  a   note with negative departure     — 10$), which
                                                                                           (

                 Concords          of   Regular and lingular Cyclical Systems.
   These considerations permit us to calculate the departures and errors
of concords in the various regular and regular cyclical systems.  There
   however, one quantity which may be also conveniently taken into
 is,
consideration in all cases, viz. the departure of 12 fifths of the system.
We will call this A, putting A=12i.
   •We have then the following Table of the characteristic quantities for
the more important systems hitherto known.
                                                               (81\

and remember that positive          systems form their thirds by 8 fifths down,
we have the rule      : —
   The four accidentals on the left in any duodene of the notation form
major thirds to the four notes on the extreme right in the same duodene.
All other notes have their major thirds in the next duodene below. Thus
d-ft, c-\« are major thirds.'
                     Use   of the Notation with Musical Symbols.
    It is an essential point in this notation that it can be used with musical
 symbols.      The following example shows the major and minor chords and
the interval used for the harmonic seventh : —
    The first chord is the major triad ; the second involves g-\f, the har
 monic seventh ; the fourth crotchet gives the minor common chord ; and
the first chord of the second bar is the sharp sixth, rendered peculiarly
 smooth by employment of the approximate harmonic seventh for the
interval /a\>-ff.
   The employment of positive systems is presupposed with this notation,
unless the contrary is expressly stated.

          Principle of Symmetrical Arrangement in Regular     Systems.
   If we place the E. T. notes in the order of the scale, and set off the
departures of the notes of any regular system at right angles to the E. T.
line, sharp departures up and flat departures down, we obtain the posi
tions of what may be called a symmetrical arrangement.
                                                   ...
   The distances of the E. T. notes from the starting-point are       abscissae,
and the departures ordinates.
                                Positive Systems.
   The subjoined is a symmetrical arrangement of the notes of General
Thompson's enharmonic organ (p. 402). It is selected as not being too
extensive for reproduction, as being of historical interest, and as illustra
ting the nature of the difficulty caused by the distribution of such systems
into separate key-boards. Each of the single vertical steps represents the
departure of one fifth.
    The property of symmetrical arrangements, from which they derive
their principal importance, is that, position being determined only by
relations of interval, the notes of a combination forming given intervals
present always the same form, whatever be the key or the actual notes
employed.
    Let us express, as before, the number of E. T. semitones, which is now
our abscissa, by simple integers, and the number of departures of fifths,
which is our ordinate, by a coefficient attached to S. . Then we have only
to note the values of the different intervals to obtain their coordinates
with respect to any note taken as origin-.
    Thus the third is 4— 8S, or four steps to the right and eight down
(c—\e) ; the fifth is 7+ J, seven steps to the' right and One up (c-g) ;
the minor third is three to the right and nine up (\e~g) ; and so on.
    Two notes are omitted from the otherwise complete series, 6 and \V? ;
and we notice the number of otherwise complete chords which their
absence destroys.
    Distribution  over three Key-boards. —As   an example of the effect of this,
we note that the notes of the chord of a minor are all present      ; but they
are «,.3-/«!-«3, so that the third and fifth are on different key-boards.
                                Negative Systems.
    According to the enunciation of the principle of symmetrical arrange
ment, the positions should be taken lower for negative systems as we
 ascend in the series of fifths ; but it is practically more convenient to
nse the positive form in negative systems as well. The coordinates of
 some intervals become different — the third is 4+4J, the minor third
3 -3 J, &c

  Application of Principle of Symmetrical Arrangement             to a  " Generalized

                         Key-board       for Regular Systems.
    A  key-board    has   been constructed,     on the principle of " symmetrical
arrangement," in the following manner : —
    The octave is taken =6 inches horizontally (in ordinary key-boards the
octave is 6 | inches).        This is divided into 12 spaces, each £ inch broad.
These are called the 12 principal divisions of the octave. A horizontal
line gives the positions of an E. T. series where it crosses them all.
   The keys are then placed at vertical and horizontal distances from the
E. T. line corresponding to their departures, on the supposition that the
arrangement      is positive.
   The departure of      12   fifths up corresponds to    a horizontal   displacement
of 3 inches from the player, and          a vertical displacement    of  1 inch up.
   These displacements are divided equally among the fifths to which they
may be regarded as due, i. e. the displacement of g with respect to c is
^ inch back and -fa inch up ; so of
                                            d with respect to g, of a with respect
to d, and so on.
   Although only 3 inches of each key are thus exposed on a plan, yet
the keys are all made to overhang | inch, and thus the tangible length of
each key is 3£ inches.
   The accompanying figure (p. 404) shows a small portion of the key
 board, on a scale of half the real size.
   The keys are each § inch broad, and their centres are                \ inch   apart.
There is thus ^ inch free between the adjacent surfaces of                each  pair of
keys, and £ inch altogether between the two keys which rise on each side
of any given key.        This is of importance ; e.g., in the chord c-\e-g-c,
taken with the right hand, the first fmger has to reach \« between elp-f
and under the overhanging e.
   The keys in the five principal divisions which have "accidental" names
(e. g. c# or rfht) are black, the rest white.
   There are seven keys in each principal division ; the seven c's are
marked from VsNe to ///c, the unmarked c being in the middle. Thus
there are 84 keys in each octave. The key-board controls an harmo
nium which contains the system of 53.
                                                                       " Generalized

tioned. Helmholtz makes a mistake in describing it (' Die Lehre von
den Tonempfindungen,' ed. 3, p. 495) ; he supposes that the fifths are
sharp instead of flat by the above interval ; it is easy to see from the
context that this is a mistake.

    Ride. — In the system of 53 the notation of positive systems becomes
 subject to the following identifications : —
    If two notes in adjoining principal divisions (e. g. c and cjf) be so
 situated as to admit of identification («. g. a high c and a low c#), they
 will be the same if the sum of the elevation- and depression-marks =4 ;
 unless the lower of the two divisions is black (accidental), then the sum
 of the marks of identical notes = 5.
    This can only be proved by enumeration of a case in each pair of divi
 sions.    This enumeration is made in the writer's original paper. It is
 founded on the following principles :—
    Noting that the 5-fifths semitone is 4 units (scheme following Th. i.),
 we see that c-c# is 4 units, whence ////c-c#, ///c—\c$, //c-N\e#           ....
 are identities  ; or, again, e#-\<2 is 4 units, and   ////c#-\d, ///c-Wd
 .... are identities.

                         the System  of 53 to the
    An harmonium      has been constructed     which is arranged as follows : —
    The note   \\\c   is taken as the first note of the series, and receives the
 characteristic  number 1.       Then c is 4, and the remaining numbers can
 be  assigned by the rules for the identifications in the system of 53 given
above.
    A number of notes at the top of the key-board are thus identical with
 corresponding notes in the adjacent principal divisions on the right at
 the bottom, e.g. //c=b=Wet.             These permit the infinite freedom of
 modulation which is the characteristic of cyclical systems ; for in moving
 upwards on the key-board we can, on arriving near the top, change the
 hands on to identical notes near the bottom, and so proceed further          in
the same direction, and vice versd.
    It is to be noted that, in positive systems, displacement upwards or
downwards on the key-board takes place most readily by modulation
between related major and minor keys — not, as has been commonly
assumed, only by modulation round the circles of fifths. In negative
systems, on the contrary, displacements take place only by modulations
of the latter type.

    The 5-fifths semitone is here 9 units, and the 7-fifths semitone is 11
units. The major tone (2-fifths tone) is consequently 20, and the minor
tone (10-fifths tone) is 18.       Hence the notes in the successive principal
divisions are alternately odd and even, and the identifications lie in alter

   If the thirds, such as c—e, are made perfect, and the fifths '05376 flat,
we have the mean-tone system.       The forms of scales and chords in nega
tive systems are different from those in positive systems.    The scales are
very easy to play, and the chords also.                            It   is   expected that this applica

                                     is
tolerably good positive cyclical system with the representation of intervals
accurately to three places                by by
                               means of logarithms.    This system has been
lately used, in particular    Mr. Ellis, for approximate calculations.                                             It
appears  to be of some interest to investigate generally what systems of
higher orders do represent either of the systems with perfect thirds, and
with what degree of accuracy they do so.
     First, with respect to positive                systems.            If   a    system n of the rth order
be   a   close approximation              to the system of perfect thirds, then                        will — 8-

    Now, when    r=2    we have the system of 118, which affords the closest
 approximation    to what is required of any cyclical system known hitherto,
 the error of its third being -00127.
    Referring to Th. v., it is easy to see that no other even system of an
 order much below the 24th can afford a better approximation ; for the
 number 118 differs from the value given by the above condition by little
 more than unity.        Its multiple is always of the right order (Th. v.) ;
 there can therefore be no other system of the right order within 12 digits
of the multiple either way, and the deviation of the value given by the
 condition cannot amount to 12 digits till near the 24th order ; we there
 fore confine ourselves to systems of uneven orders.
    Casting out 12's from 58-4526, we can take the remainder as 10•45

    The coincidence at the llth order is the closest so far; and it is
easy to see, by considerations analogous to those above, that no subse
quent system can afford another till     a much higher order is reached.
    For the  llth   order, then, we have
                             11 x 58-4526=642-9786;
and 643 is a system of the llth order,      as shown by its    giving remainder
7 on dividing by 12 (Th. hi.).
    Calculating the third of this system             =dep.), and taking seven
places, we have    : —
                 Departure of perfect third =        - -1368629
                 Departure of third of 643 =         - -1368585
                                        Error =        -0000044 sharp.
   To five places both thirds are represented by -^-13686.
   The intervals of this system will furnish us with simple numerical
ratios, which represent with great accuracy the intervals of the perfect
system.
   •We have (see the section on the number        of units in any interval) —
                        7-fifths semitone = 60 units,

whence we can deduce the remaining intervals.       These values of the
semitone? suggest the following curious derivation of this system : —
  Referring to the Table of characteristic numbers, we notice that the
errors of the thirds of the systems of 53 and 65 are nearly equal and
opposite.
    The system of 53 is derived on the assumption that the interval ratio
of the semitones is

   The facts recorded in this paper are the results obtained by electrical
stimulation of the brain of monkeys, after the method described by the
author in the West Eiding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports, vol. iii. 1873.
They formed part of a paper " On the Localization of Function in the
Brain," read before the Royal Society on March 5, 1874*. This memoir
also contained the results of other experiments on the brain of monkeys,
chiefly relating to the effects of localized lesions of several parts of the
hemispheres, with a view to determine the significance, as regards sensa
tion and motion, of the phenomena caused by electrical irritation. These
experiments are not here recorded, but are reserved for comparison with
the results of a more extended reinvestigation of a similar nature, on
which the author has been for some time engaged, and which will shortly
be laid before the Society.
    In order to avoid unnecessary detail, and in order to place the results
together for the purposes of comparison, the animals experimented on
 are described, the dates of experiment given, and numbers assigned to
them, so that they may all be brought into relation with each other : —

This is particularly liable to occur if the currents are too strong. The
areas drawn on the woodcuts are therefore more or less indefinite as to
their boundaries.    Their centres indicate more precisely the points of
exact localization.

   It  will  be observed that     in some   cases  the movement is only partially
carried out.       This is frequently the case, and, as will be seen in the sub
sequent     details, a movement, at first of limited extent, gradually merges
into   a more complex one,       involving numerous muscles.

             (^)<
ascending frontal convolution, and also stretches across the fissure of
Rolando, so as to include the anterior division of the upper extremity of
the ascending parietal convolution.
   In the description reference is made to an anterior and posterior divi
sion, the boundary between the two being the fissure of Rolando.             This
is done because, though on analysis movements excited by stimulation of
both are essentially the same, they are less distinctly brought out by
stimulation     of the posterior     division  alone, and are apt to merge into
those resulting from excitation of circle

            The combination        of actions is just such      as when a monkey
        scratches its abdomen with its hind leg.
            The muscles of the trunk participated           in the movements,     so
        that the body was twisted to the opposite side.

        in   II.

         on the slightest stimulation, rendered analysis of the movements
         impossible.
  V. In this      case   the action described in     II. was very distinct, viz. the
         rotation outwards of the thigh, the rotation inwards of the leg
         and foot, and the grasping portion of the toes pointing towards
          the middle line.

          and rotated outwards, the leg and foot inwards, while the toes
          were spread out.
   VII. In      this case also the movements were very distinct, consisting in
          rapid combined muscular action, bringing the foot and toes inward
          as  if to scratch the body.

             Here it must    be noted that the centres which     cause the above-
         described movements of the hind leg, as well as those afterwards
         to be described which cause clenching of the fist, had been under
         stimulation previous to the exploration of this region.           Hence
         the result is to be looked upon as the combined action of all three
         centres.     This is the real difficulty experienced in analysis of the
         complex movements of the limbs, there being always a tendency
         to have complications arising from the irritable condition which
         continues in the regions which have been under experimentation.
         This, along with the tendency to convulsive spasms of a choreic
         or epileptiform nature, lasting for minutes after the cessation of
          stimulation, renders it frequently excessively difficult to draw
          accurate conclusions. The results described have always been those
          arrived at after as complete exclusion as possible of these adverse
          conditions.

    I  have observed frequently that only very partial action was occa

obtained, they are detailed with more fulness in each case in the order of
the experimentation, care being taken to compare accurately correspond
ing regions.        The divergences are in a great measure to be explained by
the fact that the movements caused involve the conjoint action of the
flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers, and hence move
ments of an apparently opposite character seem to result from stimulation
of the same point.        A differentiation of centres for extension and centres
for flexion could not be made out.

      extensors of the wrist and fingers were seen to be contracted.
         c. Momentary application of the electrodes caused adduction of
      the thumb, followed on longer stimulation by clenching of the
      whole fist and slight pronation of the hand.
         After several other regions had been explored,             these points
      were again stimulated in succession.
         The second result at point d was extension of the thumb and
      fingers instead of flexion.
         A second stimulation of point b caused, first, adduction of all the
      fingers, then extension of the wrist and flexion of the distal pha
      langes, the proximal phalanges not being flexed till the wrist was
      fully extended.

      lasting for three minutes.
IV.   a. Abduction of the thumb.

         became adducted, then the index-finger, the fingers in succession
         becoming adducted and then flexed till the fist became firmly

   The variations described in the movements resulting from stimulation
of the ascending parietal convolution are apparently all referable to dif
ferent aspects of combined muscular contractions, which in their com-
pletest action serve to cause closure of the fist or the grasping-action of
the hand.       Centres for the extensors and flexors, or for the flexors and
extensors, of the individual digits could not be definitely made out.
   Owing to the proximity of the centre for the platysma (circle

at the lower end of the ascending parietal, very frequently, along with

         of the fingers.
            Long-continued stimulation brings the hand up to the mouth,
         and at the same time the angle of the mouth is retracted           and

   VIII. Apparent action of the biceps as before.
   IX. Flexion and supination of the forearm and hand.
            In this case it was found very decidedly that stimulation close
         to the fissure-of-Rolando side of the convolution caused the action
         of the biceps to be associated with clenching of the fist. Towards
         the lower margin of the circle the same movements were asso
         ciated with retraction of the angle of the mouth.

   These results point very definitely to a centre for the movements of
the mouth and tongue, the muscles concerned in mastication and also in
articulation. Its position is significant, as being the homologue in man
of that region which is the         seat  of lesion in the disease known as aphasia,
described    as the posterior       extremity of the lower frontal convolution.
(In aphasia the lesion is generally on the left side, but the bilateral move
ments are seen by the experiments to be induced from both right and
left sides.)

    X.  Retraction of the left angle of the          mouth.
             This point was explored after           several other regions had been
         under stimulation.          The application of the electrodes to this point
          gave rise to spasms of a choreic or epileptiform nature, beginning
          in the left angle of the mouth, then affecting the left hand and
          arm, and lastly the left leg and tail. The choreic spasms then
          passed to the right angle of the mouth, the right hand and arm,
          and in a slight degree to the right leg and tail.
             The fit lasted one or two minutes.            It had not all the charactci s
          of a fully pronounced epileptic attack.

     XTTT. Strong contraction of the platysma, and retraction       of the left
          angle of the mouth.
     The results of stimulation of this centre agree with each other, and
indicate a centre for the platysma.       The frequent retraction of the angle
of the mouth observed on causing clenching of the fist is explained by the
proximity of the two centres to each other.
     Island of Reil (central lobe), within fissure of Sylvius : —
     Owing to the central lobe in the monkey being completely concealed
 within the lips of the fissure of Sylvius, mechanical injury and consider
 able haemorrhage is necessarily caused in the attempt to expose it clearly.
 This is mentioned     as a possible  explanation of the negative results,  but
 it  is not sufficient to account for the apparent non-excitability of this
 region.
     The island was exposed and experimented on in monkeys IX. aud
 XIII.
     IX.   Electrization of the island of Reil gave no results.
              Some movements of the mouth we,re caused during the intro
           duction of the electrodes within the fissure, but were referred to
           stimulation of the mouth-centres in close proximity.
      XIII. The result in this case was also negative.
      To test this matter more fully, another monkey, not among those
 already numbered, was experimented on on December 10.
      The lips of the fissure of Sylvius were carefully separated, without
  causing much injury or haemorrhage.       After the haemorrhage had entirely
  ceased, the electrodes were applied directly to the surface of the central
  lobe.
      Ho effect was observed.
      After the animal had been allowed to rest for     some time,  it was then
  tested   as to the   excitability of the other centres. The hand, leg, and
  mouth could      as usual be acted on by stimulation of their respective
  centres.
      The electrodes, insulated up to the point, were again applied to the
  island of Reil.
      No result was observed.
      Stronger and continuous stimulation gave rise to choreic spasms of the
  angle of the mouth.       This was attributed to diffusion of the current,
  owing to its being strengthened, and irritation of the proximate centres
  for the angle of the mouth.
      Another application     of the electrodes within the lower end of the
  fissure   caused   movements    of the mouth and tongue.      These also may
   have been due to conduction to the mouth-centres already described.
      Beyond these, stimulation of the island of Reil yields negative results.

volution from the antero-parietal sulcus (Huxley), sulcus praecentralis
(Ecker), to the anterior extremity of the supero-frontal sulcus.
    The results of stimulation of these convolutions were always so uni
form, that the general result of experimentation             in ten monkeys may     be
stated together.       The results were       :—
    Elevation of the eyebrows and the upper eyelids, turning of the eyes
and head to the opposite side, and great dilatation of both pupils.
    Occasionally on stimulation of the centre for the forward extension of
the hand this movement of the eyes and head was called into play.
    Inferior frontal convolution          (including all in advance of the sulcus

    Antero-f rental region (including all in advance of the anterior extremity
of the supero-frontal sulcus, and indicated sometimes by a slight sulcus
at right angles to the median fissure) and orbital convolution.
    These regions were subjected to stimulation in four cases, viz.            I., V.,
VIII., and IX.
    No results could     be observed, either from the       antero-frontal or orbital
regions.
    In a later experiment (December 2) on another monkey it was found
that stimulation of the frontal part of the brain caused the eyes to move
to the opposite side. This was found to be the case with irritation of
both right and left hemispheres.             The eyelids were not always opened,
however, nor was dilatation of the pupils observed.               Sometimes also the
eyes moved upwards,         instead of to the opposite side.
    Irritation, therefore, of this region gives nothing definite          as to their
function.

  XIII.      In this case   there were some movementa of the jaws          ; not of
         any decided character.
  These are all the facts      I have been able to gather from experimentation
on this region, which is attended with       some difficulty.

          crossed, as usual.
   IX.    Spasmodic torsion of the right lip and nostril, also on same side
          as stimulation.
   X.   Similar results, viz. an elevation of the right nostril and lip, so as
          to cause partial closure.      In this case the phenomenon was ob

of the olfactory tract from the subiculum cornu ammanis, and which passes
on to the olfactory bulb without decussation.
   The results plainly indicate a perception or subjective sensation        of
odours, and point to this as the central seat of the sense of smell.
   Occipital lobes (superior and middle convolutions).
   These were experimented on in I., III., V., VII., VIII., IX., X., XI.,
and XII. ; also in another, not numbered, on November 21.
   The results, except in the case of X., to be afterwards mentioned,
were altogether negative as far as outward phenomena were concerned.
   The negative results are not to be attributed to exhaustion of the
excitability of the brain, for the other centres at the same time gave the
usual results.
   In  the case of  X. it was observed that stimulation of the inferior occi
pital   convolution  towards its inner aspect caused uneasy movements in
the hind legs and tail, the head being turned to the left (opposite side)
and backwards.      Occasionally also a plaintive cry, as if from annoyance,
was uttered.      On cessation of the irritation the animal subsided into its
dozing state.                                     •
   Possibly the result may be attributed to conduction of the current to
the tentorium or other part of the dura mater ; but, owing to the diffi
culty of reaching this part of the brain, it is not easy to avoid all sources
of fallacy.
   Marginal convolution.
   In the case of IX., the only one explored, it was found that irritation
of the median aspects of the frontal and parietal convolutions caused
movements of the head and limbs similar to those caused by stimulation
of the centres on the outer aspect of the hemisphere.
   Gyrus fornicatus.
   No results were made out     oft slipping the electrodes deeply between
the hemispheres.
   Corpus callosum.
   Stimulation of this was likewise unattended by any outward result.
   These complete the regions which      I have as yet been able to succeed in
experimenting on.
    I now pass from experiments on the hemispheres to similar experiments
 on the basal ganglia.    These were reached in a few cases by division of
 the corpus callosum, turning out the hemisphere partially, and thus lay
ing open the interior of the lateral ventricle.
   Corpus striatum.
    The corpus striatum was laid bare and stimulated in VIII. and       XUI.

Besults   : —
   VIII.    Left corpus striatum.
            Stimulation caused bending of the body to the right (pleurostho-
        tonus) and rigidity of the limbs in the position of flexion.
   XIII. Right corpus striatum.
            Curving of the head and trunk to the left, the platysma being
         strongly in action, while the limbs were maintained in a rigid con
        dition in the position of flexion.
   The results indicated that all the muscles were simultaneously              in
action, individually stimulated by irritation of the cortical centres.
   Optic thalamus.                                        ,
   Stimulated in    VIII.   and  XIII.   Results  : —
   IX.  Entirely negative.
   XIII.    Also negative after several explorations of the upper surface.
   Application of the electrodes to the inner aspect in the region of the
soft commissure caused a spasmodic extension of the limbs. There was
no cry of pain. The result was not constant, and it may therefore have
been an accidental complication.
  No other experiments were made on these ganglia in the monkey,
on account of their resemblance to the results obtained on other animals.
   Corpora quadrigemina.
   These ganglia were subjected to experimentation in the following seven
cases, viz. V., VI., VIII., IX., X., XII., XIII., with the results:—
   V. In this     case the exploration was not sufficiently definite, as the
        exact position of the electrodes was not observed, and death
        occurred before a more careful exploration could be made.
            The application of the electrodes to the ganglia on the left side
         (position as to the testes or nates not ascertained) caused the
        animal to utter various barking, howling, or screaming sounds of
        an incongruous character.               •
            The head was drawn back and to the right, and the right angle
        of the mouth was strongly retracted while the stimulation was
        kept up. The tail was raised and the limbs were thrown into
        contortions, but nothing further was ascertained, as the animal
        died from haemorrhage.
   VI. In    this case irritation of the right anterior tubercle (nates) caused
        intense dilatation     of both pupils (especially beginning in the left),
        elevation of the eyebrows, and turning of the eyeballs upwards
        and to the left, at the same time that the head was turned in the
        same direction with an intensely pathetic expression.
            Momentary application of the electrodes to the posterior tuber
        cles (testes) caused the animal to bark loudly, the sound passing
        with longer stimulation into every conceivable variation of howl
        ing and screaming.

 130             Dr. D. Ferrier on the Brain of Monkeys.
           Continuous    application of the electrodes for several seconds
        caused ultimately firm clenching of the jaws, retraction of the
        angles of the mouth (particularly the left), elevation of the eye
        brows, and retraction of the ears. The pupils were dilated, eyes
        widely open, and the head thrown back. The tail became ele
        vated, the limbs, after contortions of various kinds, became rigidly
        drawn back, the arms drawn back and flexed at the elbows and
        closely approximated     to the sides. A complete state of opistho
        tonus was induced.        The dilatation of the pupils occurred on
        irritation of both nates and testes ; the screaming &c. only on
        irritation of the testes.
   VIII. The results in this case were essentially the same as in VI., as
        regards the dilatation of the pupils, howling, and rigidity of the
        limbs, Ac.
   IX. As before, stimulation of the anterior tubercle on the right sida
        caused elevation of the eyebrows, dilatation of the pupils, and
        turning up of the eyes to the left. Irritation of the ganglia for
        some time caused a condition of opisthotonus, and the phenomena
        described under    VI.
           Irritation  of the testes caused utterance of every variety of
        barking and howling, ultimately trismus and general opisthotonus.
   X. Exactly    as in IX.
   XII.   As before, irritation of the testes caused barking and howling.
           When the animal was nearly dead irritation of the testes caused
        only powerful retraction of the angles of the mouth, so as to show
        the firmly clenched teeth.
   XIII. In this case the results as to the nates and testes were in every
        respect similar to those already detailed in the former cases.
   Cerebellum.
   Experiments were also made on the cerebellum in five monkeys, some
of those already alluded to, as well as others. Further than stating that
the results which    I have already described (West-Eiding Reports) in the
case of rabbits, viz. alteration of the optic axis in different directions
according to the part stimulated, are confirmed in the case of monkeys,       I
do not at present intend entering into fuller details, but reserve a full
consideration of this subject for a future paper.
   There is great difficulty in ascertaining the exact causation and relation
of the phenomena which are manifested on irritation of the cerebellum
along with movements of the eyeballs.        Among others, it may be stated,
are certain movements of the limbs and trunk, which       I interpret as indi
cations of an attempt to adjust the equilibrium of the body in harmony
with the ocular movements.          On this point, however, further experi
ments are necessary.
   An attempt to analyze and interpret the significance of these results
will be made in the next communication.

 The Croonian Lecture, "Experiments on the Brain of Monkeys"
        (Second Series), was delivered by David Ferrier,              M.A.,
        M.D., Professor of Forensic Medicine, King's College.          Com
        municated by Dr. Sanderson, V.P.R.S.            Received   April 27,
        1875. The following is an Abstract : —
     This paper contains the details of experiments on the brain of monkeys,
 supplementary to those already laid before the Society by the author.
 They relate chiefly to the effects of destruction, by means of the cautery,
 of localized regions previously explored by electrical stimulation.
    Twenty-five experiments are recorded in detail, and the individual
experiments are illustrated by appropriate      drawings.    The results are
briefly summed up as follows : —
     1. Ablation of the frontal regions, which give no reaction to electrical
stimulation, is without effect on the powers of sensation or voluntary
motion, but causes marked impairment of intelligence and of the faculty
of attentive observation.
    2. Destruction of the grey matter of the convolutions bounding the
 fissure of Rolando causes paralysis of voluntary motion on the opposite
 side of the body ; while lesions circumscribed to special areas in these
 convolutions, previously localized by the author, cause paralysis of volun
  tary motion, limited to the muscular actions excited by electrical stimula
 tion of the same parts.

    3. Destruction of the angular gyrus (pit eourbe) causes blindness of the
opposite eye, the other senses and voluntary motion remaining unaf
fected.      This blindness is only of temporary duration, provided the
angular    gyrus   of the other hemisphere remains intact.          When both
ace destroyed, the loss of visual perception is total and permanent.
    4. The effects of electrical stimulation, and the results of destruction
of the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions, indicate that they are
the centres of the sense of hearing.       (The action is crossed.)
    5. Destruction of the hippocampus major and hippocampal convo
lution abolishes the sense of touch on the opposite side of the body.
    6. The sense of smell (for each nostril) has its centre in the subi-
culum cornu ammonia, or tip of the uncinate convolution on the same
side.
    7.  The sense of taste is localized in a region in close proximity to the
centre of smell, and is abolished by destructive lesion of the lower part
of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. (The action is crossed.)
    8. Destruction of the optic thalamus causes complete anaesthesia of the
 opposite side of the body.
     9. Ablation of the occipital lobes produces no effect on the special
 senses or on the powers of voluntary motion, but is followed by a state
 of depression and refusal of food, not to be accounted for by mere con
 stitutional disturbance consequent on the operation.          The function of
 these lobes is regarded as still obscure, but considered to be in some
  measure related to the systemic sensations.       Their destruction does not
 abolish the sexual appetite.
     10. After removal both of the frontal and occipital lobes, an animal
  still retains its faculties of special sense and the powers of voluntary
 motion.

 May 27th.

     The following Papers were read     : —

  1875.J      On the Liquation of Alloys of Silver and Copper.            433
 I. " On the Liquation of Alloys of Silver      and Copper." In a Letter
        addressed to the Secretaries of the Royal Society, by Col.
        J. T. Smith, Madras Engineers, F.R.S. Received April 2,
        1875.
    It has occurred to me that it might be useful, as a guide to future
 inquiries, if   I  were to communicate, in reference to Mr. Roberts's
 paper
         " On the Liquation, Fusibility, and Density of certain Alloys of
 Silver and Copper," the results of some experiments made by me many
 years ago, the conclusion to which     I was led being that the separation
 of the constituent parts of an alloy containing 91 § per cent, of silver
 was not so much due to the rapidity or slowness with which the heat of
 the fluid metal was abstracted, as to the inequality affecting its removal
 from the different parts of the melted mass in the act of consolidation.
 Thos, if a crucible full of the melted alloy were lifted out of the furnace
 and placed on the floor to cool, the surface of the melted metal within it
 being well covered with a thick layer of hot ashes, the lower parts of
 the mass, after it had become solid, would be found to contain less silver
 in proportion than the upper surface.
    If,  on the other hand, the crucible were left to cool while imbedded in
 the furnace, the upper surface only being exposed to the air, except a
 thin layer to protect it from oxidation, then the lower parts would, after
 solidification, be found finer than the upper surface.
    The variations here referred to are not considerable ; but they some
 times become of practical importance, especially in those cases wherein,
 as the practice of the Indian Mints used to be, the value of a large mass
 of coins is calculated by the assay of samples cut from a representative
 bar, formed by melting together a number of the pieces selected from the
 mass.
    Under certain conditions, different parts of      a bar of 50 or 60 lbs.
 weight, cast horizontally, though composed of metal which, previous to
 being poured from the crucible, was perfectly homogeneous, might be
 found to vary as much as 1| or even 2 per cent.            A much smaller
 difference than this might be the cause of considerable loss or gain in
the valuation of a large invoice.
    This peculiar action in the cooling of melted silver alloy first attracted
notice by observation of the fact that coinage-ingots, which were about
 15 inches high, 2£ inches broad, and $ inch thick, cast in vertical iron
moulds, were uniformly finer at their upper surface and coarser at their
sides and bottom, especially at the corners.
    It  was at first thought possible that this might be due to the combus
tion of the oil employed to lubricate the moulds causing a sensible
refinement of the metal, as the flames were frequently tinged by copper ;
but the same increased fineness of the tops of the ingots was found to
exist when they had been poured into new iron moulds which had never
                                                              2m2

434                        Col. J. T. Smith   on the              [May 27,
boon lubricated, and also when burnt clay-moulds were used — the only
case in which the phenomenon did not occur being when clay-moulds
heated to redness were used, and the melted metal, instead of being
poured in at the top, was caused to rise from the bottom upwards.
   It was also found that, by using artificial means to cool the ingots from
their upper surface only, the usual refinement was prevented, and the
metal might be caused to become as inferior in quality at the top as, in
the ordinary course, it would have been at the bottom.
   In  short, after   many experiments, it was satisfactorily     established
that, whatever form the metal might take, the act of cooling caused a
partial separation of the copper towards the surfaces from which the heat
was abstracted, those parts of a bar or ingot being the finest which con
gealed the last.
   The experiments here referred to were part of a series constituting a
minute analysis of all the ordinary processes of a mint, with the view
of discovering the unavoidable causes of the loss of precious metal, if
any, and measuring their amount.        In the course of the series more
than 3700 assays were made of standard silver under various conditions ;
and the result was a demonstration of the fact that, with the exception
of the very inconsiderable proportion left in the sweepings, which might
bo reduced, in silver coinage, to less than the twenty thousandth part,
no loss whatever ought to occur ; and hence that, if the quantity left in
the " sweep
              "
                 be ascertained and allowed for, every particle of silver
intrusted to the Mint might be accounted for. This was actually done
in 1854-55 by a coinage of more than 24 tons of silver into 3,458,000
pieces, when every ounce was reproduced, even taking into account the
 " turn of the scale " in assays given in favour of the purchaser.
    But this  close   agreement between the receipts and deliveries of a
mint requires not only an exact valuation of the bullion delivered to it,
but also an equally exact valuation of the coins produced by it ; and a
 somewhat curious result followed, as a corollary to the phenomenon
above described —namely, that as the ingots showed a uniform difference
in their various parts, so the laminated straps, formed by reducing the
same   ingots to one twelfth of their original thickness, show similar
varieties, and the coins cut from the straps also.
   A minute examination of all the various parts of laminated straps
proved that there must be, in all cases, a difference, and in some cases
an important one, in the fineness of the several parts of every coin,
depending upon the position it occupied in the laminated strap from
which it was cut. On a careful examination of the latter there was found
to be, as in the ingots, a systematic variation between the finenesses of
the parts rolled out from the top and bottom, and also between the sides
and centre.     In like manner, as the centre of an ingot is finer than the
sides, so the central line of the strap formed from it is finer than the
edges, and this to a degree frequently exceeding the allowed " remedy "

of   1dwt. in the pound, or the         part ; and as the coins were cut
in a double row down each strap, from top to bottom, it followed that
 every coin at one end of a transverse diameter touched the edge of the
 strap, or the coarser metal, and at the other end of the same diameter
touched the interior or liner metal.
    Thus the different parts of coins composed of standard silver vary
essentially in fineness at different points of their circumference.   If we
were to call those parts of the coins north and south which, before they
 were cut, lay in the direction of the length of the strap, and those at
right angles thereto east and west, it would give a correct idea of this
 peculiarity to say that there is no essential difference between the north
 and south sides of the piece, but a considerable one between the east
and west, frequently amounting to | dwt. in the lb., and in coins cut
 from certain portions of each strap to more than 1 dwt., or j^-, some
times even to 2 dwts.     From this circumstance it is evident that assays
taken in the manner formerly used for the pyx examination of coins
in some of the Indian Mints, by flattening one edge of a coin and
cutting off a part of it for trial, may often lead to its unjust condem
nation ; and when the whole work of a mint of many thousands of
pounds value is liable to rejection in consequence of an unfavourable
report upon individual coins, which more than once occurred in Madras,
it is obvious that a more correct method of ascertaining the average
fineness of the whole outturn is very desirable.
    For this purpose it was suggested that the samples for assay should
be taken from the centre of each coin, or by a ring representing the
whole circumference.     But the true average fineness of the whole of a
large silver coinage is much more easily and better arrived at by taking
out a large number of the coins indiscriminately, and having melted
them together into a perfectly uniform and homogeneous compound, pro
ceed according to the following method, which was latterly adopted in
India.
  While the representative coins are undergoing fusion, a portion is taken
ont in its fluid homogeneous condition and granulated by pouring into
cold water. A number of the granules are then selected for assay, and
after being carefully dried and weighed, are wholly (that        is,
                                                               each granule
in  its integral state) dissolved in acid. The  silver contained  in themis
afterwards separated as chloride, and estimated in the usual way, the

fineness of the mass being calculated by     acomparison of the weight of
pure silver thus ascertained with the original weight of the granules.
     When carefully prepared,   as above described, there    near agreement

in the finenesses of the single granules, which rarely differ from the mean
fineness of the metal so much as two thousandths when individually
assayed, more than half of them being found within one thousandth,
and the average of   a   number consequently very close to the truth.

siie of the tracing in the three latter observations    undoubtedly due to  is
cardiac exhaustion, and may be noticed in several of the instances given
in my paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1873 (vol. xxi.

m*  it well exemplified in fig. IV. ; it may even reduce the tracing to a
Kraisht fine. Beyond this it seems as if the force of pressure " could no
farther 50 :" it is unintelligible how, after a sufficient force has been used
to compress the artery, a greater amount of force should produce a fall
aad tabsequent rise.
    On farther considering these tracings it seemed very important to
dewrtaine whether the rise really corresponded to the rise of the normal
tracisr. or not.     The constant presence of the notch in the apparent
rise in nort cases suggested that this was perhaps not systolic in cardiac
tise, hit diastolic : and on examination this proved to be the case ; for
wiDe the spaygmograph applied to Mr. Hawksley's radial was giving
wvfil-Marfced fails of the lever, at a rate below 70 per minute,   I observed,
by feeong the other radial, that each drop of the lever coincided exactly
with the beat of the pulse, and was therefore systolic in time, so that, of
coarse, the rise must have been diasystolic.      This conclusion was subse
quently coaSrmed by observations made with a " schema," every con
traction of the ball causing a fall of the lever under circumstances to be
                                             "
immediately mentioned.        The " schema employed was rather a rude
affair, only a HigErinson's syringe, with a long flexible tube attached, the
open oridce of which was obstructed to make the pressure more effectual.
When the elastic tube was placed under the spring of the sphygmograph
every contraction of the ball jerked the lever up, and produced such a
tracing as is represented in a, fig. V. ; but when the tube was shifted a
little forwards so as to lie, not under the spring, but under the brass plate
just beyond it, then erery contraction of the ball produced a sudden fall
of the lever, as shown in b, fig. V.        The pressure of the brass plate
when a was obtained was little more than 2 ok., when 6 was obtained
it was 30 oz. But that the increase of pressure was not the efficient
cause of the lever falling instead of rising is shown by the fact that, in
another observation, merely shifting the position of the elastic tube from
below the spring to below the brass plate sufficed to make the difference.
Simply raising the brass plate by taking hold of the screw attached to
the framework above it also depressed the lever.
    From observations recently made by Mr. Hawksley on his arm, we
were unable for some time to obtain a reversed tracing, or, rather, the
movement of the lever which gives it, although a very high pressure was
employed, the spring being made to rest upon the radial artery. As
 long as this was the case the lever either remained motionless or jerked
 upwards ; but when the brass plate at the distal extremity of the instru
 ment was intentionally placed over the artery, the spring being set on
 one side, the lever was at once jerked downwards, and my friend, who had
 been sceptical before, was quite convinced that the cause of reversed
 tracings is the malposition of the instrument.
    The only thing which makes me at all hesitate to rest in this conclu
 sion is, that it does not explain why the reversal of the tracing sometimes

of pressure.  In fig.             II.   I
                            find it rather difficult to think that the degree
of pressure did not in                  some way modify the form             of the tracing.      Of
course   if,   as    is   most probable, reversal of the tracing depends solely on the
causeI       have pointed out, and can be produced           in no other way, no pos
sible effect can be attributed to any alteration of the spring-pressure, as

be taken for         a    tracing     inverted (eerit en sens inverse)          ;    but this depends
only on the phenomena of dicrotism not having had time to work them
selves out (s'accomplir) between two successive pulsations."
    The circumstance that the aortic notch    preserved during the arterial

shows the essentiality of this event.    It was remarking the presence of
this notch which first made me suspect that the sloping ascent of the
inverted tracing was not equivalent to the ascent of the ordinary.
   The chief practical lesson to be derived from the foregoing statements
is, that we need, in using the Sanderson-Marey sphygmograph, to be very
careful that the brass plate     so placed as not to rest upon the artery.

The cases which have come under my observation fall into four series,

   A. Cases, six in number, in which Graafian follicle had been matured

    (1) The first of     these was a young girl who died through the effects
of a   fall,  three or four days before the expected return of the catamenia.
In the left ovary was a recently ruptured Graafian follicle. The cavity
of the follicle was about        j  inch in diameter, and contained a recent clot,
which projected slightly through the rupture ; the clot was of a fresh red
colour, nowhere adherent to the parts around, for on making a section
through the follicle it fell out.          The wall of the vesicle was of a pale
yellowish colour, and slightly         wrinkled. The rupture had evidently taken
place a short time only before death.
    (2) The second subject was a woman who died suddenly through a             fall,
probably a fortnight after the cessation of the last menstrual flow.            On
examination a considerable quantity of blood was found in the cavity of
the peritoneum, and the liver was torn. In the left ovary was a rup
tured follicle, with corrugated and collapsed walls ; its cavity contained
no blood, but there was a slight effusion between its lining membrane
and its outer coat.        The depth of the follicle from the rupture to the
furthest point of the opposite wall measured nearly ^ inch.              It is not
impossible that this follicle was ruptured somewhat prematurely by the
 shock of the fall.
    (3) The next example was observed during life. Mr. Christopher
 Heath performed ovariotomy on a patient on the fourteenth day after
 the cessation of the last catamenial discharge.             Menstruation lasted
usually three days, and the patient had always been regular every four
 weeks.       In the ordinary course of things the next flow would have
 appeared in eleven days.           When the diseased ovary had been removed,
 the remaining one was raised up, with a view to see if it were healthy,
 and it was observed that it contained an enlarged Graafian, follicle,
 which became ruptured when being held in the hand.                I ought to add
that the flow returned three days after the operation, and eight day?
 before it was due.
     (4) The next case was a young woman who died of pleurisy on the
 fifth day of menstruation.          On the surface of the left ovary was a rough,
 brownish-coloured,        star-like cicatrix.   On section there was seen under
 the cicatrix a corpus luteum, dilated in the middle and narrow at both
 ends, nearly       J inch in length and \ inch in width ; its walls were in
 some parts of a pinkish and in others of a yellowish colour, slightly if
 at all thicker than those previously mentioned, and had small promi
 nences on its inner surface.            In the centre was a partially decolorized
 clot, which was but slightly adherent to the surrounding walls.              From
 these characters it is evident that the rupture of the follicle had taken
 place several days before.
     (5) The fifth member of this series was a patient who died on the
  fourth day of menstruation, and about the ninth of typhoid fever. One
  ovary contained a corpus luteum similar to the one just described.
     (6) The last example occurred in a young girl, who died of pneumonia

1875.]       its relation in point of Time to Menstruation.              441
six days after the cessation of the catamenia.       On the surface of the
right ovary was a small cicatrix, beneath which was a corpus luteum
with the following characters : — It was of an irregular, elongated shape,
nearly   | inch in length and | in width ; had thick, yellow, convoluted
walls, and enclosed a small whitish mass, in which were two dark-
coloured spots, which were evidently the remains of a clot.        This ovary
contained also a Graafian follicle of the size of a small pea.     The deter
mination of the age of effused blood is always difficult.    In the Graafian
follicle which becomes ruptured without impregnation taking place it is
known that certain definite changes occur ; the wall of the vesicle becomes
thick, yellow, and convoluted ; the blood which flowed into it and filled
it becomes decolorized and absorbed. The exact length of time in which
these changes in the follicle are brought about is not accurately deter
mined, but it is known that the corpus luteum of one menstruation has
become considerably atrophied by the return of the next.
   It appears to me that the yellow body in the last example of this group
was considerably older than the two preceding ones, and that it was more
than a fortnight old, and that the two preceding ones were from eight to
ten days.
   B. Cases, four in number, in which a Graafian follicle had been ma
tured, and haemorrhage had taken place into its cavity, but no actual
rupture had occurred.
   (1) The first case was a patient who died of pyaemia in the third week
after the cessation of the last catamenial flow. The left ovary contained
a follicle | inch in diameter, distended by a recent non-adherent, softish
coagulum, uniform in consistence and colour.          This follicle was pro
minent above the adjacent surface of the ovary ; and its superficial wall
was thick, and presented no tendency to point or rupture.          There was
no recent rupture to be seen on the surface of either ovary.
   (2) The second example was a woman who had undergone an opera
tion for fistula in ano. The monthly flow made its appearance a week
before the expected time for its return, and she died five days after. One
ovary contained a follicle measuring £ inch by ^ inch ; this follicle con
tained a bright red, fresh, loose clot, and its walls were thin and not
corrugated.     From these characters it appears that the haemorrhage into
the follicle had taken place but a short time before death.
   (3) The next was a patient who had undergone an operation for
the removal of an ovarian tumour.      She died a fortnight after the opera
tion, when she had menstruated for one day. At the inner extremity of
the left ovary was a large, dark-coloured, softish mass, which, on section,
proved to be a Graafian follicle containing a brick-red-coloured clot, which
appeared to be of a spongy texture.       It could with difficulty be turned
out of the sac. After its removal it was seen that the wall of the sac
was formed by a thin yellowish substance.
   (4) The last example in this group was a person who suffered with
fibroid tumour of the uterus.    She died on the third or fourth day of the

  442         Dr.    J. Williams     on the Discharge     of Ova, and     [May 27,
   menstrual flow.       Both ovaries were bound to the surrounding structures
  by tough    and   firm  false membranes.      The left contained a follicle nearly
  an inch in length, in which was found a softish, dark-coloured clot, having
  a spongy texture, which appeared to be several days old.
     In  the first and third members of this group haemorrhage had taken
  place into the follicle unquestionably before the appearance of the cata-
  menial discharge.
     In the second, haemorrhage had occurred before the flow had become
  due  ; but the latter, owing to surgical        interference, having returned a
  week before its time, the haemorrhage took place while the discharge was
  in progress.
     In the fourth, the condition       of the clot makes it almost certain that
 the haemorrhage        had taken place before the appearance of the catamenia.
     C. One   case,   in which  a Graafian follicle had matured, but where neither
 rapture nor haemorrhage had actually occurred.
     This was a patient who died of typhoid fever just before the appear
 ance of the catamenia.          In one ovary there was an enlarged Graafian
 follicle, which was highly vascular, and projected like a nipple beyond
 the surrounding surface.          It was evidently on the point of bursting, and
 it is doubtful whether rupture of the follicle or the appearance of the
 discharge would have taken place first.
    D. Cases, three in number, in which no Graafian follicle had become
 enlarged to the sixe exhibited by it at maturity.
    The fir*t was a patient in whom the menstrual flow had almost ceased.
 There was no rupture in either ovary, but the right contained a Graafian
 follicle about the size of a small pea.
    The next was a young suicide, who died three days after the cessation
 of the catamenial discharge.           There was no recent rupture in either
 ovary, but the left contained a follicle similar to the one seen in the pre
 ceding case.
    The last member of the series was a girl who died of peritonitis,
 caused by the rupture of an abscess on the right ovary.           In the left was
a Graafian follicle about the size of a small pea, but no recent rupture.
 The state of the lining membrane of the uterus showed that in this
case menstruation was imminent.
    Besides the appearances described, there were in all the preceding
cases    numerous Graafian follicles, varying in size from a millet-seed
downwards, together with some superficial pits and atrophied corpora lutea.
    These cases appear to me to bear out the opinion stated at the begin
ning of the paper, that, in the great majority of subjects, the discharge of
ova takes place before the appearance of the menstrual flow with which
it is connected ; for in ten out of the fourteen rupture of a follicle, or
haemorrhage      into its cavity, had occurred before the return of the cata
menia    ; in one it was doubtful whether rupture of a follicle, or the
appearance of the discharge would have taken place first; in two a
menstrual period had passed without maturation of a follicle ; and in one

1875.]          its relation in point of Time to Menstruation.                     *
                                                                                        443
a periodical discharge was imminent, though the ovaries contained no
matured Graafian follicle. It is not improbable that the follicles which
were found in the three last cases, and which were enlarged to the size
of              would have become mature by the next return of the flow.

     I
     have carefully considered the cases recorded by Cruikshank, Jones,
Patereon, Lee, Girdwood, Negrier, Costo and others, and find that,
though they do not contribute materially to the solution of the question
discussed in this paper, yet, in so far as they go, they favour the view
put forward here —a view which derives support from the custom im
posed by the Levitical law, and observed to this day by the stricter sect
of the Hebrew community.
         Postscript.       Received         June   10, 1875.   Communicated       by
                                   Dr. Sharpey, F.R.S.
   Since writing the above,             I
                            have had opportunities to examine two sub
jects in whom the date of the last menstruation was known.
     The first was girl aged 17 years, who died on the fifth day after
                       a
admission to the Middlesex Hospital of traumatic tetanus.      She was said
to have ceased to menstruate just before admission ; and the condition of
the inner surface of the uterus confirmed that statement. The uterus
and ovaries were small and imperfectly developed. On the surface of tho
right ovary was found a patch \ inch in diameter, slightly injected, and
presenting a punctated appearance.    In its centre was a cicatrix, appear
ing as a white spot, beneath which was situated a yellow body, elongated
and irregularly flattened in shape. This appeared to be due to pressure
from several Graafian follicles growing in close proximity to           the       it,
largest of which   was as large as   small pea.
                                              a   The yellow body  measured
nearly inch in length
          \                   had folded walls, and in its centre was
                               ;   it                                  thin       a
elongated  clot, the middle  of which  was of   dark colour.
                                                           a
   The second subject was aged 26 years she died of Bright's disease.
                                                       ;
The last menstruation began May 13th, ceased May 19th, and death
occurred May 28th, 15 days after the appearance of the flow.        Haemor
rhage had taken place into the superficial tissue of the ovaries, probably
by reason of the condition of the blood.
   In the right was small superficial prominence formed by yellow
                           a                                                  a
bodv, which measured about      inch in diameter
                                        f               was throughout of
                                                               ;   it
a  yellowish colour, and contained no trace    of the  colouring-matter    of
blood.   On comparing these organs with one another and with those
previously described,   am led to infer that in the first 12 to 14 days, and
                           I
in the second about 20 days had elapsed since rupture of the follicle
occurred.
   Reichert has examined 23 organs in which signs of menstruation were re
cognizable. In four cases Graafian follicle had matured but not ruptured,
                                   a
nor had haemorrhage taken place, though the decidua menstrualis was in                   a
state of greater or less development in eighteen cases
                                                   ;      Graafian follicle
                                                                        a

had ruptured, and haemorrhage had taken place into the decidua ; in one case
only, in which bleeding had not begun, had a Graafian follicle been rup
tured.    The latter statement appears opposed to the conclusions at which
I   have arrived ; but this is only apparent ; for in one case a follicle had
ruptured, in four a Graafian follicle had matured before haemorrhage began,
and in one of these rupture was on the eve of taking place ; in eighteen
a follicle had ruptured, and haemorrhage had taken place into the decidua
menstrualis.      Put in this form, Reichert's cases are not opposed to the
conclusions    arrived at in the preceding note ; and as his cases have not
been   described, it is not possible to say what their actual bearing may be.
The conclusion arrived at by Reichert, after examination of the 23 speci
mens, however, is that rupture of the Graafian follicle takes place at an
early stage of the menstrual flow.
 IV. " Note      on  Mr. Mallet's Paper on the Mechanism of Strom-
     boli"*.   By Robert Mallet, F.R.S. Received May 21, 1875.
    Since the appearance of my paper on Stromboli some strictures hostile
to the views therein contained have been publishedt, in which it is urged
that the elevation of the fundus, or bottom of the visible crater, which
I   have  assumed at 300 to 400 feet above the sea, is greatly            below the
truth, that being, it is affirmed, at least 2000 feet above the sea-level. It is
added that " Mr. Mallet's whole theory hangs upon the proximity of the
bottom of the crater to the sea-level," and that " Mr. Mallet's hypothesis
 of the mechanism of Stromboli is based entirely on these grossly inac
 curate measurements."         It is unnecessary that       I should occupy the time
 of the Society by any discussion as to the correctness or incorrectness of
 either of the above levels, neither of which are more than loose approxi
 mations   ; but  I beg permission to point out that the theory of the rhyth
 mical action of Stromboli which        I  have proposed does not rest upon the
 proximity of the fundus to the sea-level, and stands equally valid whether
 the height of the tube C (see diagram no. 4, p. 512, Proc. Roy. Soc.
  1874), or, what is the same thing, the difference in level between the sea
 and the bottom of the crater, be 300 to 400 feet or 2000 feet. That
 tube, whether long or short, is never filled, according to my views, by a
 column of liquid lava or water, but only with steam more or less dense
 before being blown off to a lower pressure ; and the only change intro
 duced by lengthening the tube C is, that a greater volume of steam is
 required to fill it ; so that the tube being supposed of uniform calibre, the
 volume of steam required to produce equal tensions in the shorter or
 longer tube, as above stated, would be about as one to five ; and no diffi
 culty can suggest itself to the mind of any physicist as to the adequacy
  of the mechanism that      I  have suggested for such supply.

 also diminished     by hanging       on the weights,                and increased by taking

   Wires of about the same gauge as the steel were used, but, except one
of them, bore only about 28 lbs. instead of 230. All of three or four
kinds tried agreed with the steel in (1).
   The first tried behaved (except a seeming anomaly, hitherto unex
plained) in the reverse manner to steel in respect to (2), (4), (5), and (6) ;
it agreed with the steel in respect to (7). Another iron wire*, which,
though called
                   " soft," was much less soft than the first, agreed with steel
in respect to (1) and (2), but [differing from steel in respect to (3)]
showed greater effects of weights on and off when the magnetizing current
was flowing than when it was stopped.
   Other soft-iron wires which were very soft, softer even than the first,
agreed with all the steel and iron wires in respect to (1), but gave
results when tested for (2) which proved an exceedingly transient
 character of the residual magnetism, and were otherwise seemingly ano
malous.
    The investigation is being continued with special arrangements to find
 the explanation of these apparent anomalies, and with the further object
 of ascertaining in absolute measure the amounts of all the proved effects
 at different temperatures up to 100° Cent.

                 «'), the corresponding density is p, a given function of
(x . . . z, w), and that the element of mass pdvr exerts on the attracted
point (a . . c, t) a force proportional to the (« + 2g,+l)th power of the
distance      {(a—xf.      .                «)*+(«— w)3}*.              The integration is extended
so as to include the whole attracting                       mass Jpdm ; and the          integral is then
said to represent the prepotential of the mass in regard to the point
(a . . c, «). In the particular case *=2, q=
                                             — the force is as the inverse
square of the distance, and the integral represents the potential in the
ordinary sense of the word.
   The element of volume d40a is usually either the element of solid
(spatial or (s+l)-climensional) volume dx . . . dzdw, or else the element
of superficial (s-dimensional) volume dS. In particular, when the surface
(»-dimensional locus) is the (s-dimensional) plane u, = 0, the superficial
element dS is=rf.r         . . .   dz.      The    cases    of    a   less-tban-s-dimensional     volume
are in the present memoir considered only incidentally.       It is scarcely
necessary to remark that the notion of density is dependent on the dimen
sionality of the element of volume dm : in passing from a spatial dis
tribution, pdx . ..dz dw, to a superficial distribution, p dS, we alter the
signification of p.  In fact                 if,
                                 in order to connect the two, we imagine
the spatial distribution as made over an indefinitely thin layer or stratum
bounded by the surface, so that at any element dS of the surface the
normal thickness      dv, where dv
                          is           function of the coordinates (x. .z, w)
                                                   is   a
of the element dS, the spatial element     =dv tfS, and the element of mass
                                                            is
  dx. .dzdw      =pdvd8 and then changing the signification of p, so as
                  it is
p                                       ;
to denote by     the product   dv, the expression for the element of mass
                                            p
becomes     dS,
              p which     the formula
                                   is   in the case of the superficial dis
tribution.
   The space or surface over which the distribution extends may be spoken
of as the material space or surface so that the density ;       not = for            p   is        0
any finite portion of the material space or surface and     the distribution ;     if
be such that the density becomes =0 for any point or locus of the mate
rial space or surface, then such point or locus, considered as an infini
tesimal portion of space or surface, may be excluded from and regarded
as not belonging to the material space or surface.      It allowable, and           is
frequently convenient, to regard as a- discontinuous function, having its
                                                    p
proper value within the material space or surface, and having else
where the value =         and this being so, the integration may be
                               0

  A belongs to Green, being in fact the fundamental theorem of his memoir

    In this " Part " the author gives additional evidences of extinct genera
 and species of Kangaroos defined in the two preceding Parts (VIII. and

 mandibular teeth, and gives a restoration of the entire skull ; the pelvis,
 femur,    tibia,    calcaneum, and principal bones of the hind foot of this
 gigantic species are described and figured.
    Of Macropus Titan the author restores the entire skull and femur.
 Of Sthenurus Atlas he describes and figures the incisor teeth, the deci
 duous dentition, and the fore part of the skull of a young individual : of
the larger species of this genus, Sthenurus Brehus, the entire skull and
dentition are restored. Tho " Part concludes with the restoration of cer

 Binney expressed his belief that the plant was the rachis of a fern, or
 of a plant allied to one.*' At the Meeting of the British Association at
 Bradford, in September 1873, the author described this plant, and
 pointed out his reasons for believing it to be not only a fern, but to
 belong to the interesting family of the Marattiaeeae ; and in the subse
 quent January Professor Renault read a description of the plant to the
 Academy of Sciences at Paris, when, on independent evidence, he arrived
at the same conclusion, viz. that it was one of the Marattiaeeae. Slightly
 modifying M. Brongniart 's generic name, M. Benault designates the plant
Mgehpterit.
    The author has obtained well-marked         examples of this plant from the
 Lower Coal-measures near Oldham, from a rachis nearly an inch in diameter
 to the smallest leaf-bearing twigs and leaflet-petioles.        It consists of a
 mass of parenchyma encased in a hypodermal layer of sclerenehymatous
 prosenchyma, arranged in anastomosing longitudinal bands, separated,
 when seen in tangential sections, by vertically elongated areolae of paren
 chyma, which latter has probably spread out as a thin epidermal layer in
 vesting the entire rachis.        These fibrous bands project inwards with
 sharp wedge-shaped angles ; and in some examples portions of them be
 come isolated as free fibrous bundles, running vertically through the
 peripheral portion of the inner parenchyma of the rachis.             Numerous
 vascular bundles run vertically through this parenchyma.               In trans
 verse sections, not distorted       by pressure, these bundles are arranged
 in   some    degree of regular order.        This is especially the case with
 a circle composed of the peripheral series of bundles.               Their com
ponent vessels are spiral in the case of some of the smaller ones, and
barred, very rarely reticulate, in a few of the larger vessels.          Scattered
abundantly throughout the parenchyma are numerous narrow intercel
lular gum-cahals.      The majority of these are isolated ; but in most of
the specimens there runs side by side with the vessels, and enclosed
within the special cellular sheath which
                                               imperfectly encloses each bundle,

a canal, of varied    sizes and shapes, which appears to have been ori
ginally a gum-canal, subsequently enlarged irregularly by the shrinking
of the neighbouring tissues. In the larger and more matured petioles
these vascular bundles are very couspicuous, both in transverse and longi
tudinal sections ; but in the small, young, and terminal subdivisions of
the rachides the vessels are so small as to be almost undistinguishable from
the surrounding parenchyma, while the gum-canals of such examples
are, on the other hand, conspicuously large.          Transverse sections of
the most perfect examples of these young rachides exhibit, on their
upper surface, a rounded central ridge, flanked on either side by a longi
tudinal groove, which arrangements are so conspicuous in the corre
sponding portions of the petioles of the Marattiaceae and of other ferns.
The ultimate leaflet-petioles were given off at right angles to the central
rachis from which they sprang, corresponding in this respect with one
of the types described by M. Renault. The author has not yet found in
 Lancashire any of the large specimens that have been met with on the
 continent at Autun and in the localities whence M. Cotta obtained his
 examples.     He has found a few and yet smaller fragments among the
 sections from Burntisland.      The recognition of the Marattiaceous cha
 racter of these plants excludes the Palmaccce for the present from all
 claim to share in the glories of the carboniferous vegetation.
    The second plant described by the author consists of clusters of
 roots with a portion of the outermost parenchymatous layer of the stem
 of a tree fern, corresponding to those of the Psaronites long known
 to characterize the upper carboniferous deposits of Autun and other
 localities. The roots of the Oldham specimen, to which the author has
 assigned the name of Psaronites Renaultii, consist of a well-defined
 cylinder of sclerenchymatous prosenchyma, within which has been a
 mass of more delicate parenchyma, in- the centre of which was the usual
 vascular bundle.    But what characterizes the specimens, distinguishing
 them from the numerous     species described by Corda, is the existence of
 vast numbers of cylindrical hairs, each composed of a linear row of elon
 gated cylindrical cells : these have obviously been the absorbent root-
 hairs of the living plant, which may possibly have been some species of
 Slemmatopteris ; but of this there is as yet no evidence.
    The author then describes a small but very remarkable stem, to which
 he assigns the name of Kaloxylon Huokeri. This is a slender stem, rarely
 more than from one seventh to one tenth of an inch in diameter.        In its
 young state it consists of a central vascular axis which has an hexagonal
 section, and which is composed of numerous vessels of various sizes, each
 of which exhibits the reticulate form of the scalariform or barred type,
 and which is so common amongst the plants of the Coal-measures.           No
 true barred or spiral vessels have yet been seen in the Kaloxylon. In the
 young twigs this vascular axis is surrounded by a mass of large-celled
 cortical parenchyma, which, in turn, is encased by an epidermal struc

ture, composed of a double row of what have evidently been colourless
cells, and which are elongated vertically, but with square ends.
   In the more matured stems, the central vascular axis of the young
twigs    becomes    the   centre    radiate six exogenously developed
                                   whence
wedges of vascular tissue, each of which enlarges as it proceeds out
wards and terminates at its outer extremity in a slightly rounded con
tour.        wedge consists of a series of radiating vascular laminae,
           Each
separated by numerous    medullary rays, which latter consist of long and,
for the most part, single vertical rows of mural cells. These six exo
genous wedges are separated from each other by a large wedge of cellular
cortical parenchyma, the cells of which are elongated radially and have a
somewhat mural arrangement.       As those between any two contiguous
wedges proceed outwards, they separate more or less definitely into two
series, which diverge right and left to sweep round the peripheral extremity
of each nearest exogenous wedge, meeting and blending with a similar set
coming from the opposite side of the wedge. In doing this they form a
sort of loop, enclosing a semilunar mass of smaller cells interposed
between the loop and the outer end of the exogenous wedge. The author
demonstrates       that this enclosed cellular tissue is essentially a cambial
layer, out of which        all the new vessels and peripheral extensions of
the medullary rays were developed.       Young vessels are seen at its
inner surface in process of formation.  External to these two specialized
cortical tissues there     is,
                         in these matured stems, a mass of the primitive
cortical    parenchyma     seen    in the youngest shoots, enclosed,     as    before,
ilka double layer of epidermal cells.
     The authorhas traced the development of branches from this axis.

eminently exogenous manner, the details of which are given in the
memoir.      But, besides                            of
                                              vessels are given off which
                             these, other clusters
have no exogenous development or radiating arrangement.      It not vet   is
clear what these secondary vascular bundles signify.
   The author points out the general resemblance between this develop
ment of the detached exogenous wedges and that of the 4-partite woody
axes     of the Bignonias of Brazil, demonstrating at the         same    time their
very marked differences.
   Though no traces of leaves have yet been discovered in connexion with
these stems, the author has very little doubt that they belong to some
Lycopodiaceous plant.    The nature of the vessels and the simplicity of
their arrangement alike indicate cryptogamic features, at the same time
that their mode of development indicates, with remarkable distinctness,
that we have here another examplo of that exogenous mode of develop
ment of which the author has already described so many modifications
amongst the fossil stems from the Coal-measures. The occurrence of this
physiological process of exogenous growth in       stem which, when

that its occurrence is not merely       a question  of the  size  of the plant, a?
some have supposed, but that it        has a deeper   meaning,   and  corresponds
more closely than has been supposed with the exogenous developments
seen equally in large and small examples of living plants.
 IV.   "Experiments on Stratification inElectricalDischarges through
        Rarefied Gases."         By William Svottiswoode, M.A., Treas.
        R.S. Received May 27, 1875.
     In  the stratified  discharges through rarefied gases produced by an
 induction-coil working with an ordinary contact-breaker, the striae are
 often unsteady in position and apparently irregular in their distribution.
 Observations made with a revolving mirror, which           I  hope to describe on
 another occasion, have led me to conclude that an irregular distribution
 of striae does not properly appertain to stratification, but that its appear
 ance is due to certain peculiarities in the current largely dependent upon
 instrumental    causes.
     The beautiful    and steady effects obtained by Mr. Gassiot with his
  Leclanche    battery, and also more recently by Mr. De La Rue with his
 chloride-of-silver battery, have abundantly shown the possibility of stra
 tification free from the defects above mentioned ; but it must be admitted
 that the means employed by those gentlemen are almost gigantic.                The
  present experiments were undertaken with the view           of ascertaining, first,
  how far it was possible to approach towards similar results with instru
  ments already at my command ; and secondly, whether these would afford
  other modes of attack, beside the battery, on the great problem of strati
  fied discharges.
     The induction-coil used was an " 18-inch " by Apps, worked occa
 sionally by 6 large chloride-of-silver cells, kindly lent to me by Mr.
  De La Rue, but more usually by 10 or by 20 Leclanche cells of the
  smallest size ordinarily made by the Silvcrtown Company.                   I  havo
 also, in connexion with the same coil, 120 of the latter cells, connected
  in twenties for quantity, and forming 6 cells of 20 times the surface
  of the former : these work the coil with the ordinary contact-breaker
  very well, giving 11-inch sparks whenever required.                 A "switch"
 affords the means of throwing any of the three batteries in circuit at
  pleasure.
     Having reason to think that the defects in question were mainly due
  to irregularity in the ordinary contact-breaker,      I constructed one with a
  steel rod as vibrator (figs. 1 &2, p. 456), having a small independent electro
  magnet for maintaining its action. The natural vibrations of the rods which
  were tried varied from 320 to 768 per second ; while under the action of
  the battery-current and electromagnet they varied from 700 to 2500, or
  thereabouts, per second. The amplitudes of the vibrations were exceed
  ingly small, in fact not exceeding -01 of an inch; and it is to this fact,

coupled with the extreme rapidity and consequent decision of make and
break, that      I mainly attribute the steadiness of the results.
    The rod bore a plate of platinum, hammered hard, on its upperside ;
and when contact was made this plate met a thin platinum pin connected
with the circuit.        In order to avoid, as far as possible, any uncertainty in
contact,      the diameter of this pin was small ; and one difficulty to be
obviated was the heating and even fusion of the platinum when the
circuit was completed.         This was met by using the small-sized cells men
tioned      above,  and employing      a fine copper   wire (No. 2G) round the
electromagnet.          The very    slight
                                            " strength  of current," or minute
" quantity," required for the illumination of vacuum-tubes made it pos
sible so to reduce the surface of the battery-cells and the diameter of
wire as to render the overheating in a great measure avoidable. This
reduction of dimensions, however, is limited, first, by the amount of mag
netism required to keep up the vibrations, and, secondly, by the diameter
of the tubes used for the experiments ; for it is obvious that, since wire
and tube both form parts of the same circuit, in order to produce an
equal illumination (other things being the same), we must for a tube of
large diameter use a thicker wire than would be necessary for one of
small diameter.
    With a contact-breaker of this kind in good action, several phenomena
were noticeable; but first and foremost was the fact that, in a large
number of tubes (especially hydrocarbons), the striae, instead of being
sharp and flaky in form, irregular in distribution, and fluttering in position,
were soft and rounded in outline, equidistant in their intervals, and steady
in proportion to the regularity of the contact-breaker.          These results are,
I think,     attributable   more to the regularity than to the rapidity of the
vibrations.        And this view is supported by the fact that, although the
 contact-breaker      may change its note (as occasionally happens), and in so
 doing may cause        a temporary disturbance in the stratification, yet the
new note may produce as steady a set of strife as the first : and not only
so, but frequently there is heard, simultaneously with a pure note from
 the vibrator, a strident sound, indicating that contacts of two separate
periods are being made ; and yet, when the strident sound is regular, the
 striae are steady.       On the other hand, to any sudden alteration in the
 action of the break (generally implied by an alteration in the sound) there
 always corresponds an alteration in the striae.
     It  is difficult to describe the extreme delicacy in action of this kind of
 contact-breaker,       or " high break," as it may be called. The turning
 through 2° or 3° of a screw, whose complete revolution raises or lowers
 the platinum pin through '025 of an inch, is sufficient to produce or to
 annihilate the entire phenomenon.           A similar turn in a screw forming
 one    foot of the pedestal of the break is enough to adjust or regulate the
 striae ; and a slight pressure of the finger on the centre of the mahogany

stand, apparently rigid, or ev^a on tie tab»e oq which the contact-breaker
stands, will often control their moreaienti.
   The discharges descrii*d above are usually ^although not always) those
produced by breaking contact : bat it often happens, and that most fre
quently when the strident noise is heard, that the current produced by
making contact is strong enoogh to cause a visible discharge.    This hap
pens with the ordinary as with the high break : but  in the latter case the
double current presents the very remarkable peculiarity that the striae of
one current are so arranged as to fit exactly into the intervals of the
other ; and, further, that any disturbance affecting the column of striae
due to one current affects similarly, with reference to absolute" space, that
due to the other, so that the double column moves, if at all, as a solid or
elastic mass.    And this fact is the more remarkable if we consider, as is
easily observed in a revolving mirror, that these currents are alternate, not
only in direction, but also in time, and that no one of them is produced until
after the complete extinction of its predecessor.       And it is also worthy
of note that this association of striae is not destroyed even when the two
currents are separated more or less towards opposite sides of the tube by
the presence of a magnetic pole.    There seems, however, to be a tendency
in that case for the striae of one current to advance upon the positions
occupied by those of the reverse current, giving the whole column a
twisted appearance.     But as there is no trace, so far as my observations
go, of this association of alternate discharges when produced by the ordi
nary break, we seem led to the conclusion that a stratified discharge, on
ceasing, leaves the gas so distributed as to favour, during a very short
interval of time, a similar stratification          on the occurrence of another dis
charge, whether in the same or in the opposite direction.   An explana
tion of the fact that the strue of alternate discharges occupy alternate
and not similar positions is not obvious, and probably demands a better
knowledge of the nature of the striae than we possess at present.
  The column of striae which usually occupy a large part of the tube
from the positive towards the negative terminal have hitherto been
described as stationary, except as disturbed by irregularities of the break.
The column       however, frequently susceptible of
                 is,                                    general motion or

tubes with  his large battery but   am not acquainted with the exact cir

assistant, Mr. P. Ward, to whose intelligence and skill I am much indebted
throughout this investigation, intended for fine adjustment. Wherever the
resistance       be introduced the following law appears to be established by a
great     number     and variety of experiments, viz. that, the striae being previously
stationary, an increase of resistance produces a forward flow, a decrease
of    resistance a backward flow.          I  have generally found that a variation
of     3 or 4 ohms, or, under favourable conditions, of 1 or 2 ohms, in the
primary current is sufficient to produce this effect.                But as an altera
tion in       the current not only affects the discharge directly, but also
 reacts upon the break, the effect is liable to be masked by these indirect
 causes. The latter, so far as they are dependent upon a sudden altera
 tion of     the resistance, may be diminished by the use of the rheostat ; but
 when the       striae are sufficiently sensitive to admit the use of this delicate
 adjustment, some precautions are necessary to insure perfect uniformity
 of current, so as to avoid disturbances due to uneven contact in the
 rheostat itself.
      When the striae are flowing they preserve their mutual distances, and
  do not undergo increase or decrease in their numbers.                 Usually one or
  two remain permanently           attached to the positive electrode ; and as the
  moving column advances or recedes, the foremost stria diminishes in
  brilliancy until, after travelling over a distance less than the intervals
  between the two striae, it is lost in darkness.           The reverse takes place at
  the rear of the column.          As the last stria leaves its position, a new one,
  at first faint and shadowy, makes its appearance behind, at a distance
  equal to the common interval of all the others : this new one increases
  in brilliancy until, when it has reached the position originally occupied
  by the last stria when the column was at rest, it becomes as bright as the
  others.      The flow may vary very much in velocity ; it may be so slow that
  the appearances and disappearances of the terminal striae may be watched
  in all their phases, or it may be so rapid that the separate striae are no
  longer distinguishable, and the tube appears as if illuminated with a con
  tinuous discharge.         In most cases the true character of the discharge
  and the direction of the flow may be readily distinguished by the aid of
  a revolving mirror.         In some tubes, especially in those whose length is
  great compared with their diameter, the whole column does not present
  the same phase of flow ; one portion may be at rest while another is
   flowing, or even two conterminous portions may flow in opposite directions.
   This is seen also in very wide tubes, in which the striae appear generally
   more mobile than in narrow ones.                But in all cases these nodes or
  junction-points      of the  flow retain   their positions under similar conditions
   of pressure and current ; and it therefore seems that, under similar con
   ditions, the column in a given tube always breaks up into similar flow-
   segments.
      These nodes      will often disappear under the action of        a magnetic pole.

                                                                      a
of   it   to the tube, will produce ageneral forward flow of the column.
    The phenomena of the flow, as well as others of not less interest, are
capable of being produced with the Holtz machine.          It well known         is
                                                                     by by
that stratified discharges, similar to those produced      an induction-coil
working with an ordinary break, may be produced             such   machine,           a
provided that     itbo furnished with the usual Leyden jars, and       high                   a
resistance (usually    piece of wetted string) be interposed in the circuit.
                       a
The absence of either of these conditions was supposed to destroy the
striae and to render the discharge continuous.    Experiments which have                  I
recently made, but do not describe on the present occasion, tend in part,
but only in part, to confirm this view.   They show that for the produc
tion of stria; both quantity and resistance are necessary, that the dis
charge  must    occupy    certain short, perhaps, but finite time, or, as
                            a
it may also be expressed, that           a    continuous         current     is   an essential
element.
   Now, seeing that every tube must offer some resistance, and also that
by  adjusting the height of the vertical condensors of the machine (or
length of air-spark interposed in the circuit) we had the means of alter
ing the quantity in the discharge,    seemed worth while to try whether,
                                         it

And this proved to be very easy of attainment in tubes which had been
successfully used      by
                    the coil  and not only so, but the character of the
                                ;
flow therein shown confirmed        in   a   very striking and simple manner the
effects of resistance described above.

plates of the machine revolved at about six times per second,     rather                  a
confused discharge. As the speed was increased,      rapid forward flow of
                                                                 a
the strife was readily discerned and on still further increase to about ten
                                    ;             a
revolutions per second, the flow, first in one part and then throughout
nearly the whole length of the tube, slackened its pace and stopped, and
ultimately reversed its motion.   An increase of speed     equivalent to an
                                                                      is
overcoming or   diminution of resistance in the circuit, diminution of

flow produced by the machine agree with those produced by the coil.

tion, the effects with the Holtz machine were very striking : the strife,
with steady revolution of the machine, became fixed in position and well
defined.     This tube,  some carbonic-acid-gas   tubes, and one or two others,
generally containing acid residua, form a class in which the action of the
machine more nearly approaches that of Mr. Gassiot's battery than in any
others. The striae thus formed were not easily brought into a state of
flow ; but an increase in the rapidity of the machine, or a diminution of
resistance, increased the number of the striae.        As the rapidity was aug
 mented, the striae might be seen pouring themselves out, as it were, from
the positive pole ; the length of the column was slightly increased, but by
no means in proportion to the number of striae.
     One modification of this effect, although almost fantastic in its appear
 ance, seems to deserve a special notice.      It is well known that if a suf
 ficient interval of air be thrown into the circuit all trace of stratification
 disappears, and at the same time the dark interval        between the positive
 and negative parts and the negative halo itself are obliterated.       If, how
 ever, the interval of air be very small, the two kinds of discharge may be
 seen coexisting ; a narrow column of the continuous discharge extends
 along the tube, and on it the striae appear to be strung.         These effects
 are easily produced by slightly lowering one of the vertical conductors of
 the machine ; and perhaps the best effects are shown if the conductor on
 the side connected with the positive terminal of the tube is lowered.
  When this is done the     striae occupying  the portion nearest to that ter
  minal become widely separated        at unequal and varying intervals ; they
 appear to oscillate along the tube with independent motions, as if attached
  to an elastic string which at each instant is unequally stretched at its
  various parts.    The portion of the column so affected varies with the
  length of the interval of air ; and when, for instance, that portion amounts
  to two thirds of the entire length, the striae in the remaining third appear
  crowded together.      As the interval of air is further increased more striae
  become disturbed, the continuous discharge becomes wider and more pro
  minent, and ultimately overpowers and obliterates the striae.
     The resistance-coil used for the secondary current or the machine consists
  of a hollow glass spiral, AAA (fig. 3), having a length of about 50 inches
  and an internal diameter of ^s of an inch. At the head is a small glass
  bulb B, having an opening at the top, which is closed by a glass stopper. A
  platinum wire, N, connected with one of the terminals, H, dips to the
  bottom of the bulb B, which is partially filled with sulphuric acid.       C is
  a small glass   bulb  containing mercury,    and  is connected with  the lower
  end of the spiral by a flexible tube, D. The height of this bulb can be
  regulated by means of the slide F, which moves on the steel rod E.            P
  is a small platinum wire fused into the interior of the bulb G, and is in
   connexion with the other terminal, H.
     If the bulb C be placed in any position, the mercury will rise in the
   spiral to the same level as that in the bulb. The mercury will act

a* a metallic conductor,   and a current   flowing between the terminals
will undergo the resistance    due to the acid in the upper part of the
spiral.

   Attached to the same stand is a coarse resistance-tube, adapted also
 to currents of high tension, such as a 3- or 4-inch spark from an induc
tion-coil. It consists of a tube, S, of about 4 millims. diameter, termi
nating at its upper end in a funnel-shaped bulb, J, and having a platinum
wire fused into its lower end. This rube is filled to R with a mixture of
glycerine and water, in the proportions of 6 to 1. L is a long steel rod,
extending from the clip M to the bottom of the tube, and capable of sliding
up and down ; its lower half is coated with a very small glass tube, K K, so
that its extremity alone is exposed to the contact of the fluid. If the steel
rod L be in the position shown in the diagram, no resistance will be offered
to a current passing through the system ; but if it be raised, the resistance
offered will be in proportion to the length    of column of resisting fluid
through which it has to pass.

 1875.]             On Electrolytic Conduction in Solids.                     463
 V. "Electrolytic Conduction in Solids. —First Example. Hot
        Glass." By Prof. Sir William Thomson, F.R.S. Received
        June   10, 1875.
    Many years ago    I projected  an experiment to test the voltaic relations
between different metals with glass substituted for the electrolytic liquid
 of an ordinary simple voltaic cell, and with        so high  a temperature   that
 the glass would have conducting-power            sufficient to allow induction
 through   it to rule the difference  of  potentials between the two metals.
 Imperfect instrumental arrangements, and want of knowledge of the
 temperature at which glass would have sufficient conductivity to give
 satisfactory results, have hitherto prevented me from carrying out the
 proposed investigation.     The quadrant electrometer has supplied the first
 of these deficiencies, and Mr. Perry's recent experiments* on the con
ductivity of glass at different temperatures the second. The investiga
tion has now been resumed ; and in a preliminary experiment               I  have
already obtained a very decided result.
   The drawing shows the arrangement            adopted.     MN is a brass case
immersed in an oil-bath.        A copper plate, C, of 5 centims. diameter,
lies in the case on a block of wood ; it is kept metallically connected with
the outside case, E, of the electrometer.        A flint-glass plate, G, which is
found to insulate very well at ordinary temperatures, is laid upon C. A
zinc plate, Z, lies on the glass, and is connected with the insulated elec
trode, I, of the electrometer, by means of a wire attached to the end of
a stout metallic stem, A Z, passing through the centre of an open vertical
tube reaching above the level of the oil. The glass was heated gradually,
and was usually kept between 100° and 120° C, the temperature being
measured by a thermometer, B.
   Even below 50° C. there is a decided result, but shown less rapidly

than at higher temperatures.    If the glass is kept at 50° C. for some
time, and 1, after having been metallically connected with P, is left insu
 lated, it soon becomes senwbly charged ; and the charge increases till
it is approximately     equal to that acquired when zinc and copper
plates in a liquid electrolyte are metallically connected with        I
                                                                      and E
respectively.    With the hot glass, as   with  the liquid electrolyte, the
charge given by the zinc to the insulated electrode of the electrometer is
negative.     The charge ultimately reached when the temperature is 50° is
not exceeded at higher temperatures ; but, as said above, when the zinc
is connected with the copper and then insulated, the charge increases
towards its ultimate value much more rapidly at higher temperatures
than at lower.
    Attemperatures between 100° and 120° C. there is a sensible diminu
tion of the ultimate charge after the zinc has been kept for a short time
connected with the copper and then insulated.       There is also a slow
diminution of the ultimate, or, as we may now call         it,

static, charge when the zinc plate    isleft insulated for several hours in
connexion with      I.
    If  small quantity of either negative or positive electricity be given to
         a
I  (always in metallic connexion with the zinc), the temporarily static
state   reached at about the same rate as the zero would be reached by
         is
conduction through the hot glass (according to Mr. Perry's experiments,
communicated to the present Meeting) were the plates both of copper or
both of zinc.
    After the experiment the surfaces of the copper and zinc plates in con
tact with the glass were found to be thickly oxidized.     The glass plate
was quite cloudy after the experiment, and   repetition
                                                a       of  the experiment
increased its cloudiness.  This plate    the flattened bottom of a flint-
                                           is
glass electrometer- jar.
   Three smoother glass plates, tried since, show as yet no signs of decom
position.   At first they only became " exhausted " (in their power to pro
duce the normal charge in zino and copper) after the plates had been
connected     for nearly   a  day, the glass being at from 100° to 120° C.     ;
but after     a   time, although they still gave the normal charge at the
beginning   of the morning's experiments, the charge fell to zero quite
rapidly (that     in about an hour), even when the zinc was kept in
                   is,
 sulated.
    Keeping for   length of time the zinc charged negatively (so as to give
                    a

  I      greater negative charge than that which
         a                                            it would have in the
 " temporarily static " condition of the copper, hot glass, and
                                                                zinc) seemed
 to have no effect   in restoring the normal electrolytic condition    ;but   I
 propose to pursue this trial further, especially with longer time        for the
 restorative electrification.
 I    propose also to return to similar experiments which        I   made many
 years ago on the electric relations of copper, ice, and zinc.

   As to the variation of temperature from centre to surface occasioned
by the rapid cooling of the ball, this was certainly not overlooked in
planning the experiments.     Sir. William Thomson considered the matter
carefully, and selected copper, on account of its high conductivity, esti
mating that in     copper ball of the dimensions used (diameter
                         a                                          centi                           4

simple calculation (made in consequence of M. Cornu's criticism, and
appended below) from Fourier's celebrated formula for the cooling of                                      a

For let b be the thickness of the glass, E the " emissivity " of its outer

      Conductivity of Glass at different Temperatures." By John
      Perry, B.E., Thomson Experimental Scholar in The Natural
      Philosophy Laboratory at Glasgow*.    Communicated by Pro
      fessor Sir William Thomson, F.R.S., LL.D.         Received
      April   8,      1875.
  A  quadrant electrometer now in use in the laboratory seems to retain
its whole charge from day to day    week's loss ; just perceptible, and
                                                    a                is
may be supplied by a few turns of the replenisher.     In a guard-ring
electrometer now in use the charge   almost wholly retained from week
                                                    is
to week. These qualities are due to the exceptionally great insulation-
resistance of the glass employed.
   At various times experiments                       in the laboratory at
                                                have been       made
Glasgow      to determine           the insulation-resistance      kinds of
                                                                       of different
glass.   Of the specimens hitherto examined, those of flint glass have
insulated best and;      hoped that experiments on flint glass now being
                          it   is
proceeded with will define the most suitable glass for use in electrometers
and other electrical instruments.
  The method of investigation essentially the same
                                           is                                 as that which      was
adopted by Sir William Thomson some years ago.                            B   D A (fig.     1)   is a

     For a lecture illustration Mr. M'Farlane, on March 13th, 1874,
                                                                            charged

  about 0-13 centim. thick.        The inside coating was put to earth by
 means of a wire ; the outside was connected with the
                                                              electrometer and
 then charged.     The wire was then withdrawn from the inside,
                                                                            and the
 stem was sealed at E. On March 20th B D was
                                                         agaiu insulated and

                                                                at E, and the
 inside put to earth as before. The original
                                                  charge was   2  1 70.     At the
end of a week the charge was found to be 1952. The
                                                              week's loss was
 218, or 10 per cent.
    The jar was again     sealed on  March 20th with a charge of 1875. On
 April 7th     the charge was      1332 ; so that the loss in 18
                                                                        days was
543, or 28 per cent, of the whole charge.
    On Jan. 5th, 1875, the author gave a charge of 1465 to a
                                                                 flint-glass jar.

    Twenty flint-glass jars, of the shape shown in fig. 1, are now being
examined.       The composition of the glass of each jar is known to
the manufacturer, and glass of the same composition as that of any
particular jar is readily to be obtained.       The diameter of the bulbs is
about 9-5 centims.    and  their thickness  about 0*25 centim.   A jar is filled
with water nearly to the top of the stem. A wet cloth covering all parts
of the bulb and stem below the level of the insulator forms an outside
mating. After being sealed, the jars are placed in running water, the
temperature of which is never greater than 50° F., nor less than 46° F.
The following observations have been made : —
       Jar No. 4. Charged 994. Opened after 10 days. No charge
                         remaining.
        „   No. 9.   Charged 20 So.     Opened after 7 days 6 hours. The
                        charge remaining was 276.
        „ No.    19. Charged 1933.       Opened after 10 days. The charge
                        remaining was 868.
    The arrangement shown in fig. 2 was employed to determine the
 relation between temperature and electric conductivity in a flint-glass
 jar.    The jar was filled to the height A, at ordinary temperature,
 with sulphuric acid. A is a cork supporting the glass insulator C, with
 the lead trough D containing pumice moistened with sulphuric acid. A
 piece of platinum wire hangs into the sulphuric acid and terminates in a
 loop at B, so that the inside coating of the jar is insulated.   A stiff wire,
 M K,    soldered to the electrode of the guard-ring electrometer, passes
 through a small hole at K without touching the glass insulator. Con
 tact between    B and this wire may    be made or unmade by a small motion
 of the apparatus. £ is surrounded by water. L is a thermometer,               J
 a stirrer. 1 supplies water when necessary.        G is connected with the
 outside   of the electrometer.
     To test the cleanness of the glass stem from A to B, a charge was
 given to the jar by the wire K M. After a certain time no further
  diminution of charge was observable during ten minutes, and the electro
  meter- wire was removed, the hole K being closed.           The charge was
  given on Friday.     On Monday it was found that less than 20 per cent,
  had been lost, a proof that the stem was clean, and that the insulation-
  resistance of the sides of the bulb was very considerable.
     The first results obtained by the author are given here in preference
  to those which have since been obtained. They exhibit the joint effects
  of polarisation and true conductivity, and are instructive when examined
 along with the table of approximately true conductivity given below.
  The jar was charged by an electrophorus ; when polarization had sen
 sibly ceased, a lamp was placed under the vessel.
     The change of temperature between successive readings was pretty
 regular, except when water was poured in.        When hot water was poured
in the stirrer was kept in rapid motion.

   The   rapidities of loss are obtained by dividing the Napierian logarithm
of  the   quotient of two charges or readings by the interval in minutes
between      the two observation^.          Thus it is roughly assumed that the
capacity    of the jar is the same at all temperatures.

 472                  On the     Ekclric Conductivity of Glass.               [June     10,
     The polarization       which occurs after charging is very marked.               Some
 of the later tables of results seem to indicate an increased polarization
 due to increase of temperature.             Thus, when at any low temperature the
 conductivity calculated from successive intervals is nearly constant, if
 the temperature is rapidly raised and then kept constant, the conduc
 tivity at the new temperature diminishes for a short time as                   if the jar
 had just been charged.
     [Lu such a jar the charge is approximately represented by
                                              IAV

 the electrometer, and a the thickness of the glass.                But if k is the spe

 and the quantity conducted through, divided* by the charge, is equal to

to approximate very closely to the logarithmic curve

VIII.     "Effects of Stress on Inductive Magnetism in Soft Iron."
        (Preliminary Notice.)   By Prof. Sir William Thomson,
        F.R.S. Received June 10, 1875.
   1. At the last ordinary meeting of the Royal Society (May 27), after fully
describing experiments by which          I
                                       had found certain remarkable effects
of stress on inductive and retained magnetism in steel and soft iron,             I
briefly referred to seeming anomalies presented by soft iron which had
much perplexed me since the 23rd of December.         Differences presented
by the different specimens of soft -iron wire which          I
                                                       tried complicated the
question very much ; but one of them, the softest of all, a wire specially
made by Messrs. Richard Johnson and Nephew, of Manchester, for this
investigation, through the kindness of Mr. William H. Johnson, gave a
result standing clearly out from the general confusion, and pointing the
way to further experiments, by which, within the fortnight which has
intervened since my former communication,              I
                                                 have arrived at a complete
explanation of all that had formerly seemed anomalous.         Those experi
ments have been performed in the Physical Laboratory of the University
of Glasgow by Mr. Andrew Gray and Mr. Thomas Gray, according to
instructions which, in my absence,           I
                                        have sent them from day to day by
post and telegraph.
   2. The guiding result (•described near the end of my former paper, and
referred to in the last paragraph but one of the Abstract in Proceedings
of the Royal Society for May 27) was, that the softest wire, tried with
weights on and off repeatedly, after it had been magnetized in either
direction by making the current, in the positive or negative direction, and
stopping    it,
             gave effects on the ballistic galvanometer which proved a
shaking out of residual magnetism      the first two or three ons and offs,
                                              by
and a gradual settlement into condition in which the effect of " on was
                                     a
                                                                     "
an augmentation, and the effect of " off
                                          "
                                              diminution, of the inductive
                                                   a
magnetization     due to the verticalcomponent of the earth's magnetizing
force. When      fresh piece of the same wire was put into the apparatus
                  a
and tested with weights on and off gave this same effect. If the wire had
                                         it
been turned upper end down and tried again in the course of any of the
experiments, still this same effect would have been shown.  It seemed
perfectly clear that in these experiments there was no other efficient
dipolar quality of the apparatus         by
                                    which the positive throw of the bal
listic galvanometer could be given by putting on the weight, and the
negative throw     taking off, than the vertical component of the earth's
                      by        it

   3. Yet   Idid not consider that      had explained the result by the ter
                                         I
 restrial influence, because, for all the specimens of steel and soft iron, the
 effect of weights on had been uniformly to diminish, and of weights off
 to augment the magnetism when the magnetizing current was kept
 flowing.    And  I        was, moreover, perplexed        by the magnitude   of the

                    m!   so speedily arrived at the following astonishing
    5. (1) When the magnetizing force does not exceed a certain critical
 value the alternate effects of ptdl and relaxation are respectively       ely to aug
                                                                                  aug-
 ment and diminish the induced magnetization.
        (2) When the magnetizing force exceeds the critical value the
effects are — pull diminishes, relaxation augments, the induced1 magneti-
 ration.
        (3) The critical value of the magnetizing force for the annealed
Johnson soft-iron wire, with 14 lbs. on and off, is about 17 or I S. if (for
a moment) we take as unity the vertical component of the terrestrial mag
netic force at Glasgow.
        (4) The maximum positive effect of the pull on the inductive mag
netism is obtained when the magnetizing force is about 4.
        (5) The positive effect of the pull when the magnetizing            force is 3
is about eight or nine times the amount of the negative effect when the
magnetizing force is 25.
    6. The actual results of the experiments which proved these i
sions are exhibited graphically in the accompanying diagram,
 zontal scale (abscissas) shows the numbers of divisions of the scale           of the
steady-current galvanometer (called for brevity the " battery-galvano
meter ") used to measure the strengths of the current through the helix.
The scale of ordinates shows the numbers of divisions of the scale of the
ballistic galvanometer by which the sudden changes of the magnetism of
the wire produced by 14 lbs. "on" and 14 lbs. "off" were measured.
The ordmates are drawn in the positive direction when the effect of " on "
is to increase and of " off
                                     "
                                        to diminish the magnetism.        The simple
round spots show the results of observations with currents in the direc
tion called negative (being those which gave negative deflections of the
battery-galvanometer).            The spots in the centre of signs (+) show results
obtained with currents in the direction called positive.              The star (*) at
the position 64 on the line of ordinates through the zero of

that is to say, when the sole magnetizing force is the vertical component
of the earth's magnetic force. The curves are drawn as smoothly as may
 be by hand, one of them to pass as nearly as it can (without intolerable
 roughness) through all the crossed (plus) dots and the star at 64, the
 other through all the plain dots. The latter curve cuts the line of abscissas
 at 8, this being the result (telegraphed to me this evening) of special

experiments made to-day for the purpose of finding accurately the amount
of the negative current which, by neutralizing the vertical force of the
t«nh or the wire, gives an accurate zero effect for the " off and " on."
                                                             "
The dotted prolongation of the curve through the plus's, to cut the line
of abscissas on its negative side, is ideal, and is inserted to illustrate the
relation of this curve to the other.   By the two curves cutting the line
of abscissas at + S and  —  S, we see that 8 is the strength of the current,
measured on the scale of the battery-galvanometer, which gives a magnetic
force in the axis of the helix equal to the vertical component of the ter
restrial magnetic force.
   7.   Next a series of experiments                      to   test the inductive     effects of
repeatedly making the current always in one direction, and stopping                           it,
with the weight of 14 lbs. always on, and again with the weight off, and
this with various degrees of current, feebler than those used in the earlier
experiments.    The results with all the different intensities of magnetizing
force thus applied were the same in kind as that which          found on the
                                                                           I

" On      the Liquation, Fusibility,           and Density of certain          Alloys

        of the Mint.     Communicated by Dr. Percy, F.R.S. Received
        March 11, 1875*.
    Alloys of silver and copper possess many curious chemical and physical
properties which make them interesting apart from their economic value,
and entitle them to careful investigation.            The most remarkable of these
is a molecular mobility, in virtue of which certain combinations of the
constituents of a molten alloy become segregated from the mass, the
homogeneous character of which is thereby destroyed.
    These irregularities of composition have long been known.                   Some
observations of Lazarus Erckern, in a work published in the seventeenth
century t, show that he was familiar with them ; that Jars possessed
more accurate information on the subject is proved by his stating
explicitly, in a memoir published in 1781            that in ingots of silver-copper
alloys containing    much   of  the    base metal,  the  centre of the mass is less
rich than the external portions.

482                           Mr. W.          C   Roberts on
  The alloys in question have, during the present century, been the
subject of many excellent researches in this country and on the continent,
the earliest   systematic experiments              being those of D'Arcet, Inspecteur
General     des Essais at the French              Mint, who in 1824 investigated the
phenomena which            the cooling of molten mixtures of silver and
                        attend
copper.   He does not appear to have published his results ; but in 1852
Levol stated, in a well-known memoir*, that the object D'Arcet had in
view was the discovery of a method of rendering homogeneous the bars
of metal used in coinage. He adds that the researches in this directioD
offered little prospect of obtaining such a result.              I
                                                    shall presently show,
as    the result of my experiments,                that this conclusion    may now     be
modified.
   Levol, in his own experiments, cast the alloy to be examined either in
a cubical iron mould of 45 millims. side, or in a sphere 50 millims. in
diameter.       He concluded that the only homogeneous alloy contains
718-93 parts of silver and 281-07 of copper in 1000 ; and he considers
this to be a definite combination of the two metals, having the formula
Ag3 Cu4 (or Ag3 Cua if 63-34 be taken to be the equivalent of copper).
All other alloys of silver and copper he views as mixtures of this definite
alloy with excess of either of the metals.
   In 1860t Matthiessen studied these alloys with the minute accuracy
which characterized all his work, and he described them as " mechanical
mixtures of allotropic modifications of the two metals in each other."
The curve of electric conductivity led him to doubt Levol's conclusion
that they were mixtures of the definite alloy Ag3 Cu3 (new notation) with
silver or copper ; for, as he observes, if this were the case, we should
expect to find that the curve consisted of two straight lines, connecting
Levol's alloy with pure silver and copper respectively.         But on examin
ing the curve, starting from the copper side of                it,
                                                          we see that     rapid   a
decrement in conducting-power          caused by copper being alloyed with
                                         is                                            a
small quantity of silver.        From the alloy containing 10 per cent, of
silver to that containing 65 per cent, we have          straight line and we
                                                             a                ;
may regard the intermediate alloys as mixtures or solutions of these two
alloys.     Again, from the latter of these to that containing 72 per cent,
of silver, we may have      amixture or solution of alloys containing 65 and
72 per cent, respectively.     This last point (which corresponds to a con
ducting-power of 63-7, fiue silver being taken as 100)           the minimum
                                                                      is
point   of the curve, and corresponds  almost  exactly to Levol's Ag3Cus alloy.
The alloys intermediate between tliis and pure silver may be mixtures, or
perhaps solutions of     itin silver containing     small quantity of copper.

containing 72 per cent, of silver to that which contains only 10 per
cent.
   I now proceed to give the results          of my own experiments.
   In   commencing       the inquiry,  it seemed      probable that, by determining
the melting-points of a series of the alloys of silver and copper, informa
tion of much interest might be gained as to the arrangement which attends
the solidification of a fluid mass of these metals.              I adopted a modifica
tion of the plan described by Pouillet*, and employed by him in deter
mining the specific heat of platinum at high temperatures.
   As soon as the alloy under examination was melted, a wrought-iron
cylinder of known weight was dropped into it by means of a wire sup
port. The crucible was then removed from the furnace, and, when the
alloy showed signs of solidifying, the iron was transferred to a calori
meter, which consisted of two concentric vessels of thin polished brass,
such as is ordinarily used for determining specific heats by the method of
mixtures.
   It was necessary to determine the mean specific heat of the iron
employed, between 0° C. and a known fixed point near the maximum
temperature likely to be attained in the course of the experiments.               The
melting-point of silver was a convenient one, and it has been accurately
ascertained by M. Becquerelt, who placed a wire of pure silver in a
crucible which was enclosed in a porcelain tube surrounded by the
Tapour of boiling zinc, the temperature of which has been fixed by M.
Deville at 1040° C.+ As the heat was sufficient to partially fuse the
silver, this temperature may safely be taken as the melting-point of the
metal.
   In  order, therefore, to determine the specific heat of the iron, plungedI
the cylinder into molten silver, and transferred it to the calorimeter.               I
may here observe that the film of oxide which formed on the surface of
the iron to    a great extent protected it from being attacked by the molten
alloy  ; but  it was impossible to avoid carrying into the calorimeter a small
quantity of metal which adhered to the iron. The metal so introduced
was always collected and allowed for. With pure silver 0-05701 was
taken as the specific heat, while in the case of alloys the necessary cor
rection was made by deducing the specific heat of each alloy from the
specific heats of its constituents ; and the equivalent weight of iron was
calculated by multiplying the weight of introduced metal by its specific
heat, and dividing this product by the specific heat of iron as ascertained
by preliminary experiments.          This weight was then added to that of the
iron employed.
   The specific heats of metals at high temperatures have not been deter-

carried into the calorimeter by the alloys may tend to make the results a

    The weight of silver carried over was 3-266 grms., the heating effect
 of which is equivalent to that of 1*306 grm. of iron.                    Therefore the
 corrected value of p is 83-140 + 1-306=84-446 grms.

     It may be pointed out that the specific heat of iron as thus determined
 includes and neutralizes several errors which are incidental to this method
 of determining high temperatures.             The principal of these are : —(1) the
 loss of heat, which is rendered latent by the small amount of water which
 is evaporated ; (2) the slight difference between the specific heat of the
 iron and the specific heat of the oxide formed on its surface ; (3) the loss

of heat sustained by the iron during its transfer from the crucible to the
calorimeter ; and (4) the radiation from this instrument.
   The melting-point of copper has not been exactly ascertained ; and           I
experienced great difficulty in determining it by means of the calorimeter,
as the molten metal adheres tenaciously to the iron. Accuracy on this
point is not absolutely essential to this inquiry, and        I therefore adopted
 1330° C, as this is considered by Dr. Van Riemsdijk* to be the probable
melting-point of pure copper.
   The several alloys were synthetically prepared by melting together pure
silver and pure copper ; and as soon as the crucible containing the fused
metal was withdrawn from the furnace, a small portion of the thoroughly
stirred alloy was granulated and set aside for analysis.
   The requisite data for ascertaining the melting-point of each alloy
were furnished by an experiment similar to that which was made for
determining the specific heat of the iron, and in calculating the result
it was only necessary to transpose the equation already given,            T being
the unknown quantity instead of x. The formula then becomes

the value assigned to .r being in all  cases 0-15693, the mean specific heat
of iron, as given above.
   To take an example.      In  one experiment to determine the melting-
point of the 820- 7 alloy, the following values were obtained : —
               P     =247-74 grms.                    < = 15° C.
                                                      G = 56° C.
              p      = 82-55      „
   The weight of alloy carried over was 3*608 grms., the heating effect of
which was equivalent to that of 1-543 grm. of iron.                Therefore the
corrected value of p is
                   82-55 + 1-543 grm.     = 84-093 grms.
   The results of the experiments are given in the following Table : —

  These melting-points are graphically represented by the accompanying
curve (next page) ; the coordinates are the amounts of silver in the several
alloys and     their melting-points.
  It will beobserved that the curve exhibits a somewhat rapid decrement
from pure silver to the alloy which contains 925 parts of silver, the one
employed for the British silver coins.   In it the relation between the
amounts of metals present is approximately represented by the formula
Ag7Cu.
   The alloys numbered 7 and 8 are of singular interest.  The first, which
contains 718-93 parts of silver, is Levol's homogeneous alloy ; and anti     I
cipated that it would have the lowest melting-point ; but the results
showed  that the alloy containing 630"29 parts of silver (No. 8) melts at a
point  which is 23'7 degrees lower.  In this alloy a very simple relation
exists between the atoms of the constituent metals, the formula being
AgCu.     Additional interest is imparted to it by Matthiessen's curve of
electric conductivity having shown that the arrangement of an alloy of
this composition would probably be peculiar.       From this point the curve
passes through the points representing      alloys in which base metal pre
dominates to 1330° C, the melting-point of pure copper.
   Further evidence as to the melting-points of Nos. 7 and 8 was afforded
by placing strips of them in small covered crucibles surrounded by the
vapour of boiling cadmium, the temperature of which has been fixed by
Deville at 860° C.    Both alloys melted, the first partially, the second com
pletely.     I
            am convinced, therefore, that the melting-points of the alloys
generally are not inaccurately indicated by the curve.      It however, not
                                                                    is,

                      certain Alloys  of Silver and Copper.                     489
point to the necessity of slightly modifying its form.                  This critical
examination       is especially necessary in the region of the 497 alloy ;
for not only do the results obtained on it diverge widely among them
selves, but their mean is far removed from the probable line of the
curve.
    I am not   satisfied with the results    I have   obtained on an alloy which
contains    773-2 parts of silver.       This alloy is of special interest ; its
formula is Ag3' Cu", silver being monatomic.
    [Since the above was submitted to the Royal Society,               I  have made
additional experiments on alloys in these two portions of the curve. The
calorimeter used was of thin polished silver, capable of holding 1200
grammes of water, which were never raised through more than 15° C.
The water-equivalent of the instrument was only 15-72 grammes. The
masses of iron used were such as had been employed as carriers of
heat in the first experiments : the mean of several very concordant
results gave '15003 as the specific heat of the iron when this new calori
meter is employed ; and, as has already been pointed out (p. 484), this
number includes and neutralizes several errors.
    The results are distinguished by an asterisk in the Table, and have
been added to those originally indicated in the Diagram.               They confirm
the direction originally given to the curve in the region of the alloys
 which contain from 718 to 800 parts of silver ; but the existence of a
cusp has been detected at the point which represents the alloy No. 11
( Ag3 Cu,). It may be interesting to point out that the results from which
 Matthiessen's curve of electric conductivity was developed appear to
 prove the presence of a cusp at the point which represents the alloy
459-4 (AgCua).— 15th May, 1875.]
    It may be useful to compare these results with those obtained by
Rudberg on alloys of lead and tin. He found that when a thermometer
is placed in a molten alloy of these metals two distinct stationary points
are indicated during the passage from the liquid to the solid state. One
of these points is always 187° C. ; and in the alloy Pb Sn, the two points
coincide at this temperature — a fact which led Rudberg to conclude that
it was the only alloy in which the whole of the metals were chemically
 combined.      I   hope, in continuing this inquiry, to be able to ascertain
whether the change of state in the case of silver-copper alloys also termi
nates at a constant        temperature.     I  may mention that M. A. Eich*
determined     the melting-points of certain alloys of tin and copper by
 means of Becquerel's thermo-electric pyrometer ; and he obtained con
 cordant   results    with the alloys Sn   Cu3 and Sn Cu4       ; but with all other
 alloys the results differed widely among themselves.
    It is at present difficult to show the direct bearing of these results on
 the phenomena of liquation in alloys of silver and copper ; but the curve
 is valuable, as it proves that the alloys Nos. 7 and 8 occupy positions in
                          * Ann. Chim. et Phys. t. xxx. p. 351.

 melting-points exhibit appears to justify the
 conclusion that liquation is in some way the
 result of the unequal cooling of a mass of
 silver and copper, and that              if  the cooling
 could be greatly protracted               the liquation
 would     be considerably       modified.       In  order
 to ascertain      whether      this were the case,       I
 used cubical moulds (about 45 millims. side)
 of firebrick (fig. 7), which were easily heated
 to bright redness, and in which the alloys
 could be slowly and uniformly cooled *.
     All  the cubes represented on pp. 490 & 491 were cast in moulds of this
 description. The first of these (fig. 1), the composition of which was about
 925 parts of silver per 1000 of the alloy, was cooled rapidly. Its structure
confirms Levol's general conclusion, as the centre contains 12-8 parts per
 thousand more silver than the external portions.                      On the other hand,
 fig. 2 shows that when the same alloy is slowly cooled the constituents
 hardly undergo any molecular re-arrangement, the maximum difference
being only 1*4 per thousand.                A cube of the alloy used for the French
coinage,      when    rapidly     cooled,    exhibits a difference of 10-1 parts per
thousand between the centre and the corners                  ; but when the same metal
is slowly     cooled   (fig. 3), the variation is only      1-3  parts per thousand.       The
maximum difference found by Levol in his homogeneous alloy was 0*44
part per thousand.           I find (fig. 4) that if the cooling is slowly effected this
homogeneity is disturbed, the external portions being slightly richer in
silver than the centre.           Fig. 5 exhibits the results of an experiment on
the alloy which has the lowest melting-point and the simple chemical
formula AgCu.             Its structure is interesting, as the action of gravity
appears to have influenced the arrangement, the lower parts of the cube
being richer than the upper.               The maximum difference is 21-1 parts per
thousand.        I should observe that Levol found the corners of a cube of
this alloy to be 15 parts richer than the centre ; but the only alloy in
which he detected any effect of gravity was that containing                    690 parts of

Dr. Boycott, formerly Assay Master in the Calcutta Mint, have shown that the liqua
tion of silver-copper alloys is modified by casting the metal in sand moulds, and that Mr.
E. Seyd suggested in 1871, in a work printed for private circulation, the use of hot
iron moulds in casting gold and silver, as an improvement in the process of coinage,
the bars being "more equal in temper and in molecular arrangement" (patented in
1872, No. J68).

silver.Fig. 6 shows the results of analyses on the different portions of
a massof the alloy containing 333-3 parts of silver per thousand ( Ag Cu4).
The mass varies in composition, but the arrangement does not appear to
have been guided by any law.
   The inquiry appears to show that several alloys of silver and copper
are, under suitable conditions, as homogeneous as Levol's alloy, the chief
peculiarity of which consists in its not being liable to liquation when poured
into a mould at the ordinary temperature and cooled rapidly.
   It will be remembered that experiments prove that in all alloys which
contain less than 71-89 per cent, of silver the external parts are richer
than the centre. The curve of fusibility shows that the alloys which con
tain less than 35 per cent, of silver have higher melting-points than
other alloys of silver and copper, or even than pure silver. It would not
appear, therefore, that liquation is the falling out of the least fusible
alloy present in a mass of silver and copper ; for if it were, the external
portions of the alloys would in all cases be less rich in silver than the
centre.
   I cannot at this stage of the inquiry offer a complete explanation of
this molecular rearrangement ; but             I
                                       venture to think that the results
already obtained are interesting.  They show, first, that the same alloys
are situated on the turning-points of the curves of fusibility and electric
conductivity  and second, that the arrangement of an alloy is to a great
               ;
extent dependent on the rate at which it is cooled.
   In accordance with a suggestion made to me by Mr. R. Mallet, have              I
endeavoured to determine the relation between the densities of silver in
the solid and the molten state.           I
                                   adopted the method which he devised
and has employed in the determination of the density of molten cast
iron *.
   A   conical vessel of best thin       Low-Moor plate (1 millim. thick), about
16 centims. in height, and having an internal volume of about 540 cub.
centims., was weighed, first empty, and subsequently when filled with
distilled water at a known temperature.   The necessary data were thus
afforded for accurately determining its capacity at the temperature of the
air. Molten silver was then poured into                   it,
                                                  the temperature at the
time of pouring being ascertained                  by
                                       the calorimetric method already
described. The precautions, as regards filling, pointed out Mr. Mallet       by
were adopted and as soon as the metal was quite cold, the cone with its
                ;
contents was again weighed.
  The surface of the molten metal in the crucible was covered with char
coal and as pure silver, when in

   The most important of the corrections applied to these results was that
for change of volume of the iron vessel which attended the introduction
of the molten metal.
    Different qualities of wrought iron vary considerably as to dilatation
by heat. This fact, together with the known increase in the expansion
at high temperatures, rendered it necessary to determine the mean coeffi
cient between 0° C. and the melting-point of silver.        For this purpose a
modification of Ramsden's method was adopted, the iron being placed in
a graphite trough and surrounded by molten silver.           The micrometer-
reading was taken when the length of the iron remained for a short
jwriod invariable, as this was the true solidifying-point of the silver,
the loss of the latent heat of liquefaction rendering the temperature
constant.
   A great number of experiments were made ; and although they were
attended with much difficulty,    I believe the following results to be trust
worthy (the numbers represent the mean coefficient of linear expan
sion per 1° C. of the Low-Moor iron employed, up to the temperature
of melting silver) : —

which gives a mean coefficient of cubical expansion
                                  *00003720.
   This result is considerably higher than that of Rinmann, who gives
0-00002808 as the mean coefficient of cubical expansion of wrought iron
between 15° C. and " a white or welding heat."
   The results of the experiments made with a view to ascertain the
densities of pure silver and of Levol's homogeneous alloy when in
a molten state are given in the accompanying Table (p. 495).              This
alloy  was  chosen   for the experiment,    as its  density  when   solid very
nearly agrees with that calculated from the densities of the constituent
metals.
   The cubic dilatation was, in the case of pure silver, in the ratio of
9-4612 : 10-57.     Deducing from this the mean coefficient through, say,
1050°   C, we obtain
                             0-00011164 per 1° C.
   The coefficient of linear expansion was therefore
                                0-00003721.

                                              0-00002015.
    It        will thus      be seen       that the expansion        of silver    between          0°   C.
 and 1050° C. is about twice as much as it would have been had this
 rate of expansion been maintained through the whole range of tem
 perature.

from the results given in the Table, is

but it is impossible to compare this with the rate of expansion at low
temperatures, as the latter has not been ascertained.

      By S. C. Tisley. Communicated by "W. Spottiswooue, M.A.,
      Treas. R.S. Received June 17, 1875.
   In the first machines constructed by Siemens and Wheatstone in 1S67
(see Boyal Society's Transactions) the power of augmenting the mag
netism by successive currents, developed from the original residual
magnetism contained in the iron, was fully demonstrated, and it was
shown that the power of the machine could thereby be developed to a
great extent ; but the only means for obtaining external work was by
the insertion   in the circuit of a magnet or coil so that the secondary
discharge could be utilized.      Sir Charles Wheatstone also showed that
a great part of the current could be shunted through a platinum wire,
care being taken that the resistance of the platinum wire was sufficient
to compel a large part of the current to pass round the electromagnet.
   In the same year the writer designed a machine which was made by
Mr. Ladd, and described by him in a paper read before this Society (see
Transactions), the principle of which was that two separate armatures

  1875.]         of Dynamo-Magneto-Electric Machine.                     497
 being introduced, one was employed for magnetizing the machine, the
  other being used for external work. This machine gave a good electric
 light &c., and was shown in the Exhibition of Paris, 1867, when a silver
 medal was awarded for it.
    To simplify this machine, the author of this paper afterwards placed
 the two armatures in the same groove between the poles of the electro
 magnet, bolting the two together at right angles to each other, so that
 they came under the influence of the magnetism alternately; by this
 method one pair of bearings was sufficient instead of two, and the
 machine altogether was much simplified.
    The machine now about to be described is a still further modification,
 in which the greatest amount of simplicity and effective power are
combined.
     The apparatus consists essentially of an electromagnet with shoes,
 forming a groove in which a Siemens's armature is made to revolve : this
 is much the same as the original machines made by Siemens and Wheat-
 stone ; but the difference occurs in the break or commutator ; here there
 are two springs or rubbers employed in taking the current off from the
 commutator. The commutator consists of three rings : one of these rings
 is complete for three quarters of the circle, the other quarter being cut
 away ; another ring is cut away three quarters, leaving the one quarter ;
and in between these two rings is a third ring, insulated and connected
 with the insulated end of the wire wound round the armature ; on this
 centre ring are projecting pieces, one a quarter of a circle and the other
 three quarters, so arranged as to complete the two outer circles.       The
 rubber spring which comes into contact with the quarter of the middle
circle is connected with the electromagnet of the machine, and the arma
ture is so arranged that at the time of contact the best magnetizing
current is developed. The other spring rubber is in connexion with the
 wire on the armature during the other three quarters of its revolution ;
and this is connected with any external piece of apparatus required to
be worked.
    By this arrangement, the alternate currents being utilized, they are all
in the   same direction ; and by the length of contact the whole of the
current is obtained in the best condition for heating wires, decomposing
water, giving an electric light, and other usual experiments.
    At present a model machine has been constructed on this principle,
the armature of which measures 5 inches long by 2 inches diameter, on
which is wound about 50 feet of cotton-covered copper wire, no. 16,
B. W. G. The magnet has about 300 feet of covered copper wire,
no. 14, B. W. G. : the whole instrument, without the driving-gear,
weighs 26 lbs.; with this apparatus 8 inches of platinum wire, '005,
can be made red-hot, water is rapidly decomposed, &c.
    The armature is constructed specially to prevent the accumulation of heat
to which every class of dynamo-magneto-electric machine is liable. It is
                                                              2q2

498                           Mr. L. Tait    on the                [June    17,
made    in two halves,   a groove  of  a zigzag form being cast in each half,
so that when the two are screwed together a continuous        channel is main
tained through the bearings for a current of cold water to pass during
the whole time the machine is at work.
    The advantages suggested by these arrangements are their extreme
 simplicity, the few number of parts, only one armature and one wire
 being used.
    This principle of the alternate current being utilized is also applicable
to machines constructed        on the multiple armature principle; and the
economy thereby resulting would prove of great advantage, as the power
 of the machine could be varied by throwing into the electromagnets
 either every other current, or every fourth, sixth, or eighth current,
according to the strength required in the machine, the whole of the other
currents being utilized for electric light or otherwise.

     VI. Its  nutrition.                                    .
    I. The spiral form of the cord has received many explanations ; but
 hitherto none has seemed satisfactory, nor sufficient to explain all the facts.
 The cause of the spiral form has generally been regarded as existing in
 the arteries ; but experiment shows that the vein is the chief factor.
    The considerations drawn from the comparative and teratological ana
 tomy of the cord point to the conclusion that its twist must depend upon
 some mechanism at the foetal insertion.
    Such mechanism is found in a peculiar camb-like growth of the dermal
 ring of the umbilicus, and in an arrangement of capillaries upon which
 the nutrition of the cord depends, that nutrition being supplied over the
  venous surface of the cord in about the proportion of three to two on
 the arterial   surface.   This unequal nutrition would    seem necessarily   to
 result in a spiral.
     II. When the surface of the cord is treated with litmus or haema-
  toxylin, the epithelial covering is found to consist of a single layer
  of irregularly polygonal cells, regularly nucleated.    The fibrillar matrix
  on which they lie is evidently only a slightly condensed arrangement of
 the canalicular tissue.       Silver-staining shows that these cells have a
 peculiar irregularity in size and arrangement.

 1875.]                'Anatomy   of the Umbilical Cord.                   Am
    Well-marked stomata, both spuria and vera, are to be seen on the sur
face, the latter unquestionably forming orifices of entrance into the vast
 system of canals of which the proper system of the cord is composed.
    The epithelium varies somewhat      in its arrangements near the placenta
and near the    foetus.
    In the former position the cells are smaller, more irregularly jointed,
and apparently somewhat more elongated in the direction of the long axis
of the cord than they are near the foetus.
    The whole appearance of the cells gives the impression that the cover
ing is older here ; and in the canals and in the stomata are to be seen rows
of minute refracting globules, visible only under very high powers, the
nature of which     I   have been unable to make out, as they appear only
after  deep silver-staining.
    III. The alveolated canalicular tissue of the cord is divided through
out its entire length into three columns, the divisions between which are
not visible to the naked eye, but become very perceptible when one of the
columns is injected by Recklinghausen's method.
    When the canals are empty they present the appearance of fibrous
tissue by the collapse of their walls, and when partially distended they
look like stellate cells. This has led to the erroneous description of a
fibrous matrix in which occur stellate cells.      In the lacunar spaces of the
canals the oval nuclei are imbedded.
    These nuclei do not alter their shapes or positions.
    In injecting this system of canals, the fluid passes more readily in the
direction from the foetus to the placenta than in the reverse way.
    During the process minute streams of the injection may be seen flow
ing from the surface of the cord ; and these are not due to rents.
    Transverse and longitudinal sections of the injected columns show that
the canals are stellate in every plane.
    In the alveoli between the canals the wandering cells are found. Silver-
 staining shows that these canals are walled. The nuclei are not fusiform,
for when magnified 1000 diameters they are seen to be oval and provided
with a very small nucleolus. The statement that they send processes into
the branches of the canals is due to an optical illusion, dispelled by the
use of high-power immersion lenses.
    The round cells which occur in the alveoli have very large nuclei, quite
disproportionate to the surrounding protoplasm.
   They are not constant.      In some cords, especially those removed from
large children, they are found very scantily, whilst on the cord of a small
eight-months' child they were found to be extremely abundant.
   They are also often more numerous in some parts of the cord than in
others, and in one district of the cord than in another.
   They are most abundant near the umbilicus and near the capillaries.
They may be seen moving on the warm stage and exhibiting amoeboid
movements after having taken up litmus colour.

500              Oh the Anatomy       of the Umbilical Cord.         [June 17,
   I h«Te not been able to discover      any nerve-fibres in the cord.
   The canalicular tissue may be demonstrated to end in three cones,
one for each column of the cord, the apices of which are just within the
dermal ring.     The injection will not pass through the tendinous ring;
nor  have  I  succeeded in making it enter the capillaries of the cord from
the canalicular tissue.
   •When the injection of the capillary plexus running from the dermal
ring has been successfully accomplished (and this is, for many reasons, a
difficult thing to do), there will be found a peculiar vascular arrangement
in the centre of the cord, lying in the firm nucleated tissue which forms
the omphalic ring. The basis of this arrangement is a peculiar sacculated
sinus, a mere excavation in the fibrous tissue, as it is doubtful if it has
any definite wall. It seems to have a spiral arrangement, for in one
section it appears and disappears as only a screw could.
   It extends from the omphalic ring at least forty-five millims. up into
the true substance of the cord, giving off at short intervals thick trunks
which rapidly break up into capillaries.
    These capillaries do not form loops, but enter directly into the canali
 cular tissue ; and it is possible to inject a large extent of all three dis
tricts of the substance of the cord by passing the injection through the
foetus. This sinus seems to originate from the small arteries of the
anterior abdominal wall, which enter with the vein.
    There seems to be a close analogy between this arrangement and that
of the Haversian system in       bones ; indeed the actual resemblance some
times seen is very close.
   IV. The proper tissue of the vessels is made up of the ordinary fusi
form fibre-cells, with their characteristic rod-shaped oval nuclei.        The
 outer layers seem to have wider limits of contraction than the inner —
 these latter   being thrown into rugose folds on the contraction of the
arteries, resembling the appearance of the contracted urethra or oeso
 phagus.     One reason of this exceptional range of contraction is, that
the fibres of the muscular tissue are arranged in bundles having a
 double spiral direction. The contraction of the fibres seems to be governed
 by the blood-current, as they contract as soon as the blood in them
 becomes arterial by the establishment of respiration ; and they may be
 seen again to relax and pulsate if the blood becomes again venous by the
 temporary arrest of respiration.
    This appears to be aided by the absence of an endothelial lining to the
 arteries, which my observations seem to establish.
    The closure of the   vessels   is effected immediately by clot, and subse
 quently by the agency of the round migratory cells.
    These wandering cells seem also to share in the subsequent processes
 of inflammatory ulceration and necrosis of the stump of the cord, and in
 the removal of the coats of the remaining vessels.
    V. Tho relation of the cord to the foetus has already been described.

    875.]       On the Natural History of Kerguelen's Island.             501
The limitation of the canalicular tissue of the cord, at its placental attach
ment, is quite as abrupt.
   The injection-fluid cannot be made to pass from the substance of the
cord into the placenta, for it is arrested by a firm membrane derived from
the chorion, which the vessels of the cord penetrate, and between two
layers of which they lie. There is absolutely no connexion between the
nutritive system of the cord and that of the placenta.
   VI. The chief factor in the nutrition of the cord is the arrangement of
capillaries entering it from the foetus.    From the facts observed by me
in cases of extra-uterine gestation, it is likely, however, that the stomata
of the epithelial surfaces of the cord play an important part in its
nutrition.
   The liquor amnii contains substances which are very suggestive that
the fluid is used for purposes of nutrition, and perhaps for the nutrition
of the cord. In recent cases of extra-uterine fetation, before the liquor
amnii becomes absorbed, the cord remains fresh and plump.          After the
fluid has been absorbed the cord becomes shrivelled ; but it still retains its
structural characters, minus the wandering cells. It may be, therefore,
that the canalicular nuclei are able to keep the cord in repair, as it were,
by the matters absorbed from the liquor amnii, until that fluid disappears —
very much as ivy continues to live after its connexion with its root has
been severed.         Indeed the analogy between the umbilical cord and vege
table tissue    is,   as
                      I   hope to be able to show further, avery close one.

                                    accompanying the Transit-of-

       President. Received May 10, 1875.
     In January
              1875, shortly after the departure of the American Expe
dition from Royal Sound, an opportunity occurred of visiting another part
of Kerguelen's Island. To relieve the ennui of his officers and men,
who by that time were thoroughly tired of being detained without any
definite occupation in an uninhabited island, Captain Fairfax ordered the
 Volage to leave Observatory Bay, and proceeded to Swain's Bay,
'           '
where he remained three weeks.      During this period he entertained me
as his guest, took me to the best localities in the bay for collecting, and
rendered me every assistance that lay in his power.     The Royal Society
is therefore indebted to Captain Fairfax for      fine series of Algao from
                                                   a

and some that were not known to be indigenous to the island.           Most
of these are described in the Flora Antarctica as Falkland-Islands

skeleton of    Globiocephahis,

Mr. Forrest (Mids.). Most of the epidermis had been removed          bysmall

Crustacea, so that  it was not possible to ascertain the colour of the animal ;
but Lieut. Goodridge, R.N., very kindly photographed the carcass before
it was flensed, and its dimensions were carefully taken by one of the boat's
crew, and therefore it will be easily identified.
    Young Sea-Elephants were frequently found by us in Swain's Bsv.
Some examples are uniformly reddish brown, others are pale, blotched
and spotted with darker grey.        They usually lie just above the beach,
separately, in hollows among the Aecena and Azordla, where they are
sheltered from the wind.       On being approached they make no attempt
to move away (possibly because there are no land animals indigenous to
the country capable of molesting them to cause them to acquire a habit
of flight), but raise up the fore part of their body, open the mouth wide,
and utter a peculiar slobbering cry.       My mammalian specimens, unfor
tunately, are not so complete as they were when first procured, owing
                                                       "

                                      "
interest in such " great curiosities    whilst the process of cleaning them
was in progress.      The removal of stones, purposely laid upon some of
the bones, led to the loss of the fore limbs of seals, &c., which were blown
away by the wind.
    All of the birds, with the exception of two species (a ProetUaria and a
 Thalassidroma), are represented in the Cape-Town Museum.
    Thalassidroma Wilsoni (Dr. Wyville Thomson, however, seems to
 consider the Kerguelen-Island bird to be another species) arrived in the
 Sound in great numbers a few days before the " Transit."         Towards the
 end of January they commenced laying their eggs generally.              By the
 second and third weeks of February the incubation of the eggs was
 usually far advanced ; and a day or two before we left the island, Capt.
 Fairfax sent me a young bird recently hatched. The tarso-metatarsal
 joint is not elongated in the chick.    I failed to find the eggs of Thalassi
 droma melanogaster    "
                         the birds occurred to me only in pairs.
     It may be well to explain that Petrels sit in their holes in pairs until
 the egg is laid.   Then usually only one bird is found at a time upon the
 nest until the young are hatched ; and soon after they have issued from
 the egg the young are found alone during the day.          For whilst incuba
 tion is in progress, the bird not upon the nest is either asleep in a siding
 or branch of the burrow or (more commonly) is spending the day at sea ;
 and when the young are a day or two old, both of the parents absent them
  selves during the day, and only return at night for the purpose of feeding
 them.
     Along the coast, outside Swain's Bay, a few examples of Diomedea
 melanophrys, a species not observed in Royal Sound, were noticed.
     In the less frequented parts of the island some of the birds were
 unusually fearless and tame.      Shags would submit to be stroked along
 the back without getting off their nests or attempting to
                                                                       peck the

of my       hand.      A Sheathbill, after pecking at my boots, ate in succes
sion six eggs         held  out to it.      But the Skua behaved in a still more
extraordinary manner.             On approaching within three hundred yards
of the nest it was evident, from the excitement of the old birds, that the
young were hatched ; and on searching for the nestlings, the old birds
commenced          their usual onslaught when within two hundred yards of the
nest.       Disregarding their outcries and fierce swooping down,               I soon
found the young           ones  crouching      amongst    the herbage some distance
apart from       one another and the nest (which          they leave at an early age),
 and sat     beside the nearest.       The hen Skua immediately alighted within a
 yard of me and continued her vociferations, whilst the cock withdrew to
 the other nestling.            On stroking her chick the hen became more
 excited than ever and advanced a little nearer. Taking a Prion's egg
 from my pocket and holding it out, her cries ceased whilst she eyed
 the egg, but recommenced when she again looked at me.                        She once
 more looked at the egg, became silent, waddled cautiously up and pecked
 gently at my finger, then, reassured, pecked the            egg, which she very soon
 made an end of.          In the same way she ate a young Prion killed for the
 purpose,      and   afterwards  flew to the hole from whence the bird had been
  taken to see if it contained another ; and upon my digging at some
  other holes, she came near and stood by in eager expectancy of further
  gratuities. With regard to her pecking first at the finger before the
  egg,    I would observe that wild birds usually do this previous to feeding
  out of the hand.           The Sheathbills did the same, and so do English
  birds which have never been in confinement.                It seems to be their way
  of testing the nature of any strange-looking object.
       The Sheathbill was plentiful in Swain's Bay, and a fair number of their
  eggs were procured.          As Dr. Kidder, the American Naturalist, had not
  succeeded     in   finding any,    I was anxious that he should have some ; but
   did not consider myself at liberty to give him more than one, and that
   a damaged specimen almost in halves.               The Royal Society will now be
   able to be more liberal.                                    ,

       The Ayrostis mentioned when           I  last wrote came into flower about the
   third   week   in  January.    It   can  scarcely be said to form a sward, or pas
   turage even, in the neighbourhoods visited by me.                 The Limosella was

     regarded as a form of C. pedunctdata rather than of C. verna. It has
     no bracts, and seems to exhibit other peculiarities of C. pedunculata.

Cape.
   All the larger Algae collected were spoilt.  One suite of dried ex
amples was lost, through the box in which they were contained being
placed open, in the rain, by one of the servants a few days before we
sailed, without my knowing it had been moved from its place. The
second set, gathered the day before we left the island, was sent on board
the ' Supply,' with directions that the box should be placed in an accessible
position : unfortunately the message miscarried, the box was stowed away
                     I
in the hold, and could not get at it until a fortnight afterwards, when
almost the whole of its contents were completely decomposed.
   Again, series of examples of some of the flowering plants were lost
through the difficulty of attending to them when collected.

netic force was produced by means of an electric current in a helix, as
the magnetism of iron magnets is an undetermined function of the shape
and nature of the iron core.
   The strength of the helix was determined by comparing the magnetic
force at a series of seven equidistant points along its axis in terms of
that at the centre of the great dynamometer of the British Association,
whose power is known in absolute measure.
   The intensities were compared by varying currents sent opposite ways
through each, till the action on a small magnet at their common centre
was nil.

the difference of magnetic potential at the two ends for that current was
obtained by integrating with respect to_ the length between limits corre

difference to the current, or the difference of magnetic potential which
would be due to a unit current) is known, and is a number, because current

determined by placing       it under the dynamometer.
   To determine the rotation of the plane of polarization, a Mcol's prism,
set in a circle, was used, and the light was polarized by means of a prism
invented by Professor Jellett, and described by him in vol. xxv. of the
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.
   It was constructed of Iceland spar, and its field of vision consisted of
a circle divided by a line, the light of one half of which was polarized in a
certain plane, and the light of the other half in a plane inclined at about
2° to that of the first.     The intermediate position of the Nicol, when
the whole field was equally dark, could be determined with some
accuracy.
   The water was contained in a tube with glass ends, of the same lengt h
as the helix, and placed with it. The polarized ray was sent through             it,

direction and then in the other, and the plane of polarization observed.
Half the difference of the readings was the rotation produced by the
current.

   The motion of a roller or wheel on a surface is always attended with
resistance.    Coulomb made some experiments with wooden rollers on a
wooden plane, from which he deduced two laws, viz. that the resistance
is proportional to the weight of the roller, and inversely proportional to
its diameter.     These laws have since been found to apply to other sub
stances, a different     coefficient being used in each case.      Beyond this,
however, nothing appears hitherto to have been ascertained as regards
the nature of this resistance to rolling. The source from which it springs
does not appear to have been made the subject of investigation.
   Some time ago it occurred to the author that it was probable that the
deformation of the surface of the roller and of the plane, which must
take place at the point of contact, would affect the distance which the
roller would advance in turning through a certain angle*. The pressure
of the roller on the plane        causes a certain   temporary indentation  and

lateral extension in the latter, so that in passing from one point to
another the roller does in truth pass over a greater extent of surface than
the distance between these points.       A  simple experiment was sufficient
to verify the truth of this conclusion.   An iron roller   18 inches in circum
ference was found to roll through something like        | inch less than a yard
 in two complete revolutions when rolling on a plate of india-rubber. The
 softness of the india-rubber suffered the roller to indent it considerably ;
 and hence it might       be expected that   the effect would    be much more
 apparent than when the roller was rolling on iron or any hard material.
 At the same time there is doubtless a certain amount of indentation in this
 latter case ; and this will probably cause a similar alteration in the distance
 rolled through, although too small to allow its being measured.
     This falling off from what may be called the geometrical distance, sug
 gested an explanation of the resistance to rolling, namely, that the exten
 sion of the surface or surfaces at the point of contact causes the one
 surface to slide over the other ; and this sliding is accomplished against
 friction.    In this way we should expect to find the resistance to rolling
 greatest under those circumstances in which the sliding is greatest, i. e.
 where the indentation is greatest ; and so far it is in accordance with
  Coulomb's laws.       In the case of india-rubber, we find the slipping
 is very large ; and hence we should expect the resistance to rolling to
 be large also ; and accordingly       we find it so, for it is more than
 ten times as great as when the roller is on an iron plane.           This very
  great resistance which india-rubber causes to rolling appears not to have
 previously caught attention ; and yet it is the natural explanation of the
 invariable failure which has attended the numerous endeavours which
  have been made to use this material for the tires of wheels.
     This idea, that the resistance to rolling is due to the friction between
  the surfaces sliding at the point of contact, naturally leads to the conclu
  sion that it must depend on the coefficient of friction between these sur
  faces, and that we might expect to diminish the resistance by using oil
  or any other means of reducing the coefficient of friction. This was the
  author's first impression.    Experiments, however, showed that the effect
  of oiling the surface, although it did generally reduce the resistance, was
  very small ; and sometimes it appeared to act in the reverse manner, and
  increase the resistance. This conclusion or surmise was therefore wrong ;
  and the cause of the error was not far to seek.       It consisted in having
  overlooked the fact that friction not only opposes the sliding of the one
  surface over the other, but also prevents    it to a considerable extent, and
  thus modifies the deformation which would otherwise take place ; so that
  any diminution in the coefficient of friction is attended with an increase
  in the extent of slipping, which tends to balance the advantage gained
  by the reduced coefficient.
     The truth of this view derives independent support from a circum
  stance remotely connected with rolling-friction, of which it furnishes an

explanation.     When the roller rests on a horiiontal surface and is very
slight lv disturbed, it does not move off, but oscillates backwards and for
wards.     This happens on all kinds of elastic surfaces ; on soft india-
rubber the oscillations are both large and continue for some time.    Now
if the deformation in the surface of the rubber were complete, there would
be no tendency to bring the roller back ; but since, owing to friction, the
india-rubber, under the advancing side of the roller, is prevented from
extending while that under the other side is prevented from contracting,
there will exist a state of constraint from which the surface is endea
vouring to free itself by forcing the roller back.
   Besid.?s the relative softness of the materials, the curvature of the
roller will affect the lateral extension both of the roller and the plane at
the point of contact, so that if the roller and the plane were of the same
material there would still be slipping. This would not be the case, how
ever, between two wheels of the same diameter and material rolling in
contact.
  Such is a short sketch of the subject of the paper, a considerable part
of which is devoted to the examination and illustration of the exact
manner in which the deformation at the point of contact occurs, and the
influence of friction upon it. The latter part of the paper contains an
account of numerous experiments, and their results, which were under
taken as part of this investigation.
  The first series of experiments relate to the resistance which an iron
roller experiences on surfaces of different hardness. Cast iron, glass, brass,
boxwood, and india-rubber were tried. Extreme care was taken to make the
roller and the surfaces true     ;   and this was so far successful that on cast iron
the roller would roll in either direction when the surface had an inclination
of one in five thousand, or, roughly,           a foot   in   a mile.     Comparing     the
different   surfaces, we   see   that the resistance increases with the softness,
although apparently not in the simple proportion ; on boxwood the resist
ance is nearly double as great as on the harder surfaces, and on india-
rubber from six to ten times as great.
   The second series of experiments were to ascertain the actual extent of
slipping on india-rubber, both with a cast-iron roller and also with an
india-rubber tire glued on to the roller, and rolled on hard surfaces and
on plates of india-rubber of different thicknesses.
   These experiments bear out the arguments expressed in the first part
of the paper : in fact the arguments were based on the experiments.
There is no intention to imply that the whole of the resistance to rolling
is in all cases due to the causes already mentioned.  Under ordinary cir
cumstances the irregularities of the surfaces and the crushing of the
material beneath the roller are the chief causes.             And,      besides these, two
other causes are discussed in the paper as having been brought to light
by the experiment, viz. the communication of heat between the compressed
material and that which surrounds             it,
                                        which prevents the material im

mediately expanding to the           same volume as   it previously occupied, and
the viscosity of       the material, which also renders   it slow to expand. Both
these causes are, however, rather connected with the effect of the speed
of the roller on the resistance than with the residual resistance, which, so
 far   as the surfaces are perfectly true and perfectly hard, appears to be
 due to the friction which accompanies the deformation, and is hence
 called rolling-friction.
      No attempt has yet been made to investigate the laws of rolling-fric
 tion, although the author hopes to continue the investigation in this direc
  tion as soon as he has obtained the necessary apparatus.
      At the end of the paper attention is called to certain phenomena con
  nected with railway-wheels, which it is thought now, for the first time,
  receive an explanation.          Thus the surprising superiority of steel rails
  over iron in point of durability is explained as being due as much to the
  fact that their hardness prevents the wearing-action, t. e. the slipping,
  as that it enables them better to withstand the wear. Also the slipping
  beneath the wheel explains the wear of the rails in places where brakes
  are not applied ; and the severe lateral extension beneath the wheel is
  thought to explain the scaling of wrought-iron rails.

   lished    in  the Proceedings   of the London    Mathematical Society (May 14,
   1874, p. 70),     I have shown that it is not in general possible to draw a
    quadric surface V so as to touch a given surface U in more than two
    points, but that a condition must be fulfilled for every additional
    point.      The equations expressing these conditions, being interpreted in
    one way, show that two points being taken arbitrarily, the third point
    of contact, if such there be, must lie on a curve, the equation whereof is
    there given.      The same formulae, interpreted in another way, serve to
    determine the conditions which the coefficients of the surface V must
    fulfil in order that the contact may be possible for three or more points
    taken arbitrarily upon it ; and, in particular, the degrees of these con
    ditions give the number of surfaces of different kinds which satisfy the
    problem.
        In another paper, " Sur les Surfaces Osculatrices " (Comptes Eendus,

     a quadric with a given surface are discussed.

     way ; and having shown how the formulae for higher degrees of contact

ence of points of four-, five-, six-pointic single    e. not multiple) contact  (t.

other surfaces.     The concluding part of the paper   concerned with the             is

       &c.    Received   June   1 1 , 1 8 75 .
    The instrument with which these observations were made is described
in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxii., and a con
 tinuous series of its records exist from 1845 to 1870.             With the
 limited resources of this Observatory it was not in my power to reduce
 them ; but it seemed to some distinguished members of the Royal Society
 desirable to ascertain whether such observations are competent to develop
 any laws amid the seeming lawlessness of the winds, and they obtained
 for me a grant from the Government Fund to discuss the anemograms
 of these seven years. Unfortunately the work has been long delayed by
 various accidents.
    Of the causes  of wind    some    are undoubtedly periodical ; and though
 they are masked by others of greater magnitude, which, in the present
 state of our knowledge, seem quite lawless, yet these will disappear from
 the mean of a sufficient number of observations and leave as residual the
first.   Of the periodical   causes    the unequal distribution of heat is the
most important ;    and this, depending on the place of the sun, is evidently
 a function of the time.
    The immediate data of the anemograms, the velocity and direction of
the wind, though not the most convenient for combining in great num
 bers, yet are those which interest most directly the general inquirer ; and
 I have presented them in a Table, which shows for each month of the
seven years the mean velocity of the wind in each octant, the number
of hours during which it has blown, the maximum in each month, the
number of hours above 25 miles, and the number during which the record
 = 0. The most striking fact shown by this Table is its extreme irregu
larity, not merely from octant to octant or month to month, but from
year to year.     Both velocity aud hours are a maximum in the octant
S.SW., a minimum in N.NE., their products being as 6:1. As to
monthly variations, the amount of wind is a maximum in January, de
creasing to July in the ratio of 2\ : 1, and thence increasing to the end
of the year, with an exception in the case of March, which is greater
than February as 1*13 : 1. This, however, does not establish the common
idea of equinoctial gales ; for the hours above 25 miles are fewer in March
than in February, and there is no excess in September above October.
There is also no clear indication of any influence of the solar spots ; but
for detecting this several decennial periods will be necessary.    The annual
variations  .are equally notable.      The maximum velocity ranges from 71
in 1861 to 19 in 18(30.      If the mean velocity for each month be taken
without reference to direction, it is 13-ol for January, 4-24 for June,
and that for the whole year is 9-73. A mode of discussion which seems
more tikely to give definite laws is to resolve each velocity into a southern

 years, and from the changes of these functions in successive periods to
  dr.-»e  ~<n*e general la -^s.     At first sight this might seem impracticable,
  from the excessive discordance of the values for the same in different
 y*»rs.    Thns in the first term of the set, January ld 0\ the extreme
  di?-rvace in the seven rears is, for W 20-S9, for S 25-35.                Evidently
  single hours were out of the question, and even the mean for the seven
  rears, as was evident from examining their probable errors.             However, I
  meaa-d each hour for the seven years, then combined these in periods of ten
  days, bat ultimately took their mean for the entire month. These monthly
  m-?ans are given in Table       II L, from which it appears, first, that all the
  ultimate values of W and S are positive.              This arises from the pre
 ponderance     of positive  over   negative  values ; but  the latter occur so fre
 quently that they evidently belong to the wind system ; and           I  was at first
  dispo«ed  to   mean   and   develop    them  separately.    I tried it for January
 and June, but saw that in the present state of our knowledge it would
 be useless.      In January the negative values are 0-27 of the whole, in
  June 0*374 ; and they are found in the septennial means of almost every
 hoar, bat so irregularly distributed that it would be almost impossible to
  develop them in terms of the time. Even were this done, we could
  not combine in any particular instance the negative and positive results
  unless we knew the causes which occasionally mix the polar and equa
  torial currents.    I  therefore took the entire means as alone available.
  Secondly, that, as    I  anticipated, notwithstanding the discordance of the
  individual   observations,   the means of from 196 to 217 present a notable
  agreement, and the differences which they exhibit are subject to law.             If
  we examine the vertical columns (which give the hours of each month),
  we find in each a principal maximum and minimiim and one or more
 lesser ones. The epochs of these vary with the season.             For W in winter
 the chief maxim nm is from noon to 3 p.m., in summer from 9 a.m. to
 noon   ; for S it varies less, being a little before noon.           The principal
 minimum occurs from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., both for W and S.
     The extreme diurnal ranges are greatest in March, 2-14 and                2-40 ;
 least in November, 0-74 and 0*79.
     Examining the horizontal columns, which give the monthly variation, the
 existence of law is still more evident.          W has a maximum in January,
 a minimum in February ; its greatest maximum in March, its least mini
 mum in April ; a smaller maximum in August, and a smaller minimum in
 November.       The variations are greater hero than in the horary columns.
     The law for S is simpler : it has one maximum in December and one
 minimum in July ; its range, too, is something greater.
    The mean TV for the whole seven years = 2-4805 miles, the mean S=
3-8398 miles, which give the mean V=4-5713, mean D=32°54' 44", and
the actual translation of air 39648 miles.

 The result rather surprised      me ; 2418 observations give for the current
 O0906, which, allowing for the omissions above mentioned and for
 friction at the earth's surface, must be very near the truth. Among the
 observations are two above 40 and three above 30 ; and it seemed worth
  trying what would be the effect of omitting these and all above four
 times the probable error of one. In this case for W-W it was all above
 15. The result is that 2360 observations give 0-0559, showing how little
 even considerable     discordances affect a mean under such circumstances,
 and also perhaps that even such discordances should not be rejected.
 IX. "   Preliminary Notice of further Researches on the Physical
       Properties of Matter in the Liquid and Gaseous States under
       varied conditions of Pressure and Temperature."                By Dr.
       Andrews, F.R.S., Vice-President of Queen's College, Belfast.
       Received     June   17, 1875.
    The investigation to which this note refers has occupied me, with little
intermission, since my former communication in 1869 to the Society, " On
the Continuity of the Liquid and Gaseous States of Matter."        It was un
dertaken chiefly to ascertain the modifications which the three great laws
discovered respectively by Boyle, Gay-Lussac, and Dalton undergo when
matter in the gaseous state is placed under physical conditions differing
greatly from any hitherto within the reach of observation.       It embraces
a large number      of experiments of precision, performed at different tem
peratures and at pressures ranging from twelve to nearly three hundred
atmospheres.        The apparatus employed is, in all its essential parts,
similar to that described in the paper referred to ; and so perfectly did
it act that the readings of the cathetometer, at the highest pressures
and temperatures employed, were made with the same ease and accuracy
as if the object of the experiment had been merely to determine the
tension of aqueous vapour in a barometer-tube.         In using it the chief
improvement       I  have made is in the method of ascertaining the original
volumes of the gases before compression, which can now be known
with much less labour and greater accuracy than by the method               I
formerly described.         The lower ends of the glass tubes containing
the gases dip into small mercurial reservoirs formed of thin glass
tubes, which rest on ledges within the apparatus.         This arrangement
has prevented many failures in screwing up the apparatus, and has given
more precision      to the measurements.     A great improvement     has also
been made      in the method of preparing the leather-washers used in the
packing for the fine screws, by means of which the pressure is obtained.
It consists in saturating the leather with grease by heating it in vacuo

  under melted lard.      In this way the air enclosed within the pores of the
  leather is removed without the use of water, and a packing is obtained
  so perfect that it appears, as far as my experience goes, never to fail,
  provided it is used in a vessel filled with water. It is remarkable, how
  ever, that the same packing, when an apparatus specially constructed for
  the purpose of forged iron was filled with mercury, always yielded, even
  at a pressure of 40 atmospheres, in the course of a few days.
     It is  with regret that I am still obliged to give the pressures in atmo
  spheres as indicated by an air- or hydrogen-manometer,      without attempt
  ing for the present to apply the corrections required to reduce them to
  true pressures. The only satisfactory method of obtaining these correc
  tions would be to compare the indications of the manometer with those
  of a column of mercury of the requisite length ; and this method, as is
  known, was employed by Arago and Dulong, and afterwards in his
  classical researches by Begnault, for pressures reaching nearly to 30
  atmospheres.      For this moderate pressure a column of mercury about
 23 metres, or 75 feet, in length had to be employed. For pressures
 corresponding to 500 atmospheres, at which       I have no difficulty in work
 ing with my apparatus, a mercurial column of the enormous height of
 380 metres, or 1250 feet, would be required.        Although the mechanical
 difficulties in the construction of a long tube for this purpose are perhaps
 not insuperable, it could only be mounted in front of some rare moun
 tain escarpment, where it would be practically impossible to conduct a
 long series of delicate experiments.        About three years ago    I  had the
 honour of submitting to the Council of the Society a proposal for con
 structing an apparatus which would have enabled any pressure to be
 measured by the successive additions of the pressure of a column of
 mercury of a fixed length ; and working drawings of the apparatus were
 prepared by     Mr.  J. Cumine, whose services   I am  glad to have again this
 opportunity of acknowledging.        An unexpected difficulty, however, arose
 in consequence of the packing       of the screws (as  I have already stated)
 not holding when the leather was in contact with mercury instead of
 water, and the apparatus was not constructed.             For two years the
 problem appeared, if not theoretically, to be practically impossible of
 solution ; but   I  am glad now to be able to announce to the Society that
another method, simpler in principle and free from the objections to
which     I  have referred, has lately suggested itself to me, by means of
which it will,    I fully expect, be possible to determine the rate of com
pressibility of hydrogen or other gas by direct reference to the weight of a
liquid column, or rather of a number of liquid columns, up to pressures
of 500 or even 1000 atmospheres. For the present it must be under
stood that, in stating the following results, the pressures in atmospheres
are deduced from the apparent compressibility, in some cases of air, in
others of hydrogen gas, contained in capillary glass tubes.

 gularly well adapted for experiment ; and the properties it exhibits will

      I  have been    gratified to find that the two results (for 13°-09 and
  21°-46)   recorded   in my former paper are in close agreement with these
  later experiments.       On the other hand, the pressures       I have found are
  lower than those given by Regnault as the result of his elaborate investi
  gation (Mémoires de l'Academie des Sciences, vol. xxvi. p. 618).               The
  method employed by        that distinguished physicist was not, however, fitted
  to give accurately the pressures at which carbonic acid gas liquefies. It
 gave, indeed, the pressures exercised by the liquid when contained in large
 quantity in a Thilorier's reservoir ; but these pressures are always con
 siderably in excess of the true pressures in consequence of the unavoid
 able presence of a small quantity of compressed air, although the greatest
 precautions may have been taken in filling the apparatus.           Even -j-i^j part
 of air will exercise a serious disturbing influence when the reservoir
 contains    a notable quantity of liquid.
     Law of Boyle. — The large deviations in the case of carbonic acid at
 high pressures from this law appeared distinctly from several of the
 results given in my former paper.           I have now finished a long series of
experiments      on its    compressibility    at the respective temperatures       of
 6°-7,   63 -7, and 100°     Centigrade.     The two latter temperatures were
obtained by passing the vapours of pyroxylic spirit (methyl alcohol)
and of water into the rectangular case with plate-glass sides in which
the rube containing the carbonic acid is placed. The temperature of the
vapour of the pyroxylic spirit was observed by an accurate thermo
meter, whose indications were corrected for the unequal expansion of the
mercury ; while that of the vapour of water was deduced from tho
pressure as given by the height of the barometer and a water-gauge
attached to the apparatus.            At the lower temperature (6°-7) the range
of pressure which could be applied was limited by the occurrence of

 1875.]            Matter in the Liquid and Gaseous States.                    517
liquefaction ; but at the higher temperatures, which were considerably
above the critical point of carbonic acid, there was no limit of this kind,
and the pressures were carried as far as 223 atmospheres.            I  have only
given a few of the results ; but they will be sufficient to show the general
effects of the pressure.      In the following Tables p designates the pressure

     These results fully confirm the conclusions which       I formerly deduced
 from the behaviour of carbonic         acid at 48°, viz. that while the curve
 representing its volume under different pressures approximates more
 nearly to that of a perfect gas as the temperature is higher, the con
 traction is nevertheless greater than it would be if the law of Boyle
 held good, at least for any temperature at which experiments have yet
 been made.        From the foregoing experiments it appears that at 633-7
 carbonic acid gas, under a pressure of 223 atmospheres, is reduced to
 •j-J-y of its volume under one atmosphere, or to less than one half the
 volume it ought to occupy if it were a perfect gas and contracted in
 conformity with Boyle's law. Even at 100° the contraction under the
 same pressure amounts to ^J-p part of the whole.            From these obser
 vations we may infer by analogy that the critical points of the greater
 number of the gases not hitherto liquefied are probably far below the
 lowest temperatures hitherto attained, and that they are not likely to be
 seen, either as liquids or solids, till much lower temperatures even than
 those produced by liquid nitrous oxide are reached.
     Law of Gay-Lussac. — That the law of Gay-Lussac in the case of the
 so-called permanent gases, or in general terms of gases greatly above
 their critical points, holds good at least at ordinary pressures, within
 the limits of experimental error, is highly probable from the experiments
 of Regnault ; but the results       I  have obtained with carbonic acid will
 show that this law, like that of Boyle, is true only in certain limiting
  conditions of gaseous matter, and that it wholly fails in others.     It will be
 shown    that  not  only does the coefficient of expansion change rapidly with
 the pressure, but that, the pressure or volume remaining constant, the coeffi
 cient changes    with the temperature.    The latter result was first obtained
 from a set of preliminary experiments, in which the expansion of carbonic
 acid under a pressure of 17 atmospheres was observed at 4°, 20°, and 54°;
 and it has since been fully confirmed by a large number of experiments
 made at different pressures and well-defined temperatures.          These expe
 riments were conducted by the two methods commonly known as the
method of constant pressure and the method of constant volume.                The
two methods, except in the limiting conditions, do not give the same
values for the coefficient of expansion ; but they agree in this respect, that
at high pressures the value of that coefficient changes with the tempera
ture.     While    I  have confined this statement to the actual results of
experiment,     I have no doubt that future observations will discover, in the
case, at least, of such gases as carbonic acid, a similar but smaller change
in the value of the coefficient for heat at low pressures.        The numerous
experiments      I  have made on this subject will shortly be communicated
iu detail to the Society ; and for the present    I will only give the following
results :  —

   Taking    as   unit   1   vol. of carbonic acid at 6°-05 and 22-26 atmospheres,
we obtain from series A the following values for the coefficient of heat
for different ranges of temperature : —
                         a=0-005499 from 6°-05 to 63°-79.
                         a=0-005081 from 63°-79 to 100°-1.
   From series B, with the corresponding unit volume at 6°-62 and 31-06
atmospheres, we find           : —
                         a=0-006826 from 6°-62 to 63°-83.
                         a=0-005876 from 63°-83 to 100°-64.
   And in like manner from series C with the unit volume at                           6°-01 and
40-06 atmospheres          : —
                         a=0-009481 from 6a01 to 63°-64.

                                          a=0-003629.
   From these experiments it appears that the coefficient of expansion
increases rapidly with the pressure.                     Between the temperatures of 6°
and 64° it is once and a half as great under 22 atmospheres, and more
than two and a half times as great under 40 atmospheres, as at tho
pressure of 1 atmosphere.              Still more important is the change in the value
of the coefficient at different parts of the thermometric scale, the pressure
remaining the same.              An inspection of the figures will also show that this
change of value at different temperatures increases with the pressure.

     Another interesting question, and one of great importance in reference
  to the laws of molecular action, is the relation between the elastic forces of
  a gas at different temperatures while the volume remains constant. The
  experiments which      I  have made in this part of the inquiry are onlr pre
  liminary,   and   were   performed not with pure carbonic acid, but with a
  mixture of about 11 volumes of carbonic acid and 1 volume of air. It
  will be convenient, for the sake of comparison, to calculate, as is usually
  done, the values of a from these experiments ; but it must be remembered
  that « here represents no longer a coefficient of volume, but a coefficient
  of elastic force.

     It is clear that the changes in the values of a, calculated from the
 elastic forces under a constant volume, are in the same direction as
 those already deduced from the expansion of the gas under a constant
 pressure.     The value of a increases with the pressure, and it is greater
 at lower than at higher temperatures.          But a remarkable relation exists
 between    the coefficients  in the  present  case which does not exist between
the coefficients obtained from the expansion of the gas. The values of
deduced for the same range of temperature from the elastic                forces at

temperature and pressure will appear when experiments now in progress

   Law of Daltcm. — This law, as originally enunciated by its author,                 is,
that the particles of one gas possess no repulsive or attractive power with
regard to the particles of another. " Oxygen gas," he states, " azotic
gas, hydrogenous       gas, carbonic   acid gas, aqueous vapour, and probably
several other elastic fluids may exist in company under any pressure and
at any temperature without any regard to their specific gravities, and
without any pressure upon one another." The experiments which have           I
made on mixtures of carbonic acid and nitrogen have occupied            larger
                                                                             a
portion of time than all   I have yet referred to. They have been carried
to the great pressure of 283-9 atmospheres, as measured in glass tubes
by  a   hydrogen manometer, at which pressure        mixture of
                                                     a                volumes
                                                                         3

                       4                                                 of its
volume without liquefaction of the carbonic acid. As this note has
 already extended to an unusual length,      Iwill not now attempt to give
 an analysis of these experiments, but shall briefly state their general
results.     The most important of these results          the lowering
                                                          is                the  of
 critical point    admixture with a non-condensable
                  by                                     gas.    Thus in the
 mixture mentioned above of carbonic acid and nitrogen, no liquid was
 formed at any pressure till the temperature was reduced below —20° C.
 Even the addition of only        of its volume of air or nitrogen to car
 bonic acid gas will lower the critical point several degrees. Finally,
 these experiments leave no doubt that the law of Dalton entirely fails
 under high pressures, where one of the gases         at
                                                     is      temperature not
                                                               a
 greatly above its critical point. The anomalies observed in the tension
 of the vapour of water when alone and when mixed with air find their
 real explanation in the fact that the law of Dalton      is
                                                          only approximately
 true in the case of mixtures of air and aqueous vapour at the ordinary
 pressure and temperature of the atmosphere, and do not depend, as has
 been alleged, on any disturbing influence produced by   hygroscopic
                                                                   a
 action of the sides of the containing vessel. The law of Dalton, in
 short, like the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac, only holds good in the
 case of gaseous bodies which are at feeble pressures and at temperatures
 greatly above their critical points. Under other conditions these laws
 are interferedwith and in certain conditions (such as
                       ;                                           some    of those
 described in this note) the interfering causes become             so   powerful as
 practically to efface them.

 X. "On         the Power of the Eye           and   the  Microscope    to  see
        Parallel Lines."       By    J. A. Broun, F.R.S.       Received   June
        16, 1875.
     Since Nobert's test-lines have been employed for the purpose of deter
 mining the comparative powers of microscopes, several curious specula
 tions have been made and conclusions arrived at by different well-known
 microscopists as to the ultimate capability of that instrument and
 even as     to the ultimate      atoms   of matter.    The lines in Nobert's
 test-bands were believed to approach to each other in a regularly dimi
 nishing series of distances, such that when the intervals left by the
 graving-point were about         80 p00  of an English inch wide, no micro
 scope,  however high the theoretical power, could show the separation of
 the lines.
     The  Jury of   the Great Exhibition of 1851,  in the Report (p. 268),  said
that to see the lines in the first and second bands of a Nobert's test-plate
 of 10 bands a power of 100 was sufficient, whereas to distinguish those
 of the tenth band a magnifying-power of 2000 was required.                 Dr.
 Lardner (in his Museum of Science and Art) considered this assertion
 erroneous, and stated that if a power of 100 could show the lines when
 there were 11,000 to the inch (as in the first band), a power of 450
 should show the lines when there were 50,000 to the inch (as in the
tenth band).        As there can be no doubt of the accuracy of the Jury's
 statement, there has been considerable difficulty in ascertaining the cause
 of the great difference betwixt fact and theory ; and the most absurd hy
 potheses have been suggested for this end. This and the speculations of
 different   microscopists induced me several years ago to begin the exami
nation of this question.
     The first thing requiring to be clearly understood was, what the micro
 scopes were employed to examine, what Nobert's test-bands really were.
 Some microscopists stated the number of lines to the inch when they
could not be seen to be about 80,000 ; whereas Dr. Carpenter (in his
work on the Microscope and its Revelations) said " it was a matter of
faith whether lines existed at a narrower interval than s 4 l00 of an
inch."     In  this case if the lines were as wide as the intervals, the num
ber to the    inch   would be 42,000. It was then essential to know what
were the widths of the lines and intervals in the different bands, whether
as the intervals would appear equally light, the lines were equally dark ;
and, finally, with reference to the bands in which the lines were so close
that they could not be seen, whether there really were lines at all, or lines
which really ought to be seen were the microscope practically equal to its
theoretical power — whether, in fact, the failure was not rather in the en
graving-machine than in the microscope.

     I was induced      meanwhile to examine the power of the eye, in order to
compare it       with the power of the microscope, and to determine what a
microscope of given power should               be able to show.      The following obser

observations of Dr. Jurin and of Tobias Mayer, to which                       I shall allude.

eye to see single lines under the ordinary illumination of a northern sky.
     1st observation. — A black line 0•042 inch wide, 1"75 inch long, drawn
 with common writing-ink on white paper, and a white line of the same
 width and length between two black lines, each 0-20 inch wide, were seen
 equally well within a room lighted by a window to N.W. at a distance of
 30 feet, the angle subtended by the width of the lines being 24" nearly.
     2nd observation. — A[dark-brown hair, 0-0026 inch wide, 2"5 inches long,
 was fixed by dots of transparent gum-arabic to the window-pane, and
 was seen against the N.W. sky by a young eye at 36 feet (I could
 not see it myself at a greater distance than 30 feet): the diameter of
 the hair subtended an angle of l"-24 at the eye. The same eye exa
 mined fine lines divided on glass at a distance of                  6 inches, and, other

  on the day preceding (2nd observation).              The difference was due, partly
  at least, to the different light of the sky.
     4tA ob*erv<Uion.  — The previous observation shows that the line is seen
  at a  greater distance as the length increases till a limiting angle is at
  tained, after which increase of length has no effect on the visibility.          The
  following observations were made to determine approximately the law
  which relates visibility to length.
      Lines of different lengths, 0-045 inch wide, were drawn on different
  slips of white paper (5-8 by 4*5 inches) ; the papers were pinned succes
  sively to a plank placed vertically in the shade (out of doors) with a clear
 sky (April, 6 PJf.); the mean distance of disappearance on retiring and
 of appearance on approaching the lines was taken.

     It will be seen that as the lengths       of the lines increase in a geometrical
 progression (nearly), the distances increase in an arithmetical progression
 (nearly).     It has been easy then to represent the observed angles (a) by
 the following equation : —
                                            145

 where a is'erpressed in seconds of arc, and I, the length of the line, is in
 units of 0-001 inch.            The calculated values agree very nearly "with
 those observed. The angle for a square of 0-045 inch calculated is 26"-4,
 which is very near to the value observed on a previous occasion,                a (or
tana) becomes infinite for f=12-6 (0-0126 inch); but the formula does
 not hold for lines in which the length is less than the width. These belong
to another case, that in which the lengths of the lines are constant and
the width variable.
    Having examined the power of the eye to see single lines, now sought  I
how this power would be affected when more lines than one were placed
parallel to each other, and with intervals equal to their widths.
   * This equation   may be put under tbe following form, where D, the distance of the
observer, and / are in units of one inch :—
                                     D = 642 log 79-4/.

     5th observation.  — Four dark-brown hairs having            been arranged on paper
at equal intervals by means of modeller's wax attached to the ends, and then
 fixed at the ends with gum-arabic, the paper was cut away between the
ends, and the two slips of paper to which the ends were gummed were
fixed to the window-pane : the diameter of the hairs was                                  inch
 (0-00267) very nearly, the lengths were nearly 1 inch, and the intervals
were very nearly the same as the diameter of the hair, the whole width
 being 0-019 inch.          The hairs could be seen to be more than one at 28
inches distance, and they could be counted at 21 inches ; the angles sub
 tended by the intervals at these distances were 20" and 26"-5 respectively.
     It thus appears that at a distance greater than 28 inches the four
hairs appeared         as   one,  when    each   hair subtended         an angle sixteen
 times greater than       it could  be observed at when         seen alone (see the 3rd
observation).        This curious fact was pointed out by Dr. Jurin in the
 essay already cited,         lie found when two pins were placed near to each
 other on a window, that the interval between them could not be perceived
 when it subtended an angle of 40", whereas a single pin could be
 seen at an angle of from 2 to 3 seconds. Mayer, who also made ob
 servations     on parallel lines nearly twenty years after Jurin, does not
 seem to have remarked this fact *.
     The 5th observation was repeated with four white hairs from a horse's
tail ; these were arranged at equal intervals, the mean diameter of the
hair being 0-0105 and the mean interval 0-0110 inch. The hairs could
be seen to be more than one 9 feet distant, when the angle subtended
by each hair was 23"-l ; and the hairs could be counted at 6 feet dis
tant, when the angle was 30"-7. These angles are about one sixth greater
than for the human hairs, the difference being probably due to the differ
ence of light, and perhaps partly to the different length, which was not
noted t.
     6th observation. — A series of lines 0*7 inch long were drawn on sepa
rate slips of paper with different widths and intervals.                 The papers were
fixed successively to the wall of a room lighted by a window to N.W.,
the light falling at an angle of about 45° on the paper. The following
Table contains the results of the observations, first, when the intervals
and lines were of equal width, and, second, when the intervals were 1, 2,
3, . . . times the width of the lines.

    When the lines and intervals were             equal, the angle increased from the
 smallest (0-021 inch) to the largest            (0-164 inch) ; the greater angle for
 the middle width (0-081) is probably            connected with some irregularity in
 the lines ; the increase of the angle           at the greater distance is probably
 chiefly due to the constancy of the              length of the lines (see 8th obser
 vation).
    When the lines and intervals are unequal, the angle subtended by the
width of the line diminishes as the interval increases ; the limiting angle
would be that at which a single line 0-70 inch long and 0-044 inch wide
would disappear.
    7th observation. — It was now sought to determine in what degree the
angle of visibility for parallel lines varied with the relative darkness of
the lines, the intervals between the lines remaining equally bright.                    One
drop   of a  weak   writing-ink having       been   mixed    with  thirty drops    of water,
four lines, 0-70 inch long, 0*081 inch wide, were made (at intervals of
0-081 inch) with a camel-hair pencil ; the first set (I,) received only one
coat, the second (I3) two coats, and I3 five coats. The slips of paper having
been pinned successively to the wall of the room as before, the following

    The last (I„) is the observation already given (6th observation) for the
same lines made      with a drawing-pen and as black as they could be made.
It was found that one hundred coats of watered ink did not make lines so
dark as those of I„ ; and it is obvious that increase of darkness after the
fifth coat (a very faint shade) made little difference in the visibility of the

lines.    On the other hand, the tint may be made so faint as to be imper
ceptible at 6 inches (the distance for a young eye of faint or small objects).
The preceding observations are represented nearly by the following
 formula   : —
                                             19-2
 where a is the smallest angle (in seconds) at which the separation of the
lines was visible, and < is the tint or number of the coats of watered ink.
 The calculated values are given in the Table.
    When t=^% (of the first tint) the lines, according to the formula,
 should have been just visible at 8 inches from the eye, or a weaker shade
on white paper than that made by one drop of the first tint with forty-six
drops of water could not have been seen.                  On the other hand, when
t= 12, the difference of the angle of visibility from that for absolute black
ness is only 0"'L           The constants in this and the other formulas will
depend    of    course   on  various circumstances of illumination, the state of
the individual eye, &c.
    Mayer made a series of observations with several parallel lines drawn
with China ink on white paper (well stretched), the width of the lines and
intervals in one case being O032 of an English inch (0-36 de ligne).
These lines he could perceive to be several at 11 feet (pieds de Roi) dis
tance with the light from an open window to north, or when the angle
subtended by the interval was 47".            He then made observations with the
same lines lighted by a wax candle placed at different distances from
them.
    I give Mayer's observations for this set of lines here for comparison

(3\   he found <?=0-2 foot; and "we may conclude," he says, "that the
light of day is  as strong as that      of  a candle at one   fifth of    a  foot from the
object.     Consequently     if we wish to light an object with a candle as
strongly as it would be by daylight [and even by strong sunlight, as
Mayer found], we must employ twenty-five lighted candles placed at a
distance of one foot from the object"* !
   Had Mayer's formula been an exact representation of the observations,
he might have concluded that the eye could separate parallel lines as well
with twenty-five candles at one foot distance as with full sunlight : but it
will be seen that the errors of the formula increase as d increases and
diminishes.      An equation of the form given by Mayer which best repre
sents the observations is found by least squares to be
                                                  i

but this also fails when d is small.           The following equation          best repre
sents Mayer's observations, including that for daylight: —
                        a-47=25Vrf+301og(d+0-9)                                        (5)
   When d=0, a=48"*3. The errors of this equation are given in the
preceding Table.        But it will be seen here also, from the distances D of
the observer (which       I have calculated from the angles given by Mayer),
that when the distances d of the candle increase in a geometrical pro
gression, the distances      D diminish in an arithmetical progression           as nearly
as the accuracy of the observations admit.            This fact      I have myself veri
fied by repeating Mayer's observations.             We may then represent the ob
servations by an equation of the same form as the others.                   The following
has its computed values and errors given in the Table : —

   It  follows from this formula that when the candle is 140 feet from the
paper, the eye at 8 inches from it could just see the lines and spaces :
when d = ^ foot, a=47", the smallest angle under which the lines and
spaces can be seen.
   It  might have been supposed that the distance of the observer from the
paper would vary inversely as the illumination, or that a should vary as
iP, which, it will    be seen, is very     far from being the      case.
   The 7th observation previously given represents more nearly the case
of the examination of test-lines on glass, the spaces being equally bright,
or nearly so, in all cases, while the lines have a variable depth of shade.
In Mayer's observations both spaces and lines receive less light as the
candle is removed. The impression on the retina for the separation of

the lines receives no improvement in the first case by any increase of depth
of tint of the lines beyond a certain feeble shade, nor in the second
(Mayer's) case by any increase of the illumination of both lines and spaces
beyond that of a candle held near.
   8th observation.   —It   was sought whether the visibility of parallel lines
increased with their length, as in the case of single lines.                        Four long
parallel lines having been drawn, of the width and at the interval of
0 048 inch, on a sheet of white paper, this was pinned, as before, to a
smooth plank and placed in the open air in the shade (before sunset) ;
the lines were covered by a sheet of the same paper so as to show variable
lengths.     The following Table contains the results of the observations                  : —

                                                is
 to the inch diminishes.      The widths of the lines and of their interspaces
 were measured by me by means of            glass scale accurately divided with
                                                     a
 one thousand divisions to the inch, the dividing lines being about one tenth
 the width of the interspaces.      This scale was placed one half on thin white
 paper, the other covering the photographed lines.             The readings were
 made with the aid of       pocket-lens
                                a        of Tl  inch focal  distance.   The width
 of every line and interspace was measured for the first six bands from                   ;
 eight to ten lines and spaces were measured from the VIl.th to the XILLth
 bands inclusive    in each case the means of these measures are given.
                     ;
 For  the remaining bands the number of lines and their spaces were counted
 and their whole width observed to the XVII.th band.             In the XTIII.th
 and XlX.th    bands  the lines  run into each other  in different places (in some
 of the previous bands the lines occasionally fail). It was evident that for
the highest bands the machine failed to make the number of separaie
lines which were drawn.         In several cases diffraction-fringes interfered
with the accuracy of the measures but as these were generally made

   Notes.  — These   measures are frequently mere     approximations   ; and  in several bands
the graving-point     has made a wonderful approach to an equality       of width of lines and
spaces ; indeed these lines are mnrvels of mechanical skill. If, in the case of each band,
the first and last lines had been drawn longer than the rest, it would have been pos
sible to measure the width of a line with considerable accuracy, since, as has been shown ,
 the risibility of a single line is nearly twenty times that for the series.
   The widths of the lines and spaces are those taken from the photographs, the unit
being ' inch. The photographs are magnified to 1000 times. In bands XVII. and
XVIII. second measures are given from photographs magnifying to 16O0 times (but re
duced to the same unit). The number of lines in ( ) are the numbers counted for which the
total width was measured.        The number for t he XlX.th ie deduced from the measure of a
few where the lines were most distinct.        The numbers of lines and spaces to an inch
are the numbers which could be put in an inch laid side by side (without interval).
Under " Both " is given the number of lines to the inch (with interspaces), as in the bands.
The "Ratio" is that of the number for the widest space (17,000 to the inch) to the number
for the widest line or space in the following bands.
    It will  be seen    that the least width of the lines which can be counted and
measured on the photographs is about , 8U)000 of an inch (XI.II.th band).
We have seen (oth observation) that dark parallel lines on glass can be
 seen with transmitted light when their width subtends an angle of 20" to
 26"; so that lines stopping the light moderately (7th observation) of yoIkoIP

of an inch wide should bo seen with a power of 125, and counted with a
power of 160 (the distance for the unaided eye being considered 8 inches).
•We have, however, obviously in the high bands to include the case of ob
servation 7, the lines on the photographs being excessively faint.  When
wo add to this fact (a most important one when such lines are supposed
to give some measure of the power of the microscope) that it appears that
separate lines cannot be drawn of a less width than about 1 80'000 of an
inch under the diminished pressure of Mr. Nobert's machine without
the graving-point sliding into previous grooves, we have a sufficient ex
planation why the power of the microscope cannot                be measured by these
lines.
   The following are the conclusions of this note : —
   1st. That lines can be seen by the naked eye with transmitted light
the width of which subtends an angle of about 1" (2nd observation).
   2nd. That the visibility of a line, or the distance at which it can be seen,
depends on the logarithm of its length, the product of the angle subtended
by the width and the cube root of that subtended by the length being nearly
constant (4th observation).
  3rd. Short parallel lines could be seen by transmitted light when the
angle formed by the width of the spaces and intervals was 20" (5th ob
servation).
  4th. The visibility of lines of the same width increases as the distance
between them decreases (6th observation).
  5th. The visibility of parallel lines depends on the darkness of the
shade or tint of the lines up to a certain feeble tint, after which no black
ing of the lines increases the visibility     ;   the distance to which the lines can
be seen depends on     c',

                             a

   7th. The visibility of parallel lines depends on the logarithm of their
length, as in the case of single lines, the variation being much greater for
short parallel lines than for long ones.            Also for short parallel lines the
product  a      nearly constant, as for single lines (see second conclusion).
               is

XI. " On      the Change produced by Magnetization in the Electrical
       Resistance of Iron and Steel. — Preliminary Notice."                   By
       Professor    W.  C-. Adams,   F.R.S.      Received June 1, 1875.
    For  some time past   Mr. Herbert Tomlinson, Demonstrator in the Phy
sical Laboratory of King's College, has been engaged in carrying out a
series of experiments on this subject, and also on the effect of change of
tension on the electrical resistance of steel and iron wires.
    In  measuring the resistances of the short lengths of the wires or rods
which were employed, a unit was chosen which was a small fraction of
the British- Association unit.
    Experiments were made with rods of soft iron about one eighth of an
inch thick, with soft steel, and also with steel of different degrees of
hardness.
     With a rod of soft iron about 3 feet long there was au increase of re
sistance of about    1 per cent, on magnetizing with two Grove's cells.      The
whole resistance of this rod was 32     units.
     The experiments were repeated with the rod placed in ice and also in
water at the ordinary temperature (about 15° C), and with nearly the
same change in the resistance of the rod.         The change in the tempera
ture of the water was found to be about       1° C. during the experiment.
     Another rod of soft iron was employed whose resistance was 50 units.
The magnetizing current was measured by means of a tangent-galvano
meter, and the resistance was measured by means of Wheatstone's bridge.
 There was found to be an increase in the resistance of the rod when it
                                                                current through
 was converted into a magnet by sending the magnetizing
 a wire which was coiled round it in the form of a spiral.
     It was found that the electrical resistance was increased when any ad
dition was made to the strength of the magnetizing current. When the
                                                                           of the
 increase in the electrical resistance was divided by the square
 strength of the magnetizing current, a series of numbers was obtained
 which did not differ much from one another ; the values of these num
 bers mostly lie between 3 and 4.
     When the magnetizing current is considerably increased, the ratio of
 the increase in the resistance to the square of the magnetizing
                                                                          current
 diminishes    rather rapidly.
     A  similar series of experiments was made with a thick knitting-needle
 made of soft steel. The resistance of the needle was
                                                             29 units.    In this
                                                      when the   strength  of the
 case also the resistance was found to     increase
  magnetizing current was increased.      On dividing the increase of resist
                                                                         obtained
 ance by the square of the magnetizing current, the numbers
                                                                        and 5-6,
  from a considerable number of experiments lie between 4*7
  showing that the ratio of the increase of resistance         to  the square of
  the magnetizing current is very nearly constant.

531          On the Electrical Resistance       of Iron and Steel.  [June  17,
    When the magnetizing current is considerably increased, this ratio is
found to diminish, just as in the case of soft iron.
    Different kinds of hard steel were tried.
    (1) An ordinary knitting-needle, of which the resistance was          66-5
units.
    On magnetizing with currents of different strengths, there was found
to be a diminution in the resistance ; and it was also found that the diminu
 tion of resistance increased when the strength of the current was increased.
With currents varying from tan 15° to tan 54° 30' the diminution
amounted to 4-33, i. e. about 6-5 per cent, of the whole resistance.       The
temperature increased about 2° C. during the experiment.
     Dividing the loss of resistance by the square of the magnetizing
current, the results of four sets of experiments            gave the following
values   : —

     Four Grove's cells were employed for the strongest current.
     Two other experiments which had been tried previously gave results
 2-30 and 2-26 for the ratio of the diminution of resistance to the square
 of the magnetizing current, thus showing that the diminution in the
 resistance is almost exactly proportional to the square of the current.
    The diminution in resistance does not take place all at once, but gra
 dually, and aleo ceases gradually when the current is stopped.
    (2) A steel needle was also magnetized longitudinally by placing it on
a copper strip at right angles to the lines of force of a current across the
strip.
    There was found to be diminution of resistance on increasing the cur
rent.      The values obtained from two series of experiments were : —

                              (tan  150)3
    With stronger currents this ratio was found to diminish.
    On magnetizing the wires transversely by sending a current in the di
 rection of their length, a diminution of resistance was also observed, which
 diminution also increased when the strength of the current was increased.
     When a current was sent along the wire itself, on increasing the

current there was found to be also a diminution of resistance in the case
of hard steel, and an increase of resistance in the case of soft iron and
soft steel.
   Thus the effects produced are the same as those due to transverse
magnetization by a neighbouring current.
    Conclusions to be drawn from the experiments : —
    (1) The effect of passing any current through a bar of hard steel is to
diminish its resistance, and through a bar of soft iron or soft steel is to
increase its resistance.
    (2) When a bar of hard steel is magnetized by sending a current through
a coil which encloses            it,
                              there      diminution of resistance which
                                         is   a                                     is
 directly proportional   to the  square of the magnetizing current up to             a
certain limit.
    (3) When soft steel or soft iron     magnetized longitudinally or trans
                                              is
 versely, there    an increase of resistance which
                   is                                 nearly proportional to
                                                              is
the square of the magnetizing current.
 XII. " The        Action of Light on Selenium." By Prof. W. G. Adams,
                    M.A., F.E.S. Received June 17, 1875.
                                (Abstract.)
    The paper contains an account of several series of experiments made
 in December and January last on this subject with the view —              :
    (1) To determine whether the change in the electrical resistance of the
 selenium    due to radiant heat, light, or chemical action.
              is
    (2) To measure  the amount of the change of resistance due to exposure
 to light from different sources and through various absorbing media.
    (3) To determine whether the action     instantaneous or gradual, and,
                                                    is
if   possible, to measure the rate at which the action takes place.
     The selenium formed one of the four resistances in        Wheatstone's
                                                                       a
 bridge, and its average resistance was about    megohms.2|
    The two resistances in the bridge, which were kept constant, were               4
 and 2000, so that the resistance of the selenium was 500 times the vari
 able resistance required to balance          it.
     R   taken to represent this resistance required to balance the selenium.
         is
 The box containing the selenium was laid on its side and had           draw-  a
 lid, which was kept closed except when exposure was made. In front of
 the draw-lid was     black screen with an opening opposite to the selenium
                        a
 6 centims. by 3| centims., into or in front of which various absorbing
 media could be placed.
   The absorbing media employed were bichromate of potash, sulphate of
 copper, ruby, orange, green, and blue glasses. Plates of rock-salt, alum,
 mica, and quartz were also employed.
   With the lid of the box on, the resistance of the selenium was measured,
 and was found to increase slowly and regularly in consequence of the

hiring     by the current.          In    most of the experiments    a battery of 30 Le-
clanche oeQ* was employed.
    It was found that the higher the battery-power the less is the resistance
of the selenium. Experiments with 5, 30, and 35 cells gave the follow
ing results : —

    This diminution of resistance               with  increased battery-power may be
vcounted for         •*   part by leakage        from   the rheoeord ; and there may be
also an opposing electromotive force similar to polarization brought into
 action in the selenium when the current is passing which increases with
 the current.
    Exposure to light diminishes the resistance of selenium.
    This may be accounted for by either of two hypotheses : —
    ( 1 ) That light acting on the selenium sets up a polarization                 current
 in it   which   opposes    the   battery-current passing through        it.
    ('2)  That   light    makes    the selenium a better conductor of electricity by
 producing     a  change    in  its  surface similar to the change which it produces
 on the surface of a phosphorescent body, by which that body is enabled to
 give out light after it has been exposed.
    With the same battery-power, an increase in the temperature causes
an increase in the resistance of the selenium.
    In   December, before the extreme cold, the resistance                R  with 30  cells
was about 5-!00. Throughout the extreme cold, from December 18 to
Januarv 4, the resistance R was about 4400. This was the value of R at
 1 r.M. on   January       1st, a bright cold day.        On January   5 the temperature
out of doors changed to 44°               F. in the   shade at 12 o'clock, and the value
of R was found to be 5400.                   These values were obtained before the box
was opened, and          were   the    first  experiments made on the days named.
   When first exposed after being closed up for some days or even hours,
the selenium is more sensitive to light : this sensitiveness increases with
the time during which the selenium has been kept in the dark ; hence
the first experiment is generally not comparable with the others.
   On exposure to light the resistance is diminished ; but on being again
eclipsed, the selenium returns in a very few minutes nearly to its pre
vious resistance.
   The change of resistance produced by exposure to daylight sometimes
amounts to one fourth of the whole resistance of the selenium.
   The experiments with various absorbing media seem to show that the

1875.]                     Action of Light on Selenium.                        537
action through media which absorb all the more chemically active rays is
very nearly as great as when they are not interposed, so that the chemical
rays produce very      little effect.
    Experiments     with   the lime light, with rock-salt, alum, and quartz, and
their combinations, two together, show that the resistance diminishes at
the same rate as the illumination increases.         This seems to show that the
action is almost entirely clue to the illuminating power of the light falling
on the selenium.
    Experiments with the electric light, with smoked rock-salt, alum, and a
solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon show that the obscure heat-rays
do not act    powerfully on the selenium.
     In one series of experiments an attempt was made to separate the
instantaneous effect from the gradual effect of the light.
    This was done by first balancing the resistance of the selenium before
exposure by a resistance R of the coils, then diminishing R by 300, 400,
or 500 ohms, according to the brightness of the light, so as to get no
 sudden deflection when the current is made at the first instant of expo
 sure.
     It  was difficult to determine beforehand by estimation what diminution
 of R should be made ; but after several trials it was quite possible to make
 the sudden deflection very small, either on one side of the zero or the
 other,   and to keep the needle near the zero by continuing to diminish the
 value    of R as long as the exposure lasted.
     In  this way the effects of exposure in successive equal intervals of time
 can be measured.
      The light allowed to pass through the coloured glasses and other
 absorbing media was examined by a spectroscope, and it was found that
 the yellowish-green        rays were among the most active in altering the
 electrical state of the selenium.
      A series of experiments was made to determine the effect of light from
  different sources.
      A Bunsen burner       was employed, and chloride of barium, chloride of
  strontium, thallium, and sal-ammoniac were introduced into the flame.
      The effect with barium seemed to be less than with strontium.
      With sal-ammoniac in the flame the effect was as great    as with strontium
 and more lasting.
      With thallium the effect was considerably greater, more gradual,      as  well
  as  far more lasting than with strontium.
      The effect on repeating an experiment is very much less than the effect
  of the first exposure with each new source of fight.
      Experiments were made with the Bunsen burner alone in its ordinary
  state and when it is rendered luminous by stopping the air-holes.
      Exposure to the ordinary Bunsen flame for several seconds only caused
  a  slight deflection of about 10 divisions of the scale.       After this slight
  diminution of resistance the needlo gradually returned to zero, and was

    dr-flected to the other side, as the heat radiated from the Bunsen burner
   was absorbed by the selenium.
       On making the    dame luminous, the needle was suddenly deflected off
   the scale with great rapidity.
       With the 10 shunt to the galvanometer there was no deflection on ex
  posure to the ordinary Bunsen flame ; but with the luminous flame there
   was a sudden deflection, which increased to 250 divisions of the scale in a
  few second*.
       This corresponded to a change of resistance in R of about 1250 ohms.
       Tai* experiment was repeated in a slightly different way.       The sele
  nium was balanced, and before exposure to the luminous Bunsen flame,
  K was diminished by 1000 ohms. On making contact and exposing at
  the same instant, there was a slight deflection, showing that the sudden
 effect was equivalent to rather less than 1000 ohms ; but in a very few
 seconds the needle was at rest at zero, and to keep the needle at zero
 the resistance was further diminished by 300 ohms.
      The resistance had   been diminished   by one fourth of its whole amount
  in less than one minute in consequence of the exposure.
      Exposure to an ordinary wax taper diminished the resistance of the
 seienium by 300,000 ohms, or about one eighth part of its whole resist
 ance.
      The illuminating powers of these sources of light were compared by
  means of the Bunsen photometer.
      The light of the ordinary Bunsen flame could scarcely be measured, but
  was somewhere about            part of a candle, and of the luminous Bunsen
  rUme about 10       candles, whilst the tight from the taper was at its best
 rather c»re than one fourth of a candle.
      The heating effects of these three sources were compared by means of
 the thermoelectric pile and delicate astatic galvanometer.
      At a distance of one foot from the face of the pile the deflection
 produced by the ordinary Bunsen flame was 46|°, and by the luminous
 Bunsen flame was 52°, whilst the taper produced no effect which could be
raoasurevL
     These experiments clearly show that very little effect is produced by
 the radiation of obscure heat, bat that the effect is due almost entirely, if
not entirely, to tight.
     As the effects produced      were measured in deflections of the needle,
 soaie series of experiments were made to determine the value in resist
ances equivalent to the divisions of the scale, from which it appeared
that »ith the 10 shunt to the galvanometer and with 30 cells, 20 divisions
of the scale were equivalent to 100 ohms resistance; and without the
rhunt, li"0 divisions of the scale were equivalent to from 100 to 110
ohms.
     Experiments were also made to determine whether moonlight would
produce any change in the electrical resistance of selenium.        The esperi

merit was made at the half-moon, when the moon was high up, so that the
light fell obliquely on the window and did not shine directly on the
selenium.
    On throwing the moonlight on the selenium by means of a plane mirror,
the needle was at once deflected 20 divisions of the scale ; on placing the
 mirror outside the window so as to send the moonlight perpendicularly
 through the window on the selenium, the deflection of the needle was 40
 divisions. The window was kept closed during these experiments.
   On another evening when the moon shone very obliquely on the window,
 and the selenium was exposed on the inside of the window directly
 to the moonlight, the needle was deflected 100 divisions of the scale,
 and the deflection increased to 150 divisions after exposure for about
3 minutes.
     The change in the resistance of the selenium was from 60,000 to 70,000
ohms.
  These experiments show that the action on the selenium is due princi
pally, if not entirely, to radiations belonging to the visible part of the
spectrum.    Light rays of all kinds, particularly the greenish yellow, pro
duce an instantaneous          effect followed   by a more or less gradual effect,
which continues to increase during exposure for several minutes.
   These facts suggest two hypotheses as possible explanations, which may
help as guides in further experiments, but which cannot be accepted
as proved without further evidence.

force in       it,

           Received June 17, 1875.
      In   a   communication   on   " Lesions of the Nervous System producing
 Diabetes,"  presented to the Royal Society in 1859 (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol.
 x. 1859-60),    made known that division of certain parts of the sympa
                     I

 of  puncturing the floor of the fourth ventricle (Bernard's celebrated
 experiment) had been for some time previously familiar to physiologists         ;
 but nothing had been ascertained about the production of               by

 which the medulla oblongata influenced the liver, that         I was   led to recog
nize the facts which my researches disclosed.
    These results      merely showed that there were other means besides
puncturing the floor of the fourth ventricle by which artificial diabetes
could be induced.        They did not explain the reason of the appearance of
sugar, and    I  still sought to discover something upon this point. Failing
to reconcile any explanation that has been suggested with the evidence
furnished by experiment,        I  have from time to time pushed inquiry in
various directions, but always with a fruitless issue, until the summer of
1874, when      I came across the results which it is the object of this com
munication     to make known, a brief announcement           of them having      been
previously made in a letter to the Secretaries of the Royal Society shortly
after the close of the session of last year.
    For some time past      I have   been led to look to an altered     condition of
the blood flowing to the liver as likely to prove the most probable cause
of the transformation of amyloid substance into sugar, which evidently
constitutes the foundation        of the artificial diabetes following operations
upon the nervous system.           Schiff is of this view, and (' Journal de l'Ana-
tomie et de la Physiologie,'      Paris, 1866) has referred the escape of sugar
from the liver, and thence the production of glycosuria, to the develop
 ment of a ferment in the blood as a result of the hyperemia which fol
lows the operations on the nervous system which occasion artificial
diabetes. It is not necessary, according to his view, that there should
 be hyperemia specially of the liver ; but hyperemia anywhere may lead
 to the development of the ferment which he alleges to be the source
 of the appearance of sugar. " Le diabete par suite de Fhyperemie pour-
 rait done bien ne pas etre l'effet specifique d'une hypercmie du foie, mais
 de chaque hyperemie genérale d'une certaine etendue."               I have carefully
 examined this view of Schiff, and cannot obtain evidence of the develop
 ment of a ferment in the manner asserted ; moreover               I  have tried the
 effect of introducing a secretion, viz. saliva, into the circulatory system,
 which is known to act as an energetic ferment upon the amyloid substance
 of the liver.    At first  I introduced    it into the general circulation through
 the jugular vein, and failed to observe the production of saccharine urine.
 Later on, thinking the experiment might be more effective,              I injected it
 into a branch of the mesenteric vein, so that it would all pass directly to
 the liver.     Upon one occasion      I  found that the urine, from some cause
 or other, became to a moderate extent saccharine ; but in a large number
 of other experiments the operation was attended with a negative result.
 The quantity used varied in different instances, the largest amount em
 ployed being 13 fluid drachms.          In some cases the saliva was introduced
 in, a pure state, in others after dilution with varying proportions of
 water.   ^
    Looking at the fact that the amyloid substance is contained in the
 hepatic cells, it is scarcely surprising that a ferment of a colloid nature

1875.]          Dr. F. W. Pavy   on the    Production of Glycosuria.           541
contained    in the blood should fail to be capable of determining the pro
duction of sugar whilst passing through the vessels of the liver.
    Having so far proceeded without success, it now occurred to me to try
the effect of introducing defibrinated arterial blood into the portal
system.         I
               was led to experiment in this way from having a long time
previously observed that when arterial blood only was allowed to] flow
through the liver (as, for instance, when the portal vein was tied and the
hepatic artery left free), sugar escaped from the organ to such an extent
as to render the contents of the circulatory system strongly saccharine.
This result         I
                 had commented upon as being somewhat surprising, and
as furnishing evidence standing in opposition to Bernard's glycogenic
theory.     Ihad not succeeded by the operation in producing glycosuria,
because, as it appeared to me, no urine was secreted, owing to the liga
ture of the portal vein leading to such a diversion of blood from the
general circulation, by the accumulation occurring in the portal system,
that the flow through the kidney was too slight to allow of it.            Ihad
endeavoured to overcome this obstacle by connecting, through the medium
of a canula, the portal with the right renal vein after ligaturing the cor
responding renal artery.       If the experiment had succeeded, the liver
would have been left with its arterial supply, but the portal stream would
have been diverted and made to reach the inferior cava without traversing
the hepatic vessels. As regards the operation, this                I
                                                                found  I  could
 accomplish ; but each time      Iperformed the experiment the object      Ihad
in -view was frustrated by the canula becoming quickly      filled with  a plug
 of blood-clot.                                                    I
                   It was whilst under this difficulty that thought of col
                                                    it it,
 lecting blood from an artery, defibrinating        and then introducing         it
 into the portal system.     I   had considered     possible that some slight
 effect might be perceptible, but had not anticipated the strongly marked
 result which           is
                   producible.
    The amount of blood used has been from 10 to 18 fluid ounces. After
 the production of anaesthesia       by
                                     chloroform the blood was collected from
 the carotid artery, stirred in order to defibrinate         it,
                                                           strained, and then
 very slowly injected   into a  branch   of the mesenteric vein.    In one ex
 periment, where half an hour had been employed in making the injection,
 the urine, at the completion of the operation, contained       notable amount
                                                                   a
  of sugar, and half an hour later showed, by analysis, the presence of 15
  grains to the fluid ounce. In second the urine contained 10 and in
                                     a                                           a
 third 14 grains to the fluid ounce when collected three quarters of an
  hour after the operation.
     The experiments were performed upon dogs, and in each case             had
                                                                           it
  been ascertained that the urine was devoid of sugar before the operation.
     It will thus be seen that these results leave no doubt about the decided
  production of glycosuria.      The effect was not only rapid but of            a
strongly marked character. It      necessary, however, before concluding
                                      is
that the glycosuria was really attributable to the influence of the oxyge
nated blood, to have evidence that in the absence of oxygenated blood            a

 542        Dr. F. W. Pavy on the Production of Glycosuria.               [June  17,
  negative result would be obtained.         I took care, by slowness of injection,
  to avoid allowing the circulation through the liver to be influenced by
  the effect of increased pressure within the portal system.               I  am not
  aware, and do no think from         my previous experience, that any fallacy
  would be likely to arise from such a source ; but          I nevertheless deemed
  it advisable   to exclude   the possibility  of its occurrence.
      Having noticed the effect which has been described from the injec
  tion of oxygenated blood into the portal system, it became necessary to
  ascertain positively that it was attributable to the oxygenated condition
  of the blood, and not to any other cause.             To decide this point an ap
  peal to the counterpart experiment was made.                 Defibrinated venous
 instead of arterial blood was injected into a branch of the mesenteric
  vein  ;  and upon each      occasion where such an operation has been per
 formed a negative result has been obtained.                With the evidence thus
 furnished the conclusion may be warrantably drawn, that oxygenated
 blood in some manner influences the liver, so as to lead to the production
 of glycosuria.      It may be inferred that, contrary to the effect of venous
 blood under a natural state of the circulation, it promotes the transforma
 tion of amyloid substance into sugar.
     In   performing   these experiments of injecting defibrinated blood into
 the portal system,      I  came across an effect which      I had not anticipated,
 and which upon several occasions frustrated the object             I  had in view.
 Defibrinated     blood,  as experimental physiologists know, may be injected
 into the veins of the general system without producing any special effect.
 Injected, however, into the portal system, it frequently gave rise to a
 complete stoppage of the portal circulation by inducing coagulation of the
 blood in the trunk of the portal vein and its ramifications in the liver.
 I   merely mention the fact in this place, and am not aware that it has
 hitherto been noticed ; but it may hereafter be found of interest in con
 nexion with the subject of the coagulation of blood.                 Finding that
 several of my experiments proved fruitless from this cause,          I tried means
to obviate coagulation occurring, and amongst these was extirpation of
the spleen.       With this operation, as far as my experience has yet gone,
the coagulation is prevented ; and, moreover,         I have noticed that the blood
in the general system after death fails to possess its ordinary coagulating
property.
     The suggestion naturally occurs, that what has been stated in this
communication affords an explanation of the glycosuria occurring after
Bernard's puncture of the fourth ventricle and the various lesions of the
sympathetic.        •Without any new agent being called in, sufficient is pre
sented in the state of the blood to account for the production of sugar
that occurs.      By a vaso-motor paralysis affecting the vessels of t he chylo-
poietic viscera    the blood will reach the portal system without having become
dearterialized     in its natural way ; and in this state it has been shown
to possess the     property of acting within the liver in such a manner as to
determine the      production of glycosuria.

511                         Mr. I. L. Bell       on some                    [June    17,
    The Whin-sill, as it is termed by the lead-miners of the Alston-Moor
 district, is the most remarkable example of bedded igneous rock in the
 northern counties, extending as it does from the Farne Islands in the
north to the county of Northumberland ; and after passing the Stublick
 Dyke, by which it is faulted, it skirts the escarpment of the Pennine
 range in its outcrop, and terminates, so far as we are informed, in the
 neighbourhood of Lunedale in Yorkshire.
    There is another but smaller occurrence of bedded basaltic rock near
Stanhope, in Weardale, which was formerly, and very accurately, described
                                                               '
 by Sir Walter Trevelyan in the first volume of the Transactions of the
Natural-History Society of Northumberland and Durham.'
    Another lateral intrusive mass of whin exposed by denudation at the
 surface occurs at Bolam, in South Durham, in connexion with the cele
brated Cockfield-Fell Dyke. This mass has been figured and graphically
described by Prof. Sedgwick            in the Cambridge Transactions above
quoted.
    A further instance of the lateral or horizontal intrusion of igneous
 rock which we have now to describe occurs in connexion with the basaltic
dyke which extends from Egglestone Moor along the Bedburn Beck,
 through Bitchburn Colliery, Constantine Farm, Whitworth, Tudhoe, Hett,
 Tursdale, and Crow Trees, to Quarrington           Hill, on the escarpment of the
Magnesian      Limestone.    This   dyke  was    first  described, and its direction
traced, by Prof. Sedgwick.         Though it is nowhere seen in contact with
the Magnesian     Limestone,  its  existence is proved in the colliery of Shotton,
which is worked entirely under that formation.
    At the point where the Hett Whin-dyke crosses the Wear are the
workings of Pagebank Colliery, which is in the occupation of Messrs. Bell
 Brothers. A little more than two miles to the north is a second basaltic
dyke, running parallel to the Hett Dyke for some distance ; but               I am not
aware that any actual point of junction has hitherto been observed between
these neighbouring dykes*.
    Connected with the mining-operations            of the above-named colliery        a
bore-hole, to prove the position of the coal, was commenced about 730
yards to the south of the more northern dyke.                 The usual well-known
 strata of that district were passed through ; but on reaching a depth of
 56 fathoms a hard       rock was struck,        which proved to be whinstone.
 Fourteen weeks were consumed in penetrating 26 inches into this obstacle,
after which   it was abandoned    ; and a second hole was commenced 910 yards
to the west of the first, but with no better results, for at a depth of 65£
fathoms the same impediment was met with. After much labour and
loss of time a length of 4 feet 9 inches was bored into the whin, and then
no further progress was attempted.
     I
   * am indebted to my friend Mr. Richard Howse, of Newcastie-on-Trne, for the
information giren above respecting the localities in which basaltic rock is found ia the
North of England.

     In
      the mean time a neighbouring firm had sunk a pit in the immediate
vicinity without meeting with any trace of whin rock ; and as circum
stances demanded           it,
                       two shafts were commenced                     by
                                                      Messrs. Bell Brothers
185 yards N.E. of the first bore-hole.   The area within these three points
amounts to something like 15 acres. When the more advanced of these
pits was sunk to      depth of 67 fathoms, the men came upon the hard
                        a
obstacle met with in the bore-holes      and the same thing happened in
                                                   ;
the second shaft, situate 60 yards to the west of its neighbour.
   In each case fully four months of incessant labour, accompanied with
considerable expense, was required before the lower surface of this hard
stratum was reached, which proved to have          thickness of 19-75 feet.
                                                                 a
In all probability, however, its dimensions are subject to considerable
fluctuations, for in one of these two pits the bed       feet thinner on the
                                                                     is   4
north side of the shaft than on the south.
   It was now clear that was bed of basalt lying in horizontal posi
                                      it      a                               a
tion which was encountered, in which direction       had spread itself as one
                                                                 it
offering less resistance than that to be overcome by forcing an exit at the
surface.   At what point communication exists between this interjected
                                      a
 mass and its subterranean source we have had no means of ascer
taining.
   Above and below the basaltic bed, as found in the pits, there are two
well-known seams of coal.       In the neighbouring colliery spoken of
(Littleburn) these are separated                  by
                                     50-25 feet of fire-clays, shales, and
sandstones, while in the present case the intervening rocks measure
 103-66 feet, showing an increase of 53-41 feet. Of this only 19-75 feet
is due to the whin, the remaining 33-66 feet arising from       thickening        a
of the sandstone and other deposits.
   During the entire progress of sinking specimens of the rocks were
preserved, which enabled me at my leisure to examine not only the whin
but also the altered character of the adjacent strata.
   The change experienced by the latter has frequently formed the sub
ject of comment     but;     am not aware that much attention has been
                                 I
directed  to any   modification in the composition of the basalt itself,
caused .by contact with the                  substances through           which   it   had pene
trated.
     It   would of course
                        highly instructive
                                 be           any sedimentary rock could
                                                            if
be accepted, in respect to its constituents and their relations to each
other, as   normal type of whinstone.
               a                           If, for example, an aqueous
rock were found in the immediate vicinity of basalt, and the compositions
of both were the same, one might infer the physical difference to be due
to the mere influence of igneous action.
   There are, however, to be found in nature                         many     substances which
more or less resemble in constitution                  the matter filling whin-dykes,       clay-
 slate being       one, some specimens of which contain the following ingre
dients    :—

 Now there would be nothing extravagant in the supposition that clay-
 slate of this character reduced to a state of fusion by heat might be
 materially altered in passing through the Mountain Limestone and Mill
 stone-grit before reaching the surface in the county of Durham, and that
 it then might resemble the composition of the whin-dykes of the district.
 That the Hett Dyke and its parallel one derive their origin from one
 common source, and if changed by subsequent contact with other rocks
 have been altered in each case by the same cause, is apparent on refer
 ring to their respective compositions.

In    some measure the    interior portions of the horizontal bed found in the

As stated, the specimen just described was obtained from the interior
of the mass of whin ; but its exterior, both ou the upper and lower

In  colour these coatings are of a light buff, and are close in texture, in both
of which particulars they differ considerably from the unchanged basalt.
It would appear that any difference in composition between the interior
of this horizontal bed of basalt and its outer surfaces is entirely inde
pendent of that which might be supposed to arise from mere contact with
the adjoining strata.      Lying above it is 8 feet of a siliceous rock known
among miners in the North of England as a "white post."                     It was

The underside of the basalt rests upon a thin seam of coal, greatly charred
by its proximity to so large a volume of matter, which must have arrived at
its present position in a state of intense heat. This coal is of course defi
cient in volatile constituents, and contains a large percentage of ash, one
half of which is carbonate of lime. Its composition is as follows :—

 518                              Mr. I. L. Bell    on some                 [June    17,
 It  will    be observed that,    in the first three instances quoted of the compo
 nent parts of whinstone, carbonic acid is named as a constituent varying
 in amount from 1 -02 to 2'57 per cent, of the whole. This is a little remark
 able, because     I confirmed by actual experiment that when protoxide of iron,
 lime, magnesia, potash, and soda, in the form of carbonates, are fused with
 silica and alumina in the proportions              in which these substances are
 found to exist       in the  w  hin, the resulting mass does not contain, as might
 be expected,        a trace    of carbonic acid. Whether the small quantities
 just mentioned          of  this  acid represent portions which under immense
 pressure could not escape from the lime with which it was perhaps
 originally combined, is a question to which no satisfactory answer ccn be
 given.
     On the other hand, it is not improbable that basalt may, after or
 possibly during the act of cooling, be placed in circumstances where
 carbonic acid may be absorbed by such of its constituents as are known
 to form carbonates.
     The following experiments were tried on a sample of the pounded
 whin-rock previously ascertained to contain 1-97 per cent, of carbonic
 acid    : —
                                                                          per cent. CO,.
     a. 2-5 grammes having been exposed            during four days to dry

             changed)                                                           1-94
     b.    2-5 grammes, after exposure during four days to moist

     r.    2-5 grammes had passed over it during five hours, at a
             temperature of about 500° C, a current of carbonic acid.

     The experiment b in the series would indicate that when moisture is
present a small quantity of carbonic acid is absorbed at ordinary tem
peratures.        When the temperature was raised, as in c, d, e, and/, there
was a perceptible loss of acid; but in d and /this loss was materially
retarded by the presence of vapour of water.                 It is therefore conceiv
able that carbonic acid, if at one time entirely expelled from the fluid
basalt, may have been reabsorbed, when aided by the presence of mois
ture and probably under enormous pressure, during the countless ages
which have elapsed since it first occupied its present position.
    This idea is confirmed to some extent by an examination of the com

position of the outer coverings of the basalt, already described.             These
in    all probability would, from their position, be more freely exposed
to the action of carbonic acid than the interior of the mass of which
they formed the coating. That these portions are in reality identical
with the bed itself, merely altered by the rate of cooling, or by a
change in composition due to absorbing carbonic acid, or by these causes
combined, is easily seen when the proportions of their fixed elements aro
compared with those as they exist in the whin-rock of the neighbourhood.

The    chief change, therefore, in composition which the outer portions of
the bed of whin have experienced is a much greater absorption of carbonic
acid, amounting to nearly nine tenths of the total quantity required for
 converting the iron, lime, magnesia, and alkalies into carbonates.
    It is perhaps a difficult task to speak with any degree of confidence
on the precise nature of the causes which have given rise to certain
differences in the proportions of some of the earths as exhibited in the
above figures. We may, however, readily imagine that a liquefied rock,
during its passage through a series of stratified beds of various kinds and
of different thickness, will continue for a longer or a shorter time in
contact with any given substance, according to the size of the latter, or
according to the rate -at which the stream of fluid matter for the time
 being is travelling. It is also equally easy to suppose that the exterior may
 solidify by contact with cooler surfaces when the basalt has assumed the
 composition resembling that of the crust or coverings already described.
The liquid torrent continues to flow through beds in which lime prepon
 derates,   such as the   mountain     limestone    :  an additional  quantity of
this earth is dissolved, and the basalt, thus altered in composition, is ex
 pelled through a kind of gigantic tube formed by the cooling of the first
portions of the ejected mass.
    As a source of silica and alumina     I  would point to the composition of
 the rocks immediately below the thin seam of coal underlying tho hori
 zontal bed of basalt under consideration.

   Having now considered the changes which the intruded igneous rock
has undergone, the alterations may be examined which the presence of a
vast mass of highly heated matter has effected on the adjacent sedimen
tary rocks.
    The small amount of volatile constituents left in the thin seam of
coal immediately underlying the bed of whin in the pit has been already
explained.     At a distance of about 17 feet below this is a second bed of
coal 5 inches in thickness ; but to it the intervening rocks have acted in
some degree as' a protection against the volatilizing power of the heated
basalt lying above.
    By its analysis the following results were obtained : —
                   Carbon                                 78-05
                   Hydrogen                                3-78
                   Oxygen                                  4-32
                   Sulphur                                 4-33
                   Ash                                    10-15
                                                         100-63
    At a  further depth of about 35 feet from this perhaps slightly altered
coal, or 52 feet below the bed of basalt, is another nearly 5 feet thick,
known as the Busty, which is one of the well-know coking seams of the
country.     When the coal from it is compared with that obtained from
the same bed two miles away, there is perceptible difference to be ob
 served. We may therefore infer that the emission of heat from the
 thick body of melted basalt lying about 50 feet above it was at the time
 of cooling so slow as not to have affected the composition of this coal,
which loses at moderately high temperatures 35 per cent. of its weight.
   Looking at the very complex nature of the composition, already re
ferred to, of the coaly shale,
                                    strong blue shale, and grey post stone, it

1875.]                 supposed Changes     in Basaltic Veins.                  551
seems not impossible but that some of the constituents of these strata,
common to all, may owe their origin to the basalt itself, from which they
may have been emitted in the form of vapour.
    Although silica, alumina, and lime are regarded, and justly so, as being
little affected by exposure even to a very intense heat,           I  am neverthe
less disposed to believe that all three are susceptible of being evaporated
at temperatures not unfrequently used in the arts.               From iron blast
furnaces, and particularly from those in the North of England,                a vast
 quantity of white fume or smoke is emitted, which readily condenses
 on a cold surface.        To one of these furnaces in the county of Durham
I attached     an air-pump worked by steam, and by its means the whole of
 this fume from a given volume of gas, as it escaped from the furnace,
 was condensed       in water.
     On analysis it was found to       be composed of —
                    Silica                                    14-06

                    Sulphuric acid                               -64
                    Oxide of zinc                             19-99
                    Carbonates of potash and soda       ....  29-05

                                                             100-18
     Not being prepared to find certain of these bodies carried away in the
  vaporous form, the idea suggested itself that they might, in the first in
  stance, be deoxidized in the powerfully reducing atmosphere of the
  hearth of the furnace, and subsequently reoxidized in its upper regions.
  To satisfy myself on this point,     I drew a considerable volume of the gases
  as they   exist  in  the  hottest  portion of the reducing zone and passed it
  through cold mercury.          Had any such action as that indicated been
  effected,  I would expect to find potassium or sodium in the mercury.
  No trace, however, of these metals was detected, and            I  therefore con
   cluded that the furnace-vapours in question must be regarded as true
   sublimates.    If so, and if the estimate of the quantity be correct, many
   thousands of tons of alumina &c. are annually evaporated on the banks
   of the Tees during the process of smelting iron.
      If similar vapours were emitted by basalt when intensely heated, it
   is almost certain that, under the great pressure then prevailing at the
   depth of this particular bed, some portion would find its way into the
   adjoining strata.      Lying above the basalt is some 8 or 9 feet of a rock
   spoken of as
                  " white post."    On referring to the analysis formerly quoted,
   it will be seen   that this bed contains 88-25 per cent, of silica (it is there

    substances all of which occur in the basalt.                  It is true the same
    mar be said of the rocks underlying the stratum of whin, and that in both
    cases these     ingredients, found in small quantities, may have been depo
    sited with the material constituting       the main body of the bed.
        Believing, however, in the possibility of the basalt having been the
    source of all or a part of what may be designated as foreign ingredients
   in this white post, three specimens were submitted to examination. One
    was taken from the bed where it adjoins the whin, a second from its
    middle, and the third from its upper portion ; and certainly, so far as
   some of these ingredients are concerned, they tend to confirm                the view
   just expressed.       This view is based on the fact that the substances in
   question are found in greatest quantity next the basalt, and that they

       Before    any well-established      conclusions   can     be arrived  at on the

  is indispensable.      At some future opportunity        I  may pursue this inquiry

  XV. " Results of       Magnetical Observations made in Little Nama
        qualand during a part of the Months of April and May, 1874."
        By E. J. Stone, M.A., F.R.S. Received June 11, 1875.
     An   eclipse of the sun was to occur on     April  16, 1874, which would
 be total throughout Little Namaqualand.          I made arrangements for a
 visit to this country to observe the eclipse. The country is one rarely
 visited.     I was not aware that any determinations of the magnetic
 elements had been made there, except a few of the variation by the
 Admiralty surveyors at one or two points along the coast. It appeared
 to me desirable that the opportunity afforded by my visit to observe the
 eclipse should not be lost of securing magnetical observations at several
 stations   in Namaqualand.        An application was made to the Colonial
 Government for some         assistance. An ox-waggon was required for the
transit of the magnetical equipment      and of a wooden building which had
been prepared to protect the instruments and the observers whilst at
work. The sum asked for was sixty pounds.            The request thus made
was, however, refused, although with great courtesy and apparent reluc
tance, from a supposed difficulty in passing such a grant through Par
liament. 1 was, however, most unwilling to abandon the idea of making
these magnetical observations. When the facts of the case became known,
I  received offers of assistance from some gentlemen in Namaqualand, and
His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly, K.C.B. &c., kindly interested himself
in the matter and afforded me all the facilities in his power. I deter
mined therefore to carry out, in a somewhat modified form, the scheme
of observations which      I  had arranged.    The wooden building was left

any kind for the instrument s or the observer, although at a considerable
 cost in time and in the comfort of those engaged upon the work.            The
greatest trouble arises from the action of the wind upon the instruments,
 more particularly upon the dip-instrument ; but by patiently awaiting
 opportunities the injurious effects arising from this cause can be very
 nearly, if not quite eliminated.       I decided also, after some hesitation,
 to take no assistant with     me.    I was anxious to avoid unnecessary ex
 pense, and to obtain as great freedom for moving about the country as
 possible.    I  only absolutely required some one to enter the times from a
 chronometer to the nearest half-second;         and  I found, after a careful
 aeries of experiments upon the point, that my wife could do this without
 anv difficulty.    The probable error of these time determinations does not
 appear   to exceed   three tenths of a second ; and it would be very difficult,
 with a skilled assistant, to obtain, under the circumstances of these
 observations, a much greater degree of accuracy.            The instrumental
                                 "                    "
 equipment consbted of : — a Dip," by Dover ; a Unifilar," variation, and
 intensity instrument combined, by Elliott Brothers ; a five-inch Theodo
 lite, for the determination of the latitudes, local times, and absolute
  azimuths of marks ; aneroid barometer ; thermometer ; and a pocket
 chronometer      beating half-seconds.     With only two persons and this
 instrumental equipment, it was found possible to move freely about the
 country in a Cape cart, and with comparative luxury in a waggon.
    I knew that a chronometer could not be trusted to carry accurate time
 over such a country as Namaqualand without, at least, special appliances,
 which were not available to me under the circumstances of the case.           I
 arranged therefore for the determination of local time with the theodolite,
 and for the fixing of the absolute azimuths of the marks with the same
 theodolite immediately before or after the determinations of local time.
 The ill effects of a trip or stoppage of the chronometer was thus elimi
 nated.     This precaution was found necessary. The chronometer has
 stopped and then gone on again on several occasions from the dreadful
 shaking of the carts or waggons over the rocky roads, and has on some
 occasions tripped some seconds from merely being carried about in the
 pocket or hand. The chronometer dead-beat escapement does not appear
at all well fitted for rough work of the kind, and a good lever escape
ment would be much preferable.           The chronometer used has had a very
steady rate when not       moved   about, and has not much changed that rate,
when at rest, from the effects of the journey.          The greatest practical
inconvenience experienced in the use of the instruments was the occa
sional breakage of the suspension-threads and the loss of time in getting
the new threads out of torsion.         After several accidents of the kind, 1
used three instead of two threads of suspension ; but the torsion was
inconveniently large, and the loss of rime in getting the threads out of
torsion considerable.      These three threads were only used at the Orange-
Hiver station and on the return to Port JNblloth.        The time of vibration

I  think this error rather in excess than defect.

read each time.     There were never less than four of these independent
lifts in each position;   acomplete dip therefore consisted of at least sixty-
four independent bisections of the ends of the needle and of thirty-two
independent lifts of the needle from the agate planes.       A great deal of
time was consumed in making one of these dips in the open air, on
account of the disturbances of the instrument by the wind. In the
zenith-distance observations of the sun for local time, and azimuth obser
vations for the determination of the absolute azimuths of the marks, both
limbs of the sun in reversed positions of the theodolite were always taken.
The differences between the azimuths of these marks, usually two, and the
azimuthal reading for the magnetic meridian were taken with the Elliott
instrument. The means of the results obtained from the variation-needle,
which allows of reversed suspension, were alone used but the reading
                                                               ;

were only made at the distance of one foot, except for the Port Nolloth
station. The small correction to the results thus found, usually deter
mined by second set of deflections at 1*3 foot, has been obtained from
             a

   No direct determination of the latitude could     be made under favourable
circumstances at noon or equally distant from and near noon, on account
of the only stand being occupied at these hours for the magnetical obser

ing and morning determinations of the azimuth of the marks, that                   the
adopted latitude is slightly in error.         The mean of the evening            and

and   were made somewhat under difficulties.            Some ostriches bore down
upon the instrument and had to be continually driven from it. The

   This station was 3059 feet above the level of the sea. This height is
derived from Mr. Hall's levelling.          The instruments were placed as near
Mr. Carson's house as would insure freedom from any disturbing effect of
the iron about the house. Ookiep is surrounded by mountains, which
impeded very early or late observations of the sun from the station
chosen.    It is the chief mining station, at present, of the Cape Copper-
Mining Company.

able one for magnetical observations.          I  had but little choice of stations.
I fear some    little local magnetic disturbances in the observations made
here, such that the elements might have been found to have differed
somewhat considerably with a comparatively small shift in geographical
position.    I should therefore have been glad to have supplemented these
observations with a set on the Bushman flats, the bed of a recent sea

to the brains of individuals of different race, sex, age, education, and
occupation, seems likely to furnish a means of investigating individual
peculiarities      in the human cerebrum.
    I propose      shortly to communicate my results to the Society.
    2.    I  have likewise made numerous observations on the convolutions
of the human brain with the view of explaining their symmetry in certain
regions, and their asymmetry in others.              In endeavouring to trace more
particularly the causes of the asymmetry of the convolutions which pre
vails in Man,        I  have been led to believe that some, at least, of this is
due to the right-handedness of Man.
    I   find, on studying a large number of human cerebra, that there are
 stronger evidences of essential asymmetry, as distinguished from what              I
 would term non-essential asymmetry, in the immediate neighbourhood of
the left fissure of Rolando, and next to this part in the right parietal
 lobule.                                                          .
    There are certain secondary essential asymmetrical            conditions   which
may be pointed           out, and besides this       many non-essential    and very
 variable ones.

eximination of                   foetal brains and the brains of idiots, the former of which
exhibit           a remarkable, early, and special tendency to deviations                    in sym

            phalon and its parts in Man." By John Marshall, F.R.S.,
            F.R.C.S.E., Professor of Surgery, University College, London,
            &c.            Received June 17, 1875.
      Being anxious, for                   a certain special purpose, to determine the influence
of stature on the weight of the encephalon and its parts in Man,     have,                     I
with the consent and ready assistance of Dr. Robert Boyd, further
analyzed the MS. records of the numerous data accumulated by him,
from which he framed his tables published in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1861.
   1.       I
        find, first, that, as might be expected, an increase of stature is
accompanied by an increase in the absolute weight of the encephalon or
entire brain                 in both      sexes.
                sexes together, the total increase, with a mean range of
      Taking both
11 inches between  the highest and lowest group of individuals examined,
is about    or. av. in the male series, with
                     <)|              ;          mean range of    inches,
                                                                      a                    7
it    is    '2\   ot.    :     in the female series, with      a    mean range of   6   inches,    it   is
 1^   or.
     Of this increase in absolute weight, the cerebrum, in both sexes,                         neces
sarily takes   larger share than the cerebellum
                           a                      but having regard to the
                                                                      ;
relative weights of those two organs, viz. as about     to   their relative8      1,
increase    as about 11 to
                    is          so that the cerebrum increases absolutely
                                                   1
                                                   ;
more than the cerebellum.
   The pons with the medulla follows the rate of increase of the cerebellum.
   2. But, secondly,   find that, notwithstanding this absolute increase in
                                      I
the weight of the encephalon and its parts in obedience to an increase of
the stature, the increase itself   not pari passu with the stature; on the
                                                       is
contrary,  there      gradual  and
                                 is progressive relative diminution in the
                                      a
proportion of encephalic substance to the stature as this latter itself
increases.
     This       is    equally true           if    we take the range of stature     in both        sexes
together or in either sex separately.
  Hence shorter persons of either        sex have, proportionately  to their
height,   larger amount
                a         of brain than   taller ones. Nevertheless the pro
portion     larger iu the male than in the female, not only generally, but
                is
even at corresponding heights — as, for example, in short men as compared
with tall women. This        interesting, as evidence that the well-known
                                              is

1875.]       Production of Exact Rectilinear Motion by IAnkwork.          565
sexual difference    in the weight of the male brain overrides the influence
of stature, or subsists in spite of his greater stature, which has a tendency
to diminish his proportionate amount of brain.
     Further comparisons show that the stature ratio, as it may be called,
diminishes with the height less markedly and less constantly in the
case of the cerebrum than in the case of the cerebellum, which latter
organ, therefore, obeys the influence of stature more exactly and impli
citly, so far as regards its relative proportion to the body.
     3. It becomes evident, and may be shown, that all estimates of other
influences regulating the brain-weights in Man, whether these be sex,
age, occupation, education, or disease, are liable to error unless the influ
ence of stature be first eliminated.     Instances of this statement are easy
to find.
;    4. It may in this mode be demonstrated what is the true influence of
sex, age, disease, and other modifying causes.
     5. Lastly, in this way alone can we arrive, as it seems to me, at a
 correct appreciation of that residual cause of peculiarity or deviation
in the weight of the encephalon and its parts, especially of the cerebrum,
which may be called its proper weiglti=variation,          as an independent
or quasi-independent organ.
      6. This residual variation, it maybe thus shown, is far larger than any
other, a fact obviously of the highest interest and importance.
     In support of these propositions, and others of greater detail, I propose
to make a lengthened communication hereafter.

      Since the invention by James Watt, in 1784, of the 3-bar linkwork
 known as " Watt's Parallel Motion," which gives an approximate recti
  linear motion, many attempts have been made to obtain a more perfect
  solution of the problem how to obtain accurate rectilinear motion by means
  of linkwork. Professor Tchebicheff succeeded in obtaining a 3-bar link-
  work giving a much closer approximation to a truo result ; but in his case,
  as in that of others, the solution is only approximate, and it may be, in
  fact, shown that with 3 bars an accurate result cannot be obtained. It
  was not until 1864 that the problem was solved ; in that year M. Peau-
   cellier made his memorable discovery of an accurate 7-bar solution; and
   in 1874, when the subject was brought prominently forward in England
   by Professor Sylvester, Mr. Hart, in a paper read before the British Asso
   ciation, gave a solution by means of 5 bars. Both these linkworks, as is
  now well known, depended upon the inversion of a circle with respect to
  a point on its circumference.

    Further investigation led me to the discovery that all these linkworks
depended for their production of straight lines on an exceedingly simple
and obvious property of any quadrilateral whose sides are of constant
length.    The observation of this property at once led to the discovery of
a  large number   of new 7-bar linkworks, of which M. Peaucellier's, Mr.
Hart's, and those previously discovered by myself proved to be particular
cases, the inversion property of the two former being, so to say, acci
dental.
    It the object of this paper to point out this property, and how
         is                                                                                          it
may be taken advantage of in the construction of      number of 7-bar     a
straight-line-producing linkworks.
 *   Professor Sylvester has employed this term to mean a network composed of an
even number   of bars.   When one bar    fixed, so that its joints become fixed pivots,
                                                  is
the system    is   termed    a   linkwork.

    The property alluded to is this :—
    The cosines of the opposite angles of any quadrilateral         whose sides are
 of  constant   length,   but whose angles   are variable, bear a linear relation to
each other.
    §  1.  In  fig. 1, A BCD is any quadrilateral of which          the sides  AB,
 BC, CD, DA          are of the lengths a, b, c, d respectively.
    Then it is clear that

That    is, there is a linear relation     of the most general character between
the cosines of the variable angles B and D.
    Before, however, this property can be taken advantage of something
more is required        ;   the angles whose cosines bear a linear relation to
each other are the opposite angles of a closed quadrilateral ; and for our
purpose it is necessary that they should be the angles at the base of an
open trilateral — t.     «., to employ the language of linkwork, the angles made
with   a   third bar by two bars which are jointed to it. To effect this
transformation let the second quadrilateral A (3 y S be constructed equal
in every respect to A B C D, and having its sides J A, /3 A collinear with
the sides B A, D A of A B C D, but placed in a reverse position so as to
be the image of A B C D. This new quadrilateral may be termed the
" conjugate image" of ABCD, the whole figure forming what may be
termed a " self-conjugate sextilateral."

568               Mr. A. B. Kempe       on the production     of     [June    17,
   It is clear that the angle   I is equal to the angle D ; thus we have the
sides  B C, $ y of the open trilateral C B $ y making angles with A B whose
cosines bear a linear relation to each other however the figure be de
formed.
   Since, however, the relation is an angle relation, it is unnecessary that
the conjugate image should be equal to the original quadrilateral ; for if
the figure A B' C D' be constructed similar to A /3 y 5 the angle D' is
clearly equal to the angle i, and we have the sides C B, CD' making
angles with A B whose cosines bear a linear relation to each other.          This
makes our results more general ; and we are moreover able to make the
points D and B', or the points D' and B, coincide if necessary.              This
more general form of figure, consisting of two quadrilaterals, one of which
is the enlarged or reduced positive or negative image of the other, may
still be appropriately termed a " self-conjugate sextilateral," the qua
drilaterals being still called the one the " self -conjugate image'' of the
other.
   §  2. Now let the linkage in fig. 2     be constructed,

bar is denoted by a broken line and the pivots by circles round the

denoting all the coincident points are bracketed together. It is found con
venient to collect the different linkworks into four groups, a separate
 section, numbered to correspond with the figure, being devoted to each
 separate linkwork described.

coming before, but is an exceptional one.

   Since  P  and F  in §  5 lie vertically the one over the other, it is clear
that if the links PO=FB, FO=PB be added, O lies on the straight
line O B perpendicular to A B, and thus O B is the locus of O.
   II.  § 8. Make k =     ^  in the fundamental    linkage, so that B and D'
coincide.
   Fix A B,   add the bars  R P O, R F O',    making

                             RP O   is parallel to F D\
                             EFO'        „      „  PB.
Thus, if O L, O' L'       be drawn perpendicular    to A B,
                             NL=N'D',
                             N'L' = B N.
   Thus the loci of 0 and O' are two parallel straight lines perpendicular
to A B.
   The two added bars may clearly be replaced by the bars f Ca>, fCW
parallel to them ; and the points to, eu', where these bars cut the line
O' B O, will move in straight lines tu\, a/A perpendicular to A B.

so that  B' K    is parallel to  C D.
Add the two bars
                            CO = B'K, KO=B'C,
so that  P O is     parallel and equal to D K, and therefore to C D'.

Then NL=N'D'.
Therefore B L=B N + N L=N N', a constant.
Thus the locus of O is the straight line O L perpendicular         to A B.
   § 10. Now in the last linkwork make
                                         a=d.

   IV.  § 11. Taking the fundamental linkage in its most general form,
fix the point P on a pivot.           Now if the bar A B be made to remain
always parallel   to the fixed   line  P 8, since N N' is constant, P' will move
on the straight line F L perpendicular to P S.
   The parallelism of A B is effected most obviously by adding the bar S T
equal to P B, P S being equal to B T.           Other methods may, however, be
employed   ;  for if C A  be  joined cutting P S in U, U is a fixed point ; and
if U V be drawn parallel to C D, U V is constant and V is a fixed point
on CD.       So if U W be drawn paralled to C D, U W is constant and W

574               Mr. A. B. Kempe      on the production     of        [June    17,
is a fixed point on A D.    Thus the bar 8 T may      be replaced by either of
the bars  UVorUW.

 that BM=D'Q.          A B is fixed. The equal bars MO, QO are added.
 Then O clearly moves on the straight O L perpendicular to A B, B L
 being equal to L D'.       This linkwork was given by me in the ' Mes

and the bars    A D, A B become superfluous and may be removed. There
then remains Mr. Hart's 5-bar linkwork.         This is the only 5-bar link-
 work giving rectilinear   motion that has as yet been obtained.
    § 16. In many of the previous cases the point O, which moves in a
 straight line, will be found to be connected to a fixed point through which
the straight line passes by tww^equal bars. Whenever this occurs the
motion of the bar containing the moving point is of the sort described by
 Professor Sylvester as " tram motion."    That is, its motion is that of a bar
sliding between two fixed rectilinear trammels, or, to present this motion
in its fullest generality, the motion of a plane in which a whole series of
points lying on a circle move each of them in straight lines passing
through a fixed point.       Turning to fig. 16, if BP, PO, be equal bars
and O, moves in the straight line O, B passing through B, then if O, P
be produced to Oa so that P Oa=P O,, Oa obviously moves in the straight
line B O3 perpendicular to O, B, so that O, Oa slides between the two
straight lines B O,, B Oa. In this case it is clear that any point O3
attached to the bar O, POa, and distant a distance PO3=PO, from P,

describes a straight line O3 B through B, the angle O3 B O, being one
half of the angle Oa P O,. This greatly adds to the usefulness of the
link works.
                                  Fig.  16.
   It is not suggested that the linkworks here given exhaust 7-bar
line linkworks ; indeed it is obvious that many of them are suscep
tible of variations.     Enough, however, has been shown to demon
strate the important part which the property of a quadrilateral combined
with the principle of the conjugate image stated at the outset plays in the
question.
   I have strictly confined myself in this paper to the consideration of the
rectilinear motion of a point.  The principles involved, however, are appli
cable to many other problems, as, for example, the motion of bars every
point in which moves in one of a series of parallel straight lines or in the
same straight line.    By means of the peculiar form of the fundamental
linkage given in figs. 6, 13, 14, valuable results in the reversal or multi
plication of angular motion may be obtained, and a linkage of 2n+2 bars
may be constructed which will divide any angle into n equal parts.     Some
of these questions have been treated of by me in my paper in the
'             of Mathematics,'                     to, which was, however,

XIX. " On the Heat of Sunshine        at London during the twenty-four
       years 1855 to 1874, as registered by Campbell's Method." By
       H. E. Roscoe, F.R.S., and B. Stewart, F.R.S. Received
       June  10, 1875.
    During the above period Mr.      J.  F. Campbell observed at London
 the relative heating effect of the sun in the following manner (de
scribed in the Report on the Warming and Ventilating of Dwellings,
 printed  by order   of the House of Commons,        25th  Angust,   1857,
 p. 151).
    A hemispherical cavity was made in a block of wood, and a spherical
lens was made to be placed in this cavity in such a position that while
its centre coincided with the centre of the cavity its chief focus was at
some point of the hemispherical concave surface, the exact point being
of course determined by the direction in which the rays struck the
lens.
    Whenever,  therefore, the sun shone, a portion of the wood would be
carbonized or burnt out by his concentrated beams ; and inasmuch as the
sun continually changes his position not only from hour to hour, but
from day to day, it follows that different portions of the wood will be
acted upon not only from one hour to another, but also from one day to
another.
   The blocks were all of mahogany, being as nearly as possible of the
same quality, and the diameter of the sphere was about 5| inches.
    When these blocks came into our hands, we considered how it was
possible best to measure the amount of wood burnt out.      At length we
hit upon the plan of filling up the hollows burnt out -with a mixture of
bees' wax and olive-oil, of such a consistency that we could easily work
it into the burnt cavities until the whole internal hemisphere should be
made to present the same smooth surface which it had before it was
burnt.
    A comparison of the weight of the block before and after this process
was supposed by us to afford an approximately good estimate of the
extent of the hollows.     Mr. J. A. Dodge, a student in Owens College,
was good enough to assist us in this part of our research.      Indeed he
made two determinations for each block, dissolving out the mixture by
means of heat and refilling the cavities ; and the near concordance of
these  two determinations gives us reason to believe that the results are
as accurate as the nature of the experiment requires.      We subjoin a
Table containing these results : —

   Before proceeding further, it will be well to state that the first six
results of the table were obtained by means of a water lens, while those
that follow were obtained by a glass lens.         The first six are not there
fore comparable with those that      follow.

    From this table it appears, as might be expected, that the heat of
 sunshine is greater during the second than during the first half of the
 vear. reckoning from the sum mer solstice ; and this result is borne out by
 the observations made by one of us* that the chemically active solar rays
 are of greater intensity during the autumn than during the corresponding
 spring months.
    There is a remarkable uniformity in this law, the only cases where it
 is broken being the years 1855, 1857, and 1868 — years, it may be remarked,
which are near the epochs of minimum sun-spot frequency.                 It thus
appears that in order to compare one set of observations with another, it
will be necessary to form yearly instead of half-yearly values ; this is done
in the following Table : —

    The first   five of these values must be treated by themselves, inasmuch
as the lens was a water one.         They point to a minimum of solar-heat
action in 1856 and 1857 ;        this agrees very well with the minimum of
sun-spot action which took place in 1856.
    Of the remaining thirty-three values the mean is 30-468.
    Now there was a maximum of sun-spot frequency in 1859 and 1870,
and a minimum about the end of 1866 or beginning of 1867.
    Let us take the values of sun-heat action about these dates, and see
if  there be any correspondence.       We have sun-heat action, mean date

which is also greater than the average, although          the difference is not so

   It would thus appear that, as far as we can judge from these obser
vations, there is more solar heat at London in years of maximum than in
years of minimum disturbance.
   This agrees very well with a remark made by Messrs. De la Kue,
Stewart, and Lowey, the Kew Observers, to the effect that the number
of fine days in the year on which solar pictures might be taken ap
peared to be greater in years of maximum than in years of minimum
sun-spot frequency.
XX. " On      the Effects of Iron Masts on Compasses placed near
      them." By Staff-Commander E. W. Creak, R.N.                     Com
      municated by Captain Evans, R.N., F.R.S., by permission of
      the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.            Received June
      17, 1875.
   The question of the position of the standard compass on board ship,
whether of wood or iron, is one of the greatest importance with respect
to safe navigation.    In H.M. ships it is one of the principal duties of
the Superintendent of Compasses to secure the best possible position for
this compass, and when that position has been determined, to ascertain
the horizontal and vertical components of the total magnetic force re
sulting from the iron used in the construction and equipment of every
class of vessel, in order that the correctness of this choice of position
may be insured and the facts recorded.
   With proper instruments in experienced hands these observations      can
be readily made ; but   in iron ships it is a somewhat intricate matter to
eliminate the part   which the hull plays in producing these forces, from
those caused by iron used in equipment, unless observations are made on
completion of the hull and afterwards as the equipment progresses.       In
wooden ships, however, the case is different ; for the great mass of the
ship being of wood and the iron in detached masses, the latter can be
attacked in detail, and the disturbance they cause to the several com
passes nearly observed.
   Carefully conducted investigations made in different ships on the
effects of similar bodies of iron are very valuable to those directing com
pass arrangements, as they give the necessary information as to how
near those bodies may be approached or of necessity avoided.
   The effects of introducing iron riders for strengthening wooden ships
were in a measure discussed by the late Captain E. J. Johnson in his
work 'On the Necessity of ascertaining the Deviation of the Compass,'
where he treats of the diagonal iron riders of the 'Encounter' and
•
  Conflict,' but afterwards more fully in the papers which the present
Hydrographer, Captain Evans, F.R.S., has written and published in the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Journal of the United
Service Institution, and Transactions of the Institute of Naval Archi

 1875.]                 Effects    of Iron Masts     on Compasses.                583
 tects.   In  these papers may be traced in turn the effects of adding steam-
 engines and boilers, iron beams, and armour plating ; but until lately no
 good opportunity has occurred for accurately defining the action of iron
 masts in producing compass disturbance from observation.                    The case
 referred to is that of H.M.S. ' Undaunted ;' and when about to visit that
 ship in the ordinary course of my duties in the Compass Department,                 I
 was directed by the Hydrographer to make a special series of observa
 tions of the horizontal and vertical forces at all three compasses, as the
lower masts and bowsprit were of iron.
    To prepare the way for a discussion of the results of these observa
tions, it appears necessary to give a short history of the two principal
 vessels mentioned in this paper, and also to go over some already well-
 trodden ground, whilst taking account of all the iron and the effects on
their compasses, until the question of the iron masts alone remains to be
settled.
    For  some       years past there have been lying in Sheerness harbour two
wooden frigates of exactly the same build, tonnage, and horse-power,
namely, the Undaunted and Newcastle' — the only important difference
                '                '       '
                                           '                                   '
between them being that the Undaunted' has iron masts, the New
castle' wooden. The diagonal iron riders which form the principal por
 tion of the iron used in construction of their hulls are about 6 inches in
breadth, | of an inch thick, and placed 5 feet apart, at an angle of 45°
with the decks. They extend from about 5 feet from the keelson on
both sides of the ship up to the top sides — the after riders inclined
towards the bow, the foremost towards the stern, the two sets meeting
and overlapping amidships.               These riders, therefore, being separated are
independent magnets, except at the point of meeting just mentioned.
    The 'Newcastle' was built at Deptford, head S. 73° W. (magnetic),
                                                                                     '
and is a vessel of 3035 tons and 600 horse-power.                  The ' Undaunted
was built at Chatham, head S. 43° E. (magnetic), and is a vessel of
3039 tons and 600 horse-power.                   Assuming the dip at the time of
building   to  be    68°, the  after    riders of  both ships (near which the com
passes are placed) were not far removed from the direction of the Earth's
Total Force, and would therefore become strongly magnetized, especially
                  '
those in the Undaunted.'
    A glance at the coefficient C of the standard compasses given in the
Table shows at once which ship was built in the easterly and which in
the westerly direction; and, further, it is highly probable that in the
' Newcastle' the coefficient B would have been more
                                                                 nearly in accordance
with the results of direction of the ship in building, but for the masses
of iron introduced in equipment, such as engines and boilers, armament,
great funnel, &c. In fact, as the compass is only 62 feet from the stern,
there is a large excess of iron before that position compared with that abaft.
We may reasonably assume the same of the B in the ' Undaunted' before
her iron masts were stepped.

584             Staff-Commander       E. W. Creak     on the        [June 17,
   It  is now time to say something about these iron masts.          The bow
sprit and foremast are so far removed from the compasses that their
effect may be regarded as zero.      The mainmast also being at a distance
of 62 feet from the standard compass, its red and blue poles must
neutralize one another.      At the steering-compasses a slight repulsion
towards the stern may exist, but sufficiently small to be neglected.
   When, however, we consider the position of the mizzenmast, at a
distance of only 8 feet 6 inches from all compasses, we shall find that it
has produced deviations    of very decided amount and marked character ;
and therefore our attention may be confined to that mast alone.
   This mizzenmast, which is 82 feet in length and 24 inches in diameter,
was built at Chatham of the " best-best
                                             "
                                                iron, half an inch thick, the
plates overlapping making it    1 inch thick at its thickest parts, and for the
purposes of this discussion may be considered a hollow cylinder.           The
effects of iron in that form have been already treated on mathematically
by the late Mr. Archibald Smith, F.K.S., in the Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.
part i. 1865, pp. 317, 318.
   •Whilst building, the mast lay in a horizontal position, the direction
N. 43° W. and S. 43° E., heel towards the northward, which was a
favourable position for that end of the mast to receive a permanent
quantity of red magnetism as the riveting was proceeding.           When the
mast was stepped in its nearly vertical position and subjected to the
tremor caused by the rapid revolutions of the screw and engines, red
magnetism would become more and more developed.               To test to what
extent this was accomplished the following experiments were made.
   At 15 feet from the heel on the upper deck, and at 12 inches from
the mast, a small compass was carried round, the blue pole of which
pointed invariably to the mast.      On the poop, at 22| feet from the heel
and 12 inches from the mast, the blue pole of the compass was attracted
three points.    At 9^ feet above the poop, and approaching the centre of
the mast, there was no attraction ; but the neutral zone was very limited
in extent, as the blue magnetism began to make itself felt a few inches
further up.     This description of the mizzenmast shows that at 8 feet
6 inches   from  all compasses there exists a vertical, hollow, cylindrical
magnet, the effects of which are clearly demonstrated by the following
coefficients (p. 585).
   According to the custom of Her Majesty's navy the ships were swung
when ready for sea, to ascertain the deviations of the standard and
                                                                        '

be so little disturbed.     To remedy this deficiency      I must now invite

'Challenger' was about to start on her present voyage- from Sheerness,
an extended series of observations for the horizontal and vertical forces
on board was made, in order to prepare for the correction of the magnetic
observnt ions now being carried out in her at sea.

     This vessel was built at Woolwich, head S. 16° W., and fitted out at
 Sheerness    ; and the coefficients obtained in her at two positions have been
                                                             '
introduced to confirm and supplement those of the Newcastle,' espe
cially as she is of the same construction, although smaller, and has
wooden masts.
     The notation and methods of computation of these coefficients are
those given in the Admiralty Manual of the Deviations of the Compass.
     The standard compasses are all within 3 inches of 12 feet 6 inches
 above the upper deck, the steering-compasses 3 feet 9 inches above that
 deck, and 6 feet apart.
     An examination of the values given in the Table shows that about 8°
                                                         '
have been added to the B of the ' Undaunted's standard, but the C
remains practically unaltered.        This is evidently the effect of the red
 pole of the mast repelling the red pole of the compass towards the bo*,
 and thus conspiring with the other iron of the ship to produce a large
  +B. Both the mast and compass being in the same fore-and-aft line,
 the C cannot be altered, and depends for its amount and sign on the
 diagonal riders before referred to.         There is nothing unusual in      the
                                                           '
 values of A, D, E, except that the ' Undaunted's D ranks among               the
largest observed in wooden vessels.
     The  X  (or the ratio of the mean horizontal force on board to that on
 shore, Earth = lvO) is at all the compasses a fraction above unity. This
 probably proceeds from the fact, already recorded, that the iron in these
 ships is in detached masses instead of its direction passing continuously
 through the compasses like iron beams, which invariably reduce X below
 unity.
     The  ix (or the ratio of the mean vertical force on board to that on
 shore, Earth =1•0) in the ' Challenger' shows how the red poles of the
 diagonal riders act in producing an upward force ; but had the riders
 been joined at the keelson, it is almost certain that the it would have
 been nearer unity at the expense of X — a more desirable result, for this
 reason : experience has shown that X may be reduced moderately below
 unity with no appreciable effect on the working of the compasses, whereas
 fi, upon which the heeling-error so mnch depends, should in wooden ships
 be as near unity as possible, heeling-error being troublesome to all navi
 gators, and an insidious source of danger to the inexperienced.
     In the ' Undaunted' the /i at all compasses is evidently much reduced
by the vertical component of the force produced by the red pole of the
 iron mast, which pole is very strong at a distance of 16 feet, and at an
 angle of 35° from the vertical line passing through the standard compass.
     The coefficient x, or heeling-error, which in these ships is to leeward,
 and practically dependent alone upon the value of p (X being so near
unity and D so small), of course becomes greater in the ' Undaunted'
than in the two other ships.
     So far all the coefficients at the standard
                                                    compasses, and X,     and  x
at all compasses, have been
                                 examined ; there remain therefore    the A, B.

C, D, E      of the steering-compasses to be considered.            For this purpose
there      is sufficient evidence in the two sister ships, which are strictly
comparable.
      The compasses      are necessarily placed but of the central line of the
ships, and diagonally to the mast under discussion ; therefore, as shown
by the figures in the Table, a transverse component is introduced.                    In
                                                            '               '

about 11° have been         added, and at the port steering a large — C of 13|°
shows the transverse component of the mast's force more strongly than
at the starboard ; but the 2|° in excess are probably due to some other
cause not accounted for by the observations made.
   .  The A for these compasses is large in both ships ; this does not, how
ever, appear to proceed from magnetic causes, but rather from mechanical
error in placing the binacles.             D and E show the results usual in
                                                 '

      Having thus, think, defined the effects of the iron mizzenmast of the
 ' Undaunted ' on her compasses, it remains now to show what was the
          desirable way of meeting them, and what was actually done
                                                                                 in that
most
 direction.
      The most certain cure of the evil would have been to remove all the
                                            mast, as far as magnetic reasons are
compasses further away from the

      The standard compass might have been raised to a level with the
 neutral     zone of the mast, but this at the expense of increasing vibration

      The steering-compasses being in the most suitable position for the use
 of the helmsman, and there being the standard compass as a means of
 comparison       and obtaining the correct course, no change of position was
 necessary.       The three compasses were therefore corrected by magnets,
                                                                               as in the

      The effects of iron masts are these :

vertical force.
   3. That the quadrantal deviation is slightly increased,                                    and the          mean
directive force remains undisturbed.
   4. Lastly, it is suggested that, as the magnetic                              condition of a mast
may be easily ascertained by carrying a                                   compass round it at stated
distances and parts, the mast may be utilized or avoided as convenient.
A similar examination of the mast in different latitudes would enable an
observer to eliminate                           induced magnetism from
                               the effects of transient
the subpermanent. The amount of deviation proceeding from these causes
is known for several classes of ships ; but what part iron masts supply is
yet a subject for inquiry.
