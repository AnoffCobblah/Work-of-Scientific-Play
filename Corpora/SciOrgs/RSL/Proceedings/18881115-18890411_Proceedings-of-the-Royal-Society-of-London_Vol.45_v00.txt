       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
     Dr. Parkinson was born in 1823 near Keighley, in Yorkshire, and
  died in 1889 at his residence in Cambridge.
     His father died when he was a boy, and left to the widow the diffi
  cult task of bringing up a large family on a very narrow income.
  Coming up to Cambridge in October, 1841, he began his college life
  with an examination for a sizarship.       One of his competitors, who
 sat just in front of him at this examination,       still remembers with
 wonder how he finished his papers long before the others, and how he
 sat at his ease with his back against the wall for a long time.       The
 success with which he thus began his college life was due to his
 own energy and talent, for as a boy he had but limited opportunities
 for study, and the same energy carried him on successfully through
 out his life.
    As a lad without independent means, it was necessary for him to
 succeed,   and accordingly he prepared to do his best at the final
 University examination. He had most formidable competitors, and
the contest therefore excited considerable interest at the time.         It
 was a very different thing from his first skirmish for the sizarship,
and it was only after a hard fight that the Johnian was declared to
be the Senior Wrangler.        The scene is described in a lively manner
by a contemporary, an American who resided for five years in an
English University. Such descriptions are outside the object of the
present memoir, but it helps us to understand the skill of the com
petitors to learn that the Senior Wrangler did more than two-thirds
of the problems set in all the three problem papers.          Such at least
was the current report     of the day.
   The Smith's Prize examination was at that time so arranged that
the element of speed did not enter into it to the same extent as into
the Tripos.     The subjects of examination were in general beyond the
reach of ordinary undergraduates.         Here the places were reversed,
and Parkinson stood second in the list.         The contest, however, was
well sustained, for    in  one paper   the two first competitors obtained
respectively 63 and 55 per cent. of the marks.
   As soon as he had taken his degree he devoted himself to an acade
mical life. He had begun to take pupils even before his degree, and
now continued to do so with great success. Three of his pupils, vis.,
Besant, Sprague, and Finch, were the Senior Wranglers in the years
1850, 1853, and 1857 ; another pupil, the Right Hon. L. H. Courtney,
M.P., now Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, was second in
1855. In 1864 he was appointed to be College Tutor.          It was here he

                                       ii
 found his real vocation in life, and worked at it until 1882. He looked
  after his pupils in a business-like way, with mingled firmness and
  kindness, and they reciprocated by giving him their confidence.
  Some of them have afterwards described how kindly he had assisted
  them with means, and by his influence started them successfully on
  their journey through life. His remembrance of his pupils did not
 come to an end when they had passed from his care, but he and they
 remained ever mutual friends. In this way he became well known
 outside the University, his name and influence attracting many
 students to his College.    When he married in 1871, he expected, as
 the custom then was, that he would lose both his fellowship and
 tutorship. But the College would not part with so valuable a
 tutor. The Master and Seniors requested him to continue in his
 office of tutor though residing in his own house.      This was a compli
 ment of which he was justly proud.        He continued to act as tutor for
 eleven more years, and was then elected a second time to a fellowship
 in his College.     He, however, did not retain the dividends of this
 office, but of his own free will gave them up to the College.    Later on
 he gave £500 for the Church at Walworth, as this is the College mis
sion belonging to St. John-s, not the only gift of his to this district.
    Dr. Parkinson took his B.D. degree in 1855, and became Doctor
of Divinity in 1869. He acted as curate shortly after his degree in a
neighbouring village, but the pressure of his other duties prevented
him from taking much more active work. He was on the Commis
sion of the Peace for the borough for several years.        He was elected
 a Member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1845, a Member
of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1853, and a Fellow of the
 Royal Society in 1870. Ho married Miss Whateley, of Edgbaston
Hall, in 1871.
    Dr. Parkinson was not a writer of many books. His treatises on
 Elementary Mechanics and on Optics were published while engaged
 in tuition.    They do not contain any novelties, but were written
 because experience had shown him that students had found difficulties
 in these subjects, which he thought he could remove. Their com
 mercial success is therefore a good test of their excellence, and of this
there can be no doubt. They came into general use in the University,
and for several years they were very generally read.           They each
passed through      several  editions.    They have,  however,  now been
 superseded by newer books with methods more adapted to the wants
of the present day.
    Dr. Parkinson took a prominent part in University affairs.          He
 was Examiner for the Mathematical Tripos in 1849, and Moderator
in 1852. He served as Senior Proctor in 1864. He was a Member
of many syndicates appointed to consider weighty questions as they
arose.    For example, he served on the important syndicate which

                                   iii
in 1867 enlarged the scope of the Mathematical Tripos. For three
successive  periods of four years each, beginning in 1866, he was
elected  a Member of the Council of the Senate, his popularity in
the University being shown by the large majorities by which he
headed the poll at each of his two re-elections.    He was one of the
first appointed Members of the General Board of Studies constituted
by the Statutes of 1882. He was also elected by the " Colleges in
common " in 1882, and on the expiration of his period of service
again in 1886 as one of their first representatives on the Financial
Board of the University. He was a Member, and for the most part
Chairman, of the Board of Examination from its establishment in
1873 till within a few months of his death, when failing health com
pelled him to resign this and other offices, the duties of which he felt
himself no longer able to discharge.
   In his public capacity his wise and prudent counsels, his able
administration and management, his thoroughness and directness of
purpose, were universally recognised. In his private capacity a wide
circle of friends will long remember his genial heartiness, his con
stant and kindly thoughtfulness.                            E. J. R.

     In 1884   some preliminary    experiments, published in the 'Journal
 of the Chemical Society,' convinced me that moisture exerted an
 important influence on the combustion of carbon.          Since that time
 experiments have been made, not only wirh that element but with
 several    others, and the same influence seems to be exerted on the
combustion of pome, while no such influence could be detected in the
case    of other elements. It was discovered very early in the investiga
tion that hydrogen, both free and combined, aided the union of carbon
with dried oxygen, and therefore for the new experiments on this and
other elements, special attention was devoted to their purification
from hydrogen.        It was found that two of these elements, amorphous
phosphorus and boron, had, like carbon, a very great power of occlud
ing hydrogen. To eliminate it some of the elements were heated in a
current of pure chlorine, while others were heated in sealed tubes
with the chlorides of the elements, special precautions being Uiken to

2       Mr. H. B. Baker.         Combustion      in dried Oxygen.      [Nov.   1   "),
free the pnrified elements from all traces of the agents used in their
purification.  In this way the elements — carbon, sulphur, boron, and
phosphorus, the latter in both red and yellow modifications — were
found to have their combustion influenced by the dryness of the
oxygen.   Some chemical union was found to take place, the extent
 of which varied with the dryness of the substances.                   In no case,
 however, did   it  manifest itself by flame. Ordinary phosphorus was
 obtained so pure as not to glow in the oxygen dried by phosphorus
pentoxide, though the pressure was increased and diminished in every
 possible way.    If water was added rapid combustion at once set in.
   The elements — selenium, tellurium, arsenic, and antimony — were
purified with as much care as was expended on the elements men
tioned above.      Their combustion was, however, not found to be
affected in any way by the dryness of the gas.
   In the course of the investigation two facts were discovered about
the combustion (i) of amorphous phosphorus, and (ii) of charcoal
                   :
 in oxygen.     Amorphous phosphorus            isgenerally regarded as being
incapable of true combustion.        It    is asserted that before amorphous
phosphorus    can   be  heated   to   its   kindling      point, it   changes into
ordinary phosphorus, which then burns.               This has been proved not
to be the case. Amorphous phosphorus was heated in a current of
nitrogen, free from traces of oxygen, to 260°, 278°, and 300°, in three
experiments, without undergoing any change to the ordinary modifi
cation. If moist oxygen was substituted for the nitrogen combustion
took place at 260°.      It seems, therefore, probable that amorphous
phosphorus undergoes a true combustion in oxygen without previous
change to the ordinary modification.
   With regard to the combustion of carbon,                it  has always been     a
doubtful question which of the two oxides             is first formed.    Is carbon
monoxide the first product, undergoing fnrther oxidation to the
dioxide, or   is carbon dioxide the first and only substance formed                ?
The problem seems incapable of direct solution.                    It is, however,
open to indirect attack.       When carbon            isheated in a current of
oxygen dried for a short time by phosphorus pentoxide, a slow com
bustion goes on, and, though the oxygen               in excess, both oxides are
                                                     is
produced.     The amount of monoxide, however,              is   twenty times the
amount    of the  dioxide.    Experiments       also   show     that this occurs at
temperatures at which dry carbon dioxide              is not reduced by carbon.
The carbon monoxide must, therefore, be produced by the direct
uuion of its elements, its further oxidation being prevented by the
dryness of the gases.      Confirmatory experiments were performed in
which carbon monoxide was found to be produced by the slow com
bustion of carbon in air at 440c, temperature too low for the reduc
                                       a
tion of the dioxide by carbon.            It    isprobable that the ordinary
combustion   of  carbou  goes  on  in   two   stages,   that carbon monoxide       is

      Mr.Lockjer writes in his interesting paper on Meteorites* as
 follows : —
    "
      The brighter lines in spiral nebulae, and in those in which a
 rotation has been set up, are in all probability due to streams of
 meteorites with irregular  motions out of the main streams, in which
 the collisiuns would be almost nil. It has already been suggested by
 Professor G. Darwin (' Nature,' vol. 31, p. 25) — using the gaseous
 hypothesis — that in such nebulae 'the great mass of the gas is non-
Inminous,             the luminosity being an evidence of condensation                              along
lines of low velocity according to a well-known hydrodynamical law.
From this point of view the visible nebula may be regarded as a
luminous diagram of its own stream-lines.'"
  The whole of Mr. Lockyer's paper, and especially this passage in
it,leads me to make a suggestion for the reconciliation of two
 apparently divergent theories of the origin of planetary systems.
   The nebular hypothesis depends essentially on the idea that the
 primitive nebula       a rotating mass of fluid, which at successive
                              is
epochs becomes     unstable  from excess of rotation, and sheds a ring
from the equatorial region.
   The researches of Rochef (apparently but little known in this
conntry) have imparted to this theory      precision which was wanting
                                                         a
in Laplace's original exposition, and have rendered the explanation of
the origin of the planets more perfect.
   But notwithstanding the high probability that some theory of the
kind      true, the acceptance of the nebular hypothesis presents great
           is
difficulties.
   Sir William Thomson long ago expressed to me his opinion that
the most probable origin of the planets was through             gradual                   a
accretion of meteoric matter, and the researches of Mr. Lockyer
afford actual evidence in favour of the abundancy of meteorites in
space.

     But the very essence of the nebular hypothesis is the conception
 of fluid pressure, since without it the idea of a figure of equilibrium
 becomes inapplicable.       Now, at first sight, the meteoric condition of
 matter seems absolutely inconsistent with a fluid pressure exercised
 by one part of the system on another. We thus seem driven either
 to the absolute rejection of the nebular hypothesis, or to deny that
 the meteoric condition was the immediate antecedent of the sun and
 planets.    M. Faye has taken the former course, and accepts as a
 necessary consequence the formulation of a succession of events quite
 different from that of the nebular hypothesis.* I cannot myself find
 that his theory is an improvement on that of Laplace, except in regard
 to the adoption of meteorites, for he has lost the conception of the
 figure of equilibrium of a rotating mass of fluid.
     The object of this paper is to point out that by a certain interpre
 tation of the meteoric theory we may obtain a reconciliation of these
 two orders of ideas, and may hold that the origin of stellar and
 planetary systems is meteoric, whilst retaining the conception of fluid
 pressure.
     According to the kinetic theory of gases fluid pressure is the
 average result of the impacts of molecules.            If we imagine the mole
 cules magnified until of the size of meteorites, their impacts will still,
on a coarser scale, give a quasi-fluid pressure.             I suggest then that
the fluid pressure essential to the nebular hypothesis is in fact the
resultant of countless impacts of meteorites.
    The problems of hydrodynamics could hardly be attacked with
success, if we were forced to start from the beginning and to consider
the cannonade of molecules.         But when once satisfied that the kinetic
theory will give us a gas, which, in a space containing some millions
of molecules, obeys all the laws of an ideal non-molecular gas filling
all space, we may pnt the molecules out of sight and treat the gas
as a plenum.
    In tho same way the difficulty of tracing the impacts of meteorites
in detail is insuperable, but if we can find that such impacts give rise
to a quasi-fluid pressure on a large scale, we may be able to trace ont
many resnlts by treating an ideal plenum.                   Laplace's hypothesis
implies such a plenum, and it is here maintained that this plenum is
merely the idealisation of the impacts of meteorites.
    As a bare suggestion this view is worth but little, for its acceptance
or rejection must turn entirely on numerical values, which can only
bs obtained by the consideration of some actual system.               It is obvious
that the solar system is the only one about which we have sufficient
knowledge to afford a basis for discussion.           The paper, of which this
is an abstract, is accordingly devoted to a consideration of the

    mechanics   of a swarm of meteorites, with special numerical applica
    tion to the  solar system.
       When two meteoric stones meet with planetary velocity, the stress
    between them during impact must generally be such that the limits
    of trne elasticity are exceeded, and it may be urged that a kinetic
    theory is inapplicable unless the colliding particles are highly elastic.
    It may, however, 1 think, be shown that the very greatness of the
    velocities will impart what virtually amounts to an elasticity of a high
    urder of perfection.
       It appears, a priori, probable that when two meteorites clash, a
   portion of the solid matter of each is volatilised, and Mr. Lockycr
   considers the spectroscopic evidence conclusive that it is so.        There
   is no doubt enough      energy liberated on impact to volatilise the whole
   of both bodies,    but only a small portion of each stone will undergo
   this change.     A numerical example is given in the paper to show the
  enormous amount of energy with which we are dealing.                 It must
  necessarily be obscure as to how a small mass of solid matter can take
  up a very large amount of energy in a small fraction of a second, but
  spectroscopic evidence seems to show that it does so ; and if so, we
  have what is virtually a violent explosive introduced between the two
  stones.
      In  a  direct collision each stone is probably shattered into frag
 ments, like the splashes of lead when a bullet hits an iron target.
  But direct collision must be a comparatively rare event.         In glancing
 collisions the velocity of neither body is wholly arrested, the con
 centration of energy is not so enormous (although probably still
 sufficient to effect volatilisation), and since the stones rub past one
 another, more time is allowed for the matter round the point of
 contact to take up the energy ; thus the whole process of collision is
 much more intelligible.          The nearest terrestrial analogy is when a
 cannon-ball rebounds from the sea. In glancing collisions fracture
 will probably not be very frequent.
     From these arguments it is probable that, when two meteorites
 meet, they attain an effective elasticity of a high order of perfection ;
 but there is of course some loss of energy at each collision.
     [It must, however, be admitted that on collision the deflection of
path is rarely a very large angle ; but a succession of glancing colli
sions would be capable of reversing the path, and thus the kinetic
theory of meteorites may be taken as not differing materially from
that of gases.*]
     Perhaps the most serious difficulty in the whole theory arises from
the fractures which must often occur.            If they happen with great
freqnency, it wonld seem as if the whole swarm of meteorites would
degrade into dust.         We know, however, that meteorites of consider-

 able   size   fall npon    the earth, and, unless Mr. Lockyer has mis
 interpreted    the  spectroscopic evidence, the nebulae do now consist of
 meteorites.      Hence it would seem as if fracture was not of very
 frequent occurrence.        It is easy to see that if two bodies meet with a
 given velocity the chance of fracture is much greater if they are large,
 and it is possible that the process of breaking up will go on only until
  a certain size, dependent on the velocity of agitation, is reached, and
  will then become comparatively unimportant.
      When the volatilised gases cool they will condense into a metallic
 rain, and this may fuse with old meteorites whose surfaces are molten.
 A meteorite in that condition will certainly also pick up dust. Thus
 there are processes in action tending to counteract subdivision by
 fracture and volatilisation.         The mean size of meteorites probably
 depends    on  the balance between these opposite tendencies.       If this is
 so, there will be some fractures, and some fusions, but the mean mass
 will change very slowly with the mean kinetic energy of agitation.
 This view is at any rate adopted in the paper as a working hypothesis.
 It was not, however, possible to take account of fracture and fusion in
 the mathematical investigation, but the meteorites are treated as
 being of invariable mass.
     The velocity with which the meteorites move is derived from their
fall from a great distance towards a centre of aggregation.          In other
 words, the potential energy of their mutual attraction when widely
 dispersed becomes converted, at least partially, into kinetic energy.
 When the condensation of a swarm is just beginning, the mass of the
aggregation towards which the meteorites fall is small, and thus the
 new bodies arrive at the aggregation with small velocity.              Hence
initially  the   kinetic  energy is    small, and  the  volume  of the sphere
within which hydrostatic ideas are (if anywhere) applicable is also
small. As more and more meteorites fall in, that volume is enlarged,
and the velocity with which they reach the aggregation is increased.
Finally the supply of meteorites in that part of space begins to fail,
and the imperfect elasticity of the colliding bodies brings about a
gradual contraction of the swarm.           I do not now attempt to trace the
whole history of a swarm, but the object of the paper is to examine
its mechanical condition at an epoch when the supply of meteorites

tribution of meteorites in space have arranged themselves into a
sub-permanent       condition, onty affected by secular changes.          This
examination will enable us to understand, at least roughly, the secular
change as the swarin contracts, and will throw light on other
questions.
     The foundation for the mathematical investigation in the paper is
the hypothesis that a number of meteorites which were ultimately to
coalesce, so as to form the sun and planets, have fallen together from

   a condition   of wide dispersion, and form a swarm in which collisions
  are frequent.
     For the sake of simplicity, the bodies are treated as spherical, and
  in the first instance as being of uniform size.
     It is assumed provisionally that the kinetic theory of gases may be
  applied for the determination of the distribution of the meteorites in
 space.     No account being taken of the rotation of the system, the
 meteorites will be arranged in concentric spherical layers of equal
  density of distribution, and the quasi- gas, whose molecules                 are
 meteorites, being compressible,        the   density  will  be  greater  towards
 the centre of the swarm.           The elasticity of a gas depends on the
 kinetic energy of agitation of its molecules, and therefore in order to
 determine the law of density in the swarm we must know the dis
 tribution of kinetic energy of agitation.
     It is assumed that when the system comes under our notice,
 uniformity of distribution of energy has been attained throughout
 a central sphere, which is surrounded by a layer of meteorites with
 that distribution of kinetic energy which, in a gas, corresponds to
 convective equilibrium, and with continuity of density and velocity of
 agitation at the sphere of separation.         Since in a gas in convective
 equilibrium the law connecting pressure and density is that which
 holds when the gas is contained in a vessel impermeable to heat, such
an arrangement of gas has been called by M. Hitter* an isothermal-
 adiabatic sphere, and the same term is adopted here as applicable to a
 swarm of meteorites.         The justifiability of these assumptions will be
considered later.
     The first problem which presents itself then is the equilibrium of
an isothermal sphere of gas under its own gravitation. The law of
density is determined in the paper, but it will here suffice to remark
that, if a given mass be enclosed in an envelope of given radius, there
is a minimum temperature (or energy of agitation) at which iso
thermal equilibrium is possible.           The minimum energy of agitation
is found to be such that the mean square of velocity of the meteorites
is almost exactly      f of the square of the velocity of a satellite grazing
tlie surface of the sphere in a circular orbit.
     As indicated above, it is supposed that in the meteor-swarm the rigid
envelope, bounding the isothermal sphere, is replaced by a layer or
atmosphere in convective equilibrium.              The law of density in the
adiabatic layer is determined in the paper, and it appears that when
the isothermal sphere has minimum temperature, the mass of the
adiabatic atmosphere is a minimum relatively to that of the isothermal
sphere.      Numerical calculation shows, in fact, that the isothermal
sphere cannot amount in mass to more than 46 per cent. of the mass
of the whole isothermal-adiabatic sphere, and that the limit of the

 adiabatic atmosphere is at a distance eqaal to 2*786 times the radios
 of the isothermal sphere.*
     It is also proved that the total energy, existing in the form of
  energy of agitation, is exactly one-half of the potential energy lost in
  the concentration of the matter from a condition of infinite dispersion.
  This result is brought about by a continual transfer of energy from a
 molar to a molecular form, for a portion of the kinetic energy of a
 meteorite is constantly being transferred into the form of thermal
 energy in the volatilised gases generated on collision.                 The thermal
 energy    is then   lost  by radiation.
     It is impossible as yet to sum up all the considerations which go to
justify the assumption of the isothermal-adiabatic arrangement, but it
 is clear that uniformity of kinetic energy must be principally brought
about by a process of diffusion.           It is therefore interesting to consider
  what amount of inequality in the kinetic energy would have to be
smoothed away.
     The    arrangement of density in the isothermal-adiabatic sphere
being given, it is easy to compute what the kinetic energy would be
at any part of the swarm, if each meteorite fell from infinity to the
 neighbourhood where we find it, and there retained all the velocity
due to such fall.         The variation of the square of this velocity gives
an indication of the amount of kinetic energy which has to be
degraded by conversion into heat and distributed by diffusion, in the
attaiument of uniformity.            This may be called " the theoretical value
of the kinetic energy." It appears that in the swarm, this square of
velocity rises from zero at the centre of the swarm to a maximum,
which is attained nearly half-way through the adiabatic layer, and
then diminishes. It is found that the variations of this theoretical
value are inconsiderable throughout the greater part of the range.
                                                                    "
Since this " theoretical value of the kinetic energy                  is zero at the
centre, there must be diffusion of kinetic energy from without
inwards, and considerations of the same kind show that when a
planet consolidates there must be a cooling of the middle strata both
outwards and inwards.
     We must now consider the nature of the criterion which determines
whether the hydrostatic treatment of a meteor-swarm is permissible.
     The hydrodynamical treatment of an ideal plenum of gas leads to
the same result as the kinetic theory with regard to any phenomenon
involving purely a mass, when that mass is a large multiple of the
mass of a molecule ; to any phenomenon involving purely a length,
when the cube of that length contains a large number of molecules ;
and to any phenomenon involving purely a time, when that time is a
large multiple of the mean interval between collisions.                   Again, any

 velocity to be justly deduced from hydrodynamical principles must be
 expressible as the edge of a cube containing many molecules passed
 over in a time containing many collisions of a single molecule ; and
 a  similar statement must hold of any other function of mass, lengtb,
 and time.
    Beyond these limits we must go back to the kinetic theory itself,
 and in using it care must be taken that enough molecules are con
 sidered at once to impart statistical constancy to their properties.
    There are limits then to the hydrodynamical treatment of gases,
 and the like must hold of the parallel treatment of meteorites.
    The principal question involved in the nebular hypothesis seems to
 be the stability of a rotating mass of gas ; but unfortunately this has
remained up to now an untouched field of mathematical           research.
We can only judge of probable results from the investigations
which have been made concerning the stability of a rotating mass
of liquid.    Now it appears that the instability of a rotating mass
of liquid first enters through the graver modes of gravitational
oscillation. In the case of a rotating spheroid of revolution the gravest
mode of oscillation is an elliptic deformation, and its period does not
differ much from that of a satellite which revolves round the spheroid
so as to graze its surface.      Hence, assuming for the moment that a
kinetic theory of liquids had been formulated, we should not be
justified in applying the hydrodynamical method to this discussion of
stability, unless the periodic time of such a satellite were a large
multiple of the analogue of the mean free time of a molecule of
liquid.
    Carrying then this conclusion on to the kinetic theory of meteorites,
it seems probable that hydrodynamical treatment must be inapplicable
for the discussion of such a theory as the moteoric-nebular hypo
thesis, unless a similar relation holds good.
    These considerations, although of a vague character, will afford a
criterion of the applicability of hydrodynamics to the kind of pro
blem suggested by the nebular hypothesis.           And certain criteria
suggested by this line of thought are found in the paper ; they give a
measure of the degree of curvature of the average path pursued by a
meteorite between two collisions.
   After these preliminary investigations, we have to consider what
kind of meeting of two meteorites will amount to an " encounter
                                                                         "
within the meaning of the kinetic theory.
   Is it possible, in fact, that two meteorites can considerably bend
their paths under the influence of gravitation, when they pass near
one another ? This question is considered in the paper, and it is shown
that unless the bodies have the dimensions of small planets, the
mutual gravitational influence is insensible.    Hence, nothing short of
absolute impact is to be considered an encounter in the kinetic theory,

and what is called the radius of   " the sphere of action " is simply  the
distance between the centres of a pair when they graze, and is there
fore the sum of the radii of a pair, or, if of uniform size, the diameter
of one of them.
    The next point to consider is the mass and size which must be
attributed to the meteorites.
    The few samples which have been found on the earth prove that no
great error can be committed if the average density of a meteorite be
token as a little less than that of iron, and I accordingly suppose their
density to be six times that of water.
    Undoubtedly in a meteor-swarm all sizes co-exiBt (a supposition
considered hereafter) ; for even if originally of unilorm size they
would, by subsequent fracture, be rendered diverse.        But in the first
consideration of the problem they have been treated as of uniform
size, and as actual sizes are nearly unknown, results are given for
meteorites weighing 3fe grams.         From these, the values for other
masses are easily derivable.
    It is known that meteorites are actually of irregular and angular
shapes, but certainly no material error can be incurred when we treat
them as being spheres.
    The object of all these investigations is to apply the formulae to a
concrete example.       The mass of the system is therefore taken as
equal to that of the sun, and the limit of the swarm at any arbitrary
distance from the present sun's centre.      The theory is of course more
severely tested the wider the dispersion of the swarm, and accordingly
in a numerical example the outside limit of the solar swarm is taken
at 44-| times the earth's distance from the sun, or further beyond the
planet Neptune than Saturn is from the sun.              This assumption
makes the limit of the isothermal sphere at a distance 10, about half
way between Saturn and Uranus.
    In this case the mean velocity of the meteorites in the isothermal
sphere is       kilometers per second, being </\ of the linear velocity of
a planet revolving about a central body with a mass equal to 46 per
cent. of that of the sun, at distance 16.        In the adiabatic layer it
diminishes to zero at distance 44£. This velocity is independent of
the size of the meteorites.      The mean free path between collisions
ranges from 42,000 kilometers at the centre, to 1,300,000 kilometers
at radius 16, and to infinity at radius 44^.          The mean interval
between collisions ranges from a tenth of a day at the centre, to three
days at radius 16, and to infinity at radius 44^. The criterion of appli
cability of hydrodynamics ranges from -g^so at the distance of the
asteriods to -jtjVo a* radius 16, and to infinity at radius 44^.
    All these quantities are ten times as great for meteorites of
3^
     kilos., and a hundred times as great for meteorites of 3£ tonnes.
    From a consideration of the tables in the paper it appears that,

                                                                         11
  with meteorites of 3^ kilos., the collisions are sufficiently frequent
  even  beyond the orbit of Neptune to allow the kinetic theory to be
  applicable in the sense explained.       But if the meteorites weigh
  3^  tonnes, the criterion ceases to be very small at about distance 24,
 and if they weigh 3125 tonnes they cease to be very small at about
  the orbit of Jupiter.     It may be concluded then that, as far 'as
 frequency of collision is concerned, the hydrodynamical treatment of
 a swarm of meteorites is justifiable.
    Although the numerical results are necessarily affected by the con
 jectural values of the mass and density of the meteorites, yet it was
 impossible to arrive at any conclusion whatever as to the validity of
 the theory without numerical values, and such a discussion as the
 above was therefore necessary.
    I now pass on to consider some results of this view of a swarm
 of meteorites, and to consider the justifiability of the assumption of
 an isothermal-adiabatic arrangement of density.
    With regard to the uniformity of distribution of kinetic energy in
the isothermal sphere, it is important to ask whether or not sufficient
time can have elapsed in the history of the system to allow of the
equalisation by diffusion.
    It is shown therefore in the paper that in the case of the numerical
example primitive inequalities of kinetic energy would, in a few
thousand years, be sensibly equalised over a distance some ten times
as great as our distance from the sun.      This result then goes to show
that we are justified in assuming an isothermal sphere as the centre
of the swarm.      As, however, the swarm contracts the rate of diffusion
diminishes as the inverse |- power of its linear dimensions, whilst the
rate of generation of inequalities of distribution of kinetic energy,
through the imperfect elasticity of the meteorites, increases.      Hence,
in a late stage of the swarm, inequalities of kinetic energy would be
set up, there would be a tendency to the production of convective
currents, and thus the whole swarm would probably settle down to
the condition of convective equilibrium throughout.
    It may be conjectured then that the best hypothesis in the early stages
of the swarm is the isothermal-adiabatic arrangement, and later an
adiabatic sphere. It has not seemed worthwhile to discuss this latter
hypothesis in detail at present.
    The same investigation also gives the coefficient of viscosity of the
quasi-gas,    and shows that it is so great that the meteor-swarm
must, if rotating, revolve nearly without relative motion of its parts,
other than the motion of agitation. But as the viscosity diminishes
when the swarm contracts, this would probably not be true in the
later stages of its history, and the central portion would probably
rotate more rapidly than the outside.      It forms, however, no part of
the scope of this paper to consider the rotation of the system.

12               Prof. G. H. Darwin.      On  the  Mechanical      [Nov. 15,
   The rate of loss of kinetic energy through imperfect elasticity is
next considered, and it appears that the rate, estimated per unit time
and volume, must vary directly as the square of the quasi-pressui e,
and inversely as the mean velocity of agitation.           Since the kinetic
energy   lost is taken up in volatilising solid  matter,  it follows that the
heat generated must follow the same law.          The mean temperature of
the gases generated in any part of the swarm depends on a great
variety of circumstances, but it seems probable that its variation
would be according to some law of the same kind. Thus, if the spec
troscope enables us to form an idea of the temperature iu various parts
of a nebula, we shall at the same time obtain some idea of the distri
bution of density.
   It has been assumed that the outer portion of the swarm is in con-
vective equilibrium, and therefore there is a definite limit beyond
which it cannot extend.      Now a medium can only be said to be in
convective equilibrium when it obeys the laws of gases, and the
applicability of those laws depends on the frequency of collisions.
But at the boundary of the adiabatic layer the velocity of agitation
vanishes, and collisions become infinitely rare.         These two proposi
tions are mutually destructive of one another, and it is impossible to
push the conception of convective equilibrium to its logical conclusion.
There must, in fact, be some degree of rarity of density and of
collisions at which the statistical treatment of the medium breaks
down.
   I have sought to obtain some representation of the state of things
by supposing that collisions never occur beyond a certain distance from
the centre of the swarm.
   Then from every point of the surface of the sphere, which limits
the region of collisions, a fountain of meteorites is shot out, in all
azimuths and at all inclinations to the vertical, and with velocities
grouped about a mean according to the law of error.                    These
meteorites ascend to various heights, without collision, and, in falling
back on to the limiting sphere, cannonade its surface, so as to counter
balance the hydrostatic pressure at the limiting sphere.
   The distribution in space of the meteorites thus shot out is investi
gated in the paper, and it is fonnd that near the limiting sphere the
decrease in density is somewhat more rapid than the decrease corre
sponding to convective equilibrium.
   But at more remote distances the decrease is less rapid, and the
density ultimately tends to vary inversely as the square of the dis
tance from the centre.
   It is clear that according to this hypothesis the mass of the system
is infinite in a mathematical sense ; for the existence of meteorites
with nearly parabolic and hyperbolic orbits necessitates an infinite
number, if the loss of the system shall be made good by the supply.

  1888.]           Conditions   of  a  Swarm    cf  Meteorites,     cf-c.
     But if we consider the subject from          a  physical point of view, this
 conclusion appears unobjectionable.* The ejection of molecules with
 exceptionally high velocities from the surface of a liquid is called
 evaporation, and the absorption of others is called condensation.                The
 general history of a swarm, as sketched at the beginning, may then be
 put in different words, for we may say that at first a swarm gains by
 condensation, that condensation and evaporation balance, and finally
 that evaporation gains the day.
     If the hypothesis of convective equilibrium be pushed to its logical
 conclusion, we reach a definite limit to the swarm, whereas if collisions
 be entirely annulled the density goes on decreasing inversely as the
 square of the distance.       The truth must clearly lie between these two
 hypotheses.      It is thus certain that even the small amount of evapora
 tion, shown by the formulae derived from the hypothesis of no colli
 sion, must be in excess of the truth ; and it may be that there are
 enough waifs and strays in space ejected from other systems to make
 good loss. Whether or not the compensation is perfect, a swarm of
 meteorites would pursue its evolution without being sensibly affected
 by a slow evaporation.
     Up to this point the meteorites have been considered as of uniform
size, but it will be well to examine the more truthful hypothesis that
they are of all sizes, grouped about a mean according to a law of
error.
     It appears, from the investigation in the paper, that the larger
stones move slower, the smaller ones faster, and the law is that the
 mean kinetic energy is the same for all sizes.               It is proved that the
mean path between collisions is shorter in the proportion of 7 to 11,
and the mean frequency of collision greater in the proportion of 4 to 3,
than if the meteorites were of uniform mass equal to the mean. Hence
the numerical results found for meteorites of uniform size are applic
able to non-nniform meteorites of a mean mass about a quarter greater
than the uniform mass ; for example, the results for uniform meteo
rites of 3£ tonnes apply to non-uniform ones of mean mass a little
over 4 tonnes.
    The means here spoken of refer to all sizes grouped together, but
there is a separate mean free path and mean frequency appropriate to
each size.      These are investigated in the paper, and their values
illustrated in a figure.       It appears that collisions become infinitely
frequent for the infinitely small ones, because of their infinite velocity,
and again infinitely frequent for the infinitely large ones, because of
their infinite size. There is a minimum frequency of collision for a

 certain size, a little less in radius than the mean radios, and consider
 ably less in mass than the mean mass.
     For infinitely small meteorites the mean free path reaches a finite
 limit, eqnal to about four times the grand mean free path ; and for
 infinitely large ones, the mean free path becomes infinitely short.        It
 must be borne in mind that there are infinitely few of the infinitely
 large and infinitely small meteorites.      Variety of size does not then,
 so far, materially affect the results.
     But a difference arises when we come to consider the different parts
 of the swarm.      The larger meteorites, moving with smaller velocities,
 form a quasi-gas of less elasticity than do the smaller ones. Hence
 the larger meteorites are more condensed towards the centre than are
 the smaller ones, or the large ones have a tendency to fall down,
 whilst the small ones have a tendency to rise. Accordingly, the
 various kinds are to some extent sorted according to size.
     An investigation is made in the paper of the mean mass of meteo
 rites at various distances from the centre, both inside and outside of
 the isothermal sphere, and a figure illustrates the law of diminution
 of mean mass.
    It is also clear that the loss of the system through evaporation must
 fall more heavily on the small meteorites than on the large ones.
     After the foregoing summary, it will be well to briefly recapitulate the
 principal physical conclusions which seem to be legitimately deducible
 from the whole investigation ; in this recapitulation qualifications
 must necessarily be omitted or stated with great brevity.
    When two meteorites are in collision, they are virtually highly
 elastic, although ordinary elasticity must b*s nearly inoperative.
     A swarm of meteorites is analogous with a gas, and the laws
governing gases may be applied to the discussion of its mechanical
properties.      This is true of the swarm, from which the sun was
 formed, when it extended beyond the orbit of the planet Neptune.
    When the swarm was very widely dispersed the arrangement of
density and of velocity of agitation of the meteorites was that of an
isothermal-adiabatic sphere.        Later in its history, when the swarm
had contracted, it was probably throughout in convective equilibrium.
    The actual mean velocity of the meteorites is determinable in a
swarm of given mass, when expanded to a given extent.
    The total energy of agitation in an isothermal-adiabatic sphere is
half the potential energy lost in the concentration from a condition of
infinite dispersion.
    The half of the potential energy lost, which does not reappear as
kinetic energy of agitation, is expended in volatilising solid matter,
and heating the gases produced on the impact of meteorites.              The
heat so generated is gradually lost by radiation.
    The amount of heat generated per unit time and volume varies as

1888.]           Conditions of a Sicarin of   Meteorites,  fyc.           15
the square of the quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and inversely as the mean
velocity of agitation. The temperature of the gases volatilised pro
bably varies by some law of the same nature.
   The path of a meteorite is approximately straight, except when
abruptly deflected by a collision with another.       This ceases to be true
at the outskirts of the swarm, where the collisions have become rare.
The meteorites here describe orbits under gravity which are approxi
mately elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic.
    In this fringe to the swarm the distribution of density ceases to be
that of a gas under gravity ; and as we recede from the centre the
density at first decreases more rapidly, and afterwards less rapid 'y
than if the medium were a gas.
    Throughout all the stages of its history there is a sort of evapora
tion by which the swarm very slowly loses in mass, but this loss is
more or less counterbalanced by condensation.          In the early stages
the gain by condensation outhalances the loss by evaporation, they
then equilibrate, and finally the evaporation may be greater than
condensation.
    Throughout the swarm the meteorites are to some extent sorted
 according to size ; as we recede from the centre the number of small
ones preponderates more and more, and thus the mean mass con
tinually diminishes with increasing distance. The loss by evaporation
 falls principally on the small meteorites.
    A meteor swarm is subject to gaseous viscosity, which is greater
the more widely diffused is the swarm.           In consequence of this a
widely extended swarm, if in rotation, will revolve like a rigid body
 without relative motion (other than agitation) of its parts.
    Later in the history the viscosity will probably not suffice to secure
 uniformity of rotation, and the central portion will revolve more
 rapidly than the outside.
    [The kinetic theory of meteorites may be held to present a fair
 approximation to the truth in the earlier stages of the evolution of the
 system.    But later the majority of the meteors must have been
 absorbed by the central sun and its attendant planets, and amongst
 the meteors which remain free the relative motion of agitation must
 have been largely diminished.      These free meteorites — the dust and
 refuse of the system — probably move in clouds, but with so little
 remaining motion of agitation that (except perhaps near the peri
 helion of very eccentric orbits) it would scarcely be permissible to
 treat the cloud as in any respect possessing the mechanical properties
 of a gas.]*
    The value of this whole investigation will appear very different to
 different minds.     To some it will stand condemned as altogether too
 speculative, others may think that it is better to risk error in the

       Cambridge. Received August 17, 1888.
                                  (Abstract.)
    Heidenhain has shown that when saliva is obtained by stimulating
  -ie chorda tympani, the percentage of salts in the saliva depends upon
      rate ot secretion, so that the faster the secretion the higher the
 percentage of salts is up to a limit of abont 0-6 per cent. Werther has
 come to the same conclusion, but finds that the percentage of salts
 may be as much as 077.        Both in Heidenhain's and in Werther's ex
 periments there are many exceptions to this rule, attributed by them
 to variations in the rate of secretion of saliva during the time of
 collecting any one sample.
    We have repeated, with some modifications, the experiments of
 Heidenhain, paying especial attention to the rate of secretion of saliva,
and find in 10 out of 11 cases, that his law of an increase in the per
 centage of salts with an increase in the rate of secretion holds.
 The single exception may be due to a modification of the blood-flow
through the gland during the time of collecting the saliva.            Tho
slowly secreted saliva contains a low percentage of salts, whether it is
produced by a weak nerve stimulus, or by a very strong nerve
stimulus which lowers the irritability of the nerve-fibres.
    We do not find any rate of secretion, beyond which an increase in
rate fails to increase the percentage of salts in the saliva.   The incre
ment in the percentage of salts decreases, however, with each equal
successive increment in the rate of secretion.
    As a rule in saliva obtained by injecting pilocarpin, the percentage
of salts follows Heidenhain's law ; we take the exceptions to be due to
the action of pilocarpin upon the circulation, the blood-flow through
the gland being less than normally accompanies the degree of stimula
tion of the gland cells.
    The percentage of salts in saliva obtained by stimulating the sym
pathetic is higher than corresponds to its rate of secretion, the saliva
obtained by stimulating the chorda being taken as a basis of com
parison ; this sympathetic saliva may be secreted at T^th of the rale

  of chorda saliva, and   jet  contain  very nearly as high a percentage of
  salts.
     Dyspnoea decreases the rate of secretion of saliva with a given
  stimulus, and if not too prolonged, increases the percentage of salts,
  and tends to increase the percentage of organic substance in the saliva.
  This holds whether the saliva be obtained by stimulating the chorda
 tympani, or by injecting pilocarpin.       Dyspnoea has, for a short time,
 an after-action, tending also to increase the percentage of salts, and
  possibly that of organic substance.
     Clamping the carotid during secretion has the same general effect
 as dyspnoea, but it causes a still more marked increase in the per
 centage  of salts. Its after-effect is also much greater, and lasts longer.
    Bleeding has a similar effect to dyspnoea and to clamping the
 carotid, but its most marked effect is an increase in the percentage of
 organic substance.
    Injection of dilute salt solution, NaCl, 02 to 0'6 per cent., in sufficie-n
 quantity, considerably increases the rate of secretion of saliva; in.
 percentage of salts in the saliva decreases, although the rate of
 secretion of salts usually increases ; the percentage of organic sub
 stance decreases ; that is, increasing the volume of the blood with
 dilute salt solution chiefly increases the rate of secretion of water.
    The percentage of salts in samples of saliva obtained after the
 injection of dilute salt solution, increases with the rate of secretion, it
 is only when these are obtained before the injection that a discrepancy
 in the normal relation between percentage of salts and rate of secre
 tion of water appears.
    Injection of sodium carbonate 2 per cent. also increases the rate of
 secretion of saliva ; in this case the percentage of salts is about normal,
 the percentage of organic substance falls slightly only, i.e., the irrita
 bility either of the nerve-fibres or of the gland cells is increased.
    Injection of considerable doses of potassium iodide, 1 per cent., after
 the sodium carbonate still allows a rapid secretion, but the percentage
 of salts falls.
    Injection of strong salt solution increases the percentage of salts in
 saliva, this is in accordance with the recent observations           of Novi
that the chlorine in the salts of saliva is increased for a given rate of
Becretion by increasing the percentage of sodium chloride in the blood.
We find, however, that in the case of an injection of strong salt solution
into the blood which leaves the secretory power of the gland un
affected, the increase in the percentage of salts is much greater with
slowly than with rapidly secreted saliva, and that when the secretory
power of the gland is affected by strong salt solution, an increase in
the percentage of organic substance also takes place ; this and a part
of the increase in the percentage of salts we attribute to a decrease of
the blood- flow through the gland.

   Saliva produced by stimulating the chorda tympani, or by injecting
pilocarpin, after a small dose of atropin has been given, contains a
low percentage of organic substance and of salts.
   We, like Werther, find that sub-lingual saliva has a considerably
higher percentage of salts than sub-maxillary saliva.
   If lithium citrate, potassium iodide, potassium ferrocyanide, and
pilocarpin are injected into the blood, lithium can be detected in the
first drops of saliva secreted, potassium iodide after the first six drops ;
potassium ferrocyanide cannot be detected at any stage of secretion.
   The general result of these experiments is to show that the secre
tion of water, of salts, and of organic substance are differently
affected by different conditions, and that the percentage composition
of saliva is determined by the strength of the stimulus, by the
character of the blood, and by the amount of blood supplied to the
gland.
   All or nearly all the arguments which have been adduced to prove
that the secretion of organic substance is governed by special nerve-
fibres, have their counterparts with regard to the secretion of salte,
so that we might imagine at least three kinds of secretory fibres to be
present.   The experiments, on the whole, indicate that this compli
cated arrangement does not exist, but that the stimulation of a single
kind of nerve-fibre produces varying effects according to the varying
conditions of the gland cells.
IV. "    Observations  upon the Electromotive Changes in the
       Mammalian Spinal Cord following Electrical Excitation of
       the Cortex Cerebri.    Preliminary Notice."   By FRANCIS
       Gotch, Hon. M.A. Oxon, B.A., B.Sc. Lond., and Victob
       HORSLEY, B.S., F.R.S., Professor of Pathology, University
       College, London.   (From the Physiological Laboratory of
       the University of Oxford.)   Received August 27, 1888.

     Hitherto pathologists have attempted the analysis of the epileptic
convulsion by the graphic method, that          is,
                                              by recording the spasmodic
contractions of the muscles involved. Recent investigations of this
kind have shown that the excitation of the cortex cerebri, whether by
electrical or chemical means, or by the presence of certain patho
logical states, neoplasms, inflammation, &c.,     invariably followed in
                                                      is
the higher mammals by a definite and characteristic sequence of
movements in the muscles.      It is, however, obvious that such investi
gations have up to the present succeeded in determining the characters
of the neural disturbance only when this has reached the peripheral

 1888.]          The Spinal Cord and the Cortex Cerebri.                19
terminations of the efferent nerves.         Now since the excitatory pro
cesses originating in the cortex are conducted by the efferent channels
in the spinal cord, presumably the pyramidal tracts, the problem of
their relationship to the centres of the bulbo-spinal system cannot be
determined by experiments which record the mechanical changes in
the muscles.     In order to ascertain what share respectively the centres
in the cortex and those in the spinal cord have in the production of
the characteristic epileptic sequence, the action of the latter mnst be
eliminated. This can be done by investigating the nature of the
excitatory processes in the cord when the efferent channels in the
dorsal region for the lower limbs are made the subject for observa
tion.
    For this purpose we determined to obtain, if possible, evidence as
to the nature of the excitatory processes of the epileptic convulsion in
the spinal cord, as shown by "tapping" the cord and noting the
electromotive changes which, as is well known, accompany functional
activity in nerves. The results we have already obtained are so
harmonious and demonstrative, that we venture to make this prelimi-
nary communication, reserving full details for a subsequent account.
Past I.   The Electromotive    Change following a Single Excitation  of the
                             Mammalian Nerve.
    Our first experiments were made for the purpose of ascertaining to
what extent we could detect an electromotive change following a single
excitation of a mammalian nerve.           Since the discovery by du Bois-
Reymond of the fact that the excitatory process in nerve is accom
panied by an electromotive change, the characters and time relations
of this change have been investigated by various observers, notably
by Bernstein, Hermann, Hering, and Head.             The general result of
their observations is to show that the change following a single stimu
lus is of very short duration, so short that the galvanometer gives
little evidence of its presence, and the observers referred to were
compelled to adopt the device first employed by Bernstein, which
involves repeated excitation and consequent summation of effect. a
method well known to physiologists as that of the repeating differ
ential rheotome.      For onr purpose it was essential to obtain evidence
of the effect following one stimulus only, and this we were fortunately
able to do by using a sensitive Lippmann's capillary electrometer of
quick reaction, made by Mr. G. F. Burch, and belonging to Dr. Burdon
Sanderson, who kindly placed it at our disposal.          This instrument,
when the capillary was magnified 400 times by the observing micro
scope, gave a perceptible response when connected through a resistance
of 10,000 ohms for one-thousandth of a second with an electromotive
difference of only 0-003 D.       The amount of movement of the mer
cury   was   estimated   by the  divisions  of a micrometer eyepiece, one
                                                                 c 2

division of which indicated an actual movement of              of a milli
metre.     After we had found that the electrometer, when connected
with the transverse and longitudinal surfaces of the sciatic nerve of
the toad, showed a response of one division following the application
of a single stimulus, whether electrical or mechanical, we proceeded
to the examination of the sciatic nerve in the rabbit, cat, and monkey.
For these experiments the animal was in every case kept under the
influence of ether, which was maintained throughout the whole experi
ment, and the animal was killed before recovery.       The sciatic nerve
seemed for many reasons the most suitable of the mammalian nerves.
It can be quickly prepared for 7 or 8 cm. in length ; its nutrition is
well preserved, since the arteria comes nervi ischiadici can be left unin
jured, and its diameter lessens the dangers of drying.
   The nerve, having been rapidly prepared and bathed in warm saline
solution, 0'6 per cent., was ligatured low down in the thigh, the liga
ture including the popliteal trunks. It was then divided on the
peripheral side of the knot, and raised in air so as to be at right
angles to the limb.      One kaolin pad of a non-polarisable electrode
was applied to the cut end, and another to the longitudinal surface at
a distance of 1'5 cm.    A pair of sheathed exciting platinum electrodes
2   mm.  apart,  was   then  applied to the trunk of the nerve 6 cm.
centrally from the nearest leading-off electrode, i.e., opposite the
sciatic notch.   The exciting stimulus was obtained by the break of
the current of a single Callaud cell supplying the primary coil of a
du Bois-Reymond inductorium graduated by Kronecker.            The break
shock produced in the secondary coil by this means was so feeble as
to be barely perceptible on the tip of the tongue when the secondary
coil completely covered the primary.       The break was effected by the
spring  rheotome,   which   opened  a fixed key at a definite point in its
course.     The electrometer was connected with the non-polarisable
electrodes by a circuit which included the usual compensator.          By
means of a switch the electrometer could be cut out, and the circuit
made to include a high resistance galvanometer, which also revealed
the single variation. The two instruments could be thus readily com
pared.     The excursion of the mercury of the electrometer was ascer
tained both by direct observation in terms of the divisions of the
 micrometer eyepiece, and by photographing tho projected capillary
upon a moving sensitive plate ; in the latter case the capillary was
 magnified 100 times.      The results of our observations are briefly as
 follows : —
    The mammalian nerve showed a well-marked difference or demar
 cation current, that is to say, the electrode upon the longitudinal
 surface was notably positive to that on the cut end.      The movement
 of the mercury corresponding to this difference amounted in some
cases to 60 divisions of the micrometer, and is shown in fig. 1 pro

1888.]          The Spinal Cord, and   the Cortex  Cerebri.          21
jected upon the plate. Its E.M.F. was from about 0 01 to 0'015 D.
The passage of the single break induction shock through the platinum
electrodes in either direction was followed by a small quick movement
of the mercury, which was invariably in the opposite direction to
that produced by the demarcation current. Its amount varied in
different animals from 1 to 2"5 divisions of the micrometer eyepiece,
and it is shown as photographed in fig. 1 and fig. 2. After severing
the nerve from the bulbo-spinal system above the exciting electrodes,
the same effect was obtained ; its character, as shown by the movement
of the mercury was, however, different, being as we believe much
shorter in duration and less in amount.        But our experiments not
being directed to the elucidation of this point, we will not speak
positively with regard to it. After a time, varying in different cases
from twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hour, the effect was no
longer visible. This movement of the mercury may be conceivably
due to the three following factors, working singly or in co-opera
tion : —
    (A.) Escape of the exciting induction current (uni-polar).
    (B.) Electrotonic change.
    (C.) The true excitatory variation of the nerve.
    (A.) That it was not due to any escape of the induction current is
shown by the following facts : —
    (1.) The variation was produced by the very weak induction
currents, such as those obtained when the Helmholtz wire is used,
and its character did not vary with increasing strength of the
 current.
    (2.) It was no longer perceptible when the nerve was ligatured
between the exciting and leading-off electrodes.
    (3.) As the nerve gradually died the effect became less, and was
no longer perceptible when the nerve was severed from the animal
and left for three-quarters of an hour. Moreover, when the nerve was
indifferently prepared the variation was absent, or else very small and
transient.
    (4.) The effect remained visible when the electrometer     was short
circuited for        second after the break of the exciting key.
    (B.)  That  it was  not due to electrotonic change is shown by the
 following additional facts : —
    (1.) The direction of the effect was always the same, that is,
opposed to that of the demarcation current whatever the direction of
 the exciting current.
    (2.) When the exciting electrodes were shifted to within a centi
metre of the proximal leading-off electrode, an effect was produced,
 the direction of which was dependent upon that of the exciting
 current (fig. 3). This effect differed from that of the true variation
 in other particulars, viz., its amount was dependent upon that of the

22             Mr. F. Gotch and Prof. Victor Horslev.              [Nov. 15,
exciting current, it could be obtained after ligature of the nerve, and
when thuB obtained its character, as shown by the movement of the
electrometer, was unlike that of the excitatory variation, both to the
eye and in the photograph (compare figs. 1, 2, 3, Plate 1).
   (3.) An excursion similar to that we are considering could be pro
duced by mechanical excitation.
 -
   There is thus no doubt that the movement we obtained and
photographed was due to the electromotive           change which accom
panies the propagation of     an  excitatory  state, along the mammalian
nerve when this state is evoked by the application of a single
stimulus.
   Having thus assured ourselves of the accuracy of the method, we
now proceeded to ascertain whether the instrument would reveal the
existence of similar electromotive changes if it was connected with
the nerve or with the spinal cord, and an epileptic convulsion pro
duced by excitation of the cortex cerebri.
                Pabt  II. Excitation of the Cortex Cerebri.
   A. Mixed Spinal Nerve     connected   with  the   Electrometer. — In two
cases we have     connected   in the manner described         in Part  I the
sciatic nerve with the electrometer, and have then exposed by a
small trephine opening the so-called motor cortical centre for the
lower limb. This we then excited by a very weak but adequate
faradic current. So far, however, we have not been able to detect
any movement in the mercury, although the mnscles of the investi
gated limb supplied by the anterior crural nerve were thrown into a
state of active convulsion.     It is probable that the character of the
neural disturbances in the mixed nerve may be best studied by
investigations which we shall shortly undertake upon the electro
motive changes in the muscles.
   B. The Spinal Cord connected with the Electrometer. — The experi
ments, the results of which are now to be briefly detailed, were made
in the following manner : —
   The spinal cord of the etherised animal (cat and monkey) was
exposed in the lower dorsal region for about 4 cm., and as low down
as the upper end of the lumbar enlargement.           Great care was taken
by bathing with warm saline to guard as much as possible against
the dangers of error due to cooling and drying.             The dura mater
 having been split longitudinally, a strong thread was passed round
the spinal cord at the lower limit of the part exposed.           It was tied
firmly and the cord divided below the knot. By successive division
of the two or three roots exposed in the intervertebral foramina, the
cord was easily raised from the neural canal and suspended in the air
without any great interference with the circulation in the longitudinal
 vessels.

1888.]           The Spinal Cord and      the Cortex Cerebri.            23
    One of the non-polarisable electrodes was then brought into contact
with the cut end of the cord and the knotted ligature, while the other
was connected with the longitudinal surface of the cord 2 cm. from
the cut end by means of soft thread cables soaked in saline solution
and tied loosely round the cord.        In one experiment the connexion
was with one lateral column only. Mass movements of the elec
trodes upon the spinal cord were suitably guarded against, though it
was found that the cord might be shaken without producing any
effect  in the electrometer.
    On connecting these electrodes with the electrometer a consider
able electromotive difference was found to exist between the contacts,
the excursion of the mercury being so great, i.e., beyond the field of
the microscope, that its amount could not be estimated in terms of
the micrometer eyepiece. The cut surface was always negative to the
longitudinal surface, and the amount of the difference as estimated by
the compensation method was about 0'02 D. It appeared to be highest
when the section passed through the dorsal region without involving
the lumbar enlargement.        A difference between the surfaces of the
cord has been previously observed by du Bois-Reymond.
    The cortex cerebri was now exposed and the exciting circuit pre
pared.     The inductorium previously employed was again used with
one Daniell cell in connexion with the interrupter of primary coil
and the Helmholtz side wire. The exciting electrodes had platinum
points 2 mm. apart.
    The demarcation current having been compensated, and the electro
 meter placed in connexion with the non-polarisable electrodes, the
 motor area for the lower limb was excited.       The results of the obser
 vations made upon four monkeys and several cats may be summed
 up as follows : —
    (1.) The application of the exciting electrodes to the cortex was
 without exception only followed by a movement in the electrometer
 when the area of representation of the lower limb was touched, and
 this even when owing to prolonged excitation of the arm area the
 upper limb was in violent epileptic convulsion.      We found that when
 the exciting electrodes were moved over the surface of the brain the
 observer at the electrometer only gave notice of a movement in the
 instrument when the person exciting had crossed the margin of
 representation of the limhs. This shows that electromotive changes
 in the cord sufficient to affect our instrument occurred only when the
 motor area of the lower limb was excited.        All error due to escape is
 thus set on one side, while at the same time this remarkable fact con
 firms the localisation of function.
    (2.) The excitation of the motor area for the lower limb was
 accompanied      and followed by characteristic movements           of the
 mercury (figs. 4 and 5). The excitation by means of the interrupted

24            Mr. F. Gotch and Prof. Victor Horsley.          [Nov. 15,
current usually lasted for two seconds, that is about 200 equal aud
alternately directed induction currents passod through the excited
tissue. During this period the mercury showed an excursion opposed
in direction to that of the difference between the longitudinal surface
and cut end of the cord.      This excursion persisted as long as the
excitation lasted, and ceased when this was left off. Then after an
interval of from one to three seconds there ensued a rhythmical
succession of excursions each opposed in direction to the resting
difference, some apparently single and others multiple.    These lasted
from twenty to thirty seconds and suddenly ceased.
   The excursions varied in amount from one to about four divisions
of the micrometer eyepiece, and their rate of occurrence was too rapid
to be correctly estimated   by the eye.   We therefore obtained photo
graphs of this rhythmical effect, and of these we append two (see
figs. 4 and 5).  The first of these (fig. 4) shows the electromotive
change occurring in the spinal cord during a complete convulsion, in
which may be distinguished the first persistent stage parallel to the
tonic stage of the muscular epileptic convulsion and the second
rhythmical series parallel to the clonic stage.
   They are both shown upon the plate, which in this instance
took about twelve seconds in travelling past the image of the
capillary.
  The second photograph (fig. 5), taken on a quickly travelling plate,
shows the rhythmical stage only. The rate of the rhythm is seen to
vary, and the individual variations to become more pronounced as the
rhythm slows, that   is, towards the end of the fit.
   We have repeated this observation thirty or forty times, and feel
ourselves justified in concluding that we have obtained evidence that
during a   cortical epileptiform discharge the electromotive changes in
the spinal cord are exactly parallel as regards the character of their
sequence to the convulsions of the muscles as recorded by the graphic
method.     It remains to be stated that after removal of the cortex we
have obtained an effect in the electrometer when the corona radiata
was stimulated. This effect was only present during the period of
excitation, no rhythmical after-effect ever being observed.          Its
character was prolonged, and resembled the persistent stage referred
to above (see fig. 6).
   In conclusion, we    consider that since by the method we have
adopted the influence of the lumbar bulbo-spinal centres    is  excluded,
the existence of the epileptic rhythm in the dorsal regions of the
spinal cord points to its being almost entirely of cortical origin.

    The six figures in the plate are facsimile drawings of photographs. The negatives
were obtained by projecting the image of the capillary electrometer upon a narrow
slit. behind which an extra rapid photographic plate travelled.           The direction of
movement was such that the right hand side of the prints corresponds to the moment
when the plate reached the slit : the figures are thus to be read from right to
left. In order to save room, only the essential part of the photographs — that
showing the position of the meniscus of the mercury in the photograph — is shown.
The lower darkly toned part of each figure corresponds to the lighter part of the
negative, and indicates the part of the slit shaded by the mercury of the electro
meter   ;  an excursion of the mercury is thus indicated by an elevation or depression
of the upper        edge of the dark band.      The regular series of dark and light bars
on the edge of the figures were made by a vibrating shutter, each entire vibration
of which occupied one-tenth of a second.
   Fig. 1. — Photograph showing two prominences, m and 4, due to two excursions of
              the mercury when first a make and then a break induction shock was
              led through the mammalian nerve, the cut end and surface of which were
              in connexion with the electrometer 6 cm. from the point of excitation.
              The arrows indicate the direction of the exciting induction current through
              the nerve, and the effect is seen to be independent of this direction.     At
              the point marked * the electrometer was short circuited, and the move
              ment of the mercury due to the cessation of the demarcation current effect
              is thus shown. The excursions at m and 4 are seen to be opposed in direc
             tion to that produced by the demarcation current.

             with the electrometer, and excited six times by means of induction shocks
             of different character and direction.     The excitation occurred at make in
             and break 4, and the direction of the induction shock — whether t, ascending,
             or I, descending —is indicated. The effect is seen to be always in the same
             direction, being opposed to that of the demarcation current, and such that
              the electrode on the longitudinal surface becomes negative to that on the
             cut section. The rate of movement of plate was the same as in fig. 1.
   Fig.    3. — Photograph illustrating the effect produced in the electrometer when
             there is a slight escape from the exciting electrodes into the electrometer
             electrodes. The effect was produced by using a severed nerve, which no
             longer gave any obvious excitatory response to electrical excitation.     The
             exciting electrodes were placed upon such a nerve at a very short distance
              (1"5 cm.) from the nearest leading off electrode, viz., that upon the longi
             tudinal surface. The direction of the effect is seen to depend upon the
             direction of the induction shock as produced by make m and break 4 of the
             primary circuit of the induction apparatus. The character of the excursion
             is markedly different to that shown in figs. 1 and 2, being much more
             abrupt.     The rate of movement of plate was the same as in fig. 1.
  Fig.    4. — Photograph showing the effect produced in the electrometer when this
             is connected by one pole with the longitudinal, and by the other with the
             sectional, surface of the spinal cord of the monkey, and the cortex cerebri
             then excited over the motor area for the lower limbs by means of the
             faradic   current.   The excitation commenced at    a and ceased at c.   It  is
             seen to be accompanied by an upward movement        of the mercury, shown   by
             an alteration    in the position of the dark band, which reaches a slightly

            higher level and remains at this level during the period of excitation, and
            then returns.      The direction of the movement indicates that the longitu
            dinal surface has become negative to the cross-section. This corresponds
            to the persistent (tonic) muscular effect which is characteristic of the first
            stage of an epileptic fit. Proceeding from right to left, the cessation of the
            excitation is seen to be followed by a rhythmical series of excursions, which
            at first follow one another in rapid succession, but are small in extent, and
            which subsequently occur at longer intervals, but are much more pro
            nounced in character, until at d they suddenly cease. This corresponds to
            the clonic stage of the epileptic convulsion.
   Fig.  5. — The photograph shows the rhythmical
                                                              (clonic) effect only.   The
            recording surface was made to travel more rapidly past the slit, a marked
            rhythmical change having been first evoked by excitation of the cortex.
            The plate was not allowed to commence its passage past the slit until six
            seconds after the excitation had ceased.     The rhythm is thus seen to great
            advantage. As before, the upward movement of the mercury, as indicated
            by the elevations of the more darkly toned parts, are due to electromotive
            changes in the cord such that the longitudinal surface of the cord becomes
            negative to the transverse section.
   Fig.  6. — Photograph       showing the effect obtained when, with the spinal cord con
            nected as in the preceding with the electrometer, the cortex cerebri is
             removed and the corona radiata excited by faradisation.        The excitation
             commenced      at. a and ceased at c.     It is accompanied by an upward
             persistent   movement    of  the  mercury, shown in the photograph as an
             alteration   of level, and corresponding in character to the (tonic) effect
             produced during the excitation of the cortex. On the cessation of the
             stimulus the effect subsides and is not followed by any rhythmical effect.

34                         Mr.  J. Joly.   On  the              [Nov. 22,
   The first metbod of procedure adopted was to compress by means of
a  pump a certain quantity of dry air into a thin copper sphere, the
sphere being then closed by a screw valve.         The quantity of gas in
the sphere is ascertained by weighing.
    The sphere is now hung in the calorimeter, suspended from a
delicate balance, reading to one-tenth of a milligram, and its thermal
capacity determined in a certain number of experiments.         The gas is
then released, and the sphere further exhausted by means of an air-
pump, sealed, and its thermal capacity again determined in a number
of experiments. This allows of a computation of the thermal capacity
of the contained gas.
   This method   I at first used, but as in dealing with the effect on the
weighings, due to the transference of so bulky a body from air to
steam, much troublesome calculation and risk of error was involved,        I
modified it in the following manner : — -
   Two spheres are prepared, alike with respect to external volume,
and approximately of the same weight.          The thermal capacities of
these are compared in a double calorimeter,         being suspended one
from each arm of a short beam balance.        If their thermal capacities
are not alike a calculated weight of copper wire is introduced into
that of least thermal capacity.     They are in this way brought to have
the same thermal capacity, so that in an experiment on the empty
spheres there is no effect on the balance.
   One of these is now pumped full of air, and the specific heats of the
spheres again compared.      The weight of condensation now obtained is
that due to the gas alone. It is evident that many        sources of error
obtaining in the former method are removed in            the latter.    The
results obtained are also far more consistent one with   another.    In this
case the specific heat is calculated directly on the     formula given in
my paper on the steam calorimeter —
                              °  - W(f, -   t{)'
where X is the latent heat of steam, w the weight of steam condensed
by the gas, W the weight of gas, and t2 <j the extremes of tempera
ture obtaining. S so calculated may be subject to some slight correc
tions, which  I will not here enter into.
    Up to the present  I have only dealt with air, but  I  have made pre
parations for resuming shortly my work, dealing with other gases,
over critical temperatures if possible in some cases, and making con
firmatory experiments on air and also in extension of those given
below.
   The spheres used are about 67 cm. internal diameter; volume
158-5 c.c.   They weigh about 92-2 grams.        That containing the air is
tested hydraulically to 1000 lbs. per square inch.

     These,   it is            result above that theoretically assigned to
                      seen, afford a
air at constant volume (0-1684). They differ too somewhat from some
experiments made by the first-described method, are somewhat lower
than their mean, but the consistency displayed throughout in the
thirteen experiments given, especially in Tables                 I
                                                       and II, leads me to
give these numbers as probably        a close  approximation to the true
value.     One point is at any rate brought out clearly, that      that the is,
surmise that the specific heat of a gas   at constant volume was a quan
tity independent of pressure — a surmise based partly on the constancy
of the specific heat at constant pressure — would appear to be correct.
The values in the three tables, calculated simply on the weights of
gas dealt with in each set of experiments, show results quite inde
pendent of the great variations of pressure and density obtaining,
the weight of condensation simply falling off with the decrease in the
weight of gas, till in the third table w      beginning to feel the errors
                                                     is
incidental to the considerable mass of the spheres and to give more
variable results.    have prepared very thin light spheres with view to
                       I                                                      a
continue the experiments to lower pressures with less danger of error.
    The cause of the excess in the value obtained above the theoretical
is   not apparent, especially in view of the independence of pressure
displayed.     The experiments embodied in the three tables were made
 indeed upon the one Bample of air — some being liberated after the
 first five experiments, and so on — but this had been dried through
 three calcium chloride tubes and two large U-tubes of phosphorus
 pentoxide before passing into the pump.       Between the pump and the
 sphere   it passed through      brass tube stuffed with asbestos which
                                       a
 had been previously heated to redness. The object of this         to guard is
 against oil being carried from the pump into the sphere.
    My first determination of the specific heat of air at constant volume
 was effected on the 13th of April of this present year.             It was
 made by the method described in the beginning of this note, at a
 pressure somewhat higher than that at which the experiments of
 Table were effected. This experiment gave as
       I                                                 result the specific

   Subsequent more extended experiments have shown me that this
condition was not absolutely fulfilled. A small reduction of the values
recorded for the specific heat of air   necessary on this account, but
                                                is
insufficient to affect any remarks made in this note. Successive
experiments on the empty spheres,       may observe, are sufficiently

consistent one with another to warrant the assumption that the values
recorded by me are not probably affected to the extent of one per
cent. by errors on the calorific capacities               of the spheres.

               On Silicon Compounds and their Derivatives.               /     87
1888.]
II.   "Report of Researches on Silicon Compounds and their
       Derivatives. Part I."          By J. Emebson Reynolds, M.D.,
       F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, University of Dublin.
       Received September 27, 1888.
    The present investigation was undertaken some years ago with a
view to examine the action of the silicon haloids — but more especially
of silicon tetrabromide — on various compounds containing nitrogen, as
our knowledge of the relations of silicon and nitrogen is extremely
limited.
    It was ascertained at an early stage of the inquiry that the bromide
of silicon is much superior to the chloride as a reagent with nitro-
geniaed compounds, but since the bromide had apparently not been
obtained in any quantity even by its discoverer, Serullas, considerable
time had to be devoted to working out a method for the production
of a sufficiently large supply of this material.
    In the purification of the crude tetrabromide anew chlorobromide* of
silicon was discovered, which boils at 141° C. This proved to be the
compound SiClBrs, which was required to complete the series of
possible chloro bromides of silicon.
    The first group of nitrogen compounds subjected to the action of
silicon tetrabromide included the primary thiocarbamide or sulphur
urea, obtained by the author in 1869, and the allyl-, phenyl-, and
diphenyl-thiocarbamides.
    All these are shown to unite with silicon tetrabromide and afford
the highly condensed compounds —
                              (H4NsCS)8SiBr4,
                              (C3H6,HsN2CS)sSiBr4,
                               (C„H6,HINJCS)8SiBr4,
                              ((C6H6)3HsN2CS)8SiBr4.
    These are more or less vitreous solids, with the exception of the
allylic compound, which is a transparent and singularly viscous
liquid.    All are dissolved and decomposed by water and by alcohol.
    The action of alcohol on the compound                (H4N2CS)sSiBr4, was
studied in detail, and it is shown that not only do ethyl bromide,
thiocyanate, and diethylic silicate result, but that the representatives
of two new classes of thiocarbamide derivatives are formed.
   * The chlorine required for the production of this compound was derived from
the crude bromine (which    always contains chloride of bromine) used in preparing
the tetrabromide.

                             Prof.   J. E. Reynolds.               [Nov. 22,
     The first of these is  a beautiful tetrathiocarbamide compound, whose
  formula proved to be
                                  (H6N2CS)4NBr,
  which may obviously      be written
                               (H4N2CS)4H4NBr.
 This body separates from alcohol in fine masses of crystals resembling
 sea anemones     in appearance, which melt at 173 — 174°, and begin to
 decompose at 178 — 180°.           The synthesis of this substance was
 effected by heating ammonium bromide with thiocarbamide.
    Several homologues of the above tetrathiocarbamidammonium            bro
 mide were produced by synthetic methods ; some of these contain
 chlorine or iodine instead of bromine.        The following are examples of
 the compounds formed in the course of this part of the investiga
 tion : —
                         (H4N2CS)4H4NBr,
                        (H4N2CS)4H4NC1,

                         (H4N2CS)4(C2H6)2H2NBr,
                         (H4N2CS)4(C2H6)3HNC1.
    By the action of silver nitrate on the tetrathiocarbamidammonium
 bromide the crystalline dithiocarbamide compound with silver bromide
 was obtained —
                                (H4N2CS)2AgBr.
 This was subsequently produced by the direct union of thiocarbamide
 with the pure silver haloid.       The compound —
                                 (H4N2CS)2AgCl
was also obtained in fine crystals, as were other similar substances.
    A trithiocarbamide compound is also formed during the action of
ethyl alcohol on (H4N2CS)sSiBr4, but it is much more soluble than
that which first separates. It is also crystalline, and its analysis
and reactions lead to the formula—
                            (H6N2CS)sBr,C2H5Br.
    Hitherto only mono- and di-thiocarbamide derivatives have been
known ; but the results above stated in outline prove that tri- and
tetra- thiocarbamide compounds are formed in presence of silicon
tetrabromide and certain other agents, which latter form addition
products with the condensed amide.

   So far,   cases   were only dealt with in which silicon tetrabromide
combined with nitrogenised groups without loss of its halogen.              The
next stage of the inquiry involved the investigation of certain inter
actions  in which the tetrabromide loses all its halogen.           One of the
chief results obtained       in that direction forms the subject of      a sepa
rate communication which accompanies this Report.

      of Chemistry, University of Dublin. Received September
      27, 1888.
   The subject of this note is a fine crystalline substance, and is the
first well-defined compound yet known in which we have reason
to believe that silicon is in direct and exclusive union with the
nitrogen of amidic groups.          Its analysis and mode of formation lead
to the conclusion that it is silicotetraphenylamide,

   This body is produced when silicon tetrabromide (or the tetra
chloride) is added to exces.s of aniline, diluted with three or four
volumes of benzene.         Aniline hydrobromate (or hydrochlorate) is a
secondary product of interaction and separates, being insoluble in
benzene.      If aniline be in excess throughout the operation, the whole
of the halogen precipitates as aniline salt, and there remains in
solution impure silicotetraphenylamide.           If aniline be not in excess, a
bromo-componnd is obtained analogous to Harden's rather ill-defined
chlorinated    product.
   Distillation from a water-bath readily removes benzene from the
solution, and a liquid remains which solidifies after some time to a
yellowish mass.         The latter dissolves in warm carbon disulphide
leaving a residue containing some thiocarbanilide, and cautious evapo
ration of the solution leads to the separation of magnificent crystals of
the silicon compound. These form chiefly at the surface of the liquid,
as they are specifically lighter than the solution.
   When twice recrystallised from carbon disulphide, the substance is
obtained in a state of purity.*
   • A Urge   quantity was prepared in June last, and about 50 grams of the pure
 compound   were   exhibited on September 11th, in Section B, during the meeting
of the British Association at Bath.

     The crystals of silicotetraphenylamide are perfectly colourless short
  prisms of considerable size. They melt at 136 — 137° to a transparent
  liquid, which can be heated to 210° without decomposition.                 On
  cooling this liquid solidifies to a transparent glass which, like the
  original crystals, can be easily decomposed by water.
     If silicotetraphenylamide be heated under diminished pressure
  (about 80 mm.), it affords a distillate of aniline, and leaves a residue
 which seems to be the silicon analogue of carbodiphenylimide ; but
 the latter has not yet been completely analysed.
     The detailed investigation of the new substance and its derivatives
 is in active progress, and promises to throw light on the hitherto
 obscure relations of silicon and nitrogen.
     I have reason to believe that the homologues of aniline, and certain
 other analogous nitrogen compounds, act like excess of aniline on the
 silicon haloids, and produce substances similar to the subject of this
 note.      These reactions are also being investigated in my laboratory.

        Professor of Engineering in University College, Dundee,

                                     (Abstract.)
     Early in 1887 the authors communicated to the Royal Society the
results of experiments made by subjecting iron to strong magnetic
force by placing the sample, in the form of a bobbin with a short
narrow neck and conical ends, between the pole-pieces of an electro
magnet.          The experiments have been continued and extended by
using    much      stronger magnetic forces and by testing samples of nickel,
cobalt, and various steels, as well as wrought iron and cast iron.          The
large magnet          of the  Edinburgh University Laboratory, kindly lent
by Professor Tait, was used throughout the experiments, and allowed
the authors to effect a high concentration            of the magnetic force by
using bobbins the necks of which had a cross-sectional area of (in some
cases) only y-yVs of the cross-sectional area of the magnet cores.           By
this meaus the induction gj was raised to the following extreme

    The induction was measured by means of a coil consisting of a
 ftingle layer of very fine wire wound upon the central neck of the
 bobbin.    Outside of this coil, at a definite distance from           it,
                                                                         second

 coil was wound, and the magnetic force was determined in the annular
 space between the two.      In paper communicated to the Manchester
                                 a
 meeting of the British Association, the authors showed that                  the  if
 force so measured could be proved to have the same value as the
 magnetic force within the metal neck itself,              wonld follow that

 the intensity    of magnetism       $ had begun to diminish under the
 action of excessively strong fields, in the manner which Maxwell's
 extension of the Weber-Ampere theory of molecular magnets antici
 pates.   In the present paper the authors discuss at some length the
 question of how far the magnetic force within the metal                  fairly
                                                                              is
measurable by the magnetic force in the ring of surrounding air, and
they show that with the form of cones originally used the force
within the metal must have been less than the force outside, by an
amount probably sufficient to explain the apparent decrease of
The form of cone suited to give a uniform field of force with sensibly
the same value in the metal neck and round               it investigated and

experiments are described in which the condition necessary for a
uniform field was satisfied.        The results of these experiments are
conclusive in showing that no considerable change cakes place in the
value of J    (in wrought iron) when the magnetic force            varied from
                                                                   is
about 2000 to 20000 c.g.s. units. Throughout this range of force, the
intensity of magnetism has sensibly constant value of about 1700 c.g.s.

units, which        to be accepted as the saturation value for wrought
                   is
iron. The term saturation may be properly applied in speaking of
the intensity of magnetism, but there appears to be no limit to the
degree to which the magnetic induction may be raised.
    To produce the greatest concentration of force upon the central
neck, the converging pole faces should have the form of cones, with
a  common vertex in the middle of the neck, and with              semi-vertical
                                                                   a
angle of 54° 44'.     This  form,  however,  does   not give   a  uniform   field
in the neighbourhood of the vertex. To secure that, the condition                       is
that <PF/Ac2, cPFjdy2, and d°F/'dzs shall vanish,        Fbeing the magnetic
force at the vertex, which         is due mainly to the free magnetism
distributed over     the pole faces.   The condition for a uniform field                is
satisfied when the cones have      a semi- vertical angle of 39° 14'.     When
this form     isgiven to the cones, the magnetic        force  in  the  air  im
mediately surrounding the central neck may be taken as sensibly
equal to the force within the neck, and          therefore becomes practic
                                                  it
able to measure the relation of the induction to the force producing
it, that is to say, the magnetic permeability.
    The greatest attainable concentration may be calculated by assum
ing the pole faces to be saturated, when the cones are such as to

   The hydrodynamical problem of finding the waves or oscillations
on   agravitating mass of liquid which when undisturbed          rotating        is
asif  rigid with finite angular velocity in the form of- an ellipsoid or
spheroid, was first successfully attacked by M. Poincare- in 1885.
   In his important memoir " Snr l'Equilibre d'une Masse fluide

 1888.]     Waves on a   Liquid Spheroid of finite Ellipticity.        43
shown that by    a   transformation of projection, the determination of
the oscillations of any particular period is reducible to finding a suit
able solution of Laplace's equation.
  He then applies Lame's functions to the case of the ellipsoid, show
ing that the differential equations are satisfied by a series of Lame's
functions referred to a certain auxiliary ellipsoid ; the boundary con
ditions, however, involving ellipsoidal harmonics referred to both the
auxiliary and actual fluid ellipsoids. At the same time, Poincare's
analysis does not appear to admit of any definite conclusions being
formed as to the nature and frequencies of the various periodic free
waves.
    The present paper contains an application of Poincare's methods to
 the simpler case when the fluid ellipsoid is one of revolution
 (Maclaurin's spheroid). The solution is effected by the use of the
 ordinary tesseral or zonal harmonics applicable to the fluid spheroid
and the auxiliary spheroid required in solving the differential equa
 tion. The problem is thus freed from the difficulties attending the
 use of Lame's functions, and is further simplified by the fact that
 each independent solution contains harmonics of only one particular
degree and rank.
    By substituting in the conditions to be satisfied at the surface of
the spheroid, we arrive at a single boundary equation.           If we are
treating the forced tides due to a known periodic disturbing force,
this equation determines their amplitude, and hence, the elevation of
the tide above the mean surface of the spheroid at any point at any
time. If there be no disturbing force it determines the frequencies
of the various free waves determined by harmonics of given order
and rank. Denoting by k the ratio of the frequency of the free waves
to twice the frequency of rotation of the liquid about its axis, the
values of k are the roots of a rational algebraic equation, and depend
only on the eccentricity of the spheroid as well as the degree and
rank of the harmonic, while the number of different free waves de
pends on the degree of the equation in k. At any instant the height
of the disturbance at any point of the surface is proportional to the
corresponding surface harmonic on the spheroid multiplied by the
central perpendicular on the tangent plane, and is of the same form
for all waves determined by harmonics of any given degree and rank,
whatever be their frequency, bnt the motions of the fluid particles in
the interior will differ in nature in every case.
    Taking first the case of zonal harmonics of the nth degree, we find
that according as n is even or odd there will be fai or ^(n + 1),
different periodic motions of the liquid. These are essentially oscil
latory in character, and symmetrical about the axis of the spheroid. In
all but one of these the value of * is essentially less than unity, that
                                                                       is,
the period is  greater than the time of semi-revolution of the liquid.

44       Waves on a   Liquid Spheroid of finite Ellipticity.    [Nov. 22,
    Taking next the tesseral harmonics of degree n and rank s, we find
that they determine n — s+2 periodic small motions.              These are
essentially tidal waves rotating with various angular velocities ahout the
axis of the spheroid, the angular velocities of those rotating in opposite
directions being in general different. All but two of the values of k are
numerically less than unity, the periods of the corresponding tides at
a point fixed relatively to the liquid being greater than the time of a
semi-revolution of the mass.
    The mean angular velocity of these n — s + 2 waves is less than
that of rotation of the mass by 2/{s(w — s + 2)} of the latter.
    In the two waves determined by any sectorial harmonic, the relative
motion of the liquid particles is irrotational. The harmonics of
degree 2 and rank 1 give rise to a kind of precession, of which there
are two.
    I have calculated the relative frequencies of several of the principal
waves on a spheroid whose eccentricity is 1/ */2.
    The question of stability is next dealt with, it being shown that in
the present problem, in which the liquid forming the spheroid is sup
posed perfect, the criteria are entirely different from the conditions
of secular stability obtained by Poincare for the case when the liquid
possesses any amount of viscosity, which latter depend on the energy
being a minimum.       In fact for a disturbance initially determined by
any harmonic (provided that it is symmetrical with respect to the
equatorial plane, since for unsymmetrical displacements the spheroid
 cannot be unstable), the limits of eccentricity consistent with stability
 are wider for a perfect liquid spheroid than for one possessing any
 viscosity.   If we assume that the disturbed surface initially becomes
 ellipsoidal, the conditions of stability found by the methods of this
 paper agree with those of Riemann.
    The case when the ellipticity, and therefore the angular velocity
 are very small is next discussed, it being shown that all but two of
the waves, or all but one of the oscillations for any particular har
monic become unimportant, their periods increasing indefinitely.
    In the case of those whose periods remain finite for a non-rotating
 spherical mass, the effect of a small angular velocity u of the liquid
 is to cause them to turn round the axis with a velocity less than that
 of the liquid by wjn.
    Finally the methods of treating forced tides are farther discussed.
    The general cases of a " semi-diurnal " forced tide or of permanent
 deformations due to constant disturbing forces are mentioned in con
 nexion with somo peculiarities they present, and the paper concludes
 with examples of the determination of the forced tides due to the
 presence of an attracting mass, first when the latter moves in any
 orbit about the spheroid, secondly when it rotates uniformly about the
 spheroid in its equatorial plane.

     Professor G. G.   STOKES, D.C.L., President, in      the Chair.
   The Report of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the
part of the Society was presented, by which it appears that the total
receipts during the past year, including balances carried from the
preceding year, amounted to £25,125 18s. 6$d. on the General Account.
and £17,884 0s. Id. on account of Trust Funds, and that the total
expenditure in the same period, including purchase of stock, amounted
to £26,079 0s. 0\d. on the General Account, and £15,771 14s. 6d. on
account of Trust Funds, leaving on the General Account an overdrawn
balance of £953 Is. 6d., less £22 2s. l\d. petty cash in hand, and on
account of Trust Funds a balance at the Bankers' of £2,112 6s. Id.
   The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors.

    The President then addressed the Society      as follows : —
 In the month which intervened between our last anniversary and the
 end of the year, the Society lost four of its Fellows.         In addressing
 the Fellows last year,   I  referred to the loss which science had sus
 tained  through the death of the illustrious Kirchhoff, and before
 three weeks were out, one followed him to the grave whose researches
 on the connexion between the emission and absorption of radiant heat
 and light were closely akin to those of Kirchhoff.        I  refer to Balfour
 Stewart, who, shortly after landing in Ireland, whither he had gone
 to spend the Christmas with his family, was suddenly carried off after
 only a few hours' illness, shortly after he had entered on his sixtieth
 year.    His name is widely known on account of his scientific work
 in heat, magnetism, and solar physics. He has been a member of the
 Council, and the Rumford Medal of the Society was awarded to him
 for the particular research to which I alluded at the outset.             The
 other three of our ordinary Fellows who died before the month was
 out were all far advanced in years.       Two of them were eminent in
 the medical world, Sir George Burrows and Dr. Arthur Farre, both of
 whom served on our Council.         Early in the year we lost one of oar

Fellows,   who, while not a man of science, was eminent in literature
and jurisprudence.        While our ranks are mainly recruited from men
of science, we gladly welcome among us men who, like Sir Heury
Sumner Maine, have proved their ability and earned their distinction
in other branches of knowledge, whose connexion with us we look on
as  honourable to the Society, while,     as the  very fact of their joining
us shows, they regard the Fellowship as honourable to themselves.
Admiral Sir Cooper Key, who was highly distinguished as a naval
officer, and was at one time Director of the Royal Naval College at
Greenwich, was another who served on the Council.              Philip Heury
Gosse, who died at an advanced age, is well known for his charming
popular works on natural history. These are some of the Fellows on
the home list who died since the last anniversary ; but, besides these,
we have lost no less than three of our foreign members.             Professor
Anton de Bary, so well known for his researches on the cryptogams,
and the eminent naturalist, Professor Asa Gray, who not very long
ago was over in this country, both died in January.           Comparatively
recently we have lost Professor Clausius, so eminent as a physicist,
especially   in the department of thermodynamics.
   The year of the Society, which terminates to-day, has shown no
flagging in scientific activity. Since the last anniversary, thirty- three
memoirs have been published in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' con-
taining a total of 1,010 pages and 91 plates.        Of the 'Proceedings,'
nineteen    numbers     have  been issued, containing 1,008 pages and 17
plates.     In   addition to this, a Monograph of the Horny Sponges,
by Dr. R. von Lendenfeld, which was accepted for publication by the
Council, and which when completed will extend to about 1,000 pages,
is now   nearly through the press.
   A large amount of work connected with the Library has been done
since the last anniversary. A special effort has been made to com
plete imperfect series of scientific periodicals,       and by means of
exchange,    or  by  the  generosity of our  corresponding   Societies, some
hundreds of deficient numbers have been obtained.              The Lists of
Institutions entitled to receive gratis the ' Philosophical Transactions '
and 'Proceedings' have also been carefully revised by the Library
Committee.
   In December last, Mr. Arthur Soper was engaged as a special
Assistant to continue the formation of the Shelf-Catalogue, and the
revision of the Catalogue of MSS., and for other work.           The Shelf-
Catalogue     of the  Upper Library is now completed    —  a work involving
the re-arrangement or removal to the lower storeys of several thou
sands of volumes.        Considerable progress has been made in collating
and cataloguing the Archives and other manuscript* belonging to the
Society, and an instalment of slips have been written towards a
Catalogue of the Miscellaneous Literature in the Library.

      In the course of this work many duplicate scientific books, and
 literary works of little value to the Society, have been thrown out,
  and    tliese  have  been presented, by order of the Council, to the
  libraries of the Universities and some of the chief Scientific Societies.
      The cataloguing of the titles of scientific papers for the decade
  1874 to 1883 is now complete, and the work is ready for the press.
  The amount of matter is estimated to require, if printed, three quarto
 volumes of the usual size. The extraction of the titles, the preparation
  of the work for the press, and the correction of the proofs of this
  work, which is really of international importance, have all along been
  done at the sole charge of the Royal Society ; but the printing of the
 volumes which have already been published has been done at the
 Stationery Office, by authority of the Lords of the Treasury, and the
 proceeds of the sale have been paid in to the Treasury.     The Council
 have applied to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury
 to sanction the printing of the last decade in a similar manner, and it
 is hoped that the application may be favourably entertained.
     In the year 1882 a change was made in the amount and mode of
 administration of the Grant, which for a considerable time before had
 been voted annually by Parliament for scientific research.         Since
 that year the annual grant has been one of £4,000, which has been
 administered by the former Gorerument Grant Committee, with the
 addition of certain ex-ofieio members, mostly the Presidents of certain
 scientific Societies.    Meetings of this large Committee, consisting
 usually of      about 50  members, have been held twice a year, the
various applications for aid from the Grant to enable the applicant to
carry out investigations explained by him having been previously
discussed in meetings of three, or latterly two, Sub-Committees, into
 which the whole Committee was divided, and then been submitted
to the General Committee for confirmation or modification.
     In the discussion of these Grants, the Goverument received the
benefit of the gratuitous services of a large number of men of the
highest distinction in science. In the large Sub-Committees, how
ever, it necessarily happened that of the members present only a
fraction would be likely to be conversant with the particular branch
of science to which any particular application belonged ; and the
 Council thought that the time of the members might be economised,
and at the same time a more efficient discussion of the Grants secured,
by arranging the applications under a number of sub-divisions, and
assigning the discussion of these to a corresponding number of Boards
formed out of the General Committee.         It was thought that a good
deal of the discussion of the applications in the several branches
might be carried on by correspondence among the members of the
respective Boards, so that one or two meetings of each Board might
suffice.      If some trouble were thus saved to the members of the

Committee    in regard to personal attendance at long meetings, there
would probably be more expenditure of time in the way of corres
pondence, and it was thought that one meeting of the General
Committee    in the year would in most cases suffice. To meet pressing
eases in the interval, it was suggested that a limited sum might be
placed by the General Committee at the disposal of the Council of
the Royal Society.       There are further provisions for forming a
reserve fund of not more than £2,000 to meet special objects involv
ing unnsual expenditure, and for holding in reserve out of the money
available for any one year enough to meet annual grants of limited
amount made for a period not exceeding three years, the future grants
being contingent on the receipt by the Committee of satisfactory
evidence of progress in the inquiry.      The new regulations, of which
I have merely given a slight sketch, have been communicated to the
Treasury, and will come into operation next year.
    The Krakatoa Committee have now completed their work, and the
volume which is the outcome of their labours is in the hands of the
public.    It has been favourably noticed in more than one quarter.
The Society is much indebted to those Fellows and other gentlemen
who discussed and reported on the different subjects into which the
whole inquiry was divided, and to Mr. Symons, who was the first
to propose that the materials should be collected, and to whose
unwearied labour as Chairman of the Committee, director of the
correspondence, and editor of the volume, the successful accomplish
ment of the undertaking is largely due.            A comprehensive and
 digested account of that extraordinary volcanic explosion, remarkable
 both for its magnitude and the striking disturbances           and other
 phenomena attending or following        it, is now placed within easy
 reach of the ordinary reader, and will go down to posterity, whereas,
 had the various accounts remained in their isolated form, they would
 many of them have perished, and the remainder could not have
 been brought together without a most laborious search.       It must be a
 great satisfaction  to my   predecessor  in  this chair to remember  that
 he urged upon the Council the importance          of collecting the facts
 before the materials should have become dissipated, and while the
  freshness of men's recollection of the event kept up a lively interest
 in all that belonged to it.
     The Royal Society is in possession of some important standards for
 the safe keeping of which we are responsible.       Parliamentary copies
  of the standard yard and standard pound have been entrusted to our
  custody ; and we have also a standard measure of length known as
  Sir George Schuckburgh's scale, with reference to which the length of
  the seconds' pendulum for Greenwich has been determined by Kater
  and Sabine.     This length, as determined by experiment, has been
  defined with reference to the interval from the 0 to the 39 and
                                                                 r 2

40-inch graduations on the scale ; but no exact comparison has
 hitherto been made between the length of this portion of the scale and
 the national yard, and such a comparison is no easy matter.          It
happens that Commandant Deforges has been engaged in determining
the length uf the seconds' pendulum at Greenwich with reference to
the French standard metre ; and just before his return to Paris he
came to our meeting, and offered to take charge of tho scale, bring
it with him to Paris, and there determine the length of the part of
the scale used by Kater and Sabine with reference to the metre, for
doing which he has all the requisite appliances ; and as we know the
ratio of the metre to the yard, the length of the seconds' pendulum as
determined by Kater and Sabine would thus be known accurately
with reference to the standard yard. It seemed to me that so im
portant a scale should hardly be sent away, even though in the care
of so experienced a physicist, without the authority of the Council,
and without an outer case being made for its box, which there was
not time to get ready.    The authority of the Council has since been
obtained, and it fortunately happens that one of the assistants at the
Greenwich Observatory is going to Paris, who will take charge of
the scale. Thus by the kind proposal of Commandant Deforges, we
may shortly hope to have an authentic comparison of the length of
the seconds' pendulum as measured by Kater and Sabine with the
standard English yard.
   At the time of the anniversary last year, some of the reports of the
observers who went to Grenada to observe the Total Solar Eclipse of
August, 1886, had been sent in, and I mentioned that it seemed
desirable, for convenience of reference at a future time, that the
different reports should come out together, instead of being published
in a scattered form, provided at least that the waiting for the later
reports should not cause too much delay.        I regret to say that the
completion of the reports has been delayed in part by the illness of
one of the observers, but I have every hope that they will all bo in by
Christmas, and    I do not anticipate that any long time will elapse
before they will be in some form in the hands of the public.
   The time is well within our recollection when the occurrence of
the solar prominences seen in total eclipses first attracted the atten
tion of astronomers, and when, for observations bearing on their
nature, we had to wait for the rare and brief glimpses which, clonds
permitting, were afforded by total eclipses. Now, however, thanks
to the method of observation devised independently by Lockyer and
Janssen, they may be studied at any time. It would obviously be a
great advantage if a similar study could be made of the corona ; for
though we cannot expect to obtain a picture of it equal to that which
may be got during a total eclipse, yet if a fairly good picture could be
obtained from time to time, we might thereby be enabled to learn

 1888.]                     President's Address.                        53
 more about the history of its changes than could be got by observa
 tions extending over a lifetime if restricted to total eclipses.    Some
observations were made during the partial phases of the last total
eclipse   with the view of throwing light on the prospect of success.
Notwithstanding the uupromising nature of the results obtained,
I have reason for hoping that the desired object may yet be accom
plished.
    In addressing you last year, that year which will be memorable as
 the Jubilee of the reign of our beloved Sovereign, I alluded briefly to
the progress which science had made in the last half century, and
ventured to indicate one or two directions in which it seemed to me
possible that a very great addition to our physical knowledge might
some day be reached.      1 will not to-day venture to look so far ahead ;
but the mention of a total eclipse leads me to refer to some theories
now before the scientific world which are likely to undergo full
discussion and further examination in the near future, with the
probable result of a pretty general    agreement  as  to their acceptance
or' rejection.
    It is now many years since Dr. Huggins discovered the peculiar
character of the spectra of the nebulae, spectra which he found to
consist mainly of bright lines, indicating that what we see is an
incandescent gas.     The natural supposition to make at the time was
that those distant masses of matter consisted of incandescent gas, of
which the luminosity was in some way kept up, probably as a result
of condensation.     But the researches of Mr. Lockyer, as described by
him in the Bakerian lecture which he delivered last spring, and in
part in a previous paper communicated            shortly before the last
anniversary, have led him to take a different view of the constitution
of nebulae. According to the theory advanced by him, the mass of
a nebula consists mainly of meteorites, which are constantly coming
into collision here and there ; and the glowing gas the existence of
which the spectroscope reveals, is merely a portion of the matter,
volatilised by the heat of collision. According to the former view
therefore, the nebula consists of glowing gas, not yet condensed into
a solid or liquid form, possibly in a condition even more elementary
than that of the so-called elements that we know on earth ; accord
ing to the latter it consists mainly of discrete portions of solid matter,
and the glowing gas does not consist of the same matter perma
nently glowing, but is continually supplied afresh by fresh collisions.
    A similar theory is applied to explain the self-luminosity of tha
nucleus, and sometimes the very root of the tail, of comets.      A comet
is regarded as a swarm of meteorites, moving in orbits not greatly
differing from one another; and as the swarm approaches the sun
collisions become more frequent, and individually more potent, from
an increase in the velocities differential as well as absolute ; and

54                       A nnivertary Meeting.                [Nov. 30,
a portion of matter is volatilised and rendered incandescent.     As to
the tail, the theory long ago suggested by Sir John Hersehel has
always seemed to me by far the most probable of those that have
been advanced, namely, that it is due to the propulsion of excessively
attenuated matter, owing to a repulsive force, probably of electrical
origin, emanating from the sun. This view seems to be adopted both
by Mr. Lockyer and Dr. Huggins ; and the latter gentleman in an
earlier Bakerian lecture has suggested a new theory of the corona—
the corona as distinguished from the prominences — namely, that it is
projected from the sun by molar forces due to the tremendous state
of turmoil, in which we have very strong reason for believing that
the matter composing the sun exists, but of matter actually propelled
from the sun by a repulsive force in the manner of the tails of comets.
   Daring as some of these speculations may appear to be, there seems
a great deal to recommend them, and the whole subject is one of
extreme interest at the present day.
   But I must not take up your time longer by dwelling on so
special a subject ; I proceed to matters more particularly connected
with the occasion on which we are assembled.
   The Council have awarded the Copley Medal of the year to my
predecessor in this chair, Mr. Huxley, for his investigations on the
morphology and histology of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, and
for his services to biological science in general during many past
years.   These subjects lie so entirely out of the range of my own
studies that I need hardly say that in attempting to give some idea of
the more salient features of his investigations   I am dependent upon
the kindness of biological friends.
   During the fifteen or twenty years which preceded the publication
of Darwin's famous work, the ' Origin of Species,' the views and
methods of comparative anatomists underwent a most marked change.
Without that change biologists would have been far less prepared to
accept Mr. Darwin's work, and, what is even more important, would
have been uuprepared to make use of that work as a light enabling
them to carry on the remarkable researches which have so brilliantly
characterised the progress of biology during the last quarter of a cen
tury. That change was effected chiefly by the labours first of Johannes
Miiller, and subsequently of Huxley in this country, and of Gegenbaur
iu Germany. The labours of these men opened out the right road of
morphological inquiry. It is not, perhaps, too much to say that Mr.
Huxley's treatment of his subject in his ' Morphology of Cephalous
           '
Mollusca was to many young morphologists little short of a revela
tion, and all his other works of the same period, such as that on the
hydrozoa and on tunicates, and latter still his treatment of the verte
brate skull and skeleton, and arthropoda produced in varying degree
a like effect.

   Closely allied to, or rather forming part of, bis morphological
labours are bis numerous palffiontological    researches, carried out for
the most part while he was palaeontologist to the Geological Survey,
researches characterised by the same clear morphological insight,
researches which have been as profitable to animal morphology as
useful to the geologist. The most important are perhaps those on
the remarkable reptiles of the Elgin Sandstones             and on the
Dinosauria ; but many others have great value, and his Anniversary
Address to the Geological Society, in 1S70, made its mark.
   Though his career has been in the main that of a morphologist, he
has through the common ground of histology given considerable help
to physiology.     An early paper by him ' On the Cell-Theory,' did
much to clear away erroneous notions concerning the relations of
structure to the actions of living beings.     His article on ' Tegumen-
              '
tary Organs was a great step onward as regards both morphology
and histology, and still remains a classical work; while, by other
papers and in various ways, he has contributed to the progress of
histology and physiology.
   But however important Mr. Huxley's original contributions to the
advancement of our scientific knowledge have been, we should form a
very inadequate idea of his benefits to the cause of science if we did
not bear .in mind also his singular ability and effectiveness as an
expositor of science to the people, and the powerful influence he has
exerted in the improvement of the teaching of biology in its widest
sense in this country.      Indeed, it is not too much to say that the
remarkable improvement which has taken place within the last few
years must be ascribed either directly or indirectly to his influence,
and has been in many cases due to his initiation.
   The Rumford Medal has been awarded to Professor Pietro Tacchini
for important and long-continued investigations, which have largely
advanced our knowledge of the physics of the sun.
   Professor Tacchini occupies a foremost place among those who have
paid special attention to the physics of the sun.      Since 1870 he has
unceasingly observed, first at Palermo, and afterwards at Rome, the
solar prominences.    The information at our disposal at the present
time, both as regards their distribution, their spectra, and the changes
which take place in them, and their connexion with other solar
phenomena, rests to a large extent upon his individual efforts.      His
memoirs on this subject are very numerous.       He has been engaged in
the observation of four total solar eclipses, and from some of the
phenomena therein observed has drawn the important conclusion that
many of the so-called prominences are really descending currents.
   A Royal Medal has been awarded to Sir Ferdinand von Mueller for
his long services in Australian exploration, and for his investigations
of the flora of the Australian continent.

   For more than forty years von Mueller has been working, without
intermission, at scientific botany and its practical illustrations.     As a
botanical    traveller and collector, he has, to quote the words of Sir
Joseph Hooker,
                    " personally explored more of the Australian conti
nent than any other botanist, except Allan Cunningham."              No one
has investigated the Australian flora and the geographical distribu
tion of its components with so much perseverance and success, and
no one has enriched our herbaria, laboratories,           and gardens with
materials   for study  to so great  an extent.   The eleven volumes of the
'                                          '
  Fragmenta Phytographiae Australia contain the descriptions of a
great series of new plants, and the unrestricted communication of his
collections and observations to the late Mr. Bentham rendered
possible the preparation of the Flora Australieusis,' in seven volumes,
                                     '
the only account of the vegetation of any large continental area which
has at present been completed.
   He has especially devoted himself to the elucidation of the most
difficult, though most characteristic groups of the Australian flora ;

and as a result of his labours in this direction, his     Eucalypt.ographia
may   be   more  particularly mentioned, a work which will always be
the standard of nomenclature for the intricate genus Eucalyptus. Of
a similar character are his descriptions and illustrations of the
                                                      -
  Myoporineous Plants of Australia,' and his Iconography of the
'
Genus Acacia.'       To him is also due the foundation of the Govern
ment Herbarium at Melbourne, the first great botanical collection
formed in the southern hemisphere, and the future centre of all
scientific work on the Australasian flora.
   A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Osborne Reynolds
for his investigations in mathematical and experimental physics, and
on the application of scientific theor}- to engineering.
   Professor Reynolds was among the first to refer the repulsion
exhibited in that remarkable instrument of Mr. Crookes's, the radio
meter, to a change in the molecular impact of the rarefied gas
consequent upon the slight change of temperature of the movable
body due to the radiation incident upon it ; and in an important
                              -                              '
paper published in the          Philosophical Transactions for 1879, he
deduced from theoretical considerations the conclusion that similar
phenomena might be expected to be observed in bodies surrounded by
a gas of comparatively large density, provided their surfaces were
very small.     He verified this anticipation by producing on silk fibres,
surrounded by hydrogen at the atmospheric pressure, impulsions
similar to those which in a high vacuum affect the relatively large
disks of the radiometer.
   lu  an importaut paper published in the ' Philosophical Transactions '
for 1883, he has given an account of an investigation, both theoretical
and experimental,     of the circumstances     which determine whether the

 motion of water shall be direct or sinuous, or, in other words, regular
 and stable, or else eddying and unstable.     The dimensions of the terms
 in the equations of motion of a fluid when viscosity is taken into
 account involve, as had been pointed out, the conditions of dynamical
 similarity in geometrically Bimilar systems in which the motion is
 regular ; but when the motion becomes eddying it seemed no longer
 to be  amenable to mathematical treatment.       But Professor Reynolds
 has shown that the same conditions of similarity hold good, as to the
 average effect, even when the motion is of the eddying kind ; and
 moreover that if in one system the motion is on the border between
 steady and eddying, in another system it will also be on the border,
 provided the system satisfies the above conditions of dynamical as
 well as geometrical similarity.      This is a matter of great practical
importance,    because  the  resistance  to the flow of water in channels
and conduits usually depend mainly on the formation of eddies ; and
though we cannot determine mathematically the actual resistance,
yet the application of the above proposition leads to a formula for the
flow, in which there is a most material reduction in the number ot
constants for the determination of which we are obliged to have
recourse to experiment.
   There are various other investigations of Professor Reynolds's
which time would not allow me to enter into, and I therefore merely
mention bis investigation of the relation between rolling friction and
the distortion produced by the rolling body on the surface on which
it rests, that of the effect of the change of temperature with height
above the surface of the ground on the audibility of sounds and his
explanation of the effect of lubrication as depending on the viscosity
of the lubricant.
   The Davy Medal has been awarded to Mr. Crookes for his investi
gations on the behaviour of substances under the influence of the
electric discharge in a high vacuum.
   Mr. Crookes's remarkable series of researches which conducted him
to the invention of the radiometer led him to work with excessively
high vacua.       In connexion with this he found that an electric
discharge in such vacua is capable of exciting effects of phospho
rescence apparently quite different in their origin from those produced
in the ordinary way by such discharges.            The latter are clearly
referable to the action of the ethereal undulations which are propa
gated from the seat of the discharge.          But the former involve in
somo way the effect of the actnal transference of the molecules of
ponderable matter.     These phenomena, in the hands of Mr. Crookes,
opened up    a  new  means   of discrimination between different bodies,
and he has applied them as a test for the discrimination of groups of
rare earths, not yet fully investigated.      The test went hand in hand
 with processes of chemical     separation.   But here  a  great difficulty

58                           Anniversary  Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
presented itself.      So very closely allied in their chemical properties
are the members        of the groups, that it was only by an excessively
tedious and laborious system of fractional precipitation that Mr.
Crookes was able to effect a pretty fair separation.        Even still, the
separate existence of some members of the groups is more or less
problematical.     It is for these most painstaking researches that the
medal has been awarded.
   The existence, or apparent existence, of so many earths of such
close chemical relationship led Mr. Crookes to speculate on the possi
bility that after all the molecules of what is deemed a chemical
element may not be absolutely alike, as chemists              have almost
universally believed, but only very approximately so,       and  that what
is deemed the molecular weight of the substance may really be that
of the. average of its molecules.         Should such groups exist, it is
conceivable that by processes of very delicate chemical separation
they might be split up again into sub-groups, the molecules of which
still more nearly match one another ; so that according to this view
the number of groups into which an element, or what is deemed such,
might be split up, not, be it observed, by any dissociation, but merely
by a sorting of the molecules which are very nearly alike, may be
somewhat indefinite.
   Chemists will not probably be disposed to give up the idea of the
perfect similarity of the individual molecules of elementary bodies;
but it is surely legitimate for one who has worked so assiduously at
these difficult separations to suggest, merely as a matter for chemists
to think about, a possible view of the nature of elements different
from that to which they have been accustomed.

   The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
 Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
 constituted  as  follows  :
                       Mr. Warren de la Rue, Chairman.

   The work      at the Observatory may be considered        under the fol
lowing heads : —
   1st.  Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental, in connexion        with any of the above depart
            ments.
   5th. Verification    of instruments.
   6th.   Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
   7th.   Miscellaneous.
                          I. Magnetic Orservations.
   There have been no changes introduced in the niagnetographs
during the year, but the building operations referred to later
on have involved the introduction of several pieces of iron, in the
shape of girders, standards, rails, &c., both temporarily and perma
nently, into the field of action of the magnets, and will there
fore somewhat complicate the corrections           necessary to render the
observations     comparable with those made prior to the alterations.
Fortunately the building in which the absolute observations are
made is sufficiently remote (about 100 yards) from the main building
to be quite unaffected by these sources of magnetic disturbance.

74                     Report    of   the   Keio Committee.
Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force variations have been secured
uninterruptedly throughout the past year, and in accordance with the
usual practice the scale values of all the instruments were determined
in January last.
   The following values of the ordinates of the different photographic
curves were then found : —
              Declination  :  1 inch=0°       22' 04.   1 cm.=0°  8'- 7.
   Bifilar, January 12, 1888, for       1  inch SK = 0-0279 foot grain unit.
                                    „ 1 cm. „ = 0-00051 C.G.S. unit.
   Balance, January 16,      1888 „ 1 inch <SV= 0-0282 foot grain unit.
                                     „ 1 cm. „ = 0 00051 C.G.S. unit.
    The distance between the dots of light upon the vertical force
cylinder having become too small for satisfactory registration, the
instrument was re-adjusted for balance. This was done on January
19th, after which the scale value was re-determined with the following
result : —
   Balance, January     21, 1888,    for    1 inch SV = 0-0278 foot grain unit.
                                       „    1 cm.    „ = 0 00050 C.G.S. unit.
   In February experiments were undertaken to verify the tempera
ture corrections of the force magnetographs                  as well as of the
barograph by artificially heating the room in which these instru
ments are at work.        A rough temporary fireplace was built of bricks
and slates, in which a charcoal fire was lighted for several hours.
This was subsequently extinguished and the windows were thrown
wide open in order to admit the cold night air for a corresponding
period. By this means changes of temperature of about 20° F.
were several times made.          The resultant effect in the case of the
bifilar was very small indeed, but with respect to the balance magnet
ometer,    it was considerable,    as expected.
   In   order   to ascertain     whether the experiments had affected the
permanent magnetism of the needles, or had otherwise influenced the
instruments, scale value determinations were made on March 20th,
and as will be seen by the following note, no appreciable effect had
been produced in the sensibility of the V.F. magnetometer by the
operation.
   Balance, March 20, 1888, for        1  inch SY = 0-0277 foot grain unit.

   Small unimportant repairs have                been   made   to  the recording
apparatus when necessary.
   Although the magnets generally have been more active than in tbs
preceding year, no very large movements have been registered.
   The principal disturbances were recorded on the following dates :

October 19-22, 1888.
   The monthly observations       with the absolute instruments have been
made   as usual,    and   the results are given in        the tables forming
Appendix    I of this Report.
   The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations

tables of diurnal range of Declinatiou (see Appendix I, Table         III) have
been reproduced       from the original photographs by means of an
eidograph kindly lent by Captain Wharton, F.R.S., the Hydro-
grapher.
   A  complete set of self-recording magnetographs by Casella, London,
similar in construction to the instruments recently supplied to the
Royal   Cornwall     Polytechnic     Society,  have been examined        at the
Observatory.
   Information     on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism             and
various  data  have   been  supplied  to  Professors  Rtlcker,  Piazzi   Smyth,
Dr. Rijckevorsel, and Messrs. Wilkinson and Harrison.
   Magnetic Reductions. — At the request of the Rev. S. J. Perry,
copies of the Kew Horizontal Force curves for certain selected days
during the years 1883 to 1886 are now being         made.
                     II. Meteobological       Obsebvations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature, and Humidity,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered, together with the daily observa
tions in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system.
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix             II.
   The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried  on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
to the Meteorological Office.
   Owing to trouble caused by bursting of the water-reservoir for1 the
thermograph wet-bulbs during frosty weather, and the risk of their
imperfect action owing to leakage of water, a double tank has been
made, so that in the event of the inner vessel bursting, the outer one
will prevent any loss of water.

76                    Report   of the Kew   Committee.
    The number of instruments under observation       has been increased
by the addition of a snow gauge on Professor Nipher's principle for the
purpose of measuring falls of snow, but no opportunity has occurred
since its erection of thoroughly testing its indications.
    A new 8-inch Glaisher gauge has been supplied by the Meteoro
logical Office, and its readings observed regularly, since January,
with the view of substituting it for the old square 100-inch area
gauge hitherto employed for check upon the Beckley S.R. gauge, on
the completion of a full year's comparison of the two gauges.
    Seven months' observations have also been made of a second 8-inch
gauge, with the view of determining the effect of paint upon the
inner surface of the collecting funnel.
    During the period that the east room of the Observatory was under
going alteration, the working standard barometer, Newman 34, was
temporarily removed to a position a few yards distant in the North
Kall. Comparisons were made with the Welsh standards (which were-
carefully cased in, during the time of occupation of the room by
workmen), both before, subsequent to its removal, and after its replace
ment in its old position.
    The following is a summary of the number of meteorological obser
vations made during the past year      : —

    In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
 to  the Committee, Mr. Whipple visited and inspected during his
 vacation the Observatories at Aberdeen, Glasgow, Stonyhurst, and
 Oxford, as well as the anemographs at Swaubister, North Shields and
 Fleetwood.
    Mr. Baker also inspected the Falmouth and Valeueia Observatories
 as well as the Anemographs at Mountjoy Barracks (Dublin) and
 Holyhead.
    Advantage was taken of these visits to fit Stonyhurst lifters to

                       Report   of the Kew   Committee.                   77
the  Beckley rain gauges at Aberdeen, Falmouth, and Valencia, and
one has since been forwarded to Dr. Dreyer for him to fit at Armagh.
  The barograph and thermograph formerly in use at the Armagh
Observatory, after being put in thorough repair, have been erected in
the Verification-house and temporarily set to work, awaiting the
decision of the Meteorological Council as to their final disposition.
  With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
of the meteorological    results have been regularly forwarded to, f,nd
                ' The          '
                                 and ' The Torquay Directory.'
published by           Times                                        Data
have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                        '
Society, the editor of    Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine,'
the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Captain Abney,
Dr. Rowland, and others. The cost of these abstracts is borne by the
recipients.
   Since January last tables of the monthly values of the rainfall and
temperature have been prepared and sent to the Meteorological Sub
committee of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club
for publication in their Proceedings.      Detailed information of all
thunderstorms observed in the neighbourhood during the year has
also been regularly forwarded to the Royal Meteorological Society
soon after their occurrence, special forms having been provided by the
Society for the purpose of collecting such information with the view
to special investigation.
   Electrograph. — The electrograph under repair at time of last Report,
owing to its partial destruction by fire, has been put in thorough
order.    The de la Rue battery, employed to charge             it,
                                                                has been
cleaned, and  its cells refilled by the makers.   The scale-value of the
instrument has been again determined by means of the portable elec
trometer (White's) and found to be practically unaffected by the
accident.

  The electrometer lent to Mr. Abercromby for the purpose of making
observations during his expedition to Teneriffe was returned to the
Observatory in good order on the termination of his experiment,          and
on trial the value of the scale division was found to be unaltered.
   In consequence of an accident whilst cleaning, the instrument
required re-adjustment in March, but no alteration was found to have
resulted to its sensitiveness when again tested at the laboratory in
Charlotte     Street, facilities being afforded   for this by the kindness of
the Chairman.

78                  Report   of  the  Kew Committee.
                        III. Solar Orservations.
   The sketches of Sun-spots, as seen projected on the photoholiograph
screen, have been made on 150 days, in order to continne Schwabe's
enumeration, the results being given in Appendix II, Table IV.
   Transit Observations. — Regular observations of solar and of sidereal
transits have been taken, for the purpose of keeping correct local
time at the Observatory, and the clocks and chronometers have been
compared daily.
   The clocks, French, Shelton K. 0., Shelton 35, and the chrono
meters Breguet No. 3140, and Arnold 86 are kept carefully rated
as time-keepers at the Observatory, and the mean-time clock, Dent
2011, lent by the Astronomer-Royal, is also in use in daily com
parisons with the chronometers on trial.
   The chronometer,      Molyneux No. 2126, is used as a " hack
              " in order to facilitate the
chronometer                                inter-comparison of the clocks.
   The scale, figures, &c., on the south meridian mark in connexion
with the transit-instrument having become somewhat obliterated
through age and exposure, steps were taken to remedy this defect,
and some slight improvements       introduced.
                       IV. Experimental Work.
   Photo-nephograph. — The past year has been particularly unfavour
able to cloud photography at the Observatory.
   The opportunities of taking negatives of cirrus, to which parti
cular attention is directed, were rare in the earlier months of the
summer, and during the later the builders' operations prevented, in a
great measure, the work being carried on.
   Several modifications have been introduced into the system of
observing, materially simplifying it, and the mathematical treatment
of the pictures has also been temporarily set aside in favour of
mechanical methods, which afford results of sufficient accuracy in a
small fraction of the time occupied by the other plans of reduction
which have been employed hitherto.
   Observations of cloud height, drift, and direction have been treated
in this manner for 1887 and for 1888, generally with satisfactory
results.   During April special photographs were taken with one
camera only, for showing the structural change in cirrns in short
intervals of time, and seven sets of negatives were procured, exhibit
ing the extensive alteration sometimes observed in this class of cloud
in a couple of minutes.
   Time Signals. — With a view of obtaining the time at the Observa
tory for pendulum work to a high degree of accuracy, and also for
comparing daily the time as determined by the Observatory Transit
with that distributed by the Postmaster-General from St. Martin's-le

                       Report  of Vie Kew Committee.                   79
Grand, application was made to H.M. Commissioners of Woods and
Forests for permission to erect a telegraph line from the Observatory
to the London and South Western Railway skirting the Old Deer
Park. This was granted, and a line has been set up placing the
Observatory in direct electrical communication with the Chief Post
Office in Richmond.
    A relay and chronograph have been purchased and placed in the
circuit, and every morning, excepting Sundays and holidays, the
10 a.m. signal from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, is recorded
beside the beats of the Observatory Standard Clock (French) on the
snme tape.     The signals have been observed daily by means of the
galvanometer for the past two months, but the chronograph was only
regularly set to work on the 31st October, delay having arisen on
account of the necessity of protecting the apparatus against lightning.
    The cost of the chronograph and attachments to the Standard
Clock has been defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society.
    Pendulum Experiments. — The swinging of the Indian Invariable
Pendulums at the Observatory has been delayed by the operations
attendant on the establishment of the time signal connexion with the
 General Post Office, and also by failure, up to the present, of informa
 tion from the American officers as to certain details of their practice
 when observing with the apparatus in America and elsewhere.
    Meanwhile experiments have been made to determine the vacuum
 correction of the two thermometers, Nos. K.S. 667 and 668, used on
 the dummy to replace those broken in travelling.         It was observed
 that a reduction of 27 inches in the barometric pressure lowered
 their zero points by 0'25°. Other observations were also made to find
 the relative degree of accordance during changes of temperature
 between the indications of the thermometers in the interior of the
  vacuum-chamber and that attached to the Richard thermograph
 placed in close proximity to its outer surface.
    During these trials the holding capacity of the chamber has been
 thoroughly tested and found to stand low pressures extremely well.
     Constants of Robinson Anemometers. — By permission of the Com
 mittee, Mr. Whipple has attended at Hersham on several occasions, and
  assisted Mr. W. Dines, B.A., F.R. Met. Soc., in the experiments in
  progress, on behalf of the Wind Force Committee of the Royal Meteoro
  logical Society, for determining the value of the Robinson constant for
 anemometers of various dimensions, and also for verifying the factor
  for converting wind velocity into pressure.
     The experiments are similar to those carried out at the Crystal
  Palace in 1874, and described in the Report for that year.
     A Preliminary Report      on the experiments    was read before the
  R.  Met. Soc. meeting    in                                  1
                              May, 1888, and is printed in the Quarterly
  Journal,' vol. 14,  p. 253.   The results compare very favourably with

80                     Report  of the Kew   Committee.
those formerly obtained as discussed by Professor Stokes      (' Roy. Soc.
Proc.,' vol. 32, p. 170).
                     V. Verification of Instruments.
   The following magnetic instruments have been purchased on com
mission and their constants determined : —
        An Inclinometer for the Tiflis Observatory.
        A pair of Inclinometer    Needles for the Colaba Observatory.
        Ditto for the U.S. Navy Department.
        Ditto for the Utrecht Observatory.

                             — The number of sextants submitted for ex
 amination continues to increase, having amounted during the past year
 to 157.
                             VI.  Rating of Watches.
    639 entries of watches for rating were made as contrasted with 510
 dnriug the corresponding period of last year.             They were sent for
 testing in the following classes      : —
               For class A, 569    ; class  8, 51 ; and class C, 19.
 Of these 218 failed to gain any certificate ; 8 passed in C, 46 in B,
 367 in A, and 28 of the latter obtained the highest possiblo form of
 certificate, the class   A  especially good.
    In   Appendix     III   will be found statements giving the results of
 trial of the 30 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks
 during the year, the premier position being attained — with 89-0 marks
 — by a keyless, single-roller, going-barrel, centre- seconds watch, sub
 mitted by W. Holland, Rockferry, Birkenhead.
    This total exceeds that of last year, and it is also extremely satis
 factory to note that a continued increase has taken place in the
 proportion of watches gaining more than 80 marks, the number this
 year being 53.
    No difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the three safes —
 in which the watches are placed during rating — at the three tempera
tures of 40°, 65°, and 90° respectively, all the year round.
    Special attention continues to be given, as before, to the examination
of pocket chronographs, in accordance with the request of the Cyclists'
Union; and in consequence of numerous enquiries from manufacturers,
timers, &c., a set of rules has been drawn up, as follows, which are
adhered to as far as practicable in testing chronographs.
    1. After the usual A or B tests are finished the watch is run with
the chronograph work in continual action for one or two periods of
24 hours each, and a note made of the maximum effect produced upon
the ordinary daily rate, by the chronograph mechanism being in
constant action.
    Yol. Xi.V.                                                         o

K-2                     Report   of   the   Kew Committee.
    2. This maximum effect must not exceed +           5 seconds.
    3. In addition    to the above 21-hour trials, the watch     — with a view
of testing   its                                                      —
                  starting, stopping, and recording qualifications is also
subjected to shorter tests,' varying from a few seconds to an hour or
more in duration.
    4. When the chronograph         mechanism is in action, and pressure is
applied to the knob or push-piece, the chronograph hand or hands
must either stop dead at once, or else must run on unaffected until
stronger force is used.
    5. There must be a complete absence of
                                                      " lagging," and moving
only in spasmodic jumps, when pressure is applied, and perfect absence
of recoil when the chronograph hand is stopped.
    6. The hands must return to, and start exactly from, the zero
mark, and in the case of split seconds they must run together in exact
accordance.
    7. The times shown by the minute-recorder must agree with the
position of the fly-back hand.
   8. When the chronograph action of a watch has been tested — in
addition to the trial of its ordinary time-keeping qualities — an endorse
ment of the result will be made upon the certificate ; and chrono
graph watches with certificates without this endorsement will be
recognised as having been examined as ordinary watches only.
    Marine Chronometers. — Certificates of mean daily rate and                of
variations of rate at each temperature have been awarded to 12
marine chronometers after undergoing the 35 days' trial as specified
in the regulations.

                                           — Prepared photographic paper has
been procured and supplied to the Observatories at Batavia, Colaba,
Falmouth, Lisbon, Mauritius, Oxford, St. Petersburg, Stonyhurst,
and Toronto, as well as also to the Meteorological Office and the U.S.
Navy Department.
    Anemograph sheets have likewise been sent to Coimbra and
Mauritius, blank forms for entry of observations, &c., have also been
distributed to various applicants.
    Hongkong Observatory. — This observatory was founded by H.M.
Government in 1883, partly on the recommendation of the Kew Com
mittee, in order amongst other objects to obtain continuous observa
tions of terrestrial magnetism and meteorology in the eastern hemi
sphere between Java and Zi-Ka-Wei.
    The Committee have recently been consulted by the Secretary of
 State for the Colonies as to the advisability of suspending the mag
netic work of the Chinese Observatory for a period of three years,

                        Report  of  the  Kew Committee.
 but having regard to the important changes going on in the horizontal
component of the earth's magnetism, on that part of the globe, they
 were not able to recommend        the Secretary to interrupt the observa
tions as suggested.
   Marine   Telescopes.  — The arrangements described in last year's Report
for the examination of Marine telescopes and binoculars have been
completed, and a circular has been approved of by the Committee for
issue to the public, stating that such instruments will in future be
tested at  Kew on payment of the following             fees  : —
     Marine telescopes and superior binoculars                 ..  2s. 6d. each.
      Opera glasses and pocket telescopes           . .        . .  Is. 6d.   „
   The Secretary of the Admiralty has communicated with the Com
mittee with reference to a proposal that all such instruments purchased
for use in H.M. Navy should be examined at the Observatory prior to
their acceptance from the contractors' hands.
   Photographic Lenses. — Captain Abney, at the suggestion of the
Camera Club, as well as Mr. Galton, have proposed to the Committee
the establishment of a system of testing and certifying lenses con
structed for use in photographic cameras. Captain Abuey has pro
posed a scheme of examination, and experiments are in progress with
a view to carrying it out at the Observatory.                 It has, however, been
found difficult as yet to fix upon one which would permit of a suffi.
cieutly exhaustive examination being conducted for the low fee which
has been suggested, as probably the only one likely to make the certifi
cates popular.
   Ships' Lights. — The Committee have had under consideration the
very important subject of the examination of ship's lights for the
Mercantile Marine, by a system based upon the method now. in
operation at H.M. Dockyard at Chatham with reference to the lamps,
lenses, and coloured shades used in H.M. Navy.
   The inland isolated position of the Observatory, and the heavy and
cumbersome nature of the lanterns, appear to the Committee at
present to offer an almost insuperable objection to the adoption of
this at Kew.      There are no funds available for the alternative plan
suggested of setting up a branch establishment at some locality on the
banks of the Thames below London.
   Exhibition, — The Committee contributed to the Annual Exhibition
of the Royal Meteorological Society held in March last, a collection of
apparatus for observing atmospheric electricity, principally that used
at Kew by Ronalds or subsequent observers.
   A list of the various objects with references is printed in the
catalogue prepared      by the Society.*

84                      Report  of the Keio  Committee.
    Extension of the Building.  — The Chief Commissioner     of Works and
Public Buildings having granted permission for the Committee to
undertake the erection of the additional storey to the east wing of the
Observatory as mentioned in last year's Report, and having instructed
Mr. Lessels, surveyor to the Board, to prepare the necessary drawings,
plans, &c., tenders were invited from the principal local builders
for the work. That of Messrs. J. Dorey and Co., of Brentford, for
£454, was accepted, and operations were commenced on July 23rd.
They have now been completed under the superintendence of Mr.
Chart, H.M. Commissioners' Clerk of Works for the Hampton Court
and Kew District, and Mr. Allen, his Assistant.
     Library. — During the year the library has received as presents the
publications of —
    22 Scientific Societies   and Institutions   of Great Britain and Ire
          land, and
    95 Foreign and Colonial Scientific         Establishments,  as well as
          numerous private individuals ;
    The reference set of   1
                             Phil. Trans.' has been bound in cloth boards
 to correspond    with, the covers of the volumes as now issued by the
 Royal Society.
     Old Mural Quadrant. — When in 1840 the astronomical instruments
 forming the equipment of George Ill's Observatory, were removed to
 Armagh, it was found impracticable to take away the 8-feet mural
 quadrant by Sissons, on account of its being too large to pass through
 the doors or windows of the room in which it was placed.
     Recently, advantage was taken of the removal of the roof of the
 east wing of the Observatory to hoist it out and convey it to the
 Stores in the Office of Works at Kew, where it is now deposited. The
 Committee propose its ultimate consigument to the Loan Collection
 of Scientific Apparatus at South Kensington.
     The stone wall which served for its support has been utilised as a
 bearer for a new gallery, providing an additional area of 29 feet long
  by 7 feet wide, which it is intended to devote to the Department for
  the Verification of Hydrometers.
     Workshop.  — The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
  Observatory by grants from the Goverument Grant Fund or the
  Donation Fund, have been duly kept in order.
     House, Grounds, and Footpath.    — These have all been kept as usual
  during the year.
     A Norton's tube-well has been driven and a pump erected in order
  to obtain an increased water supply, the Observatory not being in
  connexion with the mains of Richmond.

                       Report    of the   Kew Committee.                       85
                          Personal Estarlishment.
   The staff employed is     as follows : —
      G. M. Whipple, B.Sc., Superintendent.
      T. W. Baker, Chief Assistant.
      H. McLaughlin, Librarian.
      E. G. Constable, Observations and Rating.
      W. Hugo, Verification Department.
      J. Foster         „                „
      T. Gunter.
      W. J. Boxall, and five other Assistants.
   The Committee feel that they cannot permit the lamented death of
Professor Balfour Stewart to pass unnoticed.
   Professor Stewart's connexion with the Observatory originated in
1856, when it was under the control of the British Association.                In
February of that year he joined the staff as an Assistant Observer to
Mr. John Welsh ; his stay was, however, short, as he left soon after in
October to become Assistant to Professor Forbes at Edinburgh, but
returned in 1859 as the Superintendent, accepting the appointment
when offered him on the death of Mr. Welsh.                  He relinquished the
superintendence     in  1871,   in  order   to   reside   at Manchester   as Pro
fessor of Physics in Owens College, but maintained a most lively
interest in the operations of the Observatory, especially in the
solar and magnetic work, being engaged in a discussion of certain of
the Kew magnetic observations even up to the time of his death.
The most important of his papers referring to these and similar obser
vations are enumerated in the appendix to Mr. Scott's
                                                                     " History of
the Kew Observatory."*

 Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.
    Long. Oh ln 15'1 W.,for the year October 1887 to September 1888.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
 Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
 the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Ma£rnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
   The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure aro also given.
   The value of log ttK employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at tem
perature 60" F.
   The induction-coefficient fi is 0 000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                o-oooimfo-ssHO-ooo.ooo^iscio-ss)'.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked TO foot and 13 feet, are 1-000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from
the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer          or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.

   In  each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
of which, with respect to the Magnetometer,           has been carefully
 determined.
    The observations   have been made and reduced by    Mr. T. W. Baker.

                                  (Abstract.)
    This   paper is an attempt to explain the morphology of the pectoral
group of muscles, and is based on the dissection of over fifty mammals,
and on descriptions of others in various journals, &c.
    The following are the chief conclusions : —
    1. That portion of the lateral sheet of muscle, pushed outwards in
the form of a cone by the growth of the anterior limb-bud, which
belongs to the ventral region, may be divided by radial lines of fission
into three segments, viz., an anterior or manubrial, a mesial or gladi-
olar, and a posterior or abdominal.

 100                  The Pectoral Group          of Mmdes.              [Dec. 6,
    2.  That the radial division is of primary importance is shown hy
 the fact that each of these segments has its own nerve, viz., the
 anterior, a nerve corresponding to external anterior thoracic of human
 anatomy ; the middle, internal anterior thoracic ; the posterior, lateral
 thoracic.    The first is definite in its origin and distribution, and the
 third in its origin, the second is less regular, and in correspondence
 with this is a certain indefiniteness of the line of division between the
 second and third segments.
    3. The anterior segment may be subdivided into clavicular or
 niannbrial portions, and the posterior may also be in two divisions,
 but these are not regarded as of primary value.
    4. Each segment may undergo a secondary lamination into super
ficial and deep parts, viz., anterior into superficial and deep mann-
brial, middle into gladiolar and costal, and posterior into superficial
and deep abdominal.
   5. Superficial manubrial is always present and generally covers the
others at its expanded insertion ; it may be distinct or fused with
 deep manubrial or gladiolar, or both.
   6. Deep manubrial may be absent, or present and distinct, or fused
with, or just separable from, superficial.          It may be fused with costal
or very rarely with gladiolar, if the plane of manubrial lamination is
more superficial than usual.         The relation of this muscle to the so-
called   "                    "  is discussed, the author being of opinion
           sterno-scapularis
that the latter is subclavian in its nature.
   7. Gladiolar may be absent or nearly so.           It may be distinct or fused
with superficial or deep manubrial, or with costal or abdominal.                It
is very often fused at its posterior border only with costal, the two
sheets being otherwise separate.
   8. Costal may arise from the edge of the sternum and the costal
cartilages, from the cartilages alone, or from the ribs.                It has a
tendency as it decreases      in  size to   shift  its  origin farther outwards,
and its insertion farther towards the shoulder.                 It may be fused
with gladiolar or deep       manubrial      or  abdominal.     It may consist of
 two portions, anterior and posterior.
    9. Abdominal may be absent or double, and the two parts may
 overlie one another, or one may be anterior to the other.             It may be
 fused   with   gladiolar  or  costal.    It  may be connected by its entire
 outer border with the dorsal sheet, thus closing the axilla, or fasciculi
 may pass from one side to the other (achselbogen).              The origin may
 wander outwards to the lower ribs (pectoralis quartus).
    10. The parts above described              are very variously arranged
amongst mammalia.          The conditions obtaining are discussed and
exhibited in a tabular form.
    11. The various factors are thus represented in man : —

III. "    Some Observations on the Amount of Light reflected and
        transmitted by certain kinds of Glass." By Sir John
        Conkoy, Bart, M.A., Bedford Lecturer of Balliol College
        and Millard Lecturer of Trinity College, Oxford. Com
        municated by A. O. Vebnon Habcoubt, Esq., F.R.S.
         Received November 8, 1 88b.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The experiments were commenced in order to determine the amount
 of light lost by transmission through glass.
    Plates of the same kind of glass, but of different thickness, were
 taken, and the amount of light they transmitted determined, and
 from these values the percentage        amounts   reflected and obstructed
 calculated.
     The amount reflected from the first surface was also determined
 directly by measuring the relative intensities of the illumination pro
 duced by two argand flames, when the light from both fell directly on
 the photometric snrfaces, and when the light from one fell directly
 whilst that from the other reached the photometer after reflection
 from the surface of the glass.
     Experiments were also made to ascertain whether repolishing
 altered in any way the reflective           power of the glass ; and the
  polarising angles of the glass before and after repolishing were also
 determined.
                                   Conclusions.
     It  seems  probable that the amount of light reflected by freshly
 polished glass varies with the way in which it has been polished, and
 that, if a perfect surface could be obtained without altering the
 refractive index of the surface-layer, then the amount would be
 accurately given by Fresnel's formula, but that usually the amount
  differs from that given by the formula, being sometimes greater and
  sometimes less.
                                                                  H 2

102             On the Properties     of Sulphur.     Presents.         [Dec. 6,
   The formation of a film of lower refractive index on the glass
would account for the defect in the reflected light; but to account for
the excess, it seems necessary to assume that the polishing has
increased the optical density of the surface-layer,          and the changes
produced    in  the amount    of  light transmitted     and  in the angle of
polarisation support this view.
   After being polished, the surface of flint glass seems to alter some
what readily, the amount of the reflected light decreasing, and the
amount of the transmitted increasing, whilst with crown glass the
change, if any, proceeds very slowly.
   There is no evidence to show to what particular cause these
changes are due.
   The values of the      transmission     coefficients for    light   of  mean
refrangibility for the two particular kinds of glass           are given, and
show that for 1 cm. the loss by obstruction amounts          to 2-62 per cent.
with the crown glass and 1"15 per cent. with the flint        glass.

                                                     Bending of Sur
faces of Revolution," I have applied the theory of bending to explain
the deformation and vibration of thin elastic shells, which are sym
metrical about an axis, and have worked out in detail                   the case where
the  shell is a portion of a sphere.     The validity of this application
depends entirely upon       the  principle that when the shell is thin
enough and is vibrating in one of the graver possible modes, the
middle surface behaves as if it were inextensible.
                                                            " When a thin
sheet of matter is subjected to stress, the force which it opposes to
extension is great in comparison with that which it opposes to bend
ing. Under ordinary circumstances,         the deformation      takes place
approximately as if the sheet were inextensible as a whole, a condi
tion which, in a remarkable degree, facilitates calculation, though
 (it need scarcely be said) even bending implies an extension of all
but the central layers."      If we fix our attention upon one of the
terms involving sines or cosines of multiples of the longitude, into
which, according to Fourier's theorem, the whole deformation may
 be resolved,   the condition of inextensibility         almost enough to

 tude, the solution contains       two arbitrary constants ; but if a pole be
included, as when the shell is in the form of a hemisphere, one of the
constants vanishes, and the type of deformation is wholly determined,
 without regard to any other mechanical condition, to be satisfied at
 the edge or elsewhere.       It will be convenient to restate, analytically,
the type of deformation arrived at [equation (5)].                    If the point
 upon the middle surface, whose coordinates were originally a, 0, 0,
moves to a + lr, 0 + i0, <p+t<p, the solution is
                                                                                (1).

shell is complete.      Any integral value higher than unity is admis
sible for s.       The value 0 and 1 correspond to displacements not
involving strain.
    In a recent paper* Mr. Love dissents from the general principle
involved in the theory above briefly sketched, and rejects the special
solutions founded upon it as inapplicable to the vibration of thin
shells.     The argument upon which I proceeded in my former paper,
and which still seems to me valid, may be put thus : It is a general
mechanical principlet that, if given displacements (not sufficient by
themselves to determine the configuration) be produced in a system
originally in equilibrium by forces of corresponding types, the result
ing deformation is determined by the condition that the potential
energy of deformation shall be as small as possible.             Apply this to an
elastic shell, the given displacements being such as not of themselves
to involve a stretching of the middle surface.J                     The resulting
deformation will, in general, include both stretching and bending,
and any expression for the energy will contain corresponding terms
proportional to the first and third powers respectively of the thick
ness.     This energy is to      be as small     as possible.    Hence, when     the
thickness is diminished without limit, the actual displacement will be
one of pure bending, if such there be, consistent with the given con
ditions.      Otherwise the energy would be of the first order (in
thickness) instead of, as it might be, of the third order, in violation
of the principle.
    It will be seen that this argument takes no account of special
conditions to be satisfied at the edge of the shell.             This is the point
at which Mr. Love concentrates his objections.                 He considers that

Trans.,' A, 1888.

   J  There are cases where no displacement (invoking strain at all) is possible
without stretching of the middle surface, e.g., that of the complete sphere.

the general condition       necessary to be satisfied   at a free edge is in
fact violated by such       a  deformation as (1).     But the condition in
question*     contains  terms   proportional to the first and to the third
powers respectively of the thickness, the coefficients of the former
involving as factors the extensions and shear of the middle surface.
It appears to me that when the thickness is diminished without limit,
the fulfilment of the boundary condition requires only that the middle
surface be unstretched, precisely the requirement satisfied by solutions
such    as (1).
    Of   course, so long as the thickness is finite, the forces in operation
will   entail some stretching of the middle surface, and the amount of
this stretching will depend on circumstances.            A good example is
afforded by a circular cylinder with plane edges perpendicular to the
axis.      Let normal forces locally applied at the extremities of one
diameter of the central section cause a given shortening of that
diameter.       That the potential energy may be a minimum, the de
formation must assume more and more the character of mere bending
as the thickness is reduced.       The only kind of bending that can occur
in this case is the purely cylindrical one in which every normal
section is similarly deformed, and then the potential energy is propor
tional to the total length of the cylinder. We see, therefore, that if
the cylinder be very long, the energy of bending corresponding to the
given local contraction of the central diameter may become very
great, and a heavy strain is thrown upon the principle that the
deformation of minimum energy is one of pure bending.
    If  the small thickness of the shell be regarded as given, a point
will at last be attained when the energy can be made least by a
sensible local stretching of the middle surface such as will dispense
with the uniform bending otherwise necessary over so great a length.
But even in this extreme case it seems correct to say that, when the
thickness is sufficiently reduced, the deformation tends to become one
of pure bending.
    At first sight it may appear strange that of two terms in an ex
pression of the potential energy, the one proportional to the cube of
the thickness is to be retained, while that proportional to the first
power may be omitted.         The fact, however, is that the large potential
 energy    which  would   accompany any stretching of the middle surface
is the very reason why such stretching will not occur. The compara
 tive largeness of the coefficient (proportional to the first power of the
 thickness) is more than neutralised by the smallness of the stretching
 itself, to the square of which the energy is proportional.

stiffness, and     if  the other coordinates be suitably chosen, the potential
energy of the system may be expressed
                         V = ic,^12+KY'*2+^SS+
    This     follows     from   the general theorem that V and T may
always      be   reduced    to sums of squares simply, if we suppose that
T = *a,^».
    The equations of equilibrium under the action of external                forces
*l,        . .  are thus
                        *, =  Clfv          *, =   c2f2         ;
hence     if the forces are regarded as given, the effect of increasing Gx
without limit is not merely to annul ^j, but also the term in V which
 depends upon it.
     An example might be taken from the case of a rod clamped at one
end A, and deflected by a lateral force, whose stiffness from the end
A up to a neighbouring place B, is conceived to increase indefinitely.
 In the limit we may regard the rod as clamped at B, and neglect the
 energy of the part AB, in spite of, or rather in consequence of, its
 infinite stiffness.
     If it be admitted that the deformations to be considered are pure
 bendings, the next step is the calculation of the potential energy
 corresponding thereto.           In my former paper, the only case for which
 this part of the problem was attempted was that of the sphere.
 After bending, "the principal curvatures differ from the original
 curvature of the sphere in opposite directions, and to an equal amount.*
 and the potential energy of bending corresponding to any element of
 the surface is proportional to the square of this excess or defect of
 curvature, without regard to the direction of the principal planes."
 Though he agrees with my conclusions, Mr. Love appears to regard
 the argument as insufficient.            But clearly in the case of a given
 spherical shell, there are no other elements upon which the energy of
                                    " Thus the energy corresponding to the

  where    H   depends upon the material and upon the thickness."
      By the nature of the       case H is proportional to the elastic constants
  and to the cube of the thickness, from which it follows by the method
 of dimensions        that it is independent of a, the radius of the sphere.
     * This is in virtue of Gauss's theorem that the product of the principal curva
  tures is unaffected by bending.

I did not, at the time, attempt the further determination of H, not
needing it for my immediate purpose.                        Mr. Love has shown that
                                           H=     *»fc«                                       (3),
where     2h represents the thickness, and n is the constant of rigidity.
Why n alone should occur, to the exclusion of the constant of com
pressibility, will presently appear more clearly.

     If the form of the shell be other than spherical, the middle surfncc

 question is now not merely one of the curvature of the deformrtl
 surface; account must also be taken of the correspondence of normal
 sections before and after deformation.*                        A complete investigation
  has been given by Love ; but the treatment of the question now to be
  explained, even if less rigorous, may help to throw light upon this
  somewhat difficult subject.
      In the actual deformation of a material sheet of finite extent there
  will usually be at any point not merely a displacement of the point
  itself, but a rotation of the neighbouring parts of the sheet, such as a
     * An extreme     case may serve      as an illustration.      Suppose that the bending is
  such that the principal     planes   retain  their    positions relatively to the material sur
  face, but that  the  principal  curvatures    are   exchanged. The nature of the curvature
  at the point in question is the same after deformation as before, and by a rotation
   through 90° round the normal the surfaces may be made to fit                ; nevertheless  the
   energy of bending is finite.

In order   to take the question in its simplest form, let us refer the
original surface to the normal and principal tangents at the point in
question as axes of coordinates, and let us suppose that after deforma
tion, the lines in the sheet originally coincident with the principal
tangents are brought back (if necessary) to occupy the same positions
as at first.  The possibility of this will be apparent when it is re
membered that in virtue of the inextensibility of the sheet, the angles
of intersection of all lines traced upon it remain unaltered. The
equation of the original surface in the neighbourhood of the point

It   thus appears that the energy of bending will depend upon two
quantities, one giving the alterations of principal curvature, and the
other t depending upon the shift (in the material) of the principal
planes.
   In calculating the energy we may regard as due to the Btretchings
                                                                  it
and contractions under tangential forces of the various infinitely thin
laminea into which the shell may be divided.        The middle lamina
being unstretched, makes no contribution.      Of the other lamina, the
stretching      in proportion to the distance from the middle surface,
               is
and the energy of stretching          therefore as the square of this
                                                 is
distance.   When the integration over the whole thickness of the shell
is   carried   out, the result     is      accordingly proportional to the cube              of
the thickness.

applicable to a spherical shell ; for, since the original principal planes
are arbitrary, they can be taken so as to coincide with the principal
planes after bending.                       Thus t = 0    ;    and by Gauss's theorem

    It will be convenient to replace Sz, Sr, aS<p by single letters, which,
 however, it is difficult to choose so as not to violate some of the usual

 The problem before us is the expression of the changes of principal
 curvature and shifts of principal planes at any point P (z, 0) of the
 cylinder in terms of the displacements w, v, w. As in (6), take as
 fixed co-ordinate       axes the principal tangents and normal to the
 undisturbed cylinder at the point P, the axis of x being parallel to
that of the cylindor, that of y tangential to the circular section, and
          f
that of normal, measured inwards.                If, as it will be convenient to
do, we measure z and 0 from the point P, we may express the undis

Another disk, attached where z has a finite value, would render the
cylinder rigid.
   Instead of a plane disk let us next suppose that the cylinder is
closed at z = 0 by a hemisphere attached to it round the circum
ference.   By (1) the three component displacements at the edge of the
hemisphere (0 = ^ir) are of the form
                               v  =   a 50 =s a cos    #0.

                              w   = or     =  sa  sin s0.
Equating these to the corresponding values for the cylinder, as given
by (23), (24), (25), we get
                       A, =    1,                        B, =  $ ;

in which we may, of course, introduce an arbitrary multiplier and an
arbitrary addition to 0.       If  the convexity of the hemisphere be turned
outwards,   z is to be considered positive.
   In like manner any other             convex     additions at one end of the
cylinder might be treated.         There are apparently three conditions to
be satisfied by only two constants, but one condition is really re
dundant, being already secured by the inextensibility of the edges
provided for in the types of deformations determined separately for
the two shells.     Convex additions, closing both ends of the cylinder,
render it rigid, in accordance with Jellet's theorem that a closed
oval shell cannot be bent.
   It is of importance to notice how a cylinder, or a portion of a
cylinder, can not be bent. Take, for example, an elongated strip,
bounded by two generating lines subtending at the axis a small
angle.    Equations (31) [giving drwjdr2 = 0] show that the strip
cannot be bent in the plane containing the axis and the middle
generating line.* The only bending symmetrical with respect to this
              * This is the principle upon which metal is corrugated.

plane is a purely cylindrical one which leaves the middle generating
line straight.         There are two ways in which we may conceive the
strip altered so as to render it susceptible of the desired kind of bend
ing. The first is to take out the original cylindrical curvature, which
reduces     it to  a plane strip. The second is to replace         it by one in which
the   middle line is curved from the beginning, like the equator of a
 sphere or ellipsoid of revolution.              In this case the total curvature
being finite, the Gaussian condition can be satisfied by a change of
 meridianal curvature compensating the supposed change of equatorial
curvature. It is easy to calculate the actual stiffness from (8) and
 (14), for here t = 0.          We have

 Whatever the equatorial curvature may be, the ratio of stiffnesses in
 the two cases is equal to m : m + n, or about 2 : 3, the spherically
carved strip being the stiffer.
    The same principle applies to the explanation of Bourdon's gauge.
In this instrument there is a tube whose axis lies along an arc of a
circle and whose section is elliptical, the longer axis of the ellipse
being perpendicular to the general plane of the tube.                     If we now
consider the curvature at points which lie upon the                 axial section, we
learn from Gauss's theorem that a diminished curvature along the
axis will be accompanied by a nearer approach to a circular section,
and reciprocally.         Since a circular form has the largest area for a
given perimeter, internal pressure tends to diminish the eccentricity
of the elliptic section and with it the general curvature of the tube.
Thus,    if  one end be fixed, a pointer connected            with the free end may
be  made to indicate the internal pressure.*
   * Dec.   19. — It appears, however, that the bending of a curved tube of elliptical
section  cannot be purs, since the parts of the walls which lie furthest from the
circular axis are necessarily stretched. The difficulty thus arising may be obviated
by replacing the two halves of the ellipse, which lie on either side of the major
axis, by two symmetrical curves which meet on the major axis at a finite angle.

tion of the energy of bending it would be simpler to use polar co
ordinates (r, 0, <p), r being measured from the vertex instead of from
 the axis.
    If  the cone be complete up to the vertex, we must suppose, in
 (53) &c., B, = 0.      And if we proceed to calculate tho potential
 energy, we shall find it infinite, at least when the thickness is uni

  change of curvature must be proportional to A»-z~2.                   When this is

  assumes an infinite value when z = 0.                   The complete cone must
  therefore be regarded as infinitely stiff, just as the cylinder would be
  if one rim were held fast.

  that the common rim is a plane of symmetry, the bending may be
  such that the common rim remains plane. If the distance of this plane

  that ez = 0 where z = zv            Hence

  III.  " An Investigation of a Case of Gradual Chemical
       Change." By W. H. Pendlebury and M. Seward.                  Com
       municated by A. G. Vernon Harcourt, Esq., F.B.S.
       Received November 27, 1888.
                               (Abstract.)
   The case of gradual chemical change with which the present investi
gation deals is that between hydrogen chloride and potassium chlorate,
 and also its reaction with hydrogen chlorate whether alone or in pre
 sence of potassium chloride.
   When dilute solutions of a chlorate (as for instance potassium
 chlorate) and hydrogen chloride are mixed together, the liquid slowly
acquires a chlorous smell, and there is a gradual liberation of oxidising
material, chlorine, and oxides of chlorine.   These immediate products
cannot easily be investigated, for if the mixture is left to itself so
that they accumulate in it, the gradual reaction first observed is
stopped, and there ensues decomposition of the usual complex nature
of these nnstable solutions of chlorine and its oxygenated com
pounds.
   But if a small quantity of potassium iodide is present it will be
decomposed by these substances,        and iodine will be gradually
liberated as the final product of the reaction we have mentioned.
   Now Messrs. Harcourt and Esson, in their work on a gradual
chemical change, measured the rate at which iodine was liberated in
a liquid by ascertaining the time taken for a known quantity of
sodium thiosulphate added to that liquid to be entirely decomposed.
A small quantity of starch solution was added at the same time, and
served as the signal of the presence of free iodine, which meant that
the measured quantity of sodium thiosulphate was exhausted.           The
observation to be made was of the interval of time which elapsed
between the addition of the thiosulphate and the first appearance of
a blue starch coloration.
   The same measurement and the same signal served our purpose.
The first obvious difference between the two reactions is that, whereas
in the former one (between hydrogen dioxide and hydrogen iodide)
iodine was the primary result, in the later one it is a secondary
result. This proved an unimportant difference.       The secondary reac
tion between potassium iodide and the results of the first is, by
comparison,    instantaneous.  But another difference is of great im
portance.    In their reaction the rate of decomposition became
gradually slower, as one of the substances reacting continued to
decrease sensibly in amount, and finally disappeared.    In this reaction
the amount of each substance decomposed bears an infinitely small

ratio to the amount of each present ; the composition of the mixture
thus remains practically unchanged, and the rate of decomposition
in each mixture is constant. Each experiment then is brought to an
arbitrary close as soon as the constant velocity has been determined
by the observation of a few intervals.       The subjects of investigation
were : the comparison of the velocities in different mixtures, and thus
 the establishment of laws connecting variation in velocity with varia
 tion of each of the ingredients.
     In a large number of experiments hydrogen chlorate was used. Mix
 tures of dilute solutions of the two acids, chloric and hydrochloric, were
 made in various proportions ; being arranged in several series in each
 of which the amount of one of the acids present was varied in arith
 metical progression, and the effect upon the rate investigated.       Then
 the effect of the presence of certain quantities of potassium chloride
 npon the rate was observed, for the purpose of connexion with a new
 series of experiments.       In these potassium chlorate and hydrogen
 chloride were used, and series for variation of one of the ingredients
 taken as before. The effect of varying the quantity of potassium
 iodide present and that of varying the temperatures were also
  observed.
      The results may be thus briefly summarised : —
      Variation in Hydrogen Chlorate. — The rate varies with the amount
  of hydrogen chlorate, in the first place, directly, as a substance
  taking part in the chemical reaction ; and in the second place with a
  small acceleration proportional to the quantity present, so that the
  substance has a coefficient of action independent of its being a parti
  cipant in the reaction.    Thus —
                              R =   aQ (1 + 6Q),
  where Q represents quantity, R rate, a and b constants.
       Variation in Hydrogen Chloride. — The variation of the rate with
   that of hydrogen chloride is not of this simple nature. It would
   seem to be (1) an effect of the secondary order above mentioned
   (accelerative) on the decomposition of hydrogen chlorate by itself,
   and in addition to this (2) an effect of both primary and secondary
   order on the decomposition of hydrogen chlorate with hydrogen
   chloride.
       Variation in Potassium Chloride. — The addition of this salt has a
   small accelerative effect on the normal rate proportional to its quan
   tity. It thus appears to be a neutral salt not taking part in the
   reaction.
      If  a  mixture of solutions of potassium chlorate and hydrogen
   chloride   in molecular proportion between 1 : 2 and 1 : 12 is made,
   complete double decomposition ensues, the hydrogen chlorate formed,
   in presence of the hydrogen chloride remaining, liberates oxidising

material, and the potassium chloride formed exercises its specific
influence on this reaction.
   The secondary action upon potassium iodide producing iodine is
practically an instantaneous one, unless the quantity of this substance
is below a certain minimum.      Below this the velocity observed in the
mixture will be less   than normal.   The effect of increasing the amount
of this substance to much greater than the minimum is closely analo
gous to that of a similar increase of any neutral salt.
   The velocity is an exponential function of the temperature, as was
observed in Messrs. Harconrt and Esson's investigations. As the
latter increases in arithmetical progression, the former increases in
geometrical progression.     The rate is about doubled for a rise of 5° C.
The ratio in this progression is not, however, absolutely constant, but
varies a little with the temperature at which it is taken.           Thus
between 0° and 15° C. the rate is a little more than doubled for a
rise of 5° ; between 20° and 30° it is a little less than doubled.
IV. " Determination of      the Viscosity of Water." By A. MALLOCK.
      Communicated by Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S. Received
      November 30, 1888.
   The experiments here described, which were made daring April and
May of the present year (1888), to determine the constant of viscosity
of water, may be of some interest on account of the newness of the
method employed, and also as being on rather a larger scale than
other experiments which have been made with the same object.
   Fig. 1 gives a section of the apparatus used.
   A and B are two coaxial cylinders ; of these A is mounted on the
vertical axis E, and can be made to rotate by a belt passing over the
wheel F. B is suspended by a long fine wire C, and the annular space
between A and B is filled with water or any other fluid to be experi
mented on.
   A little way   above the lower edge of B is fixed an air-tight dia
phragm    D,  so that when the space between the two cylinders is filled
with liquid air is inclosed under D, and the liquid touches B only on
the cylindrical surface.
   The interior of B above D is filled with water which serves the
purposes of checking the torsional vibrations of B, of preventing any
rapid change of temperature of the liquid in the annulus, and of
holding the thermometer.
   The experiments were made by driving the cylinder A at a uniform
speed and recording the angle through which B is turned when it
comes to rest under the action of the fluid friction on its cylindrical
surface and the torsion of the suspending wire C.         A was driven by

 a remontoir      weight in connexion with a governor, and the speed
 recorded electrically on a chronograph by means of a contact maker
  on the axis E.
      The torsion of the wire C was measured on a divided circle H,
  attached to B.
      To get the absolute value of the torsion-scale the following method
  was used    : —
      W (fig. 2) is a small weight hung at the end of a silk thread S in
   the neighbourhood of the torsion-wire C.      H is the divided circle on
   B. From S a second thread, L, is taken to the circumference of H.
   The point of W is over a horizontal scale, and a reading of its position
   taken when there is no strain on L, that is, when S is hanging verti
   cally.   The weight W is then displaced by unclamping the circle H
   from B and winding up the thread L round its circumference, then
   reclamping H and allowing things to come to rest ; readings are then
   taken of the displacement    of W and the position of H. After this
    the thread L is cut and the position of H read again.

   These experiments     give directly the force which a known angular
 twist of the wire exerts at the known radius of the divided circle.
   These experiments are recorded below, and it will be seen that the
 results are very fairly consistent.
   The dimensions of the various parts of the apparatus are given in
the computation of the viscosity constant.
    In making    the experiments on viscosity the velocity of the cir
cumference    of the cylinder A was made to vary from 05 to 50 metres
per minute.
   It  was found that at all these speeds the force tending to turn the
inner cylinder B could be represented by the sum of two terms, one
varying as the velocity and the other as the square of the velocity ;
the latter being small compared to the former, even at the highest
speed. See Diagram 1.
   The cause of the square term seems to be that, owing to the action
of the bottom of the revolving cylinder, a circulation is set up in the
fluid in the annulus, the flow being up the side of the revolving
cylinder and down the side of the stationary one, the result being that
the fluid having the velocity due to a position near the outer cylinder
is by this circulation continuously carried towards the inner one,
thns making the variation of velocity in the neighbourhood of the

latter gTeater than it would otherwise be.* As far as could be
observed there was no trace of eddies with axes parallel to that of the
cylinders. The proportion between the two terms depends on the
 ratio l>etween the length of the cylinders and the breadth of the
 amrolns, the square term becoming smaller and smaller compared to
 the other as the ratio increases.
   It    was found that when the temperature                          of the fluid was altered
the coefficient of the term varying                       as   the velocity changed, but that
 the coefficient of the square term remained unaffected.
   The value of the viscosity constant deduced from these experiments
 agrees closely with that obtained from the experiments of Poiseuille
 on the flow of liquids through capillary tubes.
   I  now proceed to give the method and the numerical data which
 were employed in the computation.

       If insteadof being in an annulus the water was contained between
  two parallel planes of infinite extent, the distortion caused by
  the motion of one of these planes parallel to the other would be
  uniform throughout the whole mass of enclosed fluid. But in the case
  of the liquid enclosed between two cylinders, although the distor
   tion is uniform over each cylindrical surface in the fluid coaxial with
   the enclosing cylinders, yet it changes in passing from one such
   surface to another, increasing as the radius decreases.    In fact, since
   the total moment transmitted by each surface is constant,f the rate of
   distortion necessary to produce this moment must be inversely as the
   area of the surface and radius of the cylinder at which it occurs ;
    that    the rate of distortion at radius

ordinates being the values of fir and the abscissae the temperature.
   Poiseuille's results are shown by the dotted curve.
   The chief interest of these experiments, beyond that attaching to
an independent determination of ft by a new method, lies in the com
paratively high velocities at which the viscous forces remain the
principal cause of resistance.

   In all other experiments on fluid friction with which        I am acquainted
(those on capillary tubes excepted) the term depending on the square
of the velocity becomes the most important at speeds far below those
used in this series.
   Many experiments were made on the viscosity of fluids other than
water, but as I find that the results do not differ materially from
those of Poiseuille it is unnecessary to give them here.

I. " Co-relations and their     Measurement,     chiefly from Anthropo
      metric    Data."     By Francis      Galton, F.R.S. Received
      December 5, 1888.
   " Co-relation or correlation of structure " is a
                                                     phrase much used in
biology, and not least in that branch of it which refers to heredity, and
the idea is even more frequently present than the phrase ; but am     I
not aware of any previous attempt to define it clearly, to trace its
mode of action in detail, or to show how to measure its degree.
   Two variable organs are said to be co-related when the variation of
the one is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of
the other, and in the same direction. Thus the length of the arm is
said to be co-related with that of the leg, because a person with a
long arm has usually a long leg, and conversely. If the co-relation be
close, then a person with a very long arm would usually have a very
long leg ; if it be moderately close, then the length of his leg would
usually be only long, not very long ; and if there were no co-relation
at all then the length of his leg would on the average be mediocre.
It is easy to see that co-relation must be the consequence of the
variations of the two organs being partly due to common causes. If
they were wholly due to common causes, the co-relation would be
perfect, as is approximately the case with the symmetrically disposed
parts of the body.     If they were in no respect due to common causes,
the co-relation would be nil. Between these two extremes are an
endless number of intermediate cases, and it will be shown how the

136                           Mr.  F. Galton.                    [Dec. 20,
closeness of co-relation  in any particular case admits of being expressed
by a simple number.
   To avoid the possibility of misconception, it is well to point out
that the subject in hand has nothing whatever to do with the
average proportions between the various limbs, in different races,
which have been often discussed from early times up to the present day,
both by artists and by anthropologists.        The fact that the average
ratio between the stature and the cubit is as 100 to 37, or thereabouts,
does not give the slightest information about the nearness with which
they vary together.     It would be an altogether erroneous inference to
suppose their average proportion to be maintained so that when the
cubit was, say, one-twentieth longer than the average cubit, the
stature might be expected to be one-twentieth            greater than the
average stature, and conversely.       Such a supposition is easily shown
to be contradicted both by fact and theory.
    The relation between the cubit and the stature will be shown to be
such that for every inch, centimetre, or other unit of absolute length
that the cubit deviates from the mean length of cubits, the stature
will on the average deviate from the mean length of statures to the
amount of 1 5 units, and in the same direction. Conversely, for each
unit of deviation of stature, the average deviation of the cubit will be
0-26 unit.      These relations are not numerically reciprocal, but the
exactness of the co-relation becomes established when we have trans
muted the inches or other measurement            of the cubit and of the
stature into units dependent on their respective scales of variability.
 We thus cause a long cubit and an equally long stature, as. compared
to the general run of cubits and statures, to be designated by an
identical scale- value.   The particular unit that    I shall employ is the
value of the probable error of any single measure in its own group.
In that of the cubit, the probable error is 0-56 inch = 1*42 cm. ;
in the stature it is 1*75 inch = 4-44 cm. Therefore the measured
 lengths of the cubit in inches will be transmuted into terms of a new
scale, in which each unit = 0-56 inch, and the measured lengths of the
stature will be transmuted into terms of another new scale in which
each unit is 1*75 inch. After this has been done, we shall find the
deviation of the cubit as compared to the mean of the corresponding
 deviations of the stature, to be as 1 to 0-8. Conversely, the deviation
of the stature as compared to the mean of the corresponding deviations
of the cubit will also be as 1 to 0-8. Thus the existence of the co-relation
 is established, and its measure is found to be 0-8.
    Now as to the evidence of all this. The data were obtained at my
anthropometric laboratory at South Kensington.                They are of
350 males of 21 years and upwards, but as a large proportion of them
 were students, and barely 21 years of age, they were not wholly full-
 grown ; but neither that fact nor the small number of observations is

prejudicial    to the conclusions that will be reached.                 They were
measured in various ways, partly for the purpose of this inquiry.                 It
will be sufficient to give some of them as examples. The exact number
of 350 is not preserved throughout, as injury to some limb or other
reduced the available number by 1, 2, or 3 in different cases.                 After
marshalling the measures of each limb in the order of their magni
tudes,   I noted the measures in each series that occupied respectively
the positions of the first, second, and third quarterly divisions. Calling
these measures in any one series, Qj, M, and Q3, I take M, which is
the median or middlemost value, as that whence the deviations are
to be measured, and ^{Q2— Qi} = Q, as the probable error of any
single measure in the series.          This is practically the same as saying
that one-half of the deviations               fall within the distance of +Q
from the mean value, because the series run with fair symmetry.                   In
this way I obtained the following values of M and Q, in which the
second decimal must be taken as only roughly approximate. The
M and Q of any particular series may be identified by a suffix, thus
Mft Qc might stand for those of the cubit, and MJ; Q, for those of the
stature.

between and just below the eyebrows.       The cubit is measured with the hand prone
and without taking off the coat ; it is the distance between the elbow of the bent
left arm and the tip of the middle finger. The height of the knee is taken sitting
when   the knee  is bent at right angles, less the measured thickness of the heel of
the boot.
    Tables were then constructed, each referring to a different pair of

examples of the       whole     of them.      It  will be understood that the Q

140                              Mr. F. Galton.                   [Dec. 20,
between   69-5   and 70-4 inches    ; that of 69 includes  all between 68*5
and 69-4, and so on.
    The values derived from Table II, and from other similar tables,
are entered in Table III, where they occupy all the columns up to
the three last, the first of which is headed " smoothed."              These
smoothed values were obtained by plotting the observed values,
after transmuting them as above described into their respective
Q units, upon a diagram such as is shown in the figure.                  The
deviations of the    "          "
                       subject     are measured parallel to the axis of
ij in the figure, and those of the mean of the corresponding values
of the " relative " are measured parallel to the axis of x. When the
stature is taken as the subject, the median positions of the correspond
ing cubits, which are given in the successive lines of Table III, are
marked with small circles.       When the cubit is the subject, the mean
positions of the corresponding statures are marked with crosses.
The firm line in the figure is drawn to represent the general run of the
small circles and crosses.     It is here -seen to be a straight line, and it
was similarly found to be straight in every other figure drawn from
the different pairs of co-related variables that I have as yet tried.
But the inclination of the line to the vertical differs considerably in
different cases.   In the present one the inclination is such that a
deviation of 1 on the part of the snbject, whether it be stature or cubit,
is accompanied by a mean deviation on the part of the relative, whether
it be cubit or stature, of 0-8. This decimal fraction is consequently
the measure of the closeness of the co-relation.         We easily retrans-
mute it into inches.    If the stature be taken as the subject, then Q, is
associated with Q<-x0-8; that is, a deviation of 1*75 inches in the
one with 0-56- x 0-8 of the other.         This is the same as 1 inch of
stature being associated with a mean length of cubit equal to 0-26 inch.
Conversely, if the cubit be taken as the subject, then Qc is associated
 with Q, x 0-8 ; that  is,   adeviation of 0-56 inch in the one with
l-75x0-8 of the other. This         is  the same as1   inch of cubit being
associated with   a  mean length of 2-5 inches of stature.          If centi
metre be read for inch the same holds true.
    Six other tables are now given in summary form, to show how
                                          a
well calculation on the above principle agrees with observation.

Table IV was itself derived.

relatives are severally measured in units of their own Q, there is
always a regression in the value of the latter. This is precisely

read before this Society on Hereditary Stature ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol.
40, 1886, p. 42).           The statures of kinsmen are co-related variables ;
thus, the stature of the father is correlated to that of the adult son,
and the stature of the adult son to that of the father ; the stature of
the uncle to that of the adult nephew, and the stature of the adult
nephew to that of the uncle, and so on ; but the index of co-relation,
whicb is what I there called "regression," is different in the
different cases. In dealing with kinships there is usually no need
to reduce the measures to units of Q, because the Q values are alike
in all the kinsmen, being of the same value as that of the popula
tion at large.          It however happened that the very first case that I
analysed was different in this respect.                  It was the reciprocal relation
between     the   statures      of what     I called   the   " mid-parent " and the son.
The mid-parent is an ideal progenitor, whose stature is the average of
that of the father on the one hand and of that of the mother on the other,
after her stature had been transmuted into its male equivalent by the
multiplication of the factor of 1'08. The Q of the mid-parental statures
 was found to be 1'2, that of the population dealt with was 1'7. Again,
 the mean deviation measured in inches of the statures of the sons was

                                            /

found to be two-thirds of the deviation of the mid-parents, while the
mean deviation in inches of the mid-parent was one-third of the devia
tion of the sons. Here the regression, when calculated in Q units, is in

from       to    x     —   1 to 044, which is practically the same.

   The rationale of all this will be found discussed in the paper on
"
  Hereditary Stature," to which reference has already been made, and
in the appendix to it by Mr. J. D. Hamilton Dickson. The entries in
any table, such as Table II, may be looked upon as the values of
the vertical ordinates to a surface of frequency, whose mathematical
properties were discussed in the above-mentioned           appendix, there
fore   I need not repeat them here.        But there is always room for
legitimate doubt whether conclusions based on the strict properties of
the ideal law of error would be sufficiently correct to be serviceable in
actual cases of co-relation between variables that conform only
approximately to that law. It is therefore exceedingly desirable to
put the theoretical conclusions to frequent test, as has been done with
these anthropometric date.        The result is that anthropologists may
now have much less hesitation than before, in availing themselves of
the properties of the law of frequency of error.
   I have given in Table V a column headed v/(l— r3) = /. The
              /                               "
meaning of is explained in the paper on Hereditary Stature."            It is
the Q value of the distribution of any system of x values, as x\, x2, xx,
&c., round the mean of all of them, which we may call X. The
                 /
knowledge of enables dotted lines to be drawn, as in the figure above,
parallel to the line of M values, between which one half of the x
observations, for each value of y, will be included.        This value of   /
has much anthropological interest of its own, especially in connexion
with M. Bertillon's system of anthropometric identification, to which
I will not call attention now.
   It is not necessary to extend the list of examples to show how to
measure the degree in which one variable may be co-related with the
combined effect of n other variables, whether these be themselves
co-related or not.     To do so, we begin by reducing each measure into
others, each having the Q of its own system for a unit.            We thus
obtain a set of values that can be treated exactly in the same way
as the measures of a single variable were treated in Tables          II  and
onwards.     Neither is it necessary to give examples of a method
by  which   the   degree may be measured, in which the variables in a
series each member of which is the summed effect of n variables,
may be modified by their partial co-relation.        After transmuting the
separate measures as above, and then summing them, we should find
the probable error of any one of them to be Vn if the variables were

perfectly independent,          and   n   if they were rigidly and perfectly co-
related.         The observed value        would     be almost always somewhere
intermediate between these extremes, and would give the information
that is wanted.
    To conclude, the prominent characteristics of any two co-related
variables, so far at least as I have as yet tested them, are four in
number. It is supposed that their respective measures have been
first transmuted into others of which the unit is in each case equal to
the probable error of a single measure in its own series. Let y = the
 deviation of the subject, whichever of the two variables may be taken
 in that capacity ; and let xv x2, xs, &c., be the corresponding devia
 tions of the relative, and let the mean of these be X. Then we find :
  (1) that y = rX for all values of y ; (2) that r is the same, whichever
 of the two variables is taken for the subject ; (3) that r is always less
  than -1 ; (4) that r measures the closeness of co-relation.

        Section when the effective Head is due only to the Pipe's
        Inclination." By Henby Hennessy, F.R.S., Professor of
        Applied Mathematics in the Royal College of Science for
        Ireland.     Received November 15, 1888.
      In the paper on " Hydraulic Problems on the Cross-sections of
   Pipes and Channels,"* it was shown that the greatest hydraulic mean
   depth was that for a channel formed by a segment of a circle, and
   bounded by an arc of 257" 27'.                 It is easy to find by a similar
   process the wetted perimeter of a circular pipe corresponding to the
   maximum discharge when the velocity of the liquid is due only to
   the inclination of the pipe.
      Among the formulae adopted by hydraulic engineers for v, the mean
   velocity of liquid in a pipe whose hydraulic mean depth is u, we may
   select Darcy's, which gives

liquid falls below the summit of the inner surface of the pipe by
about the twentieth of the diameter. This result might be called a
hydraulic paradox, or the condition of a pipe carrying liquid at a

 nineteen-twentieths of its diameter than when completely full.

       phyte of Splachnum               luteum."       By J. R. Vaizey, M.A.,
       of Peterhouse,          Cambridge.            Communicated            by FRANCIS
       Darwin, F.R.S. Received December 3, 1888.
      The investigations of Haberlandt,* published in the latter part of
  1886, together with the results of investigations of my own, which
  were then just completed, and communicated to the Linnean Societyt
  early in 1887, convinced me of the importance of obtaining further
  knowledge of the highest development to which the sporophyte of
  the mosses attains, as being likely to throw light indirectly on the
  phylogeny of the higher Cryptogams and Phanerogams.                             Inquiring
 into the matter,       I  found   that   Splachnum luteum, Splachnum rubrum,
 and some few other forms were the most likely to yield the best
 results ; I determined, therefore, to obtain material for investigating
 their morphology.           These forms being arctio or subarctic,                    I  pnt
 myself    in   communication      with   Professor   Axel Blytt, of Christiania, to
 find out if he could either procure me material properly preserved for
 the purpose, or put me in the way of obtaining material if                          I   went
 myself to Norway.           From my correspondence with Professor Blytt, I
 concluded that the only really practicable course was to go myself,
 and obtain my own material in the different stages in which I
 required it.         To carry out this project,          I   applied for, and was
granted, assistance by the Royal Society.                   I, therefore, now tender
to the Society a brief outline of the first of my results.
                                                                  I
     I obtained after considerable search, in which was fortunate in
having the invaluable assistance of Professor Blytt and Dr. F. C. Kiaer,
whose knowledge of the habitats of Norwegian mosses is notorious, a
large quantity of Sp. luteum in many different stages of development ;
of Sp. rubrum I only obtained one specimen ; but beyond the mere
difference of colour there is little or no difference between the two
species.       The material was obtained in the marshy land on the top of
the watershed between the River Glommen and Lake Miosen, and on
t he south-eastern side of the Dovref jeld region.
     In the sporophyte of Splachnum luteum we have                    a  structure with
a   remarkable similarity to an umbrella, the handle end of which is
inserted in the tissues of the oophyte, and is known as the foot. The
seta is much elongated, bearing the umbrella-like expansion,                              the
apophysis, at       the  top just below     the   sporangium.      It  is   the   structure

of the apophysis and certain of the organs of the sporophyte with
which we are now concerned.
     A  transverse section through the vaginula, including the foot of the
sporophyte, shows that the tissues of the oophyte in this part contain
a considerable quantity of organic substance, and this is seen to be
more particularly the case in the layers of cells next to the foot. The
foot itself is seen to consist of a cylindrical mass of parenchyma, with
an external layer of epidermal cells of a somewhat columnar form,
which contain a considerable quantity of protoplasm, and contain
large distinct nuclei. The protoplasm of these cells is found to be
aggregated towards the peripheral surface, the nucleus being usually
found in the mass of protoplasm next to the outer wall of the cell.
The large vacuoles of these cells are traversed by fine protoplasmic
 filaments.      These cells, as well as those of the cortical layer beneath
 the epidermis, contain a number of very small protoplasmic bodies,
 which are found congregated in large numbers round the nuclei of
 the cells, there being also some in other parts of the cell, both in the
 peripheral layer and in the fine protoplasmic filaments traversing the
 vacuole.       In the epidermal cells these bodies are particularly
 numerous, and are found principally in the aggregated mass of proto
 plasm on the outer side of the cells.              These bodies may,        I think, be
 safely regarded as leucoplastids.            From their number and position, I
 am inclined to believe that they are concerned in absorbing substances
 from the tissue of the oophyte for the nourishment of the sporophyte.
 No starch has been found in the foot.
     In the centre of the foot there is a definite central strand consisting
 of two kinds of tissue, an outer phloem-like layer of cells containing
 protoplasm by means of which it is probable that organic substance
 travels, and an inner strand of very thin-walled cells without any
 protoplasmic contents* which conducts the water up the seta. In the
  foot the protoplasm of the phloem-like cells is aggregated in each
  cell towards the periphery as in the epidermal cells, but there are no
  plastids present.          The strand of thin-walled empty cellsf               I  have
  been able to prove in other species of Splachnum conveys the water
  absorbed by the foot up the seta into the tissues of the apophysis.
      The seta has a distinct epidermis beneath which there is a layer of
  Bclerotic supporting tissue, and then a layer of parenchyma, the two
  together forming the cortex.             In the centre is the central strand,
  which in the lower end of the seta has almost the same structure as
  that described for the central strand of the foot, from which it is
  distinguished by being larger and less distinctly delimited from the

  cortex.      Higher up in the seta there is a large intercellular canal
  formed in the middle of the axile strand of thin-walled empty cells
  which extends for nearly its whole length. This intercellular space
  is lysigenous in origin.           A  similar passage or canal occurs in several
   other species.
      A longitudinal           median     section through the umbrella-shaped
   apophysis shows        that    the central strand here swells out into a large
  pear-shaped mass of cells, that in the mature sporophyte contain
  no protoplasm, and even in the younger states only a very small
  quantity with small, inconspicuous nuclei.                 Chlorophyll bodies are
  absent except in the two outermost                  layers of cells, even in the
  youngest specimens observed, and even here there are only a very
  few.     The cells are all thin-walled, and cubical in shape, with no
  intercellular spaces between them.               In this tissue, which may be
  regarded      as a kind of aqueous tissue, large masses of crystalline
  inorganio matter were frequently found.
     Outside the aqueous tissue there is a quantity of parenchymatous
  tissue, with numbers of communicating intercellular spaces.                        The
 cells all contain large numbers of chlorophyll bodies.                    This tissue
  extends into the umbrella-shaped organ.                  On the upper surface in
 the proximal region the cells are arranged close to one another, and
  sh w a distinct tendency to an elongation of their axes in a direction
  vertical to the surface, thus forming a palisade tissue similar to that
 in the tissues of the vascular plants.* This is rendered more striking
 by a comparison with the parenchyma of the lower surface in the
 same region, where the cells are much elongated in a direction parallel
 to the surface, and with very much larger intercellular spaces. The
 distal region of the apophysis shows that the cells of both upper and
 lower surfaces have undergone a considerable lengthening in the
 direction parallel to the surfaces, but that the upper as compared with
 the lower has still a resemblance to palisade.                Stomata are found in
 considerable numbers in the epidermis of the upper surface, but there
 are none on the lower. The epidermis consists of a very distinct
 layer of cells without chlorophyll, the outer walls of which are
 cuticularised, and have a distinct cuticle.
     A large quantity of starch is formed in the cells of the apophysis
 by the chloroplasts-, each chloroplast containing a number of separate
 starch grains. When the apophysis is quite young, at this time
 being green, immediately on its beginning to become umbrella-
 shaped, and before the spores ripen, the starch begins to be formed.
At a later stage the starch disappears, the starch-forming plastids,

which     before were large and well formed, degenerate into small and
comparatively inconspicuous bodies, the starch apparently being used
up in the formation of spores. In all probability there is at this
period a formation of xanthophyll, which would account for the
yellow colour of the apophysis in the mature condition of the
sporangium, and hence the name of the species.
    That    the apophysis      performs the functions of a leaf, and is there
fore analogous with the leaves of vascular plants,          I  think there can
now be no doubt. And as this structure is a development of the
sporophyte, the possibility of its being also homologous either directly
or indirectly suggests itself.         I  am myself inclined to believe that
the two are homologous; but to give a full discussion of that question
would be beyond the scope of the present communication.
  IV. "A        Contribution to the Knowledge of Protection against
       Infectious Diseases." By Alfbed Lingaud, M.B., M.S. Durh.,
       Diplomate in Public Health, Cambridge.              Communicated by
       Dr. E.    Klein,    F.R.S. Received December 3, 1888.
     It has    long been known, and it is now a well-established fact, that
 various eruptive fevers and blood diseases from which the mother may
 suffer, can be communicated to the foatus in utero.          There is evidence
 also to prove that a disease may be transmitted to the fcetus through
 a mother who is herself insusceptible to contagium, as in the case of a
 child having been born covered with small-pox eruption, the mother
 being quite free from it.        The following are the diseases upon which
 the most important observations have been made : — Syphilis, small
 pox, tnberculosis, anthrax, and relapsing fever.           In the three latter
 the organisms producing these diseases have been found in the body
 of the fcetus at birth, having passed through the placental vessels.
     In the present paper I wish to contribute to the other side of the
 question, viz., the relation existing between the fcetus and its mother,
 or, in other words, the influence, if any, exerted by the foetus on the
 mother, when       the fo,tus becomes the subject of an infectious disease con
  tracted   independently of the mother. All the comments made from
 this standpoint have, with the exception of one, been in relation to
 svphilis ; the one being an instance communicated by Vidal, of a
 father attacked at the time of conception with small-pox, the fcetus at
  six months being covered, during the whole of which period the mother
  remained healthy.         With regard to syphilis, we are indebted to Colics
 for the first practical observation noted in 1837, when he cited as a
  carious fact, that he had never witnessed or even heard of an instance
  in which a child deriving the infection of syphilis from its parents,
  had caused an ulceration in the breast of the mother.
                                                                     i. 2

 15%                 Protection against Infectious Diseases.      [Dec. 20,
     At   the present time, however, we are able to go a step farther, and
 say —
     (1.) That a healthy woman become pregnant by a syphilitic man,
 may give birth to a syphilitic child, and still remain healthy herself.
     (2.) That this woman suckling a syphilitic child is not exposed to
 contagion from it.
    This singular immunity remains only to be explained, and we have
to determine whether it is not explicable, as one is led to think, by a
 special kind of protection derived from the foetus.
     Several years ago it occurred to me as feasible to attempt the eluci
 dation of this proposition by means of some virus other than that of
 syphilis, this disease having been found incapable of communication
 to the lower animals.        For this purpose none appeared to be more
 suitable than that of anthrax, on account of tho properties and life-
 history of this organism being so well understood, and also by reason
 of the very short period of time this disease takes to run its course to
a fatal termination after inoculation in most of the lower animals.
    The results of this investigation I propose giving in the following
pages : —
    [. It is possible to directly inoculate a fcetus in utero of a living
rabbit with an active growth of anthrax, without the bacillary disease
being      communicated     to the mother ; and further, the remaining
 foetuses of   this pregnancy under certain conditions have been found to
receive a like protection. A control animal subcutaneonsly inoculated
 with the same growth died in sixty-eight hours.
    II. The mother may give birth to a litter of healthy young ones
some days later, with the exception of the one primarily inoculated
with anthrax, which is always dead when born.           The longest period
of parturition after inoculation was ten days.
    III. The blood of the mother during the time intervening between
 the inoculation of the fcetus and parturition does not reveal the pre
sence of the anthrax bacillus when examined —
    (i.) By fresh cover-glass preparations.
    (ii.) By aniline stained cover-gl-iss preparations.
    (iii.) By cultivations, gelatine at 21° C., and agar-agar at 37" C.
    (iv.) By symptoms when animals were inoculated with it.
    IV. The mother        subsequently  inoculated with tho blood of an
animal dead of anthrax, whose blood was swarming with the Bacillus
anthracis,     does not succumb, but is found to have received protection.
The control animal died in forty-eight hours.
    V. Twenty-four hours after this second inoculation to prove pro
tection or otherwise,     no anthrax bacilli were found in the blood of the
mother.       Proved as in No. III.
    VI. The same animal, when re-inoculated with the anthrax blood
eight months later, was proved to be still protected.

    VII.   The shortest period observed intervening between the inocu
lation of the foetus in utero and parturition, after which the mother
was found to be protected against the inoculation of virulent anthrax
blood, was thirty-six hours.
    VIII. For the protection of the Surviving foetuses, or those other
than the one primarily inoculated with anthrax in utero, a longer
exposure is required than the minimum thirty-six hours observed to
protect the mother.      Or the surviving foetuses may have received pro
tection, provided that a period of not less than six days have elapsed
 between the primary inoculation of the foetus in utero and parturi
tion.
    IX. In   those cases where the mother died    of anthrax contracted at
the time of the inoculation of the foetus in utero, and excepting the
last-mentioned     one, the heart's blood of the other foetuses in utero
was not found to contain any anthrax bacilli, as proved by cultivations
when the examination was made, several hours after the death of the
mother.      But if the examination and cultivations were made some
 sixty or seventy hours later, then any or all of the foetuses, according
to the temperature of the air prevailing, may have anthrax bacilli in
 their blood.
    [X. The inoculation of a foetus in utero with anthrax may produce
one of three results : —
    (i.) If during the inoculation of a foetus the anthrax bacilli gain
            entrance into the tissues of the mother, owing to imperfect
            manipulation, the mother naturally succumbs to the disease,
    (ii.) In some cases the organisms pass through from the foetal to
            the maternal vessels ; this is probably due to some change
            taking place in the placental tissues, either inflammatory or
            traumatic in origin.
    (iii.) Lastly, in those cases where the foetus alone is inoculated, the
            mother remains free from the bacillary disease, and at a later
            date is found to have acquired immunity. — Jan. 22, 1889.]
    XI. In sections of the placenta of the foetus primarily inoculated
 with anthrax in utero, and through which the mother received pro
 tection, the anthrax bacilli, after staining with aniline dyes, are to be
seen wholly in the foetal, while there is a total absence of them in the
maternal portion.

   In  the Bakerian      Lecture given last Session*            I  detailed the spectro
scopic evidence which in my opinion shows that the various orders
of nebulae and stars are produced by the presence and subsequent
condensation of meteoric swarms in space, the most uncondensed ones
giving rise to the appearances which we term nebulae, the more con
densed ones to those which we term stars.
   Since the lecture was delivered, my assistants and myself have been
employed not only in continuing the experiments, but in bringing
together and co-ordinating as great a number of recorded observa
tions as possible, along those lines which seemed likely to furnish the
most severe tests as to the validity of the conclusions stated in my
former communications.
   Among the lines on which this work has been done are the follow
ing:—
   1.  Spectra of Comets. — Here the test is as follows : — It is generally
accepted that comets are meteor-swarms in the solar system.                           They
get brighter, and therefore they must be hotter, as they approach the
sun.     Their spectra, then, if my hypothesis is true, must resemble
those of gradually condensing swarms outside the system.
   2. Spectra     of Aurora. — Here the test is as follows : — 400,000,000
meteorites, big and little, are encountered by the earth every day.
The air should contain some of their debris. If in aurorre the solid
particles are acted on by an electric current, the spectral phenomena
presented by glow tubes should be reproduced to a greater or less
extent in the spectrum of the aurora.
   3. Origin of Double Stars. — Here the test is as follows : — The ap
parently single variable stars of the Mira type are on the hypothesis
produced by the interaction of two or more swarms ; they are in fact
double nebulae.       Visible physical doubles are probably then of the
same nature ; if so, in the present absence of complete knowledge of
their spectra, colour phenomena may help us to discuss their probable
origin.

I. "ON THE SPECTRA OF METEORIC                               SWARMS IN THE
                               SOLAR SYSTEM."
           I. Views of Rkichenrach, Schiaparelli,                and    Tait.
    Reichenbach was the first to bring forward a large amount of
evidence (founded on the study of meteorites) indicating that comets
were in all probability swarms of meteorites* in our own system
moving in orbits round the sun.
    Accepting as proved by the then knowledge the most intimate
connexion between meteorites and falling stars, Reichenbach reasoned
that both were connected with comets in the following manner.                     He
first recapitulated the facts then accepted with regard to comets :              —
    (1.) Comets, both tail and nucleus are transparent.
    (2.) Light is transmitted through comets without refraction ; hence
the cometary substance can be neither gaseous nor liquid.
    (3.) The light is polarised, and therefore borrowed from the sun.
    (4.) Comets have no phases like those of moon and planets.
    (5.) They exercise no perturbing influences.
    (6.) Donati's comet (which was then visible) in its details and its
contour is changing every day — according to Piazzi, almost hourly.
    (7.) The density of a comet is extremely small.
    (8.) The »bso!ute weight is sometimes small (von Littrow having
 calculated the masses of very small comets, tail and all, as scarcely
 reaching 8 lbs ).
    From these data the following conclusions might be drawn : —
    (1.) That a comet's tail must consist of a swarm of extremely small
 but solid particles, therefore granules.
    (2.) That every granule is far away from its neighbour — in fact,
 so far that a ray of light may have an uninterrupted course through
 the swarm.
    (3.) That these granules, suspended in space, move freely and yield
 to outer and inner agencies — agglomerate, condense, or expand ; that
 a comet's nucleus, where one is present, is nothing else than such an
 agglomeration of loose substances consisting of particles.
    Hence we must piclure a comet as a loose, transparent, illuminated,
 free-moving swarm of small solid granules suspended in empty space.
    The next step in Reichenbach's reasoning was to show that
 meteorites     (of which he had a profound knowledge) were really
 composed    of  granules.
     He pointed out that these granules (since called chondroi) formed
  really the characteristic structure both of irons and stones, so that both
 orders were chiefly aggregates of chondroi — stony ones in iron
 meteorites, iron ones in stony meteorites.
                   * I'ofgeiKloiff, '

1889.]         of  the  various Species    of Heavenly Bodies.                161
   In   some irons,   such as Zacatecas,       they exist as big as walnuts,
firmly adherent, but they can be separated ; inside these are balls of
troilite often firmly embedded, so that on breaking the meteorite they
will divide, but in other cases so loose that they fall out, and they are
smooth enough to roll off a table.
   Sometimes chondroi have smaller ones sprinkled in them, sometimes
dark chondroi have white earthy kernels.
   In some cases these chondroi are so plentiful as to form nearly the
whole mass of the meteorite.            They are often perfectly round, but
not always, and they are       so often so loose that they tumble out and
leave an empty smooth spherical cavity.
   The stones chiefly consist of such chondroi and their debris.
   He adds that each magnetic chondros " is an independent crystal
lised individual — it is a stranger in the meteorite.              Every chondros
was once a complete, independent, though minute meteorite.                   It is
embedded like a shell in limestone.         Millions of years may have passed
between the formation of the spherule and its embeddal."
   He finally remarks that the chondroi of meteorites indicate a con
densation of innumerable bodies such as we see must exist in the case
of comets ; further, that they have been formed in a state of unrest
and impact from all sides.         Mauy meteorites are true breccias ; they
have many times suffered mechanical violence : in comets we have
seen precisely the conditions where such forces could operate, and
hence he arrives at the view that :I comets and meteorites maybe
nothing else but one and the same phenomenon."
   Schiaparelli* in 1886 showed the probability that comets, with
which he had identified certain recurring streams of shooting stars,
were swarms of meteorites drawn from the depths of space by the
attraction of the outer planets of the solar system or by the general
attraction of the system itself.
   Schiaparelli did not look upon the head of a comet as a swarm of
meteors as Reichenbach did, but regarded it as the largest meteorite
in the stream which produced the star-shower. " Nous voici done
arrives a cette consequence veritablement inattendue, que la grande
comete de 1862 n'est autre qu'une des Perseides dn. mois d'Aout, et
e'est probablement     la plus considerable de toutes."t
   Professor Tait in 1869, supporting the opinion of Reichenbach,
showed that the cometary phenomena to which Reichenbach had
called attention could bo mechanically explained by the assumption
of a cloud of meteorites.
   He writes : " The principal object of the paper is to investigate
how far the singular phenomena exhibited by the tails of comets, and
by the envelopes of their nuclei, the shrinking of their nuclei as they

approach   the sun, and vice versa, as well as the diminution of period
presented by some of them, can be explained on the probable supposi
tion that a comet is a mare cloud of small masses such as stones and
fragments of meteoric    iron, shining by reflected light alone, except
where these masses impinge on one another, or on other matter
circulating round the sun, and thus produce luminous gases, along
with considerable modifications of their relative motions.    Thus the
gaseous spectrum of the nucleus was assigned to the same impacts
which throw out from the ranks those masses which form the tail.''*
   It is not too much to say that at the present time it is generally
accepted that the heads of comets are meteor- swarms, possibly the
densest portion of each swarm, or portions with the same orbit in the
case of multiple comets.
   I propose now to set forth the spectroscopic evidence which I have
obtained bearing upon the nature of, and the changes which take place
in, these meteoric swarms which have become entangled in our
system.

                                Magnesium Radiation,      X.   500.
   When a tube such as I have already described is used in experiments
to determino the spectrum of meteoric dust at the lowest temperature,
we find that the dust in many cases gives a spectrum containing the
magnesium fluting at 500, which is characteristic of the nebulae, and
is often seen alone in them.     If the difference between nebulae and
comets is merely of cosmographical      position, one being out of the
solar system, and one being in            it,

regards rest are the same, the spectrum should be the same, and we
ought to find this line in the spectrum of comets, when the swarm
most approaches the undisturbed nebulous condition, the number of
collisions being at or near a minimum, i.e., when the comet        near      is
aphelion, the fluting should be visible alone.
   As a matter of fact in comets of 1866 and 1867, when they were
observed away from the sun, the only line seen was the one at 500.                f

nitrogen, while the nebulosity surrounding the nucleus and forming the coma

his observations      on the Great Comet (6) 1882 (date of perihelion
passage September 27th) on November 1st, was the low- temperature
flnting of magnesium at 500. By that date the D line and the carbon
flutings had passed their maximum intensity, and had begun to fade
ont.
   The same fluting was also seen by Vogel in Coggia's Comet (IV,
1874) as a bright line at about 499, when the comet was yet a month
from perihelion, and when therefore the appearance of the low-
temperature      characteristic of the magnesium spectrum would be
expected.
                                          I
   It is fair to myself to Bay that was not aware of these observa
tions when     I  began my recent researches.             The fact of the line at
500 remaining alone in Nova Cygni, however, made it clear that if
my views were correct,       the same thing should happen with comets.
It  now turns out that the crucial observation which I intended to
make was made more than twenty-two years ago.
   This spectroscopic evidence is of the strongest, bnt it does not
stand alone ; comets at aphelion present the telescopic appearance for
the most part of globular nebulae.
   If it be taken as generally accepted that comets are of nebnlous
origin, it must be remembered that there are no visible nebulae near
enough to our system to supply this material. Prior, therefore, to the
effects produced by solar or planetary attraction, the material was in
a state of repose ; there were no collisions, and therefore no luminosity.
It is not surprising, then, that the faintest comets and the faintest
nebulae should both, as a rule, be of globular form.
                                Carbon Radiation.
   It is well known that comets generally give us the spectrum of
carbon at some time or another on their journey to and from the sun.
The question arises, is there any evidence that when at some dis
tance from the sun the carbon phenomena observed indicate a low-
temperatnre ? Is the presence of low-temperature magnesium asso
ciated with low-temperature flutings of carbon P
   In my paper* of November 17th, 1887, I gave a map showing the
two sets of flutings, and one to show low and high temperatures.
The brightest edges of the three principal flutings in the low-tempera
ture spectrum are at wave-lengths 519-7, 560-7, and 483-3, and those
in the high-temperature spectrum are at 516-4, 563-3, and 473-6.
The two first flutings in each of the two spectra fall pretty near to
those in the other, and a considerable degree of accuracy, which has
not in a great number of cases been attained in the observations of
cometary bands, is therefore necessary before we can say with abso-

late certainty from observations of either of these two bands whether
the spectrum is that of hot or cool carbon.
    If, however, the fluting at 483 is present, we can be certain that
we have to deal with cool carbon, because no hot carbon fluting falls
near that wave-length.            In laboratory experiments with Geissler
tubes, the passage from one spectrum to the other is very gradual,
so that it is not uncommon to have the two spectra superposed, and
 we might therefore expect a reproduction of this in cometary spectra,
and I have no doubt that the changes from the cool to the hot carbon
spectrum are answerable for many of the apparent discrepancies in
different observations of the same comet, as I pointed out in November,
 1887.
    There is another difficulty which must not be passed over ; indi
 vidual observations have not in all cases been recorded.                  Observers
 have in many cases been in the habit of giving the means of their
 several observations, and hence the differences in wave-length of the
 flutings due to the changes from cool to hot carbon, or vice versa, if
 they exist, cannot be certainly followed in man)- cases.
    A discussion of all the recorded observations at my disposal, how
 ever, shows that in some comets we have distinct evidence of cool
 carbon flutings, but as happens with the magnesium fluting at                  \ 500,
 the observations recording them are comparatively few.                  The reason
 is probably the same in both cases,             namely,      that the temperature
 being low, the light is consequently             excessively feeble, and obser
 vations are very difficult..
     We have evidence of cool carbon in Winnecke's Comet, 1868 (peri
 helion passage, June 25th). On the 17th June, M. Wolf* recorded
 three flutings, the wave-lengths of which, as determined by a curve,
 are about 480, 517, and 560. These differ from their equivalents in
 the cool carbon spectrum by almost equal amounts, so there can
 be    little doubt that        the   comet's    spectrum       was   that   of   cool
 carbon.
     At   the return of this comet        in 1877, cool carbon was again ob
  served when    it wa<j   about a month from perihelion. f The perihelion
  passage occurred on April 17th, and the observation was made on
 May 15th. Two bands were measured, one at 517, and the other
  near 483. Another was also seen near 561. As the criterion for cool
  carbon is the fluting at 483, there can be no doubt of its identity in
  this case.
     Again, in Brorsen's Comet (1879), perihelion passage 30th March,
  KonkolyJ observed three flutings at wave-lengths 482-3, 514p6, and
  560-5, the first of which coincides very nearly with the characteristic

     When meteorite dust is more strongly heated in a glow tube, the
 whole tube, when the electric current is passing, gives us the fluted
 spectrum of carbon, and other bright metallic flutings are added to
 that of magnesium at 500. Among those metallic flutings which are
 first added may be chiefly mentioned Mg 5210 and Mn (1) 558.
     Both these as well as the high-temperature fluting of carbon, have
been seen in comets, and I now proceed to give the details of the
observations.

     It will  be seen that       in each of these cases the observations were
made when the comets were at a considerable                distance from perihelion,
when the temperature            would not be very high, although higher than
that which gives Mg 500.
                                    Carbon Radiation.
     When a comet gets nearer the sun there is a change in its spectrum
similar to that observed in the experimental tube at the second stage
of heat.       Not only does the magnesium radiation change, as we have
seen,     but the  spectrum of carbon, produced from some compound of
carbon or another, in nineteen cases out of twenty when the comet
gets nearer the sun, and near enough to the earth to be satisfactorily
observed, becomes most prominent.
     Under these conditions, under which comets generally lend them
selves best to spectroscopic study, the spectrum consists chiefly there
fore of the flutings of hot carbon.               In the majority of cases the
spectrum of a comet has not been recorded until it has arrived at
this stage of temperature.
     The three chief flutings of hot carbon have their least refrangible
maxima at approximately 517, 564, and 474.                        The accompanying
table indicates some of the comets in which they have been observed.
The variations in the position of the citron band will be again re
ferred to.
     It is necessary to state that the maximum luminosity of the blue
band, under some conditions, is at about 468.                    As I have so often
had occasion to refer to this,            I  here  reproduce (fig. 2) one of the

The diagram is taken from a photograph of the spectrnm of alcohol
vapour in a capillary tube with a 9-inch spark.
  The conditions under which this band has its maximum                                                               luminosity
at 468 in Geissler tubes seem to be those of maximum conductivity.
If the pressure be high all the members of the group are sharp, and
the   luminosity of the band is almost uniform throughout.        This
always occurs when the pressure is very low. At intermediate stages
of pressure, however, the luminosity of the band has a very decided
maximum at about 468.
   This latter condition has been reproduced in many comets, though
generally the band has been stated to end at 474, or thereabouts, the
maximum possibly having been overlooked.
   It seems probable that a detailed study of this band in our labora
tories will enable us in the future to determine the approximate
temperature of a comet by the appearance of this band in its
spectrum.

attributed to faulty observation          ; but this is certainly not so    in all
cases.
   The following, which         I  quote from Dr. Copeland's discussion of
observations on comet spectra, is important in its bearing upon this
           "
point : — We cannot omit to say a few words about the first —
yellowish-green band. It is generally described as similar to the two
other bands, beginning brightest towards the red, and fading
gradually away towards the violet. It is true the dispersive power
of the instrument greatly modifies the appearance, but we must say,
that nnder high dispersion we have never seen the first band like the
others : it always faded away on both sides, and had seldom a very
marked maximum, sometimes it had two, and, perhaps, more, and it
seems to be the only band which shows an essentially different
appearance in different comets, and, therefore, deserves always a
special examination. Unfortunately, it is nearly always the faintest
band, and difficult to deal with, and only in Comet III, 1881, traces of
what may be bright lines were recognisable ; that the iron lines have
any connexion with it is very doubtful, since E falls outside of it."*
   Again, Professor Young remarks : —
   " It is
           hardly necessary to say that the evidence as to the identity
of the flame and comet spectrum is almost overwhelming. The
peculiar, ill-defined appearance of the cometary bands at the time of
the comet's greatest brightness is, however, something which I have
not succeeded in imitating with the flame spectrum.                     The comet
spectrum on    July   25th certainly presented a general appearance quite
different from that of the later observations as regards the definition
of the bands."f
   Other observers      have also remarked this variability          in the citron
band.
   A  discussion   of the recorded        observations shows that this varia
bility is perfectly regular, and depends chiefly on the distance of the
comet from perihelion.        When carbon first makes its appearance in
the spectrum as the comet approaches the sun, the wave-length of
the citron band agrees with that of the carbon fluting at 504. As
the comet gets nearer perihelion the changes begin, and I now proceed
to show that the irregularities are produced by a special case of
masking due to the addition of the radiation of manganese or of
manganese and lead.
                                                 I
   In the Bakerian Lecture (page 63) showed that in the spectra of
some "stars" the characteristics of the spectra of many subvtances
are considerably inodiu'ed by what          I  called " masking." Thus in the
early species of Group       II  we have manganese indicated, not by the
first fluting at 558, but by the second at 586. This is due to the

masking effect of the bright carbon Hating beginning at 564. The
radiation of manganese, and sometimes of lead, is added to that of
carbon, since the first fluting (558) of manganese falls in the carbon
band ; the result is a new band of a different form. A further com
plication, as we shall see, is added when lead, as well as manganese,
makes its appearance.
   The addition of the manganese radiation does not take place in all
comets at an equal number of days from the perihelion passage ; it
depends upon the perihelion distance, so that the irregularities in
question are not observed in all comets.

   When we deal with the integration of the bright manganese
fluting at 558, which fades away towards the red, and the carbon
fluting at 564, fading towards the blue, we have as a result a band
brightest in the centre and fading off iu both directions. If both
flutings are well developed there will be a single broad maximum
extending from 558 to 564, as shown in fig. 3. If both were rather

            IV. The Stage Immediately Pbeceding Pebihelion.
                              Manganese Absorption.
    It  has been pointed out that in the case of a comet approaching
perihelion, manganese is first represented by the radiation of the
fluting at 558. As the comet gets nearer to perihelion, if the
perihelion distance      be sufficiently    small, we find the          radiation    of
manganese replaced by absorption.
    The reason that the presence of the strongest manganese fluting at
558 has not been previously recorded is, I fancy, that the masking
effects of one spectrum on another, to which          I referred in the Bakerian
 Lecture, have not been present in the minds of even those observers
 who were familiar with low-temperature spectra.
    I have obtained abundant evidence that the masking phenomena
manifest themselves in the spectra of comets, but since there is in
general so little continuous spectrum to be absorbed (from which we
can gather that the meteorites are farther apart in comets at this stage
than they are in many stars of Group II), we have chiefly to deal,
when discussing absorption, with the masking of the radiating citron
fluting of carbon by the absorption of metallic vapours.
   The way in which the manganese absorption shows itself in comets
is generally by the obliteration of the red end of the citron fluting,
which produces an apparent shifting of the carbon fluting towards the
more refrangible part of the spectrum.            The way in which this comes
about    is   shown  in  fig.  5.   The   manganese absorption            masks the
                                                           Hot carbon radiation.

 The result is an apparent displacement of the 564 fluting, whilst the
 517 fluting retains its position. This is by far the most general case
 of masking in comets.
     D'Arrest (' Astr. Nachr.,' No. 2001, p. 138), speaking of Coggia's
 Comet, says : — " The centre shows a bright continuous spectrum with
 some dark absorption bands."                   This observation was made on June
 15th, and the perihelion passage of the comet took place on July 8th,
 1874. The statement is so indefinite, however, that to determine the
 origin of the bands is almost out of the question.                            It is probable that
 one of the bands at least was due to manganese.                                The above view is
strengthened by         the   fact that    Vogel's     observation          on  June 15th (' Astr.
 Nachr.,' vol. 85, p. 19) gave indications of manganese absorption.
     There is another interesting point in connexion with manganese.
 In the second part of this Appendix I show that the principal
 aurora line (557) is in all probability the remnant of the manganese
fluting at 558, and hence there is a close relation between the spectrum
of the aurora and cometary spectra.                          Professor Young recognised
this relation as far back as 1872, but he attached no importance to it.
In a note on Encke's Comet§ § he states that, "Although quite probably
merely accidental, it may be also worth noting that the principal line
of the aurora spectrum (wave-length 5568) very closely coincides
with the lowest (cometary) band."
                                         Lead Absorption.
    In other cases we have, in addition to the absorption of manganese,
the absorption of the lead fluting at 546. The result of this is a much
greater apparent shifting of the carbon fluting at 564, as shown in
fig. 6. In the absence of the carbon fluting 564, which is not so

persistent as the one at 517, we should still get pretty nearly the
same result by contrast ; that is, the darkening due to absorption
commencing at 545 would give rise to an apparent bright fluting at
5i6, fading away on the more refrangible side. This occurred in the

    It is important to note, as a test of the validity of this explana
tion, that the lead fluting never occurs without the manganese one,
otherwise we should get two bright maxima, one at 5(34, and the other
at 546.
    In   the case of Comet       III,   1881, it seems probable that both the first
and second flntings of lead were absorbing.                    Copeland (- Copernicus,-
vol. 2, p. 226) states that on June 25th, there was a dark band at
567-9.      The perihelion          passage of the comet occurred                      on June
16th,     and   the    band     was not seen in its spectrum on any other
occasion.
    There can     be   little doubt that the band at 567-9 was due to lead

the first band at 546 was evidently masked by the bright carbon

                                Carbon Absorption.
    There are     a few cases in which we probably have to deal with
comparatively feeble manganese absorption, together with the
absorption of cool carbon masking the radiatiou of hot carbon.                  Here
both the hot carbon flutings are affected, instead of one as in the
previous cases. With regard to the 564 fluting, we have the cool
carbon absorption fluting at 560- 7, masking the third maximum of the
hot carbon fluting at 554, and the manganese fluting at 558 dimming
the first maximum.         The result is a band with two maxima as shown
in fig. 7, one of these being at 564 and the other at 554 (the

brighter.
    With regard to the other hot carbon fluting at 517, we have the
cool carbon     absorption masking the first maximum, and we get the
apparently paradoxical result of the second maximum of the fluting
being brighter than the first, as shown in fig. 7.
    It is probable, too, that at this stage the outer layers of the hot
oarbon vapour would also begin to absorb ; this would show itself in
the brightest least refrangible maxima.             Just as the masking of D by
the balancing of absorption and radiation gives us the

June 5th a fluting with its sharpest edge at 615-7, which he supposed
to be the red sodium line at 615.            The iron fluting has its maximum
at 615, and fades away on the less refrangible side; hence, when
absorbing, it will give rise to such an apparent bright band as that
observed by Vogel and Hasselberg in Comet Wells.
                V. The Final Stage of Hkat — Pebihelion.
   There is evidence to show that when a comet arrives at its shortest
distance from the sun, the mean temperature effects are exceeded ;
and that, speaking generally, a line replaces a fluted spectrum, and
we pass from a spectrum very similar to that which we ordinarily
get in a glow-tube to one which we cannot produce in it until we
employ the highest temperature.                The spectral conditions brought
about in the comets which in our time have got nearest to the sun,
have been almost similar to those observed in the oxy-coal-gas flame;
and the recorded observations of the spectrum show that we are
dealing with the lines of iron, manganese, and other substances seen
at that temperature, which is below that of the electric arc.
   We see in the telescope that a comet under the conditions of neai

approach     to the sun, puts on the appearance of a central nucleus
 (or  nuclei), with surrounding envelopes, or jets, or both. Because
the former now falls upon one part of the slit of the spectroscope, and
the latter upon another, the difference between the nucleus and the
envelopes is best made out when the comet is nearest to the sun and
 earth.
    When a comet approaches very near to the sun, we get the bright
 lines, especially in the spectrum of the nucleus, so that in addition to the
 long flutings of carbon (if they be then visible), we have short lines
 added along the nucleus in the red, yellow, green, and so on.
    The lines characteristic of the more volatile substances extend some
distance from the nucleus.
    It does not always happen, however, that a comet gives a bright
 line spectrum while near or at perihelion, for the perihelion passage
may occur at some distance from the sun, and then the spectrum
 will be simpler.
    In Comets b, 1881 (perihelion passage June 16), and d, 1882
 (perihelion passage September 17), the only lines recorded were
 magnesium 6 ; but the apparent absence of the other lines might be
 due to continuous spectrum.
    It should be noted that the greatest brilliancy and maximum of
action is observed after perihelion, hence the temperature must be
highest after perihelion.
                             Magnesium      Radiation.
    In  cometary spectra we have already seen that magnesium is first
indicated by the fluting at 500, and at a more advanced stage by the
fluting at 521. There is evidence to show that magnesium is repre
sented by b at perihelion.       This was the case in the Great Comet of
 1882 as observed by Copeland on September 18th, the day after
perihelion passage 6 was probably also seen in Comet III, 1881, by
Copeland* (perihelion passage, June 16th). It is described as a well-
defined bright line standing at the edge of the bright-green band.
                                Carbon Radiation.
    The disappearance of the flutings of carbon in comets which have
short perihelion distances when near perihelion, taken in conjunction
with laboratory experiments, at once suggests that the disappearance
of the flutings ought to be accompanied by the appearance of carbon
lines.
    The principal line in the spectrum of carbon is at wave-length
426. This has only been recorded on two occasions, in cometary
spectra, namely in Comet Wells.            On May 28th (perihelion passage,

  178           Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.        On    the  Classification    [Jan. 10r
  June 10th), Copeland redorded a bright line at 426-1, and it was also
  possibly shown in Huggins's photograph of the spectrum of the same
  comet taken on May 31st, its wave-length being given as 425-3.              On
  each of these occasions, other evidences of carbon were entirely absent,
 and the bright lines present in the spectrum gave indications of
 a relatively high temperature.
     There are several reasons why the carbon line spectrum has not
 been recorded a greater number of times.                First, very few comets
 approach sufficiently near the sun to attain the necessary temperature.
 Second, the principal line is in a part of the spectrum which is very
 difficult to observe.    Even in the Great Comet of 1882, which was
 very bright, the observations did not go beyond 465.
    This conclusion cannot be regarded as final until careful differential
 observations of nucleus, envelopes, and jets are made. At present
 the exact part of the comet the spectrum of which is described is
generally not stated, and there is evidence that, up to the highest
 temperature produced by collisions, carbon in some form is liberated
 from the meteorites composing the cometary swarm.
            the Perihelion Conditions of     the Great Comet     of 1882.
    As the perihelion distances are different in different comets, we
must expect the effects to be more decided in some cases than others.
The most remarkable case since the beginning of spectroscopic inquiry
was afforded by the Great Comet of 1882, most admirably observed
by Copeland.
    It is found that many of the lines which have been observed at
perihelion are coincident with lines seen in experiments with meteo
rites, while the low temperature lines of magnesium are absent. In
the Great Comet of 1882, the lines recorded were the D lines of
sodium, the low temperature iron lines at 5268, 5327, 5371, 5790, and
6024, the line seen in the manganese spectrum at the temperature of
the bunsen burner at 5395, and a line near 6 which might be due to
magnesium, or to a remnant of the carbon fluting.               There were also
four other lines less refrangible than D, the origin of which has not
yet been determined.
    The following is a complete list of the lines recorded by Copeland
and Lohse* on the day after perihelion passage. The origins of the
lines which my observations have suggested are also given.

    Again, in Comet Wells almost the same phenomena were exhibited
 as  in the Great Comet of 1882. In this case the perihelion passage
 occurred under such conditions that the spectrum of the comet could
 not be satisfactorily observed on account of the interference of day
 light. Detailed observations, however, were made when the comet
 was near     perihelion and its temperature sufficiently high to give
 bright lines.      The following table gives the bright lines and bands
 with their probable origins, observed in the comet on May 31st, 1882,

                          Line Absorption at Perihelion.
   It has been seen that the first evidence of the appearance of ab
sorption in comets is that afforded by the Sittings of manganese and
lead, which mask the citron band of carbon. The next indication of
absorption is that of the iron fluting at 615.
   Line absorption was observed in Coggia's Comet (1874) by
Christie, on July 14th, but he gives no definite wave-lengths for
the lines seen. He says : — The spectrum of the nucleus was con
tinuous ; it appeared to have traces of numerous bright bands, and
three or four dark lines also were seen on several occasions, but
owing to passing clouds, they were lost before their position could be
determined.        One appeared to be between D and E, another on the
blue side of b, and a third near F.*
   The perihelion passage of the comet occurred on July 8th.
   There were also evidences of absorption in Comet Wells, as observed
at Greenwich.
   " Two dark
                   spaces were seen near F ; the less refrangible one was
measured and its wave-length determined as 4862 tenth-metres. It
therefore probably is the F line."t
   Polariscopic observations have shown that part of the light received
from comets is reflected light, and it has been assumed that it is
reflected sunlight that is in question.             Dr. Huggins, in his valuable
memoir on the Comet b, 1881 (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 33, p. 1), gives
a photograph showing absorption lines which he states to be the
reflected lines of Fraunhofer.             I  have not had an opportunity of
seeing   the   original photograph,          and  it is therefore impossible to
speak with confidence, but if the drawing is exact we are not deal
ing with reflected sunlight, for the hydrogen lines are too strong
and the relative thicknesses of H and K are dissimilar.                 But varia
tions  from  the    solar spectrum are       to be  noticed  in  the spectrum of a
Cygni, and they should be reproduced in a cometary swarm when
near the sun.
   An additional        argument for this conclusion with respect to
Huggins's photograph is the absence of ultra-violet continuous spec
trum. As shown in the lithograph, the continuous spectrum appears
to end rather abruptly, just in front of the group of bright flutings
3883. If we had to deal with reflected sunlight this could not
possibly happen.

    In the green there were two bands, one at 560*1, and the other at
557, both as broad as the interval of D, which had sharp dark line
on their redward sides.
    In all probability   these two bands were the first two maxima of the
manganese fluting at 558.
    The dark lines which Copeland saw were no doubt partly due to
the spectrum of daylight, bnt some were also due to the absorption
taking place in the comet itself. The evidence for this conclusion is
that some of the dark lines recorded in the cometary spectrum are
altogether absent, or are exceedingly faint in the solar spectrum.
    Thus there are no dark lines in the solar spectrum to correspond
 with the dark lines in the spectrum of the comet at 547-4, 539-5,
 and 517-6. The lines in the spectrum of the comet at 526-9 (E)
 532-9, 536-9, 542-8, D1, and D2, which also occurs in the solar spec
 trum, are probably common to both the spectrum of the comet and
 the daylight spectrum.         These are lines which would be likely to
 appear in the absorption spectrum of the comet, and hence it is
 highly probable that Copeland observed an integration of the radiation      <
 and absorption spectra of the comet and that of daylight.
     A comet gives bright lines at perihelion because there is an action
 which drives the vapours away from the meteorites.
     The vapours being driven away with great velocity, the lines in
 their spectra are displaced if the resolved part of the velocity in the
 line of sight be sufficiently great.          The vapours, however, would
 surround the meteorites at the moment they were produced by the
 heat due to impacts, and there would therefore be dark absorption
 lines which would not suffer displacement.          The total result would
 accordingly     be   bright  lines   and   flutings corresponding to them
 arranged alongside each other.          This, no doubt, was what Copeland
 observed    in  the  Great   Comet   of 168-2, the vapours of sodium, iron,
 and lead were being driven away from the earth, the dark lines being
 on the more refrangible sides of the bright lines, while the man
 ganese vapours were driven towards the earth, the dark flutings being

             VI.   Genebal Statement with begabd to Cabbon.
   The earliest      spectroscopic      observations of comets showed that
carbon     was   a  very important element in coinetary spectra.               Since
then, as we have seen, carbon has also been recorded in almost every
comet which has been observed, although the spectrum is often
greatly modified by the presence of other substances.                  The experi
ments    on  the spectrum of carbon        which   I  commenced many years ago,
but which have been temporarily discontinued, show that there are
several distinct stages in the spectrum of carbon.                   At very low
temperatures all compounds of carbon give a spectrum consisting of
what I have already referred to as the cool carbon flutings. A
higher temperature gives what I have called the hot carbon flutings,
or carbon A. Finally we get the line spectrum of carbon.                    Another
condition, which is not yet completely understood, is marked by the
appearance of the group beginning at 460, which 1 have called
carbon B.* Associated with this are the groups beginning at 420 and
 388, the relations of which to the line spectrum                  I have already
discussed in a communication to the Royal Society ;f 1 here repro
duce a diagram, fig. 11, which I theu gave, showing this relation.

      violet and ultra-violet carbon B groups. The top horizon indicates the highest
      temperature.
    In the majority of         cases the spectrum of a comet has not been
 recorded     until  it has arrived at the hot carbon condition, but in the

case of Winnecke's        and Brorsen's Comet, to which reference has
already been made, we have evidence to show that this spectrum
appeared as the cool carbon spectrum disappeared.
    In Winnecke's Comet (perihelion passage Jane 25th) Wolfs
observations on the 17th of June showed the cool carbon speotrum, as
I  have already stated.
    On the 22nd of June Huggins* recorded three bands at wave
lengths 469, 517, and 559. Nothing was recorded near 483, the
position of the characteristic cool carbon band, so that we are justified
in assuming that the low-temperature condition had changed.                     The
517 fluting agrees almost perfectly with the principal hot carbon
fluting at 516"4.     We have seen that the variability of the citron band
is one of the principal features of cometary spectra, so that the apparent
discrepancy in its position is of no importance here.
    The band at 469 was in all probability the hot carbon band which
begins at wave-length 474, but has its maximum of brightness at
about 468.     It is very probable, therefore, that during the time which
elapsed   between    the observations of Wolf and Huggins the spectrum
of the comet had changed from that of cool carbon to that of hot
carbon.     This change is precisely what we should expect, Huggins's
observation being the one nearest to perihelion, when the comet was
hottest.
     Again, we have evidence of the change from the spectrum of cool
 carbon to that of hot carbon       in Brorsen's Comet (1879), the perihelion
 passage of which occurred on the 30th of March.                Konkoly's observa
 tion on the 25th of March showed the characteristic cool carbon
 fluting at 483. Later observations were made by Bredichinf on the
 28th, 29th, and 31st March and April 2nd.                Eight observations of the
 citron band gave the wave-length as 551'3. Three measurements of
 the principal green band gave 510-2 as the mean wave-length, and three
 of the blue band gave 465-5 as its wave-length.               Obviously, there was
 no cool carbon in the comet spectrum on any of these dates, which are
 all nearer the date of perihelion passage than the date of Konkoly's
 observations.     It may be remarked that if the blue band is corrected
 as we have to correct the first green one to obtain the true wave
 length (516'4), we obtain a wave-length not far removed from that of
  the hot carbon band, 474.         The apparent displacement of the citron
 carbon    band  has    before     been     referred to.       As in the case of
  Winnecke's Comet then, as Brorsen's Comet (1879) approached
 perihelion, its spectrum changed from that of cool carbon to that of
 hot carbon.
     In Wells's Comet, as already stated, there was, in all probability, the
 line spectrum of carbon.          All the detailed spectroscopic observations

188            Mr. J. N. Lockyer.          On   the  Classification  [Jan.   10,
of  this comet were made between              May 20th and June 11th, the
perihelion passage occurring on June 10th.
   The comet gave indications of a comparatively high temperature
during all of this interval, so that the derivation of the line from the
fluted spectrum of carbon, or vice versd, cannot be traced.
   In addition to this evidence of the existence of carbon in comets,
we have further evidence afforded by Dr. Huggins's photograph of the
spectrum of Comet III, 1881,* taken on June 24th, the perihelion
passage occurring on June 16th.          Besides the dark line spectrum to
        I
which have previously referred, the photograph shows three groups
of apparent bright lines. Measurements of the two strongest lines in
the most refrangible group gave, according to Dr. Huggins, 3883 and
3870 as the wave-lengths.        Dr. Huggins says (p. 2) : — " The less re
frangible line is much stronger, and a faint luminosity can be traced
from it to a little beyond the second line at 3870. There can be,
therefore, no doubt that these lines represent the brighest end of the
ultra-violet group which appears under certain conditions in the
spectra of the compounds of carbon.            Professors Liveing and Dewar
have found for the strong line at the beginning of this group the
wave-length 3882- 7, and for the second line 3870-5.
   " I am also able to see upon the continuous solar spectrum, a
distinct impression of the group of lines between G and h which is
usually associated with the group described above. My measures for
the less refrangible group give a wave-length of 4230, which agrees as
well as can be expected with Professors Liveing and Dewar 's measnres
4220."
   In addition to the two groups of bright lines above mentioned, a
third, and fainter group between h and H is shown by Dr. Huggins.
On the lithograph which accompanies the paper these lines are shown
at approximate wave-lengths of 4059, 4052, 4044, and 4038, but no
origin is suggested for them.
   Messrs.  Liveing and Dewar have attributed the two groups first
mentioned    to cyanogen ; but my own researches, which are still far
from complete, have not convinced            me   that this view is correct.   I
may state, and here Messrs. Liveing and Dewar's observations agree
with my own, that the most characteristic cyanogen group is one
beginning at about 461 ; and since there is no trace of this in the
photograph, it does not seem likely that the groups seen can be taken
as proving the existence of cyanogen.

   In a paper which communicated to the Royal Society in 1880f                 I
described the two groups of lines, or rather flutings, which are
referred to in Dr. Huggins's paper, and I also gave their wave-lengths.
I have since found that under certain conditions other compounds of

  carbon give the second and last members of tbe ultra-violet group,
 at wave-lengths 3873 and 3850, or lines coincident with them, when
 the other three are entirely absent.       I have, however, found no con
  dition under which the first two members            of the group, at wave
 lengths   3883   and 3870, are as much        brighter than the remaining
 ones, as they are shown in the lithograph which accompanies
 Dr. Huggins's paper.        As shown in the lithograph, the distance
 between the two brightest members of the group is considerably greater
 than the distance between the first two members of the ultra-violet
 carbon group, and if this fairly represents the photograph, the sugges
 tion is that we have to deal with the two lines at 3850 and 3873 to
 which I have referred.        Under the conditions at which these are
 produced,   however,   I have  never obtained at the same time the group
 in the bine beginning at 4215, and we should therefore not expect to
 find them associated with each other in comets. It is also worth
 noting that nearly all the lines of this group approximate very closely
 to lines in the flame spectrum of iron. We know that bright iron
 lines do occur in comets, as, for instance, in Comet Wells and the
 Great Comet of 1882, and it is nearly certain that the four faint lines
 between h and H are flame lines of iron and manganese ; it is quite
 possible, therefore, that the blue-group is not due to carbon at all.
 The group of four faint lines is certainly not due to carbon under
 conditions which we are able to reproduce.
          VII.  Sequence    of Phenomena      in Cometary Spectra.
    The first stage in the spectrum of a comet is, we have seen, that in
 which there is only the radiation of the magnesium.             The next is
that in which Mg 500 is replaced wholly or partially by the spectrum
of cool carbon.     Mg 5201 is then added, and cool carbon is replaced
by hot carbon.       The radiation of manganese 558 and sometimes
lead 546, is then added.           Absorption phenomena next appears,
 manganese 558 and lead 546 being indicated by their masking effect
upon the citron band of carbon.        The absorption band of iron is also
sometimes present at this stage.          At this stage also the group of
carbon flutings which I have called carbon B* probably also makes its
appearance.     As the temperature increases still further, magnesium
is represented by b, and lines of iron appear.         This takes place when
the comet is at or near perihelion.       At this stage the repellant action
of the sun upon the comet is most effective, and if the vapours are
driven off in the line of sight with sufficient velocity, the bright lines
will suffer displacement.      A double set of phenomena would thus be
presented ; there would be radiation lines of one wave-length from

left off in others.      Many comets have never been observed beyond
the hot carbon stage, whilst others, like Wells's Comet, have not been
observed below that stage.          Again, this sequence is what we should
expect from laboratory observations.          The table on p. 191 shows the
 sequence of the different spectra in a few cases, and it will be seen
 that in each case, as far as the observations go, the different bands
 appear in the foregoing order.
    In the case of Encke's Comet, 1871 (p.p. December 28th), as the
 comet approached perihelion, hot carbon radiation was succeeded by
 the integrated radiations of hot carbon and manganese, and this again
 by the integration of hot carbon radiation and manganese absorption
 as shown in fig. 13.
    The slight variations shown in the positions of the green band
 (517) are assumed to be due to errors of observations.                 I
                                                                    As have
 already explained, the apparent position of the blue band depends
 upon temperature, the point of maximum luminosity varying between
 468 and 474.
    The case of Comet III, 1881 (fig. 14), is a little more complicated,
 but the general result is the same, namely, that radiation phenomena
 succeed absorption as the comet recedes from perihelion.              Twelve

                  showing that absorption occurs nearer to perihelion than radiation.
        days after perihelion passage, the spectrum of the comet consisted of
        the integrated spectra of hot carbon radiation, and the absorption of
        cool carbon       and manganese, as indicated by the masking of the
        second and dimming of the first maximum of the citron fluting (see
        fig. 7). A month later still, the absorption bands disappeared, and
        the spectrum of the comet consisted of the integration of hot carbon,
        manganese, and lead radiations.               On both occasions the blue band
        had a maximum at 468.
           In the Great Comet of 1882 we have a good example of the passage
        of the spectrum from that of manganese and hot carbon radiations
        to that of hot carbon alone as the comet cooled.                         The spectrum

    This sequence may not have been apparent in some comets for two
 reasons.   In the first place, a complication is introduced by the
 nnequal displacements of the bands at different times due to motion
in the line of sight, which is variable, and is sometimes very great.
 Many, apparently, faulty observations are probably to be accounted
for in this way.
   Again, different observers may not have recorded the spectrum of
exactly the same part of the comet, though in general it may be
assumed that the brightest part will have been examined.             There
must be regions of different temperatures      in the same comet, and,
from what     I have shown in this paper, the spectra of different
portions will vary considerably.   One part of the comet may give hot
carbon, whilst another may give cool carbon radiation.          The wave
lengths of the bands seen in the two cases would    differ, and the results
would apparently disagree.     In future observations, therefore, it is
very important that the exact portion of the comet examined should
be stated.
VIII.    More Detailed Discussion of certain Comets, with Special
        Reference to Approach and Recession from Perihelion.
                                       Comet Wells.
    Comet Wells was first seen on the 17th of March, 1882, its peri
helion passage occurring on June 10th. During the earlier observa
tions, made by Vogel, Tacehini, and others in April, its spectrum
presented no feature of special interest, consisting merely of
                                                                    " faint
traces of the customary three bands close to the weak, faint, con
tinuous spectrum of the nucleus."*         At Greenwich, on May 20th,
Maunder suspected      " a dark band near D on the blue side of that
line," due most probably to the absorption of the second manganese
fluting at 586, the first being masked by the citron carbon band.
   By May 22nd, when the spectrum was again observed by Vogel, the
comet had much increased in brightness, and
                                                         " the continuous
spectrum of the nucleus had increased in intensity and extent, and
was not different from the spectrum of a fixed star."
   On May 27th, however, Copeland and Lohse noticed a bright line,
so faint as to require some attention to see                     it,
                                                   in the less refrangible
end of  the  spectrum,   which  they identified with  the D line by com
parison on the following day.        At the same time they observed a
bright part  at wave-length    558, due, there can be little doubt, to the
first manganese fluting at 558. A maximum at 503 may have been

due to the low-temperature magnesium fluting at 500. On the 29th
of May the spectrum of the comet was again observed by Cope-
land and Lohse, and the identity of the bright line in the yellow
with the D line placed beyond doubt.               On the preceding day a Dun
Echt circular had announced the discovery as follows : — " The
spectrum of the nucleus of Comet Wells deserves the closest attention,
as it shows a sharp bright line coincident with D, as well as strong
traces of other bright lines, resembling in appearance those seen in
7 Cassiopeiae and allied stars."
   Dr. Huggins succeeded on the 31st of May in photographing the
spectrum of this comet, and, as was to be expected, could detect no
trace of the ultra-violet carbon fluting which was seen in his photo
graph of Comet b, 1881.           I  have already had occasion to refer to
this photographed spectrum.*
   On the same day the spectrum of this comet was observed by
Maunder, Copeland, Vogel, and others.                The most complete record
is that made by Copeland and Lohse. They observed " a bright part;
         "
line (?)    at wave-length 614*1, for which the reading on the follow
ing day gave 615'7. There can be little doubt that this was a con
trast band due to the absorption of the low-temperature iron fluting
at 615. At the same time there was a maximum brightness in the
green at wave-length 501'7, caused most probably by the radiation
of the magnesium fluting at 500, in addition to the continuous
 spectrum.
    "                                 "
      A bright part, a maximum           of which the wave-length recorded
 on May 31st was 543'6, and on the following day 546 8, was due
in all probability to absorption by the lead fluting at 546, as have       I
already explained.      It was on this night (May 3 1st) that Vogel first
observed and identified the bright sodium line.               " When  I examined
the spectrum, on May 31st," he writes,            " I was greatly surprised by a
line in the yellow of great intensity. Measurements and comparisons
seemed to identify this line with the sodium line. Yesterday, June
 1st, several measurements were made by Dr. Muller, Kempf, and
myself, which showed an agreement of the bright line in the spectrum
of the comet's nucleus with the D lines ; considering the dispersion
 used this agreement must be called an absolute one.              The continuous
spectrum extended from about C to deep in the violet.                Besides the
bright yellow   line  traces   of  bright bands were present, perhaps also
some dark absorption-lines."t               Writing later, he describes the
observations of June       2nd   thus  :
                                         "  The bright line was, not only in
 the spectrum of the nucleus, but also in the parts of the comet near
to the nucleus, distinctly visible. Besides this, several more bright
 bands could be seen, which stood out more distinctly when the slit of

 196           Mr.  J.   N. Lockyer.        On  the Classification   [Jan. 10,
 the spectroscope was not directed on the nucleus itself, but on parts
 of the comet close to it." He further states that he observed a bright
 band fading towards the blue, to which reference has been made
 above, and  for which he obtained the wave-length 613. This we have
 seen was probably a contrast band due to the dark iron fluting at 615.
 From this date until the comet was lost to view no further change of
 note took place in the spectrum of this comet.
    On June 2nd Vogel observed dark bands in the spectrum of Comet
 Wells,* but suggests that they might have been due to atmospheric
 absorption.   He says: "The dark absorption-bands, which are still
 visible in the comet's spectrum, may probably have their origin in
 our atmosphere, the absorbent action of which, at the inconsiderable
 height of the comet above the horizon, is very powerful."
    Again, Vogel states that dark absorption-bands were possibly
 present on July 1st, the perihelion passage occurring on the 10th of
 Jnne. Vogel's suggestion is very important, but since no wave
 lengths were determined, it is not possible to say how far it is sup
 ported by the facts.
    It might, on first consideration,       be expected that the changes in
the spectrum of a comet as it approaches the sun must be perfectly
 continuous.   The spectrum of Comet Wells, however, was a case in
which the changes in the spectrum were apparently discontinuous.
    On May 30th and 31st, as already stated, dark bands were observed
by   Mr. Maunder, f which were in all probability due to manganese
 absorption.
    Between these two dates, i.e., on May 28th, Copeland observed a
 bright part at 558 which was clearly due to manganese radiation. I
have already shown that manganese radiation occurs further from
perihelion than manganese absorption. The Greenwich observation
of absorption on May 20th, whilst radiation occurs on May 28th,
nearer to perihelion, is therefore apparently a discontinuity.
    I showed in the Bakerian Lecture that variable stars may be
explained by considering the meeting of two meteor-swarms and the
consequent    increase    of   temperature due to the impacts. Comets,
apparently, go through similar changes and suddenly increase in
brightness, as I show in another part of the paper.               The explana
tion is probably the same for comets as for stars, and Comet
Wells affords a good example of the fact. It is most probable that on
May 20th the comet met another meteor-swarm in its orbit, and an
increase of temperature took place; this meant manganese absorption,
and this was what was observed.
   All the other changes in the spectrum were perfectly continuous as

the comet approached          the sun, the perihelion passage occurring on
June 10th.
   The perihelion passage occurred under such conditions that the
spectrum of the comet could not be satisfactorily observed on account
of the interference of daylight.             Detailed observations, however,
were made when the comet was near perihelion and its temperature
sufficiently high to give bright lines.
   I  have already discussed the spectrum of this comet when the lines
were best seen      (May 31st), and the discussion shows that we had
remnants     of the fluting of magnesium at 500, and of the blue carbon
band at 468. The line of carbon at 426 was probably also visible, and
the temperature was high enough for the appearance of iron.
   As the comet approached perihelion the conditions of observation
became less favourable.            Between Juno 5th and June 11th, the
perihelion pass-age occurring on June 10th, nothing but the D lines
were recorded.       After June 11th the comet was lost.
                            The Great Comet      of 1882.
   The spectrum      of the Great Comet of 1882 was first observed on
September 18, a day after perihelion, by Copeland.*
   The spectrum consisted of bright and dark lines, among which was
the bright yellow line of sodium, several bright lines in the green, E,
and some prominent iron lines and five well-defined bright lines on
the red side of D. These have already been referred to. In addition
there were two dark lines on the redward side of 558 and 560, which
were most likely the edges of the first two maxima of the manganese
absorption fluting at 558. No more observations could be made at
Dan Echt until September 29, and in the interval most of the bright
lines in the spectrum had disappeared, whilst the carbon bands had
made their appearance.          The D lines were still bright, but E and the
other lines had vanished.         There was, however, something which is
described as    " almost a line" at 610'3 ; this, no doubt, was the iron
fluting at 615.
   The next observations        of the comet were made by Vogel.t on the
1st, 5th, 6th, and 7th October.           On each of these occasions D was
still visible as a bright double line, in addition to the ordinary cometary
flutings.
   When the next observation was made on October 16th, by Hassel-
berg,J D had disappeared.           On the 22nd and 23rd October, Copeland
again   observed  the   spectrum, and it then consisted of the three ordi
nary cometary bands ; the citron band had a maximum at about
wave-length 557. Here Mn radiation had evidently commenced.

The later observations of Gothard* and Konkoly,f showed nothing
but the three ordinary bands.
   No observations were made after the comet had got sufficiently
cool to show either the cool carbon flutings or the magnesium fluting
at 500.
   Although    the observations are not perfectly continuous, there is
conclusive evidence that the reduction in temperature of the comet
consequent on its departure from the neighbourhood                of the sun was
accompanied by the following changes in its spectrum : —
   18th   September.      Bright and dark iron           lines   and   manganese
flutings.
   29th September.       Bright flutings of iron.
   22nd October.      Bright manganese.
   1st November. Hot carbon radiation.
   The two latter stages have already been specially referred to (p. 193).
   No doubt if further observations had been possible the flutings of
hot carbon would have been replaced by cool carbon flutings, and these
again by magnesium 500.
                                  Ooggia's Comet.
   The perihelion passage of this comet occurred on July 8th, 1874,

July 14th. On May 18th, Vogel observed three bands, one of which
was at wave-length 515. This was probably the hot carbon fluting at
517, but as the wave-lengths of the other bands are not given, it is
not possible to come to a definite conclusion.
   On the 18th May Vogel again recorded the three bands, the prin
cipal one commencing at 516-5, and having a second maximum at 512.
It is probable that these were the first two maxima of the green carbon
band, the wave-lengths of which are about 517 and 513.
   On June 4th, the date of Vogel's next observation, the three bands
were still visible.    The wave-lengths are given as 562, 514, and 473.
   On June 7th, Vogel's observation recording three bands at 557, 518,
and 473, give evidence of manganese absorption, as indicated by the
apparent displacement of the citron carbon band in the manner I have
already explained.
    On June 13th, 14th, and 15th, in addition to the absorption of man
 ganese, there was probably the absorption of cool carbon, as indicated
 by the masking of the 2nd maximum of the citron carbon band, as I
 have already explained.

 the manganese       absorption was increasing, whilst the carbon was
 probably beginning to fade ont.
     The later observations of Vogel, on June 22nd, and of Christie,*
between July 3rd and 14th, are incomplete, inasmuch as the positions
of all the bands were not determined.              Vogel gives the position of the
green    band  as 515, but simply states the presence of the citron and
 blue band. Christie states that two of the bands were sensibly coinci
 dent with the two principal bands in the spectrum of carbon dioxide
 (probably carbon 517 and 474), but the position of the third band
 was not determined.         It is scarcely possible, therefore, to say how far
 the indications of manganese absorption have increased between
 June 22nd and July 14th. Christie states, however, that there was
 line absorption on July 14th, six days after perihelion. I have stated
in another part of the paper that the highest temperature effects do
 not occur until the comet is some distance beyond perihelion, and this
 is a case in point.
     As Coggia's Comet approached perihelion, therefore, after having
 first become visible, the first recorded change in its spectrum was the
addition of manganese absorption to carbon radiation, but the dis
cussion of other cometary spectra shows that there was probably an
 intermediate stage between June 4th and June 7th, when instead of
manganese absorption, manganese radiation was added.                A little later
cool carbon absorption was added.                 Finally, just after perihelion,
fluting was replaced by line absorption.
    In observations in my own observatory with my 6^-inch refractor,
I   obtained indications that the blue rays were singularly deficient in
the continuous spectrum of the nucleus of the comet ; and in a com
                                   I
 munication to ' Nature 'f suggested that this fact would appear to
indicate a low temperature.
    This conclusion was strengthened by observations which              I made at
Newcastle with Mr. Newall's telescope.                  The colour, both of the
nucleus and of the head of the comet, as observed in the telescope, was-
of a distinct orange yellow, and this, of course, lends confirmation to
the view expressed above. While ten minutes' exposure of a photo
graphic plate gave no images of the comet, the faintest of seven stara
in the Great Bear gave an impression in two minutes.
    The fan also gave a continuous spectrum but little inferior in
brilliancy to that of the nucleus itself; while over these, and even the
dark space behind the nucleus, was to be seen the spectrum of bands,
which indicates the presence of a rare vapour of some kind, while the
continuous spectrum of the nucleus and fan, less precise in its indi
cations, may be referred either to the presence of denser vapour or
solid particles.

  200           Mr.   J.  N. Lockyer.         On   the  Classification    [Jan.  10.
    I found  that the mixture of continuous band spectrum in different
  parts was very unequal, and, further, that the apparently continuous
  spectrum changed its character and position of maximum. Over some
 regions it was limited almost to the region between the less refrangible
 bands.
    I wrote at the time : —
    " It is more than possible,        I  think, that the cometary spectrum,
 therefore, is not so simple as it has been supposed to be, and that thv
 evidence in favour of mixed vapours is not to be neglected."
                                 Comet    III,   1881.
    The perihelion passage of this comet occurred on June 16th.                    I
 have already remarked that Copeland* observed on June 25th a dark
 band at 567"9 in this Comet, in addition to the hot carbon radia
 tion. This band was probably due to lead at 568, the first band at
 546 being masked by the hot carbon.             Manganese absorption was also
 indicated on the same date. On June 25th the spectrum of this comet
 was photographed by Huggins, and the carbon B group of fiutiDgs
  was stated to have been seen, giving indications of a relatively high
 temperature.     As the comet receded from the sun other phenomena
 were observed.     On June 27 magnesium at 520 was detected by
 Hasselberg ; manganese absorption was again indicated in Copeland's
 observations on June 28, and manganese radiation on June 29 and
 July 27. I have already had occasion to refer to these two conditions
 (p. 193).
    No observations were made on the comet after July 27, or the hot
 and cool carbon flutings would doubtless have been recorded alone.
 Carbon radiation is indicated in all the observations that were made
 from June 25 to July 27.
    It should also be noted that hydrocarbon at 431 was observed on
 June 28th, by Copeland ; but neither before nor after this date was
 hydrocarbon recorded.        The reason probably is that the band is too
                                                                                 "a
 far in the violet to be very manifest.             Copeland recorded it as
 bright line, common to spirit-lamp and comet," and hence there cau
 be no mistake as to its identity.

    The observations of this comet at its appearance              in 1868, made by
 Secchif between the 23rd and 27th of April, 1868,                and by HugginsJ
 between April 29th and 13th May, 1868, perihelion               passage  occurring

agrees almost) exactly with the blue band of hot carbon, and if the.
two other bands be shifted by equal amounts, so that the first one
coincides with hot carbon 517, and the second consequently with
manganese 558, we have indications of manganese added to carbon
radiation ;  the description of the band, however, is insufficient to
enable us to say whether the manganese was radiating or absorbing.
   Huggins gives flutings at positions which, when reduced, give 464,
508, and 544, as the    wave-lengths. The wave-lengths of the two less
refrangible ones are apparently shortened, as if they were shifted
towards the blue.      It is probable, however, that manganese was indi
cated by the observations of Huggins, for if we shift the band at
508 to 517, the 544 band becomes 553, which is not far removed from
the manganese fluting. The drawing given by Huggins shows this as
a somewhat narrow band, fading away in both directions, which
would seem to show that there was manganese radiation added to
carbon radiation, as      I  have previously explained.      This being so,
since Huggins's observations were made when the comet was further
from perihelion than at the time of Seochi's observations, the dis
cussion of the sequence of changes in other cometary spectra suggests
that in Secchi's observations we had to deal with the absorption of
manganese.
   In a note on the spectrum of Brorseu's Comet at the next return
(1879), Professor Young* refers to Huggins's observation.           He states
that "the only special interest in this (Professor Young's) observa
tion lies in the fact that in 1868 Mr. Huggins obtained a somewhat
different result for the same comet."         He further goes on to say : " I
am entirely at a loss to explain Mr. Huggins's result.         It can hardly
be that the comet has really changed its spectrum in the meanwhile,
and a careful reading of his account (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 16,
p. 388) gives no light as to how an error could have crept into his
work ; on the other hand, eveiy precaution would seem to have been
                                    I
taken. However this may be, am quite positive as to the accuracy
of my present result — that the middle band of the spectrum of this
comet now coincides sensibly (to a one-prism spectroscope) with the
green band in the hydrocarbon spectrum."
   I  have now shown that the spectrum of a comet is by no means a
constant, but depends upon the distance of the comet from perihelion
passage.     The spectrum is, therefore, not necessarily the same at two
different returns, as Professor Young supposes, although it may be
the same at equal distances from perihelion.
   It is impossible, however, to explain Huggins's observation of
Brorsen's Comet without assuming a shift, which is probably instru
mental.     In the face of this difficulty, I venture to suggest the above
as the probable explanation of the spectrum of this comet.

 202            Mr.  J.     N. Lockyev.        On    the Classification   [Jan. 10,
  • There are no further observations which might enable us to further
 trace the sequence of spectroscopical           phenomena in the comet at this
 return.
    At the next return, however (perihelion passage March 30, 1879),
  several observations were made on different dates.               Low temperatnre
  carbon  hands  were   recorded     on   25th March,     1879.*   Bredichinf made
 a series of observations, extending from 26th March to 2nd April,
 bat only gives one set of wave-lengths, as if no change had occurred
 in the spectrum of the comet during the interval. The observations,
 however, seem to indicate hot carbon with manganese absorption.
    An observation was made two days after perihelion by Young,                   J
 who observed bands near 476 and 560, and measured one at 512.
 These are probably hot carbon bands with manganese absorption ; in
 the case of the green band at 512, the first maximum of the fluting
 at 517 was probably masked in the way I have already explained, so that
 the second maximum at 513 was the brighter. On April 17, the Astro
 nomer Royal§ observed cool carbon bands in the comet's spectrum.
    Messrs. Copeland and Lohse|| observed the comet from April 16 to
 May 2, and give 547-6, 515-6, 469-6 as the wave-lengths of three
 bands.    Of the band at 547-6 they say, " it was very ill defined on
 both sides, and being without any definite brighter part, its wave
 length is very uncertain." The measurements made on April 16 are
 not given separately, nor is it definitely stated that any measurements
 were made on that day.             The apparent discrepancy of hot carbon
 being seen when the comet was farther from perihelion than when
 cool carbon was seen, is most probably another case of a comet tem
 porarily passing through a meteoric swarm, and thereby increasing
in temperature, as was the case with Comet Wells, 1882, on May 20th.
                             Winnecl-e's Comet      in 1877.
    Winnecke's    Comet,       1877, was      observed     by Lord Lindsay^     on
April 18th, a day after perihelion. Its spectrum presented much the
same characteristics as in 1868. Bands at 472-2, 516, and another
near 556 were observed.           The strongest was at 516 and the baud at
556 is given   as very      weak.
    We, no doubt, have here another case of manganese absorption
occurring in conjunction with hot carbon radiation, when a comet is
near perihelion. On May 5th, the spectrum of the comet gave every
indication of hot carbon in conjunction with manganese radiation, the

band given at wave-length 558 being evidently due to the radiation
of the latter element, since the band fades away in both directions.
   Another band was measured at 467-9, and is most probably the
carbon band at 474 which under certain conditions has it maximum
at 468 instead of 474.
   On May 6th the comet was again observed.      A very faint line was
seen at 569 and another at 543. These were probably due to the lead
flutings at wave-lengths 568 and 546.
   The apparent absence of lead in the spectrum observed on May 5th
may probably be due to the incompleteness of the observations on
that date in comparison with those made on May 6th.      Or it may be
that the greater brightness of the continuous spectrum masked the
two faint remnants of the lead fluting.
   Other bands were observed on May 6th, the hot carbon and the
manganese radiation at 558 being clearly indicated.
   An observation was made on May 15th at Greenwich* and it is
interesting to note the change that had taken place. A band at 517
was measured, and two others observed, one about 483 and another
about 561. Here, clearly, we have indications of cool carbon radia
tion occurring as the comet receded from the sun, the observations
having been made nearly a month after perihelion.
   As the comet receded from the sun, then, manganese absorption
was succeeded by manganese radiation, hot carbon being indicated in
both cases.   No further observations were made until nine days after
the latter condition was observed, and then the spectrum was that of
cool carbon.    Doubtless there was an intermediate stage in which
hot carbon was observed alone.

                                  Internal Work.
   Professor Tait's view as to the origin of collisions in a meteor-swarm
entering our system as a comet was that they were a consequence of
the movement of the individual meteorites along approximately
elliptic orbits, described in something like equal periods in any plane
about their common centre of inertia.
   The group was also supposed to be subjested to a sort of tidal dis
turbance by the sun.-f
  It  is certain that one of the principal causes of the increase of
temperature   of a comet during its approach to perihelion is the
increased number of collisions due to the greater tidal action which
takes place.   Hence the larger the swarm, the greater the difference
between the attractions of the sun upon opposite sides of   and thereit,
fore the greater the disturbance set up.        Also, the shorter the

perihelion distance, the greater fraction of it is tho diameter of the
swarm, and the greater therefore the differential attraction.
  The initial movements of the individual members of the swarm,
and these superadded by tidal action, may be defined as producing
internal work.
   If all the heat of a comet is produced by such internal work, it is
clear that the temperature of the comet will depend (1) upon the
velocity of orbital motion of the particles, (2) upon the size of the
swarm of which it is composed, and (3) upon its perihelion distance.
It will practically be independent of the velocity of the comet in its
orbit round the sun.
   While some comets at perihelion give such high temperature
phenomena as were observed in Comet III, 1881, Wells's Comet, and
the Great Comet of 1882, others, like Winnecke's Comet, 1868, give
only the spectrum of carbon.
   These differences are what we should expect from the known peri
helion distances, and it must be understood that the four stages into
which the different degrees of activity in a comet have been divided
in this paper are those which occur in a comet with a short perihelion
distance.    In comets with a long one, perihelion effects may only be
equivalent to mean distance effects in comets with short perihelion
distances.

comets which have been discussed, the distances being given in

                                External Work.
    If  external work is done on a comet by meteorites in space, that
is to say, if there are collisions with external bodies, the velocity of
the comet mnst be considered in the first place, and the equal or
 unequal distribution of the masses which it encounters can be tested
 by the phenomena observed.
    The discussion of the recorded observations shows, indeed, that in
addition to the constantly increasing action which takes place in a
comet during its approach to perihelion passage, there are at times
 temporary increases in temperature.
    We know that meteorites are scattered through space, and here
 and there are gathered into swarms.           It is only to be expected, there
 fore, that at times a comet will meet with such swarms just as our
 own planet does, and in that case its temperature would be increased
 by the collisions which would occur.            The increase of temperature1
 would depend upon (1) the dimensions and density of the swarm;
 and (2) upon its velocity.     The larger and denser the swarm the more
 collisions would be likely to occur, and the greater the velocity of the
 comet the greater the amount of kinetic energy available for transfor
 mation into heat energy.
    If the density of the meteoritic plenum increases towards the sun,
 the external work done will increase with it.
               Collisions between Cometary and other Swarms.
    We have then not only to consider the increased activity in a comet
 due to its approach to perihelion, but we have also to take into
 account the possibility of its passing through other swarms of
 meteorites during its revolution.       That such collisions do take place
 there can be little doubt.      Sawerthal's Comet, 1888, which increased
in brightness by three magnitudes in two days, is a case in point.*
 Unfortunately, no spectroscopic observations were made, or no doubt
the effects of the increased temperature upon the spectrum would
have been apparent.
    The spectroscopic observations of Comet Wells seem to show that
this comet also passed through at least one swarm during its revolu
tion.     An observation at Greenwich, on May 20th, recorded dark
absorption lines, which I have shown to be especial to high tempera
tures in comets. Between that date and perihelion passage (June
10th) there were evidences of a lower temperature, as I show in
another part of the paper.          I am not aware of any observations
recording an increase in brilliancy of the comet on May 20th, but if
they do exist, they will obviously strengthen this view.
    Perhaps the case of greatest importance, however, is the Great

206             Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.          On  the  Classification   [Jan. 10,
Comet     of 1882.    At perihelion, this        comet was only 300,000 miles
 from the photosphere of the sun, and it was practically as bright as
 the sun itself.   Mr. Finlay, at the Cape, followed the comet until it
apparently rushed into the sun.            That a comet should he able to pass
within    so short  a distance      of the sun without suffering entire dis
ruption has been used as an argument against the existence of an
 extended solar corona.         My own view of the case, however, is that
 the evidence afforded by this comet of the existence of a meteoritic
solar atmosphere is most conclusive.
    That it would be impossible for a comet to pass through a gaseous
atmosphere is proved by our terrestrial experience with falling st irs,
but if the regions far above the sun's photosphere are constituted as
I have suggested,* we should expect a transcendental clashing effect,
but no change in the orbits of the meteorites which were not
engaged.
    I  would submit, therefore, that the immediate                  cause of the
enormous increase in brilliancy of the comet, which enabled it to be
obtained close to the sun's disk, was undoubtedly the collisions which
took place between the meteorites constituting the comet, and those
which occupy the outer cooler regions of the sun. Not only does
this event demonstrate the existence of an outer solar atmosphere,
therefore, but it also points to its meteoric nature, the meteo
rites there being probably formed by the condensation of metallic
and other vapours, exactly in the same way as we have snow and
raindrops in our own atmosphere.               Observations by Messrs. Finlay
and Elkins before and after perihelion showed that the comet was
not perceptibly retarded by its adventure, which is quite consistent
with my view, collisions between individual meteorites would not
retard the motion of the comet as a whole.
    Another case of considerable interest is the Pons-Brooks Comet,
1883 — 1884.      At its last return this comet was first observed by
Mr. Brooks on September 1, 1883; it passed perihelion on January
25th, and was last seen on June 2nd, 1884. It was distinguished by
its sudden fluctuations in brilliancy, which no doubt were caused by
its intersection with other swarms.                  On September 21st, it was
observed by Mr. Chandler, at Harvard,! as a faint nebulosity with a
slight condensation.        On the 22nd, it was represented by an npparent
star of the eighth magnitude, according to the observations of
Schiaparelli,^    the luminosity having been augmented eight times
within a few hours.
    In a short time, the comet again appeared as a nebulous disk. This
sudden change has an exact parallel in "new stars," and the cause is

  no doubt the     same   in both      cases.   The rapidity with which the
  comet   cooled  demonstrates       that only small masses could be in
  question.   This    took place     whilst the comet was no less than
  200 million miles from the sun.
     On October 15th there was a similar occurrence in the same comet,
  and again, a more decided one on January 1st. In the latter case, in
  less than four hours,* the comet had become an apparent star, and
  again assumed the cometary form.
     In these cases, then, we have evidence          that the luminosity of the
  comets depends first upon its distance from the sun, and secondly upon
  distribution of other swarms along its path.
     It would appear that a further discussion from this point of view
  might afford us interesting information on several points.
              X. On    some  Effects of Collisions in Comets.
     If we assume that the increased brightness of comets as the sun is
  approached    depends to any extent on collisions with meteorites
 external to the swarm, we must conclude that such meteorites exist
 nearer together nearer the sun. The idea seems strengthened by the
 great and irregular variations of intensity sometimes observed, as we
 know that the meteorites which the comet is liable to meet are
 not equally distributed.     Such a variation was noticed in Sawerthal's
 Comet in 1888, as I have already stated.
    Such variations, however, would be more likely to be observed in
 the tails in consequence of the enormous dimensions of some of them.
 Such variations have been observed from the time of Kepler.
    The fact that these variations so strongly resemble at times auroral
 displays is an additional argument in favour of the meteoric origin of
the latter.
    Another result of a different order produced by a comet moving
through a meteoric plenum would be the gradual shortening of a
comet's periodic time as the result of collisions, and this shortening
should not be absolutely regular, as in a homogeneous gas, for the
reason that the meteorites are not equally distributed.
    That there is such a shortening was proved by Encke for the comet
which bears his name, and that there are irregularities the following
table will show, though how far they might have been due to pertur
bations has not, I believe, been so far studied : —

     There is still another point.       If the luminosity were due entirely
 to internal collisioiis brought about hy the increase of solar action,
 then large comets, or those best visible, should begin to be brilliant
 long before smaller or more distant ones. But this does not seem to
 be so.     Mr. Hind has pointed out that proximity to the earth is not
 so important a condition for visibility of a comet in the daytime as
 close approach to the sun* ; and M. Faye is the authority for the
 statement that no comet             has been seen beyond the orbit of
 Jupiter.t        " It is               not on account            of their smallncss
                           assuredly
  that they thus escape our notice in regions where the most distant
 planets, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, shine so clearly with the
  light which the}. borrow from the sun ; this is because the rare and
  nebulous matter of comets reflects much less light than the solid and
  compact surfaces of the planets of which we speak, much less even
  than the smallest cloud of our atmosphere."
     On the latter part of this quotation it may be remarked that it is
  not necessary to assume that comets at a great distance from
  the sun, any more than nebulae, are visible by means of reflected
  light.
     Olbers, Faye, and others have attributed the production of comets'
  tails to solar repulsion.     Away from the sun, as we have seen, comets
  are tailless.
     The tail of a comet usually grows with its approach to the sun.
  This is not merely an apparent increase due to diminished distance,

bat is a steady growth outwards.              The tail of a comet is always
directed away from the sun, so that it sweeps round in a semicircle
«s the comet passes through perihelion.               The apparent repulsion of
the tails suggested to Olbers in 1812 the idea that the materials com
posing them are subject to electrical repulsion proceeding from the
sun, that they consist, in fact, of small electrified          particles repelled by
the similarly electrified sun.
   As   a  rule, the tail increases very quickly and considerably in
length after perihelion passage. Thus Borelly's Comet of 1874 in
creased from 4° to 43£° in length from July 3rd to July 19th in that
year, or from 4 millions to 25 millions of miles in length.* This effect
is precisely what we should expect if the tail be fed by vapours due
to collisions, for at perihelion the tidal action, and therefore the
interior movements, will be greatest ; besides which it is probable
that collisions with meteorites external to the swarm will here be
more frequent and more heat-prod ncing on account of the highest
velocity of the comet.
    M. Bredichin, of the Moscow Observatory, has shown that there are
three distinct types of tails.        In the first class, the tails are long and
straight,   and  the  repellent  energy of the sun upon the small particles
 is about twelve times as great as the energy of his gravitational
attraction.      The particles therefore leave the nncleus with a high
 velocity, generally about 14,000 or 15.000 feet per second.                     The
greater   this  velocity  in relation   to the  rate   of travel of the comet, the
straighter of course will be the tail, because the particles forming it
 do not lag behind.      In the second type, the energies of the attraction
and repulsion balance each other, or nearly so, and the tails of this
class are plumy and gently curved. In this case the particles which
go to form the tail leave the head with a velocity of about 30J0 feet
per second.
   Tails of the third type are short and strongly bent, the repellent
energy being only abjut ona-fifth of the attractive energy of the sun,
and the velocity of the particles leaving the head is only about 10)0
feet per second.
    Many comets exhibit tails of more than one type, and it was con
jectured long ago that such tails were composed of different kinds of
matter.
   Bredichin went further, and defined the composition of the different
kinds of toils which he had classified, by referring to the weights of
the materials which would give the relative values of the repulsive
and attractive forces necessary for tails of the different types.                 He
thus found that the long straight tails of the first type would be
probably formed by hydrogen, since this substance, on account of its
exceeding lightness, would be little influenced by gravity, while at

  the   same time    strongly influenced by the electrical repulsion.
  The second type of tails he considered to be made of hydro
  carbons, since hydrocarbons have a specific weight such that the
  repellent and attractive forces of the sun upon their particles may be
  nearly equal. Iron, ou the other hand, would be more subject to the
  action of gravity, on account of its greater weight, and was therefore
  taken as adapted to tails of the third type.
     The observations on meteorites recorded in the Bakerian Lecture,
 and the discussion of cometary observation contained in this Appendix,
 show that the vapours which are given out by the meteorites as the
 sun is approached, are in an approximate order : —
                          Slight hydrogen.
                          Slight carbon compounds.
                          Mugnesium.

                          Lead.
                          Iron.
    Now of these the hydrogen and carbon compounds are alone per
 manent gases, and the idea is that they have been occluded as such
 by the meteorites.      They are given out as the temperature of the
 meteorite again increases.
    Tails extending 10,000,000 miles through the cold of space, cannot,
 as Bredichin supposes,     I suggest, be composed of iron vapour, but
 they may well     be, and   doubtless are, of the hydrogen and various
 carbon compounds.
    The magnesium and iron vapours will condense soon after their
 repulse from the meteorite, the volatilisation of which produced them,
 and here, as Reichenbach with marvellous prescience suggested in
 pre-spectroscopic times, we have the chondroi of the exact chemical
 nature which he postulated.
    There is nothing extravagant in these suppositions, for we now
 know that all the substauces in question do exist in comets, and
it is evident that much is to be learnt from a continuation of the
inquiry.
    We know that the short-period comets get less brilliant with every
approach to perihelion, and that some do not even throw out a tail,
and we can easily ascribe both these results to the fact that after
several such appulses the vapours liable to be driven out of the
meteorites by temperature get less and less.
    If this be so, we may regard the comet with many tails as one
which for the first time undergoes perihelion conditions. We are iu

   repulsion away from the meteorites which produce them, through a
   meteoritic plenum.       Hence we should expect auroral phenomena.
   These have been recorded in comets' tails since the time of Kepler.
   In the tail we have gases moving through meteoritic dust, in the
  aurora, as I shall show in the next part of this memoir, we have in all
  probability meteoritic dust moving through gases.
      What then becomes of the tails?
      Being thus formed at the expense of the materials composing the
  head, the materials removed from the head can never be returned to
  it because of its insufficient gravitational power over them, and more
  over they can no longer traverse the same orbits as the meteorites
  from which they sprung, because they have already been turned out
  of that course by the forces attending the development of the tail.
  The gaseous bodies thus become distributed throughout the space
  occupied by our system, and give no farther trace of their existence
  until, after subsequent occlusion which causes their disappearance,
  they are again made evident by future collisions.               The existence of
  " unperihelioned matter" then indicates that the regions of space,
  nearer the sun are not so full of these free gaseous products as those
 farther away.
     Comets must thus degenerate, so far at all events as their easily
 volatilised constituents are concerned, with each perihelion passage,
 but as the majority of them only approach the sun at long intervals
 of time they do not suffer much in this way. Some of the short-
 period comets get less and less brilliant at each successive perihelion
 passHge, and others are then observed entirely without tails, all the
available tail-forming material having been used up and dispersed
 into the regions of space farther away from the sun, while at aphelion
a fresh supply has been lacking.
     It has been conjectured by Weiss and Schiaparelli that the con-
 densed metallic materials of the tails, which are projected with the
 tails in the cases of the comets whose perihelia lie within the earth's
orbit, may give rise to the appearance of meteors.
    This may also happen in the case of condensable materials shot in
the first instance towards the sun, so that we may imagine the original
train of meteorites to gradually widen out in the plane of the orbit
inside and outside of the orbit of the main swarm.*
    It has been suggested that the luminosity of comets is possibly
partly electrical, and in support of this view Hasselberg showed that
the changes in Wells's Comet were closely related to changes which

212             Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.    On  the Classification    [Jan. 10,
took place    in an electrically illuminated vacuum tube, containing
hydrocarbon and sodium.
    Before referring to this, however, I may mention an early experi
ment of my own in connexion with this point.
    I described this experiment in the ' Manchester Science Lectures,'
1877 (p. 130), but it was made some years before.
    A mixture of meteorites taken at random was placed in a tube
attached to another tube with arrangements            for passing electric
sparks, and this again was connected with a Sprengel pump.            After
exhaustion, on passing the current under conditions which are
generally supposed to give a spark of low temperature, the spectrum
was seen to be that which Huggins, Donati, and others had observed
in the spectrum of the head of a comet.            The gases occluded in
meteorites were thus shown to be exactly what we get in the head of
a comet.
    A Leyden jar was then included in the circuit, and the spectrum
of carbon was seen to have been replaced by that of hydrogen, from
the decomposition       of hydrocarbons. Under low temperature condi
tions, then, the spectrum was that of carbon, while under high tem
perature conditions the spectrum was that of hydrogen.         I also stated
that in my laboratory work I had come across other curious cases in
which compound vapours when dissociated only gave us one spectrum
at a time, meaning that in a vapour consisting of two well-known
substances, under one condition we only get the spectrum of one
substance, and under another condition we get the spectrum of the
other substance alone, so in others again of both combined.
    I had noticed this change very particularly during the researches
of Professor Frankland and myself, in 1869, on the spectrum of
hydrogen.      In this case the two substances to be considered were
hydrogen and the mercury vapour from the mercurial air-pump which
was employed in the experiments.
    In the subliming experiments      I  also found that a carbonaceous
 meteorite in vacuo gives off hydrocarbon vapour at the ordinary tem
 perature, as a weak electric discharge gives us the longest line in the
 baud spectrum of carbon without heating.           On heating, the other
 lines come in till the well-known bands are formed with more or less
 completeness.     If the discharge be a little less weak, the hydrogen F
 line also appears, and sometimes C, and the F is brighter than the
 carbon line. A non-carbonaceous        meteorite, like the carbonaceous
 one, also gives traces of continuous spectrum in the orange, yellow,
 and green, with a weaker electric discharge.
    After describing the changes which took place in Comet Wells,
 which I have already referred to, Hasselberg writes : —
    " The above observations form an
                                        interesting addition to our know
 ledge of the physical peculiarities of the comet, and give a new and

 indubitable proof of the inherent luminosity of this boily, and also of
a greater complication of chemical constitution than former observa
tions had implied. It seems to be a particularly noteworthy fact
that the usual cometary spectrum observed first by Tacchini and
Vogel from May 22nd to 31st disappeared, while in its stead the
bright line spectrum was developed.             As this occurrence coincides
with the approach of the comet to perihelion, the cause of it may be
songht in the rapidly increasing heat of the comet, as thereby on the
one hand the sodium present in it was turned into vapour, and on the
other hand the electric processes within its mass attained greater
vigour.    From a discussion of the earlier spectroscopic observations
of the comet, and from comparative laboratory experiments of the
spectral relations of hydrocarbon, it seems to me very probable that
the development of light within this comet chiefly depended on disrup
tive electric discharges."*
   Hasselberg further refers to the experiments of E. Wiedemann on
the spectra observed during the passage of an electric current through
mixed gases and vapours.
   Wiedemann found that when electric sparks were passed throngh a
heated tube containing sodium and a gas like hydrogen or nitrogen,
the spectrum consisted solely of lines of sodium.              Hasselberg also
repeated this experiment, substituting hydrocarbon for hydrogen or
nitrogen, and found that the same thing happened.                He concludes,
therefore, that this demonstrates the electrical origin of the light of
comets, since the additional heat due to the approach of the comet to
perihelion might certainly bring out the sodium, but could not have
caused the hydrocarbon spectrum to disappear.
   I  would suggest, however, that the changes           which took place in
Comet   Wells can    be  equally    well  explained   on the supposition that
heat alone was in question.          The main point to be explained is the
disappearance   of  the   carbon    fluting spectrum and the appearance of
sodium as the comet approached perihelion. With the first increase
in temperature, as the comet left aphelion, the occluded compounds
of carbon would be driven out of the meteorites constituting the
head of the comet, and the spectrum would consequently be that
of carbon.     At the increased temperature due to further approach
to the sun, the carbon flutings would be masked by the increased
brightness of the continuous spectrum and by the radiation of other
vapours.     At the same time a still larger number of meteorites
would become incandescent, and vapours of sodium, and possibly also
of iron, would distil out. Also since the stones would remain in this
condition for a considerable time, sodium vapour would continue to be
visible until they had almost ceased to be incandescent.
   I may here state that sodium exists only in very small quantities

   in iron meteorites, but to a far greater extent in stony ones. A
   photograph of the arc spectrum of the Obemkirchen meteorite
   shows barely a trace of D, but the spectrum of a mixture of iron and
   stones shows    it fairly bright.
                                   XI.   Conclusions.
       I must again refer to the vast difference in the way in which the
  phenomena of distant and near meteoric groups are necessarily
  presented to us; and, further, we must bear in mind that in the case
  of comets, however it may arise, there is an action which drives the
  vapours produced by impacts outward from the swarm in a direction
  opposite to that of the sun.
       It must be a very small comet which, when examined spectro-
  scopically in the usual manner, does not in consequence of the siz«
  of the image on the slit enable us to differentiate between the spectra
  of the nucleus and envelopes.             The spectrum of the latter is usually
  so obvious, and the importance of observing it so great, that the
  details of the continuous spectrum of the nucleus, however bright it
  may be, are almost overlooked.
      A moment's consideration, however,              will show that if the same
  comet were so far away that its whole image would be reduced to a
  point on the slit-plate of the instrument, the differentiation of the
  spectra would be lost; we should have an integrated spectrum in
  which the brightest edges of the carbon bands, or some of them,
  would or would not be seen superposed on a continuous spectrum.
      The conditions of observation of comets and stars being so different,
  any comparison is really very difficult; but the best way of proceeding
  is to begin with the spectrum of comets, in which, in most cases, for
  the reason given, the phenomena are much more easily and accurately
  recorded.     But even in the nucleus of a comet as in a star it is much
  more easy to be certain of the existence of bright lines than to record
 their exact positions,* and as a matter of fact bright lines, as we
  have seen, including in all probability hydrogen, have been recorded,
  notably in Comet Wells and in the Great Comet of 1882.
      Allowing for these differences in the conditions of observations,
 the discussion shows that the changes in the spectrum of a meteor-
 swarm in the solar system are closely related to those which take
 place in a swarm outside the solar system.
      In both cases, when the number of collisions is just sufficient to
 render the swarms visible, the spectra are identical, consisting simply
 of the radiation of the fluting of magnesium at 500.

   In  each case, an increase     in temperature    is accompanied by the
addition of continuous spectrum.
   Further condensation of the nebulous swarm results in an apparent
star with a spectrum consisting of bright flutings and lines in
addition to continuous spectrum, and this condition, we have seen,
also has a parallel in cometary spectra.
   Still further condensation of the nebulous swarm results in a body
of Group II, giving the radiation of carbon and metallic fluting
absorption.     It has been seen that this is also reproduced in cometary
spectra.
   The next stage in the history of a nebulous swarm is the forma
tion of a body of Group III, in which the carbon radiation has
disappeared, and the metallic fluting- has given way to line-absorption.
This, we have seen, was exactly reproduced in the Great Comet of
 1882, and in Comet b, 1881, to which reference has just been made.
In the former case, both radiation and absorption lines were recorded,
this being due to the repellent action of the sun, as already explained.
   The general sequence of phenomena, both in nebulous swarms and
comets, may be stated as follows : —
              Magnesium (500) radiation.
              Carbon and manganese fluting radiation.
              Manganese and lead fluting absorption.
              Line radiation and absorption.
   It is now universally agreed that comets are swarms of meteorites,
and hence this connexion between comets and bodies of Groups I,
II, and    III  strengthens the general view, which would have been
worthless had the cometary spectra been otherwise.         We have, there
fore, well-marked species of swarms revolving round the sun exhi
biting just the same series of phenomena as marked species of non-
revolving ones in space.
   Schiaparelli's view, therefore, that comets consist of materials
similar in nature to that of which the nebulae are composed drawn
into the solar system by solar attraction, is now abundantly demon
strated by the spectroscopic survey of nebu'ae, stars, and comets
detailed in my previous papers and in the present one.
                            —
   [Note. December ith. Since the above was written, my assistants
have made some observations of the nebula in Andromeda, which
were suggested by the foregoing discussion. We have seen that
some planetary nebula give the same spectrum as a comet at
aphelion.     It appeared that if the nebula of Andromeda were further
advanced than a planetary nebula in condensation, it should give a
spectrum approximating to one of the more advanced cometary stages
which have been already discussed.

216            Mr. J. N. Lockyer.     On  the  Classification      [Jan. 10.
   The spectrum of this nebula has hitherto been regarded as a per
fectly continuous one, but the observations referred to show that
there are some parts brighter than others.       The spectrum is almost
entirely wanting in red and yellow light.     In the green there are two
maxima, the brightest of which is at wave-length 517, as near ns
could be determined with the wide slit which it was necessary to
employ ; the other maximum is near 546.           One of the observers,
Mr. Fowler, made six independent measures of the maxima on
November 20th, and got very nearly the same result each time, com
parison being made with the spectrum of a bunsen, and the spectrum
of chl iride of lead at the temperature of the bunsen.         The measure
ments were repeated on kNovember 27th, with the same result, and
on this occasion they were confirmed by another observer, Mr. Coppen.
 Another brightness near 474, as determined by comparison with the
bunsen burner, was also suspected, but it was not so easy to measure
us the others.
   My sugge-tion as to the origin of this spectrum is that it is the in
tegration of very slight continuous spectrum, carbon fluting radiation,
and the absorption of manganese (558) and lead (546).             The citron
 band of carbon masks and is masked by the manganese fluting, and
the absorption fluting of lead causes by contrast the apparent bright
ness at 546. The brightest maximum is no doubt the brightest
fluting of carbon at 517, and the one in the blue, which was sus
pected, is probably the blue carbon group 468 — 474.
   If these observations are confirmed this nebula is at present at the
same stage of condensation as Comet I, 1868, on April 29th (p.p.
April 20th), which must be regarded as a pretty advanced cometary
stage, seeing that it was observed so near perihelion and that the peri
helion disiance was small.
   The discussion of the observations of Nova Andromedae, which is
not yet completed, shows that there were bright lines in exactly
the same positions as the brightnesses which have now been de
termined in the nucleus of the nebula.      The appearance of the Nova
was therefore probably   due to increased  temperature due to collisions
taking place between the sparser outliers of the swarm composing
the nebula and the external swarm which came in contact with them.
The view of the Nova's probable connexion with the nebula is there
fore greatly strengthened by this inquiry.]

meteorites,  each large enough to present us with the phenomenon of

of this dnst in the higher regions of the air is by spectroscopic obser
vations of the atmosphere containing it when it is rendered luminous
by electrical discharges.       It becomes necessary, therefore, to make a
thorough investigation of the spectrum of the aurora boreal is from
the point of view that meteoric dnst, if it exists, is likely to assert
 itself in any electrical excitation of the atmosphere.
    It is now many years since the idea was first thrown out that the
aurora was in some way connected with shooting stars. The connexion
was first suggested by Olmsted in 1833.*
    M. Zenger, in a catalogue of aurora observed from 1800 to 1877,
showed an apparent connexion between the brightest displays and the
appearance of large numbers of shooting stars, and M. Denza noted
the same connexion on November 27, 1872, and remarked that ho
had noticed it before.
    In spite of these ideas, however, even after the chemical nature of
shooting stars was known, observers have in the main contented
themselves with making comparisons of the aurora spectrum with
the spectrum of air under different conditions of temperature and
pressure.
    It has   never been possible, however, to reconcile the aurora
spectrum    with   any known spectrum of air.             Some observers are of
opinion that the lines seen in the aurora coincide with air-lines, but
have different intensities, and they attempt to overcome this difficulty
by assuming that the aurora spectrum is produced under conditions
 which we are unable to imitate in our laboratories.
    When we recognise the importance of considering the possible
existence of meteoric dust in the atmosphere, a comparison with the
 spectra of uncondensed meteor-swarms is at once suggested, for the
more my researches advance the more does dust rather than large
meteoritic masses appear to be in question.
    The result of a preliminary comparison with 7-Cassiopeiae and with
 the bands in Duner's stars was communicated to the Royal Society on
 January 9, 1888. The tables which I then gave show that there is
 probably a very intimate relation between the spectrum of the
 aurora and those of meteor-swa,rms.
    The further inquiry into the recorded observations to which           I have
 subsequently   to  refer,  seems   entirely    to   justify the suggestion then
 put forward, and I now propose to show what progress has been
 made in attacking what has always been regarded as a difficult
 subject.   I  will first, however, briefly refer to the observations and
 comparisons which have been previously made, and discuss them in
 chronological order.
    It is necessary to state that the existing observations of aurora
 spectra show such great differences of wave-length for what are

 origins for the lines.       These discrepancies occur not only in the
 measures made by different observers, but in those made nt different

 are seldom recorded, but in place of them are given the means of
 several observations, and in some cases the means have been obtained
  by throwing together lines which are very far apart.            At best, there
 fore, it is only possible to suggest the most probable origins of the
 lines and bands seen.

                                                                            elec
 tricity up to     the   present    there   has    been   a  perfect agreement
 between the actions of this natural force and those of frictional elec
 tricity, that it was easy to foresee that the spectrnm of lightning
 must be the same as that produced by the ordinary electric discharge
 in air. The observations made by M. Kundt have perfectly proved
 this. The two phenomena of the aurora borealis and of terrestrial
 magnetism     being so closely connected with each other, that the
 appearance of the aurora is always accompanied by disturbances of
 the magnetic needle, it might he supposed that the aurora borealis
 was only an electric flash, which is however not the case.          During the
 winter of 1867-68    I  was  able  several times   to observe  the spectrum of
 the luminous arc which borders the dark segment, and is always
 present in faint aurorae.       Its light was almost monochromatic, and
 ronsisted of one bright line, on the left of a group of calcium lines.
 I  determined the wave-length of the line which was equal to X =
 5567.    Beyond this line the intensity of which is relatively great,
I  observed also, by increasing the width of the slit, traces of three
very faint bands which extended almost to F. On one occasion only,
where the luminous arc was agitated by undulations which changed
its form, I saw the regions in question lighted momentarily by some
faint spectral lines ; but considering the lack of intensity of the

 220              Mr.   J. N. Lockyer.         On   the Clarification      [Jan. 10,
 rays, it may still be said that the light of the luminous arc is sensibly
 monochromatic.
    " Here is a
                     circumstance which gives this observation on the
 spectrum of the aurora borealis a greater and even cosmic importance.
 During a week of the month of March, 1867, 1 succeeded in observing
 the same spectral line in the zodiacal light which had then an ex'ra-
 ordinary intensity for the latitude of Upsala.                  At last, during a
 starlight night, the whole heavens being in a manner phosphorescent,
 I found traces of it even in the faint light emitted from all parts of
 the firmament.        A very remarkable fact is that the line in question
 coincides with none of the known lines in the
                                                              spectra of simple or
 compound gases, at least so far as I have studied them at present.
It follows from what I have said that au intense aurora borealis, such
 as may be observed above the
                                       polar circle, will probably give a more
complicated spectrum than that which I saw. Supposing that to be
the fact, it may be hoped that in the
                                                    future it will be possible to
explain more easily the origin of the lines found and the nature of
the phenomenon itself.           Not being able to give this explanation at
present, I propose to return to it another time."

the spectrum he regards as having the same origin as the group of
lines in the spectrum of nitrogen which extends from 6213 to 6620,
and brightens towards the violet end, the change in appearance being
due to the faintness of the aurora.      This, however, is not likely to be
the case, as the red line has been seen both bright and sharp (R. H.
Proctor, " Aurora," ' Encycl. Brit.,' 9th edit.).
    In the same paper, Vogel shows the close coincidences between the
aurora lines and lines in the spectrum of iron, but considers it more
in accordance with probability to regard the aurora spectrum as a
modification of the spectrum of atmospheric air.
               Angstrom's further Observations and Conclusions.
    In   a later paper   ('Nature,' vol. 10, p. 210), Angstrom arrives at
conclusions which may be thus briefly stated : —
    (1.) That the aurora has two different spectra, one consisting of
the characteristic line, and the other consisting of the fainter lines.
    (2.) That the coincidences of the bright green line with a faint
line in the spectrum of air, as determined by Dr. Vogel, is purely
accidental, and also that there is no coincidence of any importance
with any member of the hydrocarbon group in which it falls.
    (3.) That the bright line is probably due to fluorescence or phos
phorescence.
    (4.) That Vogel's theory of unknown conditions of temperature
and pressure being competent to produce the change from the ordi
nary experimental spectrum of air to that given by the aurora, is
inadmissible. (Angstrom regarded the spectrum of a gas as invari
able.)
     (5.) That moisture may be neglected in considering the nature of
 the aurora spectrum.
     He describes an experiment on a glow equivalent to the glow of the
 negative pole of an air vacuum-tube, in which the spectrum obtained
showed close coincidences with three faint lines in the aurora spectrum.
 A layer of phosphoric anhydride is spread over the bottom of a flask
 fitted with platinum wires ; after exhaustion with an air-pump, the
 current from an induction coil is passed between the two platinums.
 The flask then becomes filled with a violet light like that which,
 under ordinary conditions, only appears at the negative pole.          The
 spectrum of this light shows the following close coincidences with
that of the aurora : —

    Although this coincidence is rather striking, it must be remembered
 that there are other strong bands in the spectrum of the negative
 pole which do not appear in aurora spectra.                        As mapped by
 Hasselberg, the spectrum of the negative pole consists of a series of
 bright flutings shading off towards the violet, the brightest edges of"
 them being at wave-lengths 419'8, 423-6, 427'8, 4515, 455-4, 459-9,
465-l, 470-8, these are all of equal intensities.*            (See fig. 16.)

    Capron remarks that if the violet-pole glow spectrum is to repre

those by which it obtains in dry-air vacuum-tubes or flasks at

ordinary temperatures            (' Auroras' p. 126).
    There can, therefore, be little doubt that the aurora spectrum has-
nothing in common with the negative-pole spectrum of nitrogen, and
that the three close coincidences noted by Angstrom are merely
accidental.
   With regard to Angstrom's objection to Vogel's theory that to view
the aurora spectrum as a spectrum of air under unknown conditions is.
inadmissible, we now know that gas spectra are not so invariable as-
Angstrom supposed ; but still we have no right to assume that any
particular change is possible until we can prove it experimentally, or
at the very least, prove an approach to such a change.                 If we assume
that any change may take place in any spectrum, we upset the whole
basis of spectrum analysis.

   The negative-pole spectrum of oxygen, as mapped by Schuster

brightest having the following positions : —

  The proximity of the brightest part of one band (5586) to the aurora
 line is notable, bnt considering that the aurora line is always sharp,
 Schuster concludes that there is no connexion between the spectrum
 of the aurora and that of the negative-pole glow of oxygen (quoted
 by Capron, 'Aurorae,' p. 130).
                  Comparison with the Spectrum of Hydrogen.
     Similarly, all attempts to identify the spectrum of the aurora with
 that of hydrogen, another constituent of our atmosphere (in the form
 <tf water vapour), have failed.         On this point Capron remarks: —
 " No
        principal line, and one subsidiary line only,* actually coincide
 with the aurora spectrum, this last being that to which Dr. Vogel
                                                      " Aurorae,'
assigns an identical wave-length, viz., 5189             ('             p. 109).
     That this coincidence is of no importance is obvious when it is
remembered that there are a great number of such lines in the
 spectrum of hydrogen, and that no experiments have been recorded
 indicating that this line is more persistent than the others.
         Comparison with the Spectrum of Phosphoretted Hydrogen.
     Next in importance       to comparisons      of the aurora spectrum with
air spectra      is the   comparison     with    the   flame of phosphoretted
 hydrogen,     in connexion with Angstrom's                  suggestion      that the
characteristic green line may be due to phosphorescence or fluor
escence.      The spectrum        of phosphoretted          hydrogen consists of
several bands, the centres of the four brightest being at 526-3, 510-6,
560 5 and 599-4 (Lecoq de Boisbaudran, 1 Spectres Lumineux,' p. 189).
These bands brighten when the flame is artificially cooled, especially
the less refrangible ones.
     On this subject, Capron says : " Having regard to the near
 proximity of the phosphoretted hydrogen band to the bright aurora
line, to the circumstance of this band brightening by reduction of
temperature (a phenomenon probably connected with ozone), to the
peculiar brightening of one line in the green in the "aurora" and
"                     " tabes
   phosphorescent               (the phosphorescent tubes probably con
taining O), and to the observed circumstance that the electric
discharge has a phosphorescent or fluorescent afterglow (isolated, I
believe, by Faraday), I feel there is strong evidence in favour of such
an origin to the principal aurora line, if not to the red line as well
                                                                                      "
(' Aurone,' p. 126).
    But the mere fact of one of the phosphoretted hydrogen bands,
and that only the third in order of brightness, falling near the
characteristic aurora line cannot be supposed to be anything more

          subsidiary lines of hydrogen constitute what   I  described as the structure-
spectrum of hydrogen in my paper of November 17, 1887.

than accidental, nnless the absence of the two brightest bands can be
explained.      As this cannot be done, the suggestion may be dis
regarded.
    The information given about the green line seen in the phosphor
escent    tube by Capron is insufficient for any conclusions to be
founded on it.
    Fig. 16 is a map showing that the aurora spectrum is not thart of
 the negative or positive pole of nitrogen, or any spectrum of oxygen,
although there are some apparent coincidences. The intensities of the
 lines and bands in the spectra are indicated by lengths, the longest
 being the brightest. The map shows that lines or flutings as bright
as or brighter than those which have been supposed to coincide with
lines in the aurora are absent from the aurora spectrum. The probable
meteoritic origins, which       I  shall have to refer to in detail later on, are
 shown at the bottom of the map.
              Groneman's reference to the Meteoric Bust Theory.
    So far we have had chiefly to deal with theories in which the
aurora spectrum is regarded as being inseparable from that of
atmospheric air, but we have next to consider one which, if true,
 would give a totally different origin.
    In 1874, Groneman ('Astr. Nachr.,' No. 2010) resuscitated the
theory of Olmsted that the aurora has its origin in the fall of incan
descent meteoric dust.*            The iron particles are regarded as being
competent      to  produce     the   magnetic phenomena which accompany
aurorffi, and as being consistent with their geographical distribution.
This theory, however, was not received very favourably, because it
left the spectroscopic phenomena as far from a solution as ever. Thus,
Capron remarks (' Aurorae,' p. 170) that "if aurorw were composed
of incandescent glowing meteors, it would be reasonable to expect to
find in the spectrum the lines of iron, a metal constituting so
prominently the composition of meteorites.               No connexion between
the iron and the aurora spectrum is, however, proved ; though it may
be suspected.      The iron spectrum contains so many lines that some
may,   as  a mere   accidental circumstance, closely agree with the aurora
lines."     Vogel also considers that we are not entitled to regard the
close coincidences of the aurora lines with some of the iron lines as
complete evidence of iron vapour, until we have succeeded in showing
by experiments that the relative intensities of the iron lines are
subject to great changes ; and in this way to account for the appear
ance of faint lines in the aurora spectrum, or, on the other hand, to
account for the absence of the strongest lines.             I  shall show subse-

    In reviewing     the above        theory to explain the origin of aurora
 up to 1879, Mr. Band Capron makes the following statement : " As
 the general result of spectrum work on the aurora up to the present
time, we seem to have quite failed in finding any spectrum which,
as to   position, intensity, and general character of lines, well coincides
with that of the aurora.            Indeed, we may say we do not find any
spectrum so nearly allied to portions even of the aurora spectrum as
to lead us to conclude that we have discovered the true nature of one
spectrum of the aurora (supposing it to comprise, as some consider,
two or more). The whole subject may be characterised as still a
scientific mystery." (- Aurorae,' p. 171.)
                          II.  Lemstrom's     Observations.
    The next contribution to our knowledge of aurora spectra of any
importance is that of Lemstrom's (' L Aurore Boreale,' 1886).                       All
previous observers who attempted to identify the spectrum                        of the
aurora with that of atmospheric air failed -to do so, but Lemstrom
asserts (p. 158) that the twelve lines which have been recorded in
aurora spectra are nearly all seen in the spectrum of a Geissler tube
containing the same gases as those constituting our atmosphere. The
differences in the relative intensities he believes to be due to condi
tions of temperature and pressure.*                  Although the auroral line
 (wave-length 557) does not agree perfectly with the line at 558 seen
in the spectrum given by his appareil de V aurore boreale (air vacuum-
tubes illuminated by sparks from a Holtz machine), ho regards the
atmospheric origin of the aurora spectrum as completely demon
 strated.    He states (p. 138) that the characteristic line of the aurora
spectrum is always seen in the light produced by the discharge of an
 electric current (by means of his appareil oVecoulement) from the top
 of a mountain.       He gives a table of auroral lines compared with the
 lines in the spectra of rarefied air, as observed by himself, and by
 Vogel and Sundell under other conditions. The air lines recorded b}-
 Yogel nearly all coincide with lines recorded as oxygen lines by
 Schuster (' Phil. Trans.,' 1879) ; but it is important to note that
 some of the strongest lines mapped by Schuster are absent from
 Vogel's list (see fig. 16).         So that, even if we allow that some of the
 aurora lines fall near lines of oxygen, the absence of the brightest
 oxygen lines from the spectrum is sufficient evidence for us to conclude

 compared        by Lemstrom with some of the lines or bands observed by
  himself in the spectrum of rarefied air. The air lines which he gives
 all agree in position with some of the nitrogen flutings mapped by
 Hasselberg (' Memoires de l'Academie Imperialo de St. Pétersbourg,'
  Series 7, vol. 32, No. 15).         One of them is at wave-length 558, and this
 he believes to be coincident with the aurora line 557. The intensity of
 the line is not given, but Hasselberg gives it as a comparatively feeble
 fluting at 557 (see fig. 16).          Considering the absence of the brightest
 nitrogen flutings from the spectrum of the aurora, the supposed
 coincidences between some of Lemstrom's rarefied air lines and lines
 in the aurora spectrum, which are far from perfection, may be dis
 regarded.
    The same objections apply to the lines in the rarefied air spectrum
 which have been recorded by Sundell ; those which fall anywhere
 near lines in the aurora are comparatively faint flutings or lines in
 the spectrum of nitrogen ; at all events, flutings of the same or
 greater intensities are absent, and there is no evidence to show that
the coincident ones retain their brightness as the others fade.
    Lemstrom then leaves the origin of the aurora spectrum as uncer
tain as ever. There is no evidence to show that it is a spectrum of
air, or, indeed, of any other gas. If it be a spectrum of air, it is one
 which has never been obtained experimentally, and one which can
only be put forward by making unphilosophical assumptions and care
fully avoiding experiments.
                  III.  Gyllenskiold's   Observations and Conclusions.
    Still later observations         of the aurora which have been published
are those made at Cape Thordsen by M. Carlheim-Gyllenskiold.*                   Two
lists of lines are given, one from observations made with a Hofmann
spectroscope, and the other from observations made with a Wrede
spectroscope.         The lines in the first list extend from blue to red, and
those in the second list from green to violet.               The individual observa
tions of different aurorae with the lines observed in each are given.
36 aurorae are recorded in which only 1 line was visible, 15 in which
there were only 2 lines, 6 with 3 lines, 15 with 4 lines, 5 with 6 lines,
4 with 7 lines, 1 with 8, 1 with 9, and 1 with 10 lines, so that
altogether, no less than 84 observations are recorded.
    The total number of lines seen were 32. Gyllenskiold's main con
clusions are : —

228              Mr. J.  N. Lockyer.    On  the  Classification    [Jan.  10r
    (1.) That 16 of the aurora lines nearly coincide with air lines,
8 with the positive-pole spectrum of nitrogen, 4 with the negative-pole
spectrum of nitrogen, and 3 with lines of hydrogen.
    (2.) That the aurora spectrum greatly resembles that of lightning,
and regards it as consisting of several superposed spectra.              The
variable    character   of the spectrum  is accounted    for by the  absence
sometimes of one, sometimes of another, of these elementary spectra.
    (3.) The brightness of the aurora, according to M. Gyllenskiold,
does not depend upon the energy of the electrical discharge which
produces it, but upon some cause with which we are not acquainted.
    Note. — It is not out of place to suggest that the brightness of the
aurora may depend upon the varying quantities of meteoric dust in
the atmosphere at different times.
    (4.) Two kinds of aurora are distinguished, viz., red ones and
yellow ones. In the former, the positive-pole spectrum of nitrogen
is predominant, while in the latter the negative-pole spectrum is pre
dominant.       Laboratory experiments have shown that the positive-
pole spectrum of nitrogen is given by dense moist air, while the nega
tive-pole spectrum is given by rarefied dry air; and Gyllenskiold
suggests that yellow aurorae are formed in the higher parts of the
atmosphere, and the red ones in the lower layers.
     (5.) That the observations bear out Angstrom's suggestion that
some of the bands belong to the negative-pole spectrum of nitrogen.
 He says : — " Nos observations confirment done l'opinion d' Angstrom,
que les bandes faiblement lumineuses de l'aurore boreale appartiennent
an spectre du pole negatif ; auxquelles les bandes et les lignes de
 l'azote se joignent dans certains cas."        He observes that the cha
 racteristic line of the aurora appears in company with the negative-
 polo spectrum, and says it is probable that some of the more refran
 gible bands of the positive-pole spectrum also appear at the same
 time.    Both the positive and negative-pole spectra are very rich in
 violet and ultra-violet rays, and Gyllenskiold's observations support
 Angstrom's view, that the characteristic line is due to the fluorescence
 of oxygen produced by the violet light of the negative pole.
     This fluorescence, however, cannot be reproduced in experiment0
  with Geissler tubes, and M. Gyllenskiold concludes that the origin of
 the characteristic line still remains unexplained, but he suggests that
 its origin may eventually be discovered by investigation of the
 fluorescent spectra of various chemical substances.
      The characteristic aurora line therefore remains unexplained by
 M. Gyllenskiold.        As regards the remaining lines, he states that
  sixteen nearly coincide with air lines, but it is important to note that
  these are not the sixteen strongest air lines.    Some of the lines fall
  near to bands in the positive-pole spectrum of nitrogen, as Gyllenskiold
  points out, but equally stroner or stronger bands are not seen in the

 1889.]            of  the various Species     of Heavenly Bodies.                 229
 aurora, so that the coincidences         are only accidental.     The same applies
 to the bands in the negative-pole spectrum.
    Like Lemstrom, then, Gyllenskiold makes                  no advance    as regards
 the origin    of the spectrum of the aurora, but at the same time it i3
 only   fair  to  acknowledge the value of the observations.
    I  have next to refer to my own observations              and comparisons.

                            different Stages of Pressure.
    In order     to demonstrate    that the aurora spectrum does not coincide
 with the vacuum-tube spectrum of air, I have made a series of obser
 vations of an end-on air vacuum-tube, about 5 feet long and 2 inches
 in diameter.         The tube was arranged as in fig. 17, one end being
.connected with the Sprengel pump, and the other with a piece of
 glass tube by means of mercury joints.                  The latter tube was con
 nected with a hand air-pump to save time in exhausting. After partial
 exhaustion      the tube was sealed off    with a blowpipe, and the exhaustion
 completed      with the Sprengel.          The slit of the spectroscope wa0

230 Mr. J. N. Lockyer. On the Classification [Jan. 10,
 1889.]         of  the various Species of Heavenly Bodies.            231
    When the spark first passed only a few of the strongest nitrogen
 flutings in the violet were visible, but as the pressure was reduced,
 the spectrum gradually extended towards the red.        A line of oxygen
 near 5316 was visible in the early stages, but it afterwards disappeared.
 At the most luminous stage, nothing but nitrogen flutings were visible.
 After a time the nitrogen flutings dimmed, and low-temperature
 flutings of carbon appeared.      Then the F line of hydrogen appeared,
 and a little later the C line. Later still, the hydrogen line at G also
 appeared.     With the further dimming of the nitrogen flutings, an
 oxygen   line at 471 brightened, being sometimes as bright as the F line,
 and brighter than the carbon flutings.       The whole spectrum then
 became very faint, but as the line at 471 dimmed, another oxygen
 line at 465 appeared.     Ultimately, the glow was so faint that only a
 few of the nitrogen flutings were visible.
    The sequence of the various flutings and lines is shown in fig. 18.
 Below the various air spectra the principal lines of the aurora
spectrum are given for comparison.       The spectra of nitrogen, carbon,
and hydrogen are given as a key to the spectra observed.         It should
also be stated that the line near 5316 is an oxygen line.        I am now
working at this line. It will be seen at a glance that there is only
one coincidence with one of the most persistent flutings, which are all
that need be considered.        Since equally persistent flutings are not
present in the spectrum of the aurora, this coincidence is obviously
of no importance.
              V.  Comparison tcith Uncondensed Meteor-swarms.
    In my preliminary communication I indicated the remarkable
coincidences between the lines in the spectrum of the aurora and
the bright lines in the spectrum of 7-Cassiopeire, and also with the
absorption-bands in bodies of Group II. These bodies are uncon
densed swarms of meteorites at a comparatively low temperature,
and hence the comparison suggests the probable meteoritic origin
of the spectrum of the aurora.
    I  have since extended the tables which    I then gave, and excluding
for the present Gyllenskiold's observations,          they now stand as

     The chemical substances indicated by Duner's bands, and by the
lines in 7-Cassiopeiae, are those constituents of meteorites which are
volatilised at the lowest temperatures, namely, magnesium, man
ganese, and lead.        Besides these there are compounds of carbon,
which, when rendered incandescent, give the carbon flutings.
     In discussing the meteoric dust theory, as first enunciated by
Olmsted during the display of 1833, spectroscopists lost sight of the
importance of considering the volatility of meteoric constituents,
instead of quantities.         Iron exists in great quantity in meteorites,
and was naturally the first thing to be expected in the aurora spectrum,
supposing it to be a meteoritio phenomenon.                 But, as I pointed out
in my paper to the Royal Society on November 17, 1887, experiments
on the luminous phenomena seen at low temperatures show that if
magnesium, manganese, and lead are present in meteorites, they will
be indicated in the spectrum before the iron.
     The experiments have shown that a very small percentage of
manganese is sufficient to render the first fluting (558) visible. It
is the first fluting seen when ordinary iron wire is volatilised in
   • This line is Been as a pretty bright line in the spectrum of the Limerick
meteorite, but its origin has not yet been determined, although comparisons have
been made with most of the common elements. So far, it has not been observed in
any other meteorite.

234              Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.    On  the  Classification     [Jan. 10,
the oxy-coal-gas flame, and even with the purest electrolytic iron
prepared by Jacobi and by Professor Roberts- Austen it is visible
before the iron lines. The importance of this fluting in this discussion
cannot therefore be overrated.
    The aurora being a low-temperature phenomenon, we should expect
to find in its spectrum, lines and remnants of flutings seen in the
spectra of meteorites at low temperatures, the manganese fluting
being the most prominent for the reason before stated.
   The characteristic line of the aurora is the remnant of the brightest
manganese fluting at 558. Angstrom gave the wave-length of the
line as 5567, and since then many observers have given the same
wave-length for it, but probably without making independent deter
minations.     Piazzi Smyth, however, gives it as 558, which agrees
exactly  with   the bright edge of the manganese fluting.      R. H. Proctor
also gives the line as a little less refrangible than Angstrom's deter
mination.      He says : — " My own measures give me a wave-length
very slightly greater than those of Winlock and Angstrom" (' Nature,'
vol. 3, p. 468).
   Gyllenskiold's measures with the Wrede spectroscope also give
5580 as the wave-length of the characteristic line.          I feel justified,
therefore, in disregarding the difference between the wave-length of
the edge of the manganese fluting and the generally accepted wave
length of the aurora line.
   The line of manganese at 540, which is seen in the spectra of many
of the " stars with bright linei, has been recorded in the aurora by
                 "
Vogel.
   The remnants of the two magnesium flutings seen in bodies of
Group II, at wave-lengths 500 and 521, are also seen as lines in the
aurora.     In addition to these, there is sometimes the lead fluting at
546, corresponding to Duner's band 5, and probably also the green
line of thallium at 535, as indicated in the tables.
   Four lines in the aurora spectrum are probably due to carbon. The
first is at 516-5, the brightest fluting seen in the spectrum of a bunsen
burner ;    I  have previously described this as a high-temperature
fluting, but the term is only relative.          The second is the low-
temperature      fluting  at 483, which   has  been recorded by several
observers.      There is probably also the high-temperature carbon
group beginning at 474, the maximum light of which is about 469.
Vogel records it as a band extending from 463 to 469, and Lemstrom
as 469 to 471.      These observations, therefore, justify us in regarding
this as a band, and if we take the readings of the other observers as
the wave-lengths of the part of maximum brightness, we get the
mean reading of the maximum as 467-5.          This agrees as well as can
be expected with the true wave-length of the maximum, 468.                The
hydrocarbon fluting at 431 has probably also been seen.

    Fig.  19 shows    how the aurora spectrum can be built up from the
lowest-temperature spectra of manganese, magnesium,                  lead, and
thallium, and the brightest flutings of carbon.
    When the temperature is increased iron (615) sometimes flashes in.
This was particularly noticed in the Norwegian observations, to which
I  have subsequently to refer.
            VI.   Further Discussion of Oyllenskiold's   Observations.
    If, in discussing Gyllenskiold's observations,      we   limit ourselves to
those cases in which not more than four lines were recorded, we find
that with a few exceptions, the lines seen were lines which are
brightest in the spectra of meteorites at low temperatures.            It might
at first sight be expected that when only a few lines are seen, they
ought to be the same in every case.           There are variations, however,
 which    in  all  probability  are  due  to  differences in composition of
ditferent groups of meteorites.
    The following tables contain all the observations in which not more
than four lines were recorded.          The probable origin of each line is
also stated.       Some of the lines have been arranged in different
columns, as the discussion       has suggested.
    It will be observed that the characteristic line was seen alone eight
times by Gyllenskiold out of the thirty-eight observations recorded
 in the first table.
    Out of the total number of seventy-six observations in the tables,
 the line of manganese at ware-length 540, which is seen in the
                              " bright line stars," was seen alone on two
spectra of many of the
occasions, and six times in company with other lines.
    The first fluting of lead, at wave-length 546, occurs alone three
 times, is twice associated with the thallium line, and occurs six times
along with other lines.
    The remnant of the magnesium fluting at 500 occurs alone only
once, but that at 521 occurs alone six times.
    The first fluting of carbon, at 517, occurs alone three times, and
 twice in company with other lines.         The carbon band extending from
 468 to 474 occurs alone four times, and six times with other lines.
 The low-temperature fluting of carbon at 483 only occurs once, and
 is then alone. The first iron line at 579 occurs alone twice, and six
 times along with other lines.        When we get iron apparently without
 manganese 558 it is probably due to masking of 558 by continuous
spectrum.       The groen line of iron at 527 occurs alone seven times,
 and thirteen times in company with other lines.
    The thallium line appears alone only once, but in company with
other lines it appears fifteen times.

    There are only six lines for which no origins can at present be
suggested.      The discrepancies between the readings of the same lines
at different times are so great that a few outstanding lines are only to
be expected.
    It  now remains for future observers to determine by direct com
parisons whether the coincidences suggested are real, or merely
accidental approximations.
                       VII.   The Norwegian Observations.
    The Report of the Norwegian Polar Station at Bossekop in Alten,
in connexion with the International Polar Investigation (1882-83),
gives the results of a few interesting observations of the aurora
spectrum. Herr Krafft states that in general only the characteristic
aurora line (558) is seen, even in strong aurorae.                 The red line
occasionally appears very conspicuously, but only in flashes.
     Tbe wave-lengths obtained for the aurora line were 5595, 5586,
 and 5587. Unlike most observations, these place the aurora line on
 the less refrangible side of the manganese fluting.            Hence, we have
 an additional reason for neglecting the difference between the wave
 length of the brightest edge of the manganese fluting, and the
commonly accepted wave-length of the aurora line, as given by
 Angstrom.
     On account of the rapid flashing-up and disappearance of the red
 line only one measurement could be made, and the wave-length
obtained was 6205.         If this reading be reduced in the same propor
 tion as those of the green line, a wave-length is obtained which
agrees almost perfectly with that of the brightest edge of the iron
fluting.*
     These observations are the latest which have been published, and
were obviously made with a full knowledge of all previous work, so
that their importance must be strongly insisted upon.
    It is fair to assume that the red line is due to iron, because we know
that the effect of a slight increase in the intensity of the discharge
which produces an aurora in which only the manganese fluting is
visible would be to bring out the iron vapour.              Hence in an aurora
in which the green line is constant, and the red line is only inter
 mittently visible, there must be a discharge in which there are sudden
fluctuations in intensity, and a simple cause of the reddening ot the
aurora is now before us.
                       VIII.    The Spectrum of Lightning.
     If the origin of the auroral spectrum is really that which have       I
assigned to it, in lightning in which the electric action is feeble we

 made, so that the iron fluting has been omitted from them.

ought to again meet with some of              the lines      indicating  higher
temperatures.
   Dr. Schuster made     a series of observations         on the spectrum of
lightning   in Colorado    in  1878.    The  region    of  the spectrum dealt
with extended from wave-length 500 to 580, and the following lines
were observed   : —
                                      559-2
                                      5334
                                      518-2
                                      5160
   There can be little doubt that the first line on the list is the
remnant of the manganese fluting at 558, the same as seen in aurorae.
The second is in all probability the thallium line at wave-length 535,
the third is probably 6 (518-3), and the fourth the edge of the carbon
fluting at 516.
   The lines at 559-2 and 516 were only seen on one occasion.
   These observations are of very great importance, inasmuch as they
appear to indicate that the difference            between the spectrum of
feeble or diffused lightning and the spectrum of aurora is due to a
difference of temperature only.
   Not only can we thus trace the difference in the spectrum as we
pass from aurora to lightning, but just as we can trace the effects
of gradually increasing temperatures on the spectrum of aurora, we
can trace the changes due to variations in the intensities of lightning
discharges, as I shall now proceed to indicate.
   The spectrum of lightning as observed by Schuster in Colorado
was obviously one produced by a comparatively feeble discharge.               It
differs  from  what         be  conveniently   called    a  " high- temperature
                      may
        "
aurora only in having Mg 500 replaced by b. It is important to
note, however, that the difference in the number of lines often seen
in aurorae and in lightning is in all probability due to the fleeting
character of the latter.
    As we pass to the spectrum of such a discharge as Vogel observed
in September, 1871, the 500 line of nitrogen makes its appearance,
 and Mn 558 disappears. Vogel's complete list of lines* is as follows : —

    The band seen by Vogel was in all probability the carbon               band

which is seen in the " bright-line stars," and it appears to be the
most visible of the carbon bands from the same reason in both cases,
namely, the absence of continuous spectrum in the blue.
   The last stage in the spectrum of lightning seems to be that in
which the brightest lines in the spectrum consist entirely of lines of
nitrogen. Such a spectrum has been observed by Col. John Herschel,
the following lines being recorded : —
                                                 5697
                                                 500-9
                                                 4636
  These are the three strongest lines of nitrogen, the wave-lengths of
which, according to Thalen, are —
                                  2«I   !?       double line.

                              4631
  We have, therefore, an almost complete sequence of electrical dis
charges  through our atmosphere, from discharges so feeble that we
only     the
        see   500 fluting of magnesium, or the 1st fluting of manga
nese in their spectra, to those in which the brightest lines of nitrogen,
characteristic of intense discharges, are the brightest lines visible.
It important to note that in the latter case we have to deal with
  is
discharges through the lower and denser portions of the atmosphere.
The conditions of the two extreme cases are therefore very different,
and the spectra differ accordingly. In one case the discharges pass
through rarefied air charged with meteoric dust, whilst in the other
they pass through dense air which         comparatively free from such
                                                     is
dust.
  In experiments with large air vacuum-tubes the lines of nitrogen
are never seen, and     itextremely improbable, therefore, that they
                             is
would occur in weak discharges through    space which     much less       is
confined. Hence, when the line at 500                     is a
                                              seen in conjunction with
the fluting  of manganese,        in
                                  it all probability due to magnesium
                                        is
and not to nitrogen.
   The forked lightning discharge can be imitated by jar spark, or   a
by the spark from an electrical machine, and the brightest lines in
the spectra, as we have seen, are identical.
   Fig. 20 shows the varions spectra of air charged with meteoric
dust when illuminated by electrical discharges of gradually increasing
intensities. The lowest temperature of all gives the Mn fluting at
558.   With the first increase in intensity the iron fluting (615)   at        is
times momentarily added, then magnesium, lead, thallium, and carbon

 until there is a complete spectrum. The next stage of increasing
 intensity is that observed by Schuster in which magnesium is repre
 sented by b.     Then comes Vogel's spectrum, entirely without man
 ganese, but with 6, Tl (535), H (F, 486), C band (468—474), and
 N(500). Schuster did not make observations beyond 500, so that the
 continuity in that region is apparently broken. It is possible that the
 broad band in the blue observed by Vogel was the group of nitrogen
 lines, the brightest of which is at 463 ; but in that case it is difficult
 to understand why a decided maximum was not recorded.            Finally,
 we have the spectrum observed by Col. Herschel, in which those
 nitrogen lines appear brighter than all the rest, exactly as they
 appear in an intense spark discharge in our laboratories.
     The question will probably arise in some minds how it is that if we
 assume that the luminosity of nebulae and aurora both proceed from
 meteoric dust, that in the case of the nebulas we have to deal chiefly
 with the magnesium fluting at 500, whereas in the case of the aurorae
 the line most constantly seen by itself is the manganese line at 558 ?
 The importance of this question becomes evident when we remember
 that the line 558 is seen for hours without the interference of any
 other line whatever, and seen under conditions which indicate that
 the higher reaches of the atmosphere are so full of the glowing stuff
 which produces the line that the light is sufficiently intense to be
 reflected by the particles lower down. It may be that in this difference
 we have an important piece of evidence regarding the origin of the
luminosity in the two cases in question.
                                                    I
     In the case of the nebulae, the light of which have attributed to
 collisions, it is obvious that the collisions which produce the lowest
 temperature will always be greatest in number, that is to say, there
 will be more grazes than smashes. In any case, however, where the
luminosity is produced in this way there will be sufficient tempera
 ture brought about by impacts to volatilise the constituents of the
meteorites.     Considering the meteorites merely from what we know
about their composition from those which have fallen on the earth,
we must assume that the largest constituent of meteorites is olivine.
    Where, therefore, we are dealing with collisions merely, we should
expect to get the spectrum of olivine produced say 10,000 times, while
the spectrum of the other substances would only be produced once in
consequence of more extensive collisions.       But when we pass from
the nebulae to the meteoric dust in our air we are no longer dealing
with collisions ; we are dealing with luminosity brought about by
electrical discharges ; and it requires no long argument to show that
these electric discharges would be more likely to travel along and to
render luminous the metallic constituents of the dust rather than
the silicates of magnesium or of any other metal.
    In this way, then, we should expect to get electrically exhibited the

spectrum of the substances in the iron dust which came out under the
lowest conditions of electrical excitation.       I have previously shown that
under these circumstances what we do get is invariably the spectrum
of manganese with its first fluting at 558, and that long before the
spectrum of iron itself is seen.
    Should this line of argument be accepted, we have in it an addi
tional proof of the suggestion that the luminosity of nebulae is really
due in great part to collisions, not to electrical excitation of any kind
in the first instance.
    I  think it will be granted after what has preceded, that there is
strong' evidence of an intimate relation between the spectrum of the
aurora and the spectra of meteorites and meteor-swarms.                    Certainly
the coincidence is such as to justify us in regarding meteoric dust
as the origin of the spectrum until a better and more probable origin
is demonstrated.
    How this view will meet the periodicity and geographical distribu
tion of aurorae remains to be investigated ; the question may be asked
whether the earth sometimes meets greater quantities of aurora-
producing matter revolving round the sun than at other times, and
whether in this way the periodicity may be explained.
                   IX.   The Aurora and the Zodiacal Light.
    Since the shooting star ignition level lies between 75 and 50 miles
in height, and aurorae have been seen at heights of over 100 miles, it
seems    probable that the matter which reaches the earth from space
is in the main of three degrees of fineness, and gives evidences
of its existence at three different heights, the finest furnishing
materials for auroral displays at heights reaching to 130 miles,* the
mean finenesses igniting at a height of 75 miles, and giving rise to
the appearance of falling stars, till a height of 50 miles is reached,
when it is all consumed ; and the coarsest of all, which at times reach
the surface itself as meteoric irons or stones.

    During the great aurora of January, 1831 (Poggendorff           's   Annalen
 of that year), a bright yellow streak was seen to rise with common
 cloud velocity, forming an arch from west to east, becoming invisible
 in the west by the time it had reached the east.
    During the same aurora Professor Bischoff, at Burgbrohl, saw a
 moving cloud, as bright as the Milky Way, pass from east to west in
 five minutes.
    During another aurora, December,              1870, Professor Rudberg, of
Upsala,    saw  a very bright     patch,    of   double  the dimensions of the
moon's disk, moving with great velocity behind the auroral beams.
    On November      2, 1871,   Dr. Groneman saw a strange, feather-like,
 brilliant arch, striped parallel to its well-defined sides, and changing
its curve during its visibility of two hours' duration. Dr. Vogel
 determined the auroral character of its spectrum.*
    On May 17, 1875, Mr. Lefroy (Freemantle, Western Australia)
 describes a similar feather-like appearance, which he considered to be
converging streams of infinitely minute particles of matter passing
through space at a distance from the earth less than that of the moon,
and at which the earth's aerial envelope may still have a density suffi
cient, by its resistance, to give to cosmic dust passing through it with
planetary velocity that slight illumination which it possesses.t
    On November 17, 1882, however, was seen the most remarkable
display of this nature in the middle of an intense aurora then visible.
Again the appearance was feather-like, again the spectrum was auroral,
but the strange object moved across the sky, at a height of 133 miles,
as determined by Capron and Herschel, and with a planetary velocity
of between 10 and 15 miles a second !
    Dr. Groneman did not hesitate at the time to look upon it as a mass
of meteoric dust traversing the higher reaches of our air, and
regarded it as a strong confirmation of the view which he had resusci
tated,  J a conclusion in which I concur.
    The above results also strengthen the view that the anrora is very
similar in some respects to the zodiacal light.            Such a connexion is
indicated by the fact that when we have greatest number of aurorae,
in spring and autumn, the zodiacal light is also best visible. The
spectroscopic observations of Angstrom and Respighi show that the
spectrum of the zodiacal light consists of the characteristic line of the
aurora and a short continuous spectrum, and thus furnish further
evidence of the connexion suggested.              The observations of Wright
and others, showing that the spectrum is continuous, are not at

 variance    with Angstrom's observation,           for we    should expect the
 spectrum to be somewhat variable.*            It is probable that the observa
 tions showing nothing but continuous spectrum were made when the
 temperature was only sufficient to render the meteoric particles red
 hot.    That the zodiacal light does consist of solid particles, or at all
 events of particles capable of reflecting light, is shown by the
 polariscope.
    No one has ever gone so far as to suggest that the zodiacal light is
 an atmospheric phenomenon, and yet the principal line in its spectrum
 is identical with that in the spectrum of the aurora. We have, there
 fore,  an additional reason, if one be required, for discarding any
 atmospheric origin which has been suggested for the auroral spectrum.
                             Part II. — Fallen Dust.
    We have now complete evidence of the existence of meteoric dust
 in the atmosphere, first, from the known number of meteorites which
 enter the atmosphere, and secondly, from the spectroscopic observa
 tions of aurorae.      This dust will finally reach the earth's surface, and
 it is exceedingly interesting to trace its subsequent history as far as
possible.
    The detection of such dust which falls on the general surface of the
earth is almost hopeless, but that which falls on the sea will have a
chance of accumulating where the water is quietest.                The researches
 of Messrs. Murray and Renardf during the " Challenger " Expedition
 seem to indicate that such an accumulation really takes place.
    An examination of the deep-sea deposits collected during the expe
 dition has led them to believe that certain small "magnetic spherules
                                                                                  "
are totally unlike particles of iron derived from basaltic rocks or from
 furnaces, and that their origin is probably meteoritic.            In addition to
 these, great numbers of the so-called             "                       " were

 found in the red muds from deep-sea bottoms.                Messrs. Murray and
Renard incline to the belief that these owe their origin chiefly to the
decomposition of volcanic rocks, but my own researches seem to show
that they may be at least partly formed by the accumulation of altered
meteoric dust.

   The specimen examined was from Station 276, 2350 fathoms, South
Pacific.
   I have observed the spectra of some of the nodules, which were
kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Murray.
   In the oxy-coal-gas flame, lines of Na, Tl, Li, K, Mn, and Fe are
seen.    The brightness and persistence of the thallium line at 535 is
very remarkable, and is especially interesting sinco the line is seen in
the aurora and in one or two meteorites.        The red line of lithium,
which is seen in many of the meteoric flames, is also bright in the
spectrum of the nodules.        The manganese fluting at 558, the one
coincident with the chief line of the aurora, is also seen in the
spectrum of the nodules, but it is not nearly so bright as the thallium
line. The iron lines are very faint. As might be expected, from the
association with sea-water, the lines of sodium and potassium are
very bright. A photograph of the flame spectrum shows lines of
manganese, and some of the strongest violet lines of iron.
   When some fragments of the nodules are placed along an end-on
vacuum-tube and the spark passed, flutings of carbon and lines of
hydrogen appear, almost exactly as they do when meteorites are
subjected to the same treatment.        When the tube is made red hot,
the thallium line becomes very bright, and also the yellow and green
lines of sodium.
   It will be seen that the spectra of the nodules are somewhat differ
ent from those of meteorites, chiefly in the relative intensities of the
lines, but the difference can probably be explained by considering the
effect of sea- water.     I have the authority of my friend Professor
 Thorpe for stating that thallium and manganese would be the most
likely of the meteoric constituents to form insoluble compounds, and
hence these are what we should expect to find in deep-sea accumula
tions of meteoric dust.        The spectroscopic observations therefore
seem to show that it is not improbable that the manganese nodules
owe their origin, in some part at least, to meteoric dust.
   At the suggestion of Professor Renard I separated some of the iron
 spherules from the nodules by dissolving in dilute hydrochloric acid,

250               Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.       On the Classification   [Jan.  10,
and passing      a magnet   through the insoluble residue. In the oxy-coal-
gas flame the spectrum of the spherules consisted of lines of iron,
sodinm, and potassium, and the flutings of manganese, but there was
absolutely no trace of thallium.           The other portion of the residue,
however, gave       the thallium   line as  bright as the nodules themselves.
The solution, when evaporated to dryness, gave no indications of
thallium.
    If we are justified in regarding the partly meteoric origin of the
nodules as established, the excess of thallium shows that each nodule
represents a very considerable quantity of meteorio dust, since there
is only a comparatively small proportion of thallium in meteorites.
This further suggests that an enormous quantity of meteoric dust
passes through our atmosphere, especially as that which falls on the
sea only represents a portion of the total amount.
  III.   " SUGGESTIONS ON THE ORIGIN OF BINARY AND
                           MULTIPLE SYSTEMS."
   In   connexion    with the explanation of the variability of the bodies
of Group      II,  which I suggested in the Bakerian Lecture for the last
year,    I  indicated that in the absence of spectroscopic details, the
colours of the components of double stars might enable us to deter
mine whether both have condensed from double or multiple nebulae,
or whether the companions are later additions to the systems.          I  also
referred to some difficulties in the discussion.
   On further consideration some of the difficulties have disappeared,
and    I   now propose to return to the subject, limiting myself for
greater simplicity to binary systems.
   For this purpose it is necessary to begin by stating briefly what we
know relating to the colours of the different groups of celestial bodies,
adopting the classification which I suggested in the Bakerian
Lecture.
                              I. Colour Phenomena.
   As far as we at present           know, the colours associated with the
different groups of celestial bodies are in all probability as follows : —
      Group        I           Blue, greenish blue, white, or pale grey.
      Group       II           Yellowish red.
      Group     III            Yellow to greenish white.
      Group      IV            Bluish white.
      Group       V            Greenish white to yellow.
      Group     VI             Reddish yellow to blood red.
      Group    VII             Dark or nearly dark bodies.

 1889.]          of  the  various Species    of Heavenly Bodies.                  251
   The    blne colour       of some of the more             advanced     members    of
eGroup I, which are all faint, is probably due to the bright blue
fluting of carbon which stands out beyond the end of the continuous
spectrum.       They are really blue, and not apparently so because of
any absorption of the red. That in the case of double stars this
colour is not due to optical causes or complementary colours is shown
by the fact that there are some equally faint stars which are seen to
be red under similar contrast, and instrumental, conditions.
   Pechiile has observed the spectrum of one faint blue star, and his
observation bears out my view of their nature.                           He says : —
"              15' au Nord de cette étoile je trouve une étoile de 7m-,
qui   a   un   spectre tres singulier ni du             III   ni du IV type- La
partie moins refrangible du spectre n'est qu'indistinctement conpee
et un peu plus lumineuse du cote du rouge. Apres un large intervalle
noir vient une zone etroite d'un eclat tout-a-fait predominant qui
s'eteint rapidement du cote plus refrangible, et forme la fin du
spectre.    La coulenr de l'etoile est bleuatre." (Pechiile, ' Expedition
Danoise,' 1882, p. 40.)
   The green colour of the unadvanced members of Group                       I is pro
bably    due  to   the   magnesium      radiation   ;  thus,   the  Ring   Nebula   in
Lyra is green, and we find that its radiation consists almost entirely
of the magnesium fluting at wave-length 500. The bodies in the
same group which are white, or pale grey, in all probability add the
radiation of carbon and incandescent meteorites to the foregoing.
How far spectroscopic observations made with the assistance of large
telescopes will confirm these views or prove them to be erroneous
remains to be seen ; for the present, however, we may take the
                                                          I
colours associated with bodies in Group I as have stated them.
   The colours which         I  have associated with Groups           II  and VI are
those given by Duner.
   The prevailing tints in bodies of Groups                  III  and V are white,
yellow    and   orange,   so   that  when  we   see   a  yellow  star we cannot say
from colour alone what group it belongs to.
   The later species of Group          III will be white and greenish white,
the latter being the most advanced.                 With a further increase of
temperature,      stars  of    Group   IV   are   formed,     the colour becoming
bluish white owing to the increase of blue light.                     After this the
temperature begins         to  fall.  The  first   species    of  Group V will also
be greenish white on account of tho reduction of blue light, and the
next species will be white. After this, the various species of the
group will vary from yellowish white to orange.
   The stars of Group IV, a Lyrae, and Sirius being the most brilliant
types, are bluish white.
   The bodies of Group VII have little or no inherent luminosity.

 252              Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.    On the Classification     [Jan. 10,
                      II.  General Statement of Conditions.
    In discussing     the question whether the components of a binary
 star have condensed from the same nebulosity or not, a difficulty arises
 on account of the fact that, according to my theory of their constitu
 tion, there will be no constant relation between the mass of a swarm
                           When we see a " star
                                                  " of a certain
 and its brightness.                                              magnitude,
 we cannot tell from its brightness alone whether it is a large faint
 one or a small bright one ; for a large body at a low temperature may
 be equalled, or even excelled in brightness, by a smaller body at a
 higher temperature.        But when we know the spectra of the bodies,
 we also know their relative temperatures.        In the absence of spectro
 scopic  details,  colour  helps us to a certain extent, as I have shown.
    If a pair of stars of unequal masses have condensed from a double
 nebula, the smaller one will be further advanced along the tempera
 ture curve than the larger one ; the colours and spectra will be
 different, but it is not imperative that the magnitudes shall be unequal.
 The smaller swarm, because it must be in more rapid movement round
 the common centre of gravity, will suffer more quasi-tidal action
 and therefore collisions per unit volume ; it will therefore condense
 more rapidly than the larger one ; it will soon become as luminous,
 and afterwards will for a time be considerably hotter than the larger
 one.
    If the masses be very unequal, the smaller one will have the smaller
magnitude for a longer time. When there is a great difference in
magnitude, therefore, it is fair to assume that the one with the
 smaller magnitude has also the smaller mass.
    Another difficulty in the discussion, in the absence of spectroscopic
details, is due to the similarity in colour of bodies at equal heights on
the opposite sides of the temperature curve. Thus, as already stated,
bodies in Group        III have, as far as we at present know, exactly the
same colour, namely, yellow, as those in Group V.               Again, many
of the    members      of  Group   II  have  the  same   colour  as some in
 Group VI.
    The general conditions with regard to this subject may be thus
briefly stated : — If the magnitudes, colour, and spectra of the two
components of a physical double are identical, both had their origin
in the same nebulosity with two condensations, or in a double nebula.
    If the magnitudes are nearly equal, but the colours and spectra
different, it may be that the one with the most advanced spectrum has
the smaller mass, and if the advance is in due proportion, we are
justified in regarding them as having had a common origin.
    If the magnitudes are very unequal, we may take the one with the
Bmaller magnitude as having the smaller mass, and if it is propor
tionately in advance, as indicated by its spectrum, or colour, we may

1889.]           of the various Species of Heavenly Bodies.              253
regard both components as having had a common origin.                 If the
smaller one be leas advanced than the larger one, we have to regard it
as a late addition to the system.
   If   the two stars are of equal mass and revolve round their common,
centre of gravity they have in all probability done so from the nebu
lous stage, and therefore they will have arrived at the same stage
along the evolution road, and their colours and spectra will be
identical.
   If, however, the masses are very different, then the smaller mass will
run through its changes at a much greater rate than the larger one.
In this way it is possible that the stars seen so frequently associated
with globular nebulae may be explained ; while the nebula with a larger
mas3 remains still in the nebolous condition, the smaller one may be
advanced to any point, and may indeed even be totally invisible
 (Group VII), while the parent nebula is still a nebula. This condition
may be stated most generally by pointing to those double stars in
which the companions are small and red, although we know nothing
for certain with regard to their masses. But if we pass to the other
category in which it may be suggested that the companion is added
afterwards, the most extreme form would be a nebula revolving
round a completely formed star, like an enormous comet round the
sun; a less extreme form would be a bright line star, or a star of the
secoud group, revolving voand one of a higher group.           In this case
the colour would be blue or greenish-blue or grey.
                              III. Light Curves.
    I find  that the best way of dealing with this question is to represent
 the life of each component by a curve, in which the ordinates repre
                                   "
 sent time and the " magnitude of tho star. Then, if the colours and
 magnitudes are consistent with the curves beginning at the same
point, we are justified in regarding both as having condensed from
the same nebulosity. If not, in all probability the companion would
be a later addition.
    The form of the light curve, which represents the effect of increase
and decrease of temperature, will probably be something like fig. 21.
We should expect the curve to be somewhat similar to the light curves
of the regular variables of Group II, where the increase in luminosity
is due to the collision of two meteor-swarms.       Here there is a rapid
rise to maximum, and a steadier fall to minimum. This is confirmed
by the fact that there is apparently a greater number of stains of
 Group V than of Group III, though on this point I cannot yet speak
with any certainty. If this should turn out to be so, the fact would
appear to indicate that the time of existence of a body as a star of
 Group V is probably longer than the time during which it exists as a
condensed meteor-swarm under the conditions of Group III. During

its existence as an uncondensed swarm, however, the increase of
luminosity of the swarm will be very steady ; hence there will first of
all be a gradual increase of luminosity ; this will be followed by a
rapid rise to maximum, and afterwards a steady fall, until finally all
luminosity disappears.
    The light curves being of this form, if we begin with two uncon-
 densed swarms of equal masses and conditions, the curve for each will
 be the same in length and in the point of maximum luminosity.                         It
 will be a neck and neck race, and we shall have equal brilliancy,
 similar colour and spectrum throughout. Such stars I call Class I.

                                            Yellow).
     The first question is: Are there any such stars, for from the
 existence of so many nearly equal double nebulae in the heavens we
 should expect a large number.
     For the purpose of this inquiry          I  have used the Bedford Catalogue,*
 and have limited myself to the stars which afford the strongest
 evidence of being binary systems.                 In the absence of any spectro
 scopic survey of such systems, I am forced to content myself with
  similar or nearly similar colours.
  ,
     The following is a list of the binary stars given by Smyth, in which
  the magnitudes and colours of the components are almost identical.
  I except for the present those in which both components are yellow
  for a reason before stated.
     In these cases the two curves representing the lives of the com
  ponents will be identical, or nearly so, and will be as in fig. 21. One of
  the components may have a somewhat smaller mass, and, therefore, a
  shorter time of existence, as a self-luminons body, than the other,
  but the magnitudes and colours may still be nearly equal, or suffi-

ponents      are yellow and of nearly equal magnitudes.                 If both com
ponents shall be found         to  have identical spectra, thus placing them in
 the same group, a point which their colour leaves indeterminate,
their "life curves" will be coincident.              IE one is found to belong
to Group III, however, and the other to Group V, they can still be
represented by two curves beginning at the same point, but with the
ascending side of one intersecting the descending side of the other
as in fig. 22.      The places occupied by the stars are indicated by dote ;
the portions of the curves to the left of the dots represent the stages
already passed throngh, those to the right the stages still to be gone
through. This also applies to the diagrams which follow. In the

           components are yellow, and of equal or nearly equal magnitudes.
former case the masses of the two components would evidently be
equal, or nearly so, while in the latter case, one would be considerably
larger than the other.          Hence, in all cases where the components are
yellow    and   of  nearly equal magnitudes, we are justified in regarding
them as having possibly condensed from the same nebulosity.

   There is a considerable number of binary stars in which the magni
tudes of the components do not differ very much, but where one star
is blue.       If "we take these blue stars as belonging to Group I
 we shall have an average case represented by fig. 23, both curves
 starting at the same point.             From this point of view ths companion
 which has the smaller magnitude has the greater mass, and the
 system is young.
Fio.  23. — Light curves of the components of a binary star of Class 3, in which both
          components have equal or nearly equal magnitudes, one being blue.
   If  these curves          are a  fair representation        of binary stars of this
class, it is clear that we ought to find the primaries in every case,
white with a tendency to yellow. This is a severe test, but yet on
referring to the following table, which is a list of such binary stars,
it will be seen that there is not a single case in which the primary
is not white or yellow : —

  VII.     Binary Stars, Class      4. — Very Unequal Magnitudes,         the smaller
                                    Star being Blue.
   The next class to be considered is that in which the companion is
of relatively small magnitude, and is blue, green, or grey, the primary
usually being white or yellow.
   A binary star of this class can be equally well explained by starting
the two curves at the same point, or starting one later than the other.
In the former case we should have to regard the one with the smaller
magnitude as having the greater mass, and the two curves would be
as in fig. 24, a.      If we take the one with the smaller magnitude as
having the smaller mass we shall have the curves as in fig. 24, b.
Fig.  24. — Light curves of the components of a binary star of Class 4.      a represents
     the case on the assumption that both components condensed from a double
     nebula, whilst b represents the case on the assumption that the companion is a
     cometary addition.
   It  seems    probable,     therefore,   that we shall never be able to tell
whether the components of            a binary star of this class have both con

denned from the same nebulosity or not ; but since the components of
the majority of binary stars appear so far to have had in all pro
bability a common origin, there is no reason why we should rather
regard these as having had a different one. The following is a list of
them taken from Smyth's ' Celestial Cycle : —

                                        being Red.
   There are      a few   binary stars in which the companion is red. The
red component has probably a smaller mass than the primary, and is
consequently, further advanced along the temperature curve.                        Fig. 25
Fio.  25. — Light curvrs   of the components of a binary star of Class 5, in which the
                          companion is red and relatively small.

                Mr. J.  N. Lockyer.         On the Classification             [Jan.  10,
represents an average case of snch a binary star ; both curves starting
at the game point.      In this case, it will be seen that the companion
 has almost run through all its stages, whilst the primary has still
several    stages to pass through.        This may be regarded as a more
advanced stage of binary stars of Class 2.
   We have here again a severe test, for if these curves represent
anything like the trnth, the primaries ought in every case to be
greenish white, white or yellow. -On referring to the list it will be
seen that this condition is satisfied in every case.                   To make quite
sure that S Herculis belonged to this class of binaries, a special
examination of its spectrum was made at Kensington.                       This showed
it to  be almost as far advanced along the temperature curve as Sirius.
   Only a small number of such binaries has been recorded.                          They
are as follow : —

'

totally indeterminate on account of the absence of a statement of the
colours ; they are as follow : —

    In the first of   these, X Geminornm, the companion has probably
 been added since the primary condensed, for we cannot place the two
 components on curves which begin at the same point.
    With regard to 7 Leonis, there is a difficulty as to what spectrnm
 should be associated with the greenish-yellow component, so for the
 present it cannot be stated whether both have condensed from the
 same nebulosity or not.
    We cannot include       f Herculis in Class 2, because the difference
 between the magnitudes of the two components is too great, but we
 can represent the case by starting the companion curve a little later
 than the primary curve.       We may therefore conclude that we have
 here to deal with an added companion.
                                X.  Conclusion.
    From the foregoing lists and discussions it will be seen that in
 nearly all cases the components of a binary can be shown with much
 probability to have had their origin in double nebulae.            There are
 exceedingly   few  cases  in which   it seems  at all likely  that  the com
 panion is an addition of a cometary nature, and it is possible that
even these few exceptions may be due to errors of observation.
    This, then, strengthens the view that in the case of regular variable
 stars of Group  II  we are in presence of the formation of a double star,
 at an early period in its history when the two swarms are at times,
 so to speak, in contact.     When the variability is not regular we are
 in presence of the formation of a multiple system.
    I cannot omit to point out how very admirable the colour observa
tions must have been to stand the strain to which the foregoing
generalisation has subjected them, and that if equal skill be now
applied to observation of the spectra of these bodies, a considerable
advance in our knowledge may be looked for.
    In the discussion included in this paper,        I have been aided by
Messrs. Fowler, Gregory, Baxandall, Porter, and Coppen.                   Mr.
Fowler made the observations of the spectrum of the large air
vacuum tube, and of the spectra of manganese nodules and iron
spherules. He also classified the binary stars, Mr. Coppen assisting
him in preparing the tables.
   Mr. Gregory has been responsible for preparing the various tables
in connexion with comets and aurorae.
   Messrs. Baxandall and Porter have prepared most of the maps
and drawings, for the careful reproduction of which          I have to thank
Mr. Collings.

 L "A    Method of detecting dissolved Chemical Compounds             and
       their Combining Proportions."          By G. Gobe, F.R.S.      Re
       ceived November 14, 1888.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The method described and illustrated by examples in this research
is an application of the " voltaic balance
                                             " to the measurement of the
amount of voltaic energy of electrolytes (see ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 44,
 pp. 151 and 294), and is based upon the general truth that "when
 substances chemically combine they lose some of their power of
exciting a voltaic couple," and the amount of this power can be
measured by means of the " voltaic balance." (Sketch.)
    The method is briefly as follows : Oppose and balance the current
from a small voltaic couple of unamalgamated zinc and platinum in
a known quantity of distilled water in a small glass vessel through a
sufficiently sensitive galvanometer, by that from a perfectly similar
couple, and take care by occasionally heating the platinum to redness,
to avoid error caused by absorption of hydrogen.
   Dissolve in separate, equal, and known quantities of distilled water
a series of several mixtures of the two constituents A and B of the
supposed compound, in the proportions of their atomic or molecular
weights, and multiples of them, some having an excess of A, and
others of B.     For instance, if both are monads mix them in the
several proportions represented by the formulae 5A + 4B, 4A + 4B,
and 4A+5B; but if A is a monad and B a dyad, then use the
proportions indicated by 3A + 2B, 4A + 2B, and 5A + 2B.
   Add sufficiently minute quantities in succession of one of these
solutions to the water of one of the voltaic couples until the needles
of the galvanometer visibly commence to move, and note the amount
added.    Recharge the vessel with distilled water, clean the metals,
and repeat the experiment with another of the solutions; and so on
until all the solutions have been tried, and the mixture has been

found of which the largest proportion ia reqnired to move the needles,
that is the one which has the smallest proportion of voltaic energy,
and which has its constituents chemically united in definite proportion
by weight without an excess of either ingredient in a chemically free
state.
   The following is an example.          The combining proportion is the
one which gives the smallest amount of voltaic energy, and its

   The compound is represented by the molecular formula —
                                K2S04,2KN03.
   By means of      a number     of suitable examples of this kind, the
author shows that the dissolved substances unite together in the
definite proportions by weight of their ordinary chemical equivalents.
The results of several experiments indicate the existence of multiple
combining proportion in a feeble degree.
   Evidence is given of the existence in solution of compounds
represented by the formulae KC1,C1, — KBr.Br, and KI,I, and these
results are confirmed by means of comparative colour measurements.
   The question of the limit of complexity of chemical combination of
substances whilst in solution together in water is experimentally
investigated, and although a definite compound was formed having
the formula K2S04,16KN03,4AmCI,2NaCl,8KCl,32LiCl, the limit of
possible complexity did not appear to be nearly reached.
   With regard to the general question, does every electrolytic sub
stance when dissolved in wator unite in definite proportions by weight
with every other such dissolved substance ? The author states that
he has examined by the foregoing method more than 180 different
mixtures of such bodies, but has not found one in which definite
chemical union is not more or less clearly indicated by a minimum
amount of voltaic energy, coinciding with the proportions of the
ordinary chemical equivalents of the substances.              The mixtures he
examined included all classes of these substances, viz., of elements
with elements; elements with monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic acids;
acids of all these classes with each other ; elements with monobasic,

    1889.]    On the Detection   of dissolved Chemical    Compounds.       267
   bibasic, tribasic, and tetrabasic salts  ; monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic
   acids with all these classes of salts, and all these salts with each
   other in similar great variety. And he concludes that the relation of
   roltaic energy to chemical combining proportion, as already stated, is
   a general one, and that every electrolytic substance      when dissolved in
   water unites chemically  in definite proportions by weight with every other
   such dissolved body,  provided no separation of substance occurs.      And
   that  they   unite to form compounds       of apparently, unlimited com
   plexity.
      The method may be employed to ascertain the degrees of valency
  of substances, the basicity of acids, &c.        It may also be used to test
  the purity of soluble bodies, and (as previously stated) to examine
   the internal constitution of electrolytes ; and the author is now
  using it for the two latter purposes.           It is capable of extensive
  application; by it the state of union, whether chemical or of mere
  mechanical mixture (possibly also the relative strength of chemical
  union) of nearly every electrolytic substance soluble in water,
  alcohol, &c., with every other such substance can be detected, pro
  vided the substances do not precipitate each other, or corrode the
  platinum, and it would be easy to indicate a very large number of
  mixtures which might be so examined, and thus lead to the discovery
  of many definite compounds, probably thousands, which exist only
  whilst in solution, and are decomposed on evaporating or crystallising
  the solution ; he has already found more than 150. The author has
 also employed it for ascertaining the distribution of acids and bases
  when together in solution, and for measuring the rate of chemical
 change proceeding in aqueous solutions, and generally for investi
 gating the chemical constitution of isomeric mixtures, or those
 having the same ultimate chemical composition.               All these results
 have arisen from investigating the electromotive forces of simple
 Voltaic couples.
     As an illustration of the application of the method to the examina
 tion of the internal constitution of electrolytes, including that of
isomeric mixtures, two instances are given in which two mixtures,
possessing the same ultimate chemical composition, exert very different
amounts of voltaic energy.
     In an additional note, dated December 27th, 1888, the author
shows that although, according to J. Tuomsen's determinations, an
aqueoas solution of a molecular weight proportion of MgS04, and
one    of K2S04, neither     evolve nor absorb heat on admixture with each
other, distinct evidence of their chemical union whilst in solution is
afforded by measurements made with the "voltaic balance;" this
difference may perhaps be explained by the different degrees of
sensitiveness of the two methods.

    II. " Relative Amounts of Voltaic Energy of Electrolytes."
        By G. Gore, F.R.S. Received November 24, 1888.
                                 ( Abstract.)
    In this   research   the  author has determined by means of the
:j                  "
   voltaic balance    the relative amounts of voltaic energy of upwards
of 100 aqueous solutions of elementary substances, acids, salts, bases,
organic substances, &c., exerted by them upon a simple voltaic couple
at ordinary atmospheric temperature.
    The method of measuring the amount of energy of a substance
was as follows : Take two small glass cups containing known volumes
of distilled water. Form two voltaic cells of them by means of strips
or stout wires of unamalgamated zinc cut from the same piece, and
two small sheets of platinum, also cut from the same piece. Connect
them together in series to a sufficiently sensitive galvanometer (say,
one of from 100 to 1000 ohms resistance), so that the currents from
the two cells oppose each other, and produce no visible deflection of
the needles.     This arrangement constitutes a " voltaic balance," and
is extremely sensitive to change of chemical composition of the liquid
in one of the vessels.       Make an aqueous solution of known strength
of the substance, and add it in sufficiently small quantities at a time
to the water in one of the cups until the needle of the galvanometer
 visibly commences to move, and note the proportion of the substance
 and of water then contained in that vessel.
    As the amount of energy required to move the needle is the same
 in all cases, the different numbers thus obtained with different sub
 stances represent the relative amounts of voltaic energy of those
 substances.     And as each substance or mixture of substances gives
 a different number, it is possible by this method to detect substances,
 to ascertain the degrees of strength or concentration of liquids, to
 ascertain whether a substance contains a soluble impurity, &c.      The
 method also is in many cases an extremely sensitive one.
     The names or formulae of the substances, together with their
 amounts of energy, are arranged in the form of a table as a volta-
 tension series of electrolytes, commencing with chlorine, which gives
  a plus number of 4-1,282,000,000, and ending with caustic potash,
  which gives a minus one of — 270,985, and a certain mixture of salts
  which gives —969,817.

III. "The       Resistance of Electrolytes to the Passage of very
       rapidly alternating Currents, with some Investigations on
       the Times of Vibration of Electrical Systems."             By J. J.
       Thomson, M.A.,       F.R.S.,  Cavendish Professor of Experi
       mental Physics, Cambridge. Received January 9, 1889.
    The electromagnetic effect of the currents induced in a conducting
plate by alternations in a primary electromagnetic           system in its
neighbourhood, is, at a point on the side of the plate opposite to the
primary system, in the contrary direction to the electromagnetic
effect of the primary.       Such a plate, therefore, tends to shield off
from a secondary systsm the induction due to the primary, the
 diminution it produces in the current induced in the secondary
 depending upon the conductivity and thickness of the plate and the
 rate of reversal of the primary current.       If the rate of reversal is
 infinitely rapid, a thin plate of very badly conducting substance will
 be sufficient to screen off from the secondary circuit all the induction
 arising from the primary, while, if the rate is very slow, a thick plate
 of the best conducting metal will hardly be sufficient to do this.
 When the current in the primary is reversed a few hundred times
 per second, a metal plate of very moderate thickness will completely
 shield off all induction. If the thickness of the plate exceeds this
 limit, the currents induced in the layers next the primary will shield
 off all electromotive force from those layers which are more remote,
 so that in these layers no currents will be formed, the induced
 currents will thus be confined to the skin of the conductor, the thick
 ness of the skin varying inversely as the conductivity of the plate
 and the rate of reversal of the current.
    In Hughes' induction balance this screening effect of metal plates
 is made use of to compare the resistances of two metals, but with that
 apparatus it is hardly possible to make the alternations sufficiently
 rapid to produce appreciable effects with substances which conduct
 so badly as electrolytes ; we can, however, by employing the vibrations
 of electrical systems such as those used by Hertz in his recent ex
 periments on the rate of propagation of electrodynamic action get
 oscillations sufficiently rapid to make the shielding effect of moderately
 thin plates of electrolytes quite appreciable.
    Before describing the experiments made on this point, we shall
 consider the theory of the screening effect of a slab of a conductor
 bounded by two parallel planes. Let us suppose that these planes are
 represented by the equations x = 0, x = — h ; let Fj, Qv Ht represent
 the components parallel to the axes of x, y, e respectively of the
 vector potential on the side of the slab on which the primary system

   But Cj/Cge-1"* is the proportion in which the electromotive force
is reduced by the conducting plate ; hence we see that if this is
considerable    2irhpj \Z(l<2+c2)a must be large, and in this case the
reduction is proportional to the thickness of the plate, the number of
reversals in the direction of the current per second, and the specific
resistance.    The term 62 + c2 will not change if the primary remains
undisturbed. We see from the above investigation that if with the
same rate of reversal two different plates produce the same effect
upon the induced current, their thicknesses mast be proportional to
their specific resistances, or, in other words, the resistance of slabs of
the same area to currents parallel to their bounding surfaces must be
the same.
   The above case is the one that is most generally useful ; there is no
difficulty, however, in writing down the solution of the most general
case when the vector potential is not assumed to be parallel to the
plate.

two plates     the same their thicknesses must be proportional to their

   The rapidly alternating currents, which in the experiments were
screened by the plates, were those resulting from the electrical vibra
tions which are set up when the electrical equilibrium of a system                          is
disturbed. We shall now proceed to give            somewhat detailed in  a
vestigation of the periods of such vibrations, as the ordinary expression
for the time of vibration of a condenser, whose plates are connected
by an induction coil,     not applicable to this case, and, in addition,

think the result of these investigations taken in conjunction with some
experiments by Hertz, will enable us to decide the vexed question as
to whether the currents flow like an incompressible fluid, and to show
that Maxwell's hypothesis on this point      correct.          is

and the   velocity of propagation of the disturbance through the wire
is p/m or   v      ft). Since the imaginary part of m does not involve a,
                    +
and a only occurs under the logarithm, the rate at which tho vibrations
die away will in this case be practically independent of the resistance
and size of the wire.     Thus, unless Maxwell's theory       true, the rate          is
of propagation of a very rapidly alternating disturbance through                                 a

slowly.    The rate of propagation through the wire          almost though           is
not quite independent of the size and conductivity of the wire and of
the rapidity of the vibrations.      Thus,       could be proved that the

which the vibrations die away did not depend upon the resistance,                                it

former rate increases rapidly with rapidity of the vibrations, which                             is
inconsistent with the above result, if v and v are independent of p.
No experiments seem to have been made on the rate at which the
vibrations die away, though this would be one of the best ways of
distinguishing between the theories.

     If
      we suppose that the rate of propagation of the electrostatic
potential is exceedingly small, q and q' will be very large, so that
unless v'q = vq, the denominator of the right hand of (15) will be
exceedingly large, so that the case is the same as when v = v, and
therefore the rate of propagation of a disturbance through a wire the
same as that of electrodynamic action through air.
   We shall now investigate the time of vibration of a system con
sisting of a straight wire connecting two spherical balls.  Let us
take the middle of the wire as the origin, and suppose that the flow
of electricity is symmetrical about this point; at points equidistant
from the origin the electrostatic potential will                         be equal and    opposite.

    This result, however, is only true when I is not large compared

approximately \ir,            and so on. Thus in this case the ends of the
wire are nodes of the electrical vibrations, and the gravest mode of
vibration is that in which the wave-length is twice the length of the
wire ; here the wave-length, and therefore the rapidity of vibration,
will be independent of the capacities of the condensers at the ends.

comparable with 1/10 of a microfarad ml will equal tt/2, the ends of the
 wire will again be nodes, and the wave-length of the gravest vibra
 tion will be twice the length of the wire.            Thus in this case, except

 the capacity of the condenser were exceedingly large, much greater
 than that requisite for the same purpose in the preceding case, the
 time of vibration would be independent of the capacities of the ends ;
 and conversely, if we conld prove that the time of vibration depends
 upon the capacity, we should prove that v = 1. Now Hertz in his
 experiments seems to have been able to bring two circuits into
 resonance by altering the capacity of the ends, though these capa
 cities were exceedingly small compared with 1/10 of a microfarad.
 This, therefore, is exceedingly strong testimony in favour of the
 truth of Maxwell's theory, at any rate for conductors.

    Thus the electromotive force parallel to the surface of the reflector
does not vanish at the surface unless vt = v,.            Hertz (' Wied. Ann.,'

large, as would be case if the rate of propagation of the electro
static potential were exceedingly small compared with that of electro-
dynamic action, the first term on the right hand side of equation (14)
would be very large, so that in this case again tan ml would be large
and ml = \tt approximately, and the same arguments would apply
as in the case when v — 1 was finite.
    If v — 1   for all substances, then since the electromotive force
parallel to the axis of x is — dVjdt — dxfrjdx, and since F = F' + d<plilx. ip,
the x component of the electromotive force is — dF'jdt. Similarly, the
y and z components are
                              — dG/-dt, — dll'jdf.   Thus the electromotive
force is propagated with the velocity of the transverse vibrations (see
" Report on Electrical Theories," ' Brit. Assoc. Report,' Aberdeen, 1885,
p. 138), and since F', G', H' satisfy the solenoidal condition, there is
no condensation.
    The rate of propagation of a disturbance through a conductor is
only equal to that of the electrodynamic action through a dielectric
when ajTrpn^logpaYjirfiv3      is small, and though this will be so for the
 rapid vibrations we are dealing with when the conductor is metallic,
it would not be so if the conductor were a dilute electrolyte or a
rarefied gas.    In this case the rate of propagation of the disturbance
through the conductor would not be the same as that through the
dielectric. In this case the action propagated along the conductor,
and that propagated through the dielectric, would when they met
interfere and set up standing vibrations, so that along the conductor
there would be a series of stationary nodes at which the current
vanished, in other words, the current along the conductor would be
striated.    In the discharge of electricity through rarefied gases we
have the   current   passing through a conductor of high resistance, and
it seems possible that the striations which are observed in the case
may be due to the interference of the disturbance propagated through
the conducting gas and that passing through the dielectric.                The
widening    of the striae on  rarefaction, and   on increasing  the  diameter
of the discharge tube, are consistent with this view.
    The resistances of the electrolytes to the very rapidly alternating
currents were compared in the following way : —
    A, B, C are three coils, two of which (B and C) are approximately
of the same dimensions, and are nearly but not quite closed.            Sphe
 rical balls are fastened to the ends of these coils.       The  two  balls  of

 1889.]    Electrolytes to very rapidly alternating Currents.          2S5
the   coil C are supported in an ebonite frame provided with an
ebonite screw, by means of which the two balls can be brought very
near together and kept so as long as is necessary.
   The coils B and C are placed on shelves of glass coated with
shellac.   The shelves are supported on a framework with supports at
different levels, as in an ordinary book-case, so as to enable the disr
tauce between the primary and secondary coils B and C to be altered
if necessary. The coil A is connected to an induction coil which,
when, in good order, will give sparks 5 or 6 inches long.       The coil is
worked by a slow mercury break, the speed of which can be regu
lated by altering the inclination of the arms of a fan whose motion
resists that of the break : in the actual experiments the circuit was
broken every few seconds. When the coil works sparks pass between the
points e and /, electrical vibrations are started in the coil B ; in other
words, there are alternating currents in B whose period is that of its
electrical vibration, and given by equation (18). The currents in B
will induce currents in C, and these latter will be rendered evident
by the production of a minute spark between the two balls at its
extremities. These sparks, though small, are so bright that they can
be readily observed without darkening the room.
   The production of sparks in the secondary circuit is much affected
by -what are, apparently, slight alterations in the conditions of the
primary. Thus, for example, it is very much facilitated by placing
the balls of a pair of discharging tongs between e and /, and allowing
the spark to jump from e to the discharging tongs, and then from the
discharging tongs to /. This change did not seem to be due to the
resonance between the coils B and C being improved by the presence
of the tongs, for unless they were placed in the way of the spark they
produced no effect ; again, it was not altogether due to an increase in
the quality of electricity which passed from A to B at each discharge,
as this was measured by placing a specially insulated galvanometer in
the circuit, and it was sometimes found that the quantity of elec
tricity which passed when the tongs were not interposed and when no
spark was produced in the secondary circuit, was greater than the
amount which passed when the tongs were interposed and when
sparks were prodnced.         The character of the spark which passes
between   A  and  B has  also  great influence — the best sparks are those
which are perfectly straight, and accompanied by a sharp snap ; zig
zag sparks in the primary very rarely produce any sparks in the
secondary.
   A  conducting plate placed between B and C ought, as we have seen,
to diminish the induction between them, and therefore the electio-
motive force in the circuit C, and since the diminution in the induction
 increases with the rapidity with which the current in the primary is
 reversed, it ought in this case to be very marked.   This was found to be

286            Prof.  J. J.  Thomson.         The Resistance  of     [Jan. 17,
the case   ; thin sheet metal and tin-foil when placed between the coils
 were found to completely stop the sparks in C.          I then coated a plate
 of glass, which of itself had no effect upon the sparks, with a film of
 Dutch metal about T7Vrr of a centimetre in thickness, and found
 that it completely stopped the sparks, and 1 have not been able to get
 a film of metal thin enough to allow sufficient induction to pass
through to produce sparks in the secondary.
    This is in accordance with the results of our investigation on the
 screening effect of conducting plates, for we saw by equation (7) that
 when a screen of thickness h was interposed the electromotive force
is only
                                   </(fc2  + C2)*r

                                        2vhp
when a is the conductivity of the metal.
    Since the electromotive force in the plane of the screen, which is
taken as the plane of yz, is of the form
                                2 cos    by cos cz,
 v/(62 + c2) will he of the order 2jt/R where R is the radius of the primary
coil ; several coils were used whose radii varied from 13 to 23 c., so
that a/(63+c') will be of the order 1/2. The length of the coils
varied from 81 to 140 c., and the balls at the extremities from 1 to
2 c.  in diameter, so that the length divided by the capacity is large,
and, therefore, by equation (18) the wave-length will be twice the
length of the coil, or for the largest coil about 3 metres; thus p will
be about 2x x 108, and if we suppose the film is -s^W of a millimetre
thick, h will be 5 x 10~4, we may take » to be 10*. A film of this
kind will, by the above formula, diminish the induction about 800
times, and we should, therefore, not expect the electromotive force
acting on the secondary to be sufficient to produce sparks.
   A thick plate of ebonite was next placed between the coils but did
not produce any appreciable diminution in the sparks in the secondary ;
thus ebonite,, though opaque to vibrations as rapid as those of light,
still allows vibrations of which 108 take place in a second to pass
through without interruption.
    The effect of interposing a film of electrolyte was next tried. A large
square glass trough was placed between the coils B and C and carefully
levelled, the electrolyte was then poured in ; when only a very small
quantity of electrolyte was in the trough the sparks still passed, but
they got feebler and feebler as the quantity of electrolyte in the trough
increased, until finally, when the electrolyte was dilute sulphuric acid,
they ceased altogether when the depth of the electrolyte in the trough
amounted to 3 or 4 millimetres.           The criterion adopted for the dis
appearance    of  the  sparks  was     to allow 60 sparks to pass into the

primary, stopping and starting the coils several times;          if,
                                                                during this
time, no sparks passed in the secondary, the sparks were considered
stopped.    A variation of       per cent. in the quantity of electrolyte
                                 5
present would cause the system to pass this point one way or another
in a marked way.
   The halls at the extremity of the secondary were adjusted so that
sparks passed freely before the electrolyte was put in, after each ex
periment the electrolyte was removed, and care was taken to ascertain
that sparks still passed as freely as before so as to guard against any
accidental disarrangement of the secondary during the experiment.
   Three sets of coils were used which we shall describe by         II, III.
                                                                       I,

   The thicknesses of the films are by equation (7) proportional to the
specific resistances, so that the numbers in the fourth line give the
relative resistance of the electrolytes to currents whose directions are
reversed from 10s to 2 x 108 times per second.          In order to see
whether these resistances are the same as those with an almost
infinitely slower reversal, I determined the resistance of the electro
lytes by using a commutator which reversed the current through the
electrolyte about 120 times a second, and kept the direction of the
current through the galvanometer constant.          The electrodes were
platinised, and no polarisation could be detected.      The numbers are
given in the last line of the above table, and agree sufficiently well to
enable us to say that the relative resistance of electrolytes is the same
when the current is reversed a hundred million times a second as for
steady cun-ents.
   It was not possible to compare in this way the resistances of electro
lytes and metals, as the thinnest metallic film which could be obtained
was evidently much thicker than was necessary to completely stop all
induction.    I succeeded, however, in comparing by this method the
resistances of graphite and sulphuric acid.      The graphite film was
prepared by placing a sheet of glass at the bottom of a trough filled
with water, holding a large quantity of finely powdered graphite in
suspension; after the graphite had deposited itself uniformly on the
glass plate, the water was syphoned off, and the graphite film allowed
to dry gradually.     When quite dry it was hard and compact. and
could   bo rubbed   down  by emery to any required thickness.       By
diminishing the thickness of the film and adjusting the distance
between the coils, a film of graphite was obtained which just stopped
the sparks ; a film of H2S04 was then substituted for the graphite,
and its thickness adjusted until             it,
                                      too, just stopped the sparks.  In
this case, by formula (7) the resistance of equal and similar areas of
the two films to currents parallel to their surface must be the same,
the currents being reversed 108 times per second.        determined the
                                                                   I
resistances to steady currents parallel to the surface, and found that

 1889.]     Electrolytes  to very rapidly alternating Currents.        289
 the resistance   of the graphite film was 6- 7 ohms, and that of the
sulphuric acid 7-2 ohms ; thus we may say that the ratio of the specific
resistances of graphite and sulphuric acid is the same when the
currents are steady as when they are reversed 10s times per second.
Since the ratio of the resistances of such dissimilar things as graphite
and electrolytes remains the same, we may conclude that the resistances
themselves remain unaltered.        The method described above for com
paring the resistances of electrolytes is one that can be very easily
and quickly applied, and only requires the simplest apparatus : an
induction coil, or, if that is not available, an electrical maehine, being
all that is required. The method has the advantage of avoiding the
use of electrodes, as all the circuits in the electrolyte are closed.
   Since electrolytes are transparent, they must, if the electromagnetic
theory of light is true, act as insulators when the currents are reversed
as often as light vibrations, or about 10u times per second.      We have
seen, however, that they conduct as well when the currents are
reversed 10s times a second as when they are steady; thus the mole
cular processes which cause electrolytic conduction must occupy a
time beiween 10-8 and 10~16 seconds.
   Another point which can be settled by this method is, whether a
vacuum is a conductor or an insulator.         According to one view the
great resistance which a highly exhausted vessel offers to the passage
of electricity is due to the difficulty of getting the -current from the
electrode into the rarefied gas : when once the current has got there,
there is, according to this theory, no further resistance to its passage :
if this theory is correct, a highly exhausted receiver placed between
the primary and secondary circuits ought to stop the sparks in the
latter, as rfnce all the circuits are closed there ought to be no obstacle
to the passage of the induced currents.                              I
                                              In order to test this took
a box, 50 c. by 50 c. by 4 c., the top and bottom of which were sheets
of plate-glass fitting into wooden sides ; the sheets of glass were also
supported by five ebonite pillars plaeed at equal intervals over their
surface.    The box was repeatedly dipped into a bath filled with
melted paraffin until it was surrounded by a coating of paraffin about
2 c. thick.   The paraffin was then smoothed over with a hot soldering
iron, and then covered with a layer of shellac varnish.       The box was
then exhausted by a mercury-pump, and it was found that the pres-
snre could be reduced to about 1 mm. of mercury, but no further.
When this vacuum was placed between the primary and secondary
coils it did not produce the slightest effect upon the sparks, so that
its conductivity must be very small indeed compared with that of the
electrolytes used in the preceding experiments.          I  am having an
earthenware vessel made with which I hope to repeat the experiment
at much higher exhaustions.
   I also tried whether the conductivity of the electrolyte was altered

by sending a current through it ; for this purpose a layer of sul
phuric acid was placed between the primary and secondary coils of
such thickness that it almost but not quite stopped the sparks in the
latter ; a current of about 2 amperes, which was reversed about 500
times a second, was then sent through the sulphuric acid, but the
passage of the current did not seem to produce any effect whatever
upon the sparks in the secondary.           I  conclude, therefore that the
resistance of an electrolyte is not affected by the passage of a current.
    I wish to express my thanks- to my assistant, Mr. E. Everett, for
the zeal and skill he has displayed in these experiments.

                                      — have recently tried the effect of a
very high vacuum in stopping the sparks.           The primary circuit con
 sisted of two  straight wires with spheres fastened to one end of each ;
 these wires were connected with the poles of an induction coil, and
the sparks passed between the spheres.             The secondary consisted
of two similar wires, with smaller balls at the ends, the distance
between the balls being very small.         The length of the wires of the
secondary was altered until it was in resonance with the primary.
The secondary was placed in a hollow cylinder formed of two coaxial
 glass tubes, sealed on to a mercury pump, by means of which a very
 high vacuum was obtained in the space between them, which sur
 rounded the secondary.        This vacuum, however, did not produce the
 slightest effect on the sparks.]

I.      On the Influence of Carbonic Anhydride and other Gases

        Ph.D., F-Et.S.    Received December 18, 1888.
    In   consequence of a paper which has appeared in the last number
of the ' Zeitschrift fur Hygiene,' by Dr. Carl Frankel, entitled " Ueber
die Einwirkung der Kohlensaure auf die Lebensthatigkeit der Mikro-
organismen," I have been led to publish the results of some prelimi
nary experiments on the same subject which I made in the spring of
 1886, but which, owing to my attention being at that time devoted to
investigations in other directions, I was obliged to put on one side.
 Although the methods which I adopted in my experiments are essen
 tially different from those which Frankel has employed, yet the results,
so far as they can be compared with his, are on the whole concordant.

1889.]          Carbonic Anhydride, fyc, on Micro-organisms.                293
In my experiments        I  used the ordinary methods of plate-cultivation
(Esmarch's important modification having not yet been published),
the plate-cultivations of the various micro-organisms being then sub
mitted to an atmosphere of different gases in the following manner : —
A suitable attenuation of a particular micro-organism was employed,
and gelatine plates were poured in the usual way; the different plates,
resting one above the other on small glass stages, were placed in a flat
porcelain dish and covered over with a glass bell-jar. Mercury was
then poured into the dish, thus forming an effectual seal, and sterilised
water was poured on to the surface of the mercury. The weight of
the bell-jar causes it to sink to a certain depth into the mercury, so
that the damp-chamber is in reality cut off from the external air by
the mercury, and not by the sterilised water.             A piece of sterilised
india-rubber tubing        is  then  introduced   beneath  the mercury, and a
current of any particular gas can be passed into the chamber, the
excess of gas escaping at the edge of the bell-jar through the mercury
and water.
     After the air has been driven out of the chamber in this manner,
and replaced by any given gas, the tubing is removed, and the dish is
kept at the requisite temperature, which in my experiments was
about 20° C.
     The particular micro-organisms which          I used in these experiments
were      (1)   the  Bacillus    pyocyaneus,   (2) KocKs    Comma Spirillum,
 (3)    Finklers    Comma Spirillum, which were procured from the
 Hygienic     Institute in Berlin. The different organisms were obtained
 in a suitable degree of attenuation by mixing them with sterilised
 water, from which a definite quantity was taken and gelatine plates
 poured.
     In each experiment one plate was placed in a damp-chamber con
 taining ordinary air, whilst a second was exposed in a similar chamber
 filled  with the particular gas under examination.           After the lapse of
 an adequate period of time admitting of their development,                  the
 colonies were counted in both cases and the results compared.
                         I.   Experiments   with Hydrogen.
     The hydrogen was generated in a Kipp's apparatus by the action of
  dilute sulphuric acid on zinc ; it was purified by passing it through a
  saturated solution of caustic soda, and was then conveyed through a
  sterilised piece of india-rubber tubing and a sterile plug of cotton
  wool into the damp-chamber              containing the inoculated gelatine
  plates. The followimg results were obtained              in the use of this
  gas:—

   In this    case again the hydrogen-plates had the same characteristic
appearance, the colonies on the surface being surrounded by a com
plete circular zone which exceeded by many diameters the original
size of the colony.
   From these experiments         it is    seen    that the development             of the
Bacillus pyocyaneus is only slightly affected in an atmosphere of
hydrogen ; the colonies, however, grow more slowly and present a
distinctly different appearance.

    The colonies on the hydrogen-plates had the appearance of small
 milky dots, and caused in many cases a depression on the surface of
 the gelatine ; they resembled, in fact, very young colonies on an ordi

    From the above experiments, it is evident that carbonic oxide exerts
 a very powerful     influence    on the vitality        of B. pyocyaneus, for it
 effectually stops their development, but that this is only a temporary
 check to their growth is shown by the fact that on being removed to
 a damp-chamber containing air, almost the same number of colonies
 made their appearance as were found in the first instance on the air-
 exposed plates.    The results of the 2nd experiment suggest that in
this case there were possibly traces of air still remaining in the
 chamber.

                     Hydrogen, and Sulphurous               Anhydride.
   Similar experimentswere made with these gases.    Those plates
which were exposed to an atmosphere of nitric
                                              oxide, snlphuretted
hydrogen, or sulphurous anhydride developed no colonies,
                                                          neither
were any found on subsequently
                                placing the plates in air-chambers.
These three micro-organisms are, therefore,
                                            rapidly destroyed by the
action of these gases.
   In the experiments with nitric oxide, the air was
                                                      first driven out
of the damp-chamber with hydrogen in
                                       order to prevent the formation
of nitrous acid.
   The organisms behaved, however,
                                      differently in the presence of
nitrous oxide; in the chambers which were filled
                                                   with this gas, and
in which pyrogallic acid was also
                                    present, the Bacillus pyocyanews
developed no colonies, but afterwards on
                                            being placed in an air-
chamber, almost as many colonies were found
                                              as were present in the
original control air-plates.
   Under similar circumstances,  Koch's comma spirilla developed
in an atmosphere of nitrous oxide
                                    nearly one-third of the                            colonies

    In  the case of the   Finkler spirilla, about one-seventh of the total
number of colonies were developed, and on being transferred to the

   Nitrous oxide acts, therefore, upon these three       micro-organisms
 much in the same manner as carbonic oxide.
                                  Hemarks.
    From the above series of experiments, it is at once apparent that
 the four different gases act very differently towards micro-organisms.
 Of the four gases employed, hydrogen, carbonic oxide, nitrous oxide,
 and carbonic    anhydride, hydrogen had the least deleterious effect
 upon those microbes with which             I
                                           experimented,  whilst carbonic
 anhydride   had  the most  destructive influence.  There   is,
                                                             therefore, no
 longer any doubt, as indeed Laborious and C. Frankel have already
 pointed out, that in the anaerobic culture of micro-organisms hydrogen
is by far the most suitable medium for the expulsion of air, whilst
 carbonic anhydride, owing to its markedly deleterious effect npon
 many forms of bacteria,     isnot only ill suited, butis  in many cases
 quite unfit for such  a purpose.
   And although there   is  no doubt, as Buchner asserts, that all those
bacteria which give rise to fermentations attended with an abundant
evolution of carbonic anhydride, must also be capable of flourishing
in an atmosphere of this gas, yet      itby no means follows that these
organisms attain their full vitality in such an atmosphere.       On the
contrary, it   is very possible that their anaerobic and fermenting
powers only reach their maximum degree of activity when the gaseous
products to which they give rise are removed either by              really
                                                                      a
indifferent gas, such as hydrogen, or by a vacuum.
   The results of some experiments on the fermentative activity of
yeast by Boussingault   (-  Compt. Rend.,' vol. 91, p. 37) support this
view, for they show that in such        a vacuum alcoholic fermentation
takes place more actively, and    ismore quickly completed than at the
ordinary pressure of the atmosphere.
   As regards the particular behaviour of these three micro-organisms
towards carbonic anhydride, the results of my experiments agree
almost entirely with those of Frankel. In both series of experiments
it was found that the growth of B. pyocyaneus was entirely suspended
by the action of this gas, but that on subsequent exposure to air the
growth, attended with the formation of the characteristic pigment,
commenced.
   Again, in both series of experiments,    was observed that carbonic
                                                 it
anhydride completely     arrested the  growth both of Koch's comma
spirillum and Finkler's spirillum, but whilst C. Frankel always
succeeded on subsequent exposure to the air in obtaining       growth,
                                                                  a
although a very feeble one, in my experiments no such secondary-
growth was observed.
   This discrepancy may, however, very possibly arise from the differ
ence in the power of resintance which   often observed in the same

 which is brought out in the quantitative results of the experiments
 made by both of us, that there is a great variation in the power of
 resistance possessed by the individual organisms                in an ordinary
 cultivation, and that conditions which exert a rapidly destructive
 influence on the majority of the microbes, leave the more hardy
 individuals of the same culture unaffected.
    1 have already had occasion*         to notice a similar result in experi
 ments on the introduction of Koch's comma spirilla and B. pyocyaneus
 into drinking water ; in these experiments it was repeatedly observed
 that the greater proportion of the organisms which were inoculated
 into the water rapidly died off, whilst a small proportion survived
 much longer, and, in fact, subsequently exhibited multiplication.

    1.  The lumbo-vertebral index gives no information as to the
 diameter and degree of the lumbar curve of the vertebral column.
 If it did so, we might assume that in the native Australian the
 lumbar region of the spine was curved so as to present a concavity to
 the front.
    2. To estimate the extent and the degree of the different curves of
 the column it is necessary to examine fresh spines in which both the
 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks may be studied in conjunc
tion with each other.
    3. In the spine of the native Australian (described in the extended
paper) the secondary curves (i.e., the cervical and the lumbar curves)
are strongly accentuated, whilst the primary curves (i.e., dorsal and
sacral) are not so marked.             In these particulars the Australian
 spine resembles somewhat the spine of a Chimpanzee.
    4. The points of inflexion of the axial curvature of the vertebral
column, in the case of the cervico-dorsal transition and the dorso-
lumbar transition, are placed differently in the Australian from the
corresponding points in the European female and the Chimpanzee
   5. In the European the sacral curve is cut off in the most decided
manner from the lumbar curve : not so in the Australian.                      In the
latter the first sacral vertebra jast escapes being included in the
lumbar curve, and the importance of this is centred in the fact that

302     The Spinal Curvature in an Aboriginal Australian.            [Jan.  24.
in the Chimpanzee       the lumbar curve      passes  continuously into the
sacral region, and involves one, or perhaps two, of its vertebrae.
    In connexion with this question, it is interesting to note the close
association which the last lumbar vertebra in the Chimpanzee
exhibits with the sacrum.      The intervening disk of cartilage is very
thin, and quite different from those above it. Further, it is extremely
common to find the last lumbar vertebra of the Chimpanzee                  pre
senting   sacral characters  and joined   by  osseous  union   to the  sacrum.
In the Australian and European the last lumbar and first sacral
vertebrae are well separated from each other by a thick pad of inter
vertebral substance, but there is reason to believe that the last
lumbar vertebra of the Australian more frequently exhibits sacral
characters than the corresponding vertebra of the European.
    6. A single glance at the tracing obtained from the mesial section
of the Australian spine will be sufficient to dissipate any doubt that
may be remaining regarding the presence of a lumbar convexity in
the vertebral column of this race.         Not only does it exist, but it
exists in a very pronounced form. The degree of curvature in the
lumbar region of the Australian, while it falls slightly short of that
which is seen in the Chimpanzee, corresponds               closely with the
degree of curvature in the European female.            At the same time we
must not lose sight of the fact that the lumbar curve does not
consolidate until adult life, and the Australian spine was taken from
a girl who had only reached the age of sixteen.             It is more than
probable, therefore, that the spine in question does not express the
full amount of curvature of the lumbar region in this race.
    7. In the Australian, the curvature in the lumbar region is entirely
due to the strongly wedge-shaped form of the intervertebral disks. If
 we form an index for these, as has been done for the vertebral bodies,
 the amount which they contribute to the curve can be appreciated.
 The following are the indices obtained for the Australian spine, and
 also the average indices of the spines of four Europeans : —
                                  Lumbo-vertebral     Lumbo-intervertebral
                                       index.                 index.

    8. In the extended paper the character of the lumbar axial curve is
 discussed,   and it is shown to differ materially from that of the
 European.     In both it is composed of the arcs of three circles. The
 parts entering into these, and the lengths of their respective radii
 differ in the two cases markedly. In the Australian the lower part of
 the curve is abrupt and sudden    ; in the European it is more uniform
 throughout.
    9. A sagitto-vertical index of the lumbar vertebrae suggests some

interesting points.      In calculating this, the sagittal diameter of the
different vertebral bodies is taken as the standard and compared with
the axial vertical diameter.      This index is observed to present a direct
relation to the proportion of bone and cartilage which enters into the
construction of the lumbar column.                The higher the index the
smaller is the amount of intervertebral substance, and vice versd.
This has been tested in the European, Australian, Chimpanzee,
Baboon, Macaque, and Orang. The European excels all these in the
amount of cartilage as compared with bone in the lumbar region of
the vertebral column.        In the erect attitude of man this greater
amount of cartilage lessens the shocks transmitted upwards through
the column.      In the prone or semi-prone position of the trunk the
same provision is not so necessary.*

L " On hoetes lacustris, Linn." By J. Bbetland Fabmeb, B.A..
      F.L.S.     Communicated by Professor S. H. Vines, F.R.S.
       Received January 22, 1889.
   The genus Isoetes has been an object of interest to botanists ever
since Hofmeister's brilliant researches on the vascular cryptogams,
but the accounts given by the different observers on the development
and organogeny of the sporophyte are so conflicting, and moreover
our knowledge of the sexual generation is so limited, that a renewed
investigation of the whole subject seems desirable.          In the present
communication I propose to summarise, as briefly as possible, the
more important of my own observations on one species, I. lacustris.
to which plant my attention has been directed for some time past.           I
intend to deal here only with the germination of the macrospore, and
to reserve details of minor significance, as well as all account of the
sporophyte, for treatment in a future paper, as this part of the subject
requires critical discussion.
   The shape of each macrospore is, as is well known, that of a tetra
hedron with somewhat rounded sides, and the protoplasmic contents
are enclosed in a number of coats which, in mature specimens, are
differentiated into six layers.    Peripherally is the episporium, a colour
less, glassy, and brittle layer, whose surface is beset with numerous
irregular prominences.      The episporium, which is derived from the
epiplasm of the sporangium, stains with hcematoxylin, though only to
a slight extent.   Within this outer layer is the exosporium, consisting
of three brown cuticularised layers, but of which the two outer ones
are frequently not easily distinguishable as separate coats.        The two
innermost membranes of all, are cellulose in character, and form the
endosporium.
   The protoplasm which is contained in the spore includes a large
quantity of reserve material, consisting of starch and oil, the latter
being, however, eliminated during the process of soaking in turpen
tine, to which the spores are subjected previously to their bein?

   embedded in paraffin.   A number of sections through each spore were
   obtained by means of the Cambridge rocking microtome, and were
  arranged in series, thus permitting of an examination of the internal
  structure of the spores. The protoplasm, which is remarkably granu
  lar, is of a spongy texture (probably due to the extraction of the oil),
  and contains a nucleus of very large size, in which bodies resembling
  nucleoli were in some cases detected.    The nucleus is sharply marked
  off from the cytoplasm by a membrane, but of course it must be borne
  in mind that this feature may be caused in part by the methods used
  in embedding.     When spores are examined in this stage, the proto
  plasm stains but slightly with hematoxylin, and the tint is inclined
 to red, and even the nucleus is not deeply coloured.       In somewhat
 older spores, at the period immediately preceding germination, the
 whole protoplasm stains far more readily and deeply in a given time,
 but a nucleus is no longer differentiated by the haematoxylin, and the
 colour now produced is of a deep blue. As         I have frequently had
 spores of different ages on the same slide, all of which were subjected
 to exactly similar treatment, this difference in colour may probably be
 taken to indicate an actual diffusion of the substance of the nucleus
 through the cytoplasm, since the change is always confined to spores
 in the condition referred to.
     This view receives some confirmation from the circumstances attend
 ing the formation of the prothallium, now to be described.       The first
 indication of cell-division occurs in a somewhat peculiar manner, but
 its significance is rendered clear by what takes place subsequently.
 Before entering upon a description of what actually happens, it may
 be well, in order to avoid possible misconstruction, to state expressly
 the opinion that the characters presented are made visible only by
 the action of the means necessarily employed in embedding, but this
 does not vitiate the conclusion that they may be taken as indications
of internal changes which actually occur in the protoplasm.      In spores
in which cell formation is about to commence, the deeply stnined
protoplasm is seen to be traversed by a few " cracks," which divide
the contents of the spore into large isolated masses. At this period
there is nothing to point to the existence of a membrane, except
the granular structure which is apparent on the surface of the
cracks, but at a subsequent stage in the development, one of the sur
faces is seen to be bounded by a membrane of extreme tenuity. When
first formed it can only be distinguished in favourable places, but it
rapidly grows in thickness, and forms a limiting surface between the
two protoplasmic masses. From the mode of its formation it can
hardly arise otherwise than by the conversion of a layer already
present in the protoplasm directly into cellulose, and it appears to be
the presence of this substance arranged in a definite plate-like manner
which determines the splitting referred to. The first membrane cuts

the spore into an apical and a basal portion, and while the latter
for some time undergoes no further change, the apical cell is divided
very rapidly into a number of cells, whose arrangement can still be
followed even in quite old prothallia.      When the first primary cells
are formed,    the nuclei are again distinguishable on staining       with
heematoxylin, but they are of exceedingly small dimensions, and       with
this change the staining capacity of the protoplasm becomes            less
marked.    Divisions in all planes proceed very rapidly in the upper
(apical) portion of the prothallium, and the rudiments of the arche-
gonia are laid down much as in the Marattiaceae.       Periclinal division
of single superficial cells into two takes place, the upper of which
gives rise to the neck, and by repeated division forms four stories, each
story beiug again divided crosswise into four cells arranged as quad
rants of a cylinder. The lower cells form the central series, in which
a neck canal cell is cut off, and then a ventral canal cell, from the
oosphere.    The canal cells then thrust themselves between the neck
cells, and cause a distortion in the two lower stories, which may be so
great as even to render them difficult of recognition.
   Whilst these changes have been taking place in the upper (apical)
of the two primary cells, the lower
                                       (basal) one is dividing, but com
paratively slowly, and it is easily distinguishable in that the cells
arising from it remain of a large size as compared with those formed
in the npper part of the prothallium. In spite of repeated search
through a great number of preparations, it has not been found possible
hitherto to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to the mode of cell-
division which prevails in the secondary stage, for no karyokinetic
figures could be detected ; nevertheless, it is highly probable that the
process does not differ in any important respect from that exhibited
by other plants, and the arrangement of the nuclei about the walls of
recently formed cells makes this supposition almost a certainty.
   I  have purposely omitted any reference to the researches of other
observers in the present paper, and it was not my object to attempt a
complete account of my own work, which is still in progress, bnt the
results detailed above appeared of sufficient interest to justify the
appearance of this note.

II. "On        Auto-infection in Cardiac Disease."                By L. C. Wool-
        DRIDGE, M.D., D.Sc., Assistant Physician to Guy's Hospital.
        Communicated by Professor Victob HoRSLEY, B.S., F.R.S.
        (from the Laboratory of the Brown Institution). Received
        January     24, 1889.
   In    1886   I described   to the Royal Society* a substance, one of the
most      noticeable   features of which was that it caused intravascular
clotting when injected into the circulation of a*n animal. In subse
quent publications I have further described the action of this
substance, or rather group of allied substances, and speak of them as
fibrinogens.
   In particular,      I  pointed out in my papers in du Bois-Reymond's
'
  Archiv,' 1886, and in Ludwig's ' Festschrift,' 1887, that the lymph
and chyle contained this substance.              More exactly I had found that
the fluid of lymphatic glands, freed from all form elements, pos
sessed precisely the same action as the fibrinogens,                  and that the
fibrinogen was the active substance in this fluid. The lymph con
tained in serous cavities does not contain this body, hence it ia
probably formed in the lymphatic glands.                  Dr. Kriiger.f assistant to
Professor Alexander Schmidt of Dorpat, has disputed the correctness
of these observations.                I
                                But am absolutely certain, from a repetition
of my experiments, an account of which I have published elsewhere,!
that Dr. Kriiger is in error, and that my original observations were
correct.
    In the present paper I endeavour to show the light which further
experiments        have thrown on this question, and to point out the
probably great importance which fibrinogen intoxication plays in a
jarge and important class of disease, particularly cardiac disease.
    For the purpose of my experiments I have used mainly the thymus
 gland, as the fluid and the fibrinogen of the thymus is quite similar to
 that of lymphatic glands, and is more easily obtained.
                                      Experiment     1.

 times diluted with alkaline salt solution.        The injection was slow,
 taking from three to four minutes.      The dog was killed.      There was
absolutely no trace of clotting in any vessel.
    As regards diet the animals were in similar conditions.
                               Experiment    2.
    Used the watery extract of thymus, precipitated with acetic acid,
and the solution of this precipitate in alkaline half per cent. NaCl
injected.
    Dog I.— Weight of dog, 14 lbs. Injected rapidly 7 c.c. of solution.
The animal ceased to breathe instantly and never breathed again.
The heart continued to beat for several minutes.         The right heart, the
whole of the pulmonary artery and veins, and the left heart one solid
clot.
    Dog   II. — Weight  of dog, 13£ lbs.      7 c.c.  of the same solution
injected, but diluted ten times with alkaline salt solution; the injec
tion slow, occupying three to four minutes.        Dog killed. Absolutely
no trace of clotting anywhere.
    It is seen from the above experiments         that a substance added
rapidly to the circulating blood produces a pronounced effect ; added
comparatively slowly and diluted, but in the same quantity propor
tionate to the weight of the animal, it produces no effect at all.
    The obvious effect may be local, i.e., occur where the sudden
admixture of fluids takes place, i.e., in the heart ; or it may be remote
and take place in the portal vein.
    The phenomenon appears to resemble somewhat the so-called
" mass influence " m
                    ( assenwirkv ng ) of chemists.
    A sudden admixture of a sufficient quantity of this substance with a
given quantity of blood poisons the blood ; the same conditions would
be produced if instead of the injection
                                            being sudden the blood were
circulating more slowly. In this case, also, a given quantity of tbe
blood would in a given time receive a larger
                                                      quantity of the fluid
than if the blood were rapidly circulating.          For the present 1 am
speaking of the blood being affected by its showing an obvious
change, that is clotting; and I know, from previous experiments, that
to produce this change a certain quantity of the
                                                        fibrinogen must be
added to the blood, i.e., the larger the dop, and
                                                     consequently the more
blood, the more of fibrinogen must be
                                          injected.
   The present experiments show that to affect the blood a certain
quantity of the substance must reach the blood within a <riven time,
and this effect may obviously be
                                    obtained either by rapid injection or
by the current of blood being slow in the
                                               neighbourhood of the vessel

used     for injection.       I  am therefore inclined to explaiu the fact that
the lymph does not normally poison the blood because it runs into the
blood slowly whilst the blood circulates rapidly.                In a normal state,
therefore, the conditions which must exist for a fibrinogen intoxica-
 -ion do not prevail.
     I  have above used the terra        " poison the blood "  ;  it will  be advan
tageous for me to explain this expression.
     The admixture of fibrinogen and blood may obviously affect the
 latter, by causing it to clot or by preventing its clotting (vide previous
papers),* but it produces other changes than these which are not so
directly perceptible.          The nature of these changes will be seen from
the    following     : — If in   a normal dog the femoral vein be ligatured
there is no obvious effect produced, i.e., there is no oedema of the leg.
If, however, some solution of fibrinogen be injected into the circula
tion through         the jugular vein and the femoral be then ligatured, the
effect produced is most pronounced,               and is as follows : either the
most extensive and rapidly developing simple oedema of the leg occurs
or an enormous          haemorrhage "per diapedesin" takes place throughout
the tissues of the       limb ; or the two are combined — there is haemorrhage
and oedema.
    The injection of fibrinogen,! then, in addition to the obvious effects
of clotting or delay in clotting, produces a totally disturbed relation
ship between the blood and the vascular wall, since, after the injection,
a slight mechanical           disturbance to the circulation causes a greatly
increased exndation of the fluid of the blood, or this associated with a
free passage of the red corpuscles.              The tendency the injection has
to cause haemorrhage I have already pointed out in a previous publi
cation, + the fact that it produces a simple but severe and sudden
oedema is new.              Now, to produce this altered state of the blood,
leading to oedema, the same conditions of admixture of blood and
fibrinogen are necessary, i.e., the admixture must be rapid.                   I will
illustrate this by an experiment.

Leg absolutely free from the slightest trace of oedema or haemorrhage.
   So far as my observations go, the tendency to cedema is the first
symptom of fibrinogen intoxication, i.e., it is more easily produced
than any other.
   One of the most important features in these observations lies in
their relationship to many important diseases.            I  have pointed ont
the conditions which must prevail to produce a fibrinogen intoxica
tion.   It is improbable that diseased conditions are often set np by a
sudden large flow of lymph into the blood ; but it is certain that the
other conditions, the slowing of the circulation in the neighbourhood
of the thoracic duct, is a common incident, particularly I may mention
valvular disease of the heart and obstruction to the circulation
through the lungs, as conditions which necessarily produce this result.
It is a dogma of medicine that cardiac dropsy as a symptom of cardiac
failure, is due to the mechanical obstruction of the circulation.            My
observations lead me to the conclusion that the danger in cardiac
disease is fibrinogen intoxication ; and that the symptoms of cardiac
disease — e.g., dropsy, formation of intravascular clots, heemorrhagic
infarction, fever, &c. — are largely dependent on this condition.

        1889.
    The acknowledged meteoritic constitution of the rings of Saturn
rendered     it important to obtain a photograph of their spectrnrn, in
order that it might be determined whether collisions there were of
 sufficient intensity to produce incandescent vapours.         It has long
 been known that the rings appear much more luminous than the
 planet, and the magnificent photographs obtained by the Brothers
 Henry show that this is truer for the blue light than for the visual
rays.
    The weather     has been so bad that only one long exposure photo
 graph has been taken.      Although the instrument was not in perfect
    vol. xlv.                                                            .

adjustment, owing to     a recent  accident,   I submit it to the Society
because there appears to be evidence of bright lines in the photograph.
It is altogether too early to announce this as an established fact,
     I
but think it well to send in this note, in order that other observers
with more powerful optical appliances and a better climate than that
of London may investigate the question.
   The photograph exhibited was taken on the 2nd instant by
Mr. Porter, Compnter to the Solar Physics Committee.           The instru
ment employed was the 10-inch equatorial of the Science Schools,
and a spectroscope of two prisms of 60°.
   Other considerations point to the possibility that bright lines or
bands may be found in the spectrum of Uranus.

 I. " Magnetisation of Iron at High Temperatures." (Preliminary
        Notice.) By J. HOPKINSON, F.R.S.                Received January 30,
        1889.
     I  have recently been making some determinations of the curves
  of magnetisation       of iron at varying temperatures up to that at
  which the iron ceases to be magnetic. Although the experiments are
  still progressing, some of the results are of sufficient interest to be
  worth publishing briefly at once.
     The method of experiment was identical with that which                I  used
  for a sample of nickel about        a year ago.   The    temperatures   are esti
  mated by the resistance of a copper secondary coil, and as there may
  be some uncertainty as to what temperatures the several resistances
  correspond with,      I   give in the curves which follow the resistance
   observed as well as the temperature estimated.

   Curve I shows the relation of induction to magnetising force at
the ordinary temperature,      the resistance     of the secondary coil
being 0'692 ohm. The curve is given to two scales, the scale of
induction being the same in each, whilst the scale of magnetising
force is magnified twenty-fold in the one as compared with the other.
   Curve  II shows the same relation for a temperature of 697° C. to
700° C.
   Curve  III  shows the same thing for a temperature    between 727° C.
and 720° C.

  These curves illustrate what has been long known, that rise of tem
perature causes increase of induction if the magnetising force                           i.-
small, but diminution of induction        if    the force    is   great.

remarkable feature.     For this force the permeability increases some
what steadily to   atemperature of about 640° C., its rate of increase
then rapidly accelerates, till     itattains a maximum of 11,000 at                      a

unity, or the magnetisability of the material has entirely disappeared.
   Regarding the iron as made up of magnetic molecules the axes of
which are directed to parallelism by magnetic forces, the results are
expressed by saying that the magnetic          moment of the molecule
diminishes with rise of temperature, at first slowly, but very rapidly
as the point  is  approached at which magnetism disappears on the                 ;
other hand, the facility with which the particles are directed con
tinually increases, at first slowly, but at high temperatures very
rapidly. The effect    isthat at a temperature of 720° C. an exceedingly
small force is competent to turn the axes of nearly all the molecules
in direction parallel to the magnetising force.

  1889.]     On Salts   of  a Base containing Chromium and Urea.        321
     [If an iron ring which, has never been magnetised has its carve of
  magnetisation determined for an ascending series of forces, if it bo
  then thoronghly demagnetised by a succession of reversed currents of
  descending intensity, and the curve of magnetisation is redetermined,
  I  find that the two curves       differ materially. The demagnetising
  currents do not reduce the iron to its virgin state.     For small forces
  the second curve is below the first, indicating less induction for the
 same magnetising force ; for medium forces the second curve is above
  the first, whilst for large forces the two curves agree.
     If a ring be heated with a current through the primary coil and the
 heating be continued till the ring has ceased to be magnetic, if then
 the current be stopped and the ring be allowed to cool, I find that
 the ring is not entirely demagnetised by the heating, but that it
 recollects its state of magnetisation before heating.      It would seem
 that the magnetic molecules of the iron, having been directed by the
 magnetising force whilst they were magnetic, retain in part their
 direction when they have ceased to be magnetic by heating, and that
 when they again become magnetic by cooling its effect is apparent. —

  II. " On    a Series   of Salts of a Base containing Chromium and
        Urea.— No. 2."        By W. J. Sell, M.A., F.I.C.            With
        Crystallographic Determinations by Professor W. J. LEWIS,
        Cambridge.       Communicated      by Professor G. D. Liveing,
        F.R.S.    Received February 1, 1889.
    In a former paper (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 33, 1882) a number of
salts were described derived from a base formed by a combination of
chromium with urea. It was stated that the chief product of the
regulated action of chromyl dichloride on dry urea, and subsequent
treatment with water, is a green crystalline powder, insoluble in
alcohol, ether, or chloroform. The compound thus obtained contains
chlorine as an essential component, while, as noted, the product of
crystallisation from hot water is the pure dichromate of the base. At
the date of the previous publication the nature of this green salt, as a
preliminary to the study of the reaction by which it is produced, was
under investigation. The present paper deals with these subjects,
and describes a number of additional salts of the base.
    The failure in the attempt to purify the green salt by crystallisa
tion from water, added to its insolubility in all other available neutral

S22               Mr. W.    J. Sell and Prof. W.    J.  Lewis.     [Feb. 14,
menstrua,     rendered   it advisable to make some preliminary analytical
determinations on the different samples of crnde well-washed sub
stance.    From the results obtained it was evident that the salt was
either a chlorochromate of chromium urea, or a compound of the
dichromate and chloride, a conclusion which at once harmonises with
its genesis, and suggests the trial of dilute hydrochloric acid as a
possible vehicle for its purification by crystallisation.
                                                              The purification
                                                                             to
by dilute hydrochloric acid containing one volume of strong acid
nine of water, was successful, the numbers obtained         on  analysis beiDg
substantially the same as       those  obtained from   the crude  well-washed
product of the reaction. The analytical results were satisfied by
either of the formulae —
                    (1.)   {(CON2HY2Ci^c|307)22H20,
                    (2.)   {(C0NtH*)"Crt}|gg;ci2Ht0.
    The latter, however, is regarded as very improbable.
    It is difficult to believe that a chlorochromate in fine powder can
 withstand the action of water for weeks without appreciable change.
 The fact also that the hydrochloric acid used in its recrystallisation
 may be replaced by metallic chlorides, such as those of sodium or
 potassium, is against the second formula.         Moreover, the decomposi
 tion effected when the salt is recry stall ised from water, may be cited.
 A   chlorochromate having the formula given in (2) should normally
 decompose, according to the equation —
   {(CON3H*)«Crs}2CrO*ci +
                                    H80 = 2HCl+{(C0N3H*)"Crt}            gg\
  whereas the decomposition effected by water is of a totally different
  character, and may be represented thus : —
  3{(CON2H*)i2CrS}(g307)3
                                   = 2{(CON2H*)i2Cr3}(Cr207)s
                                                      + {(CONW)12Cr3}Cl6.
     These   facts may be regarded as conclusive that formula (1) is the
  more correct representation of this compound, which may be called
                                                                            —

    188^.]    On Salts   of a Base containing Chromium and Urea.        325
     The question naturally arises, "Is the compound last considered
  the  initial chief product of the reaction of chromyl dichloride on urea,
  or is it produced from this compound by interaction with the water
  added subsequently ? As at the present time difficulties, which seem
  insurmountable (see below), attend the direct determination of this
  question, and as, moreover, it was suspected that the salt above
  described is the product of the action of water on the chlorochromate
  of the base, it was determined before proceeding further to attempt
  the isolation of such compounds.         With this object in view an in
  vestigation was made of the action of aqueous hydrochloric acid on
  the compound last considered.        As mentioned above, the dichlordi-
  chromate crystallises out unaltered from a hot solution containing one
  volume of strong acid to nine of water.      If, however, the quantity of
  acid to water be increased to one in six, a salt crystallises out as the
 solution cools in brownish-yellow crusts of small crystals.       When a
 much stronger acid than one in six is used, the product is a mixture
 of the brown-yellow salt and green needles of the chloride. The
 examination of this brown-yellow compound showed it to be the
 dichlortetrachlorochromate of the base having the composition —
                         {(CON2H*)12Cr2}^2r°2C13H20,
 formed from the dichlordichromate by the following change : —
 {(CONsH*)}«Cr»p5'S°7 + 4HCl = {(CON^H^Cr^}^1'0301-)-^^.
    The colour of     the new salt presents a striking contrast to that of
the preceding compound.          With the exception of the acid of the
strength from which it has been crystallised, it is either insoluble
in, or decomposed by, all the usual solvents.                With alcohol
the chloride of the base is formed, and the usual products of the
action of chromic acid on that reagent. Water effects immediate
decomposition,      the colour changing to the characteristic dark green of

free, thus : —

   Itis extremely probable that this salt is the chief initial product of
the reaction between chromyl dichloride and urea, and that the subse
quent   addition of water decomposes                          it,
                                            as shown by the preceding
equation.     Granting that     chlorochromate

reaction takes place in presence of excess of chromyl dichloride,                                    it   is
difficult to resist this conclusion), the only salt of this character
which would normally decompose by water with production of the
dichlordichromate,     the compound under consideration.

   The direct decision of such an apparently simple matter aa the
composition of the chief initial product of the reaction has, up to the
present time, been found to be impossible.     No reagent or mixture of
reagents  has been    discovered  which  at once dissolves any excess of
materials used and the other products of the reaction, without pro
ducing some change in the composition of the chief product.
   A careful examination of the reaction between chromyl dichloride
and urea was made by taking known weights of the materials, col
lecting and measuring the gaseous products, and after the addition
of water to the residue, estimating the dichlordichromate produced,
as well as the other products which pass into solution.     The dichlor
dichromate was then calculated           as dichlortetrachlorochromate.
Without going into a mass of detail, it may be stated that the results
of the examination gave numbers very nearly agreeing with the
equation —
13CO(NH2)2 + 9Cr02Cl2 = {(CONSH^^Craj^^^+CrSCl6
                                       + H2CrO* + H20 + CO2 +  W + 3C12.
   With regard to the preparation of these substances, it may    be well
to note that the reaction of chromyl dichloride on urea succeeds best
in narrow test-tubes, working with about 3 grams of urea. On a
larger scale the reaction becomes very difficult to control, and decom
position more or less complete is very liable to ensue. On the other
band, unless the reaction is fairly vigorous and the temperature
allowed to rise, little or none of the compound is produced.
   A considerable amount of time has been taken up in attempts to
prepare this class of compounds by some modification of the above
process which should present less complexity, and thus offer soms
hope of arriving at their constitution. Passing over the unsuccessful
attempts, it was discovered that the dichromate of the base may be
obtained by the action of chromic acid on urea. In the month of
September of last year three separate portions of nearly equal
weights of urea and chromic anhydride were dissolved in a small
quantity of cold water, the solutions covered with filter-paper, and
allowed to stand at the ordinary temperature.
    On examination in March the solutions had changed colour, become
quite thick from evaporation, and on addition of water a small quan
tity of sparingly soluble green crystals were found to be left. These,
 when separated and recrystallised from hot water, had all the cha
racters of the dichromate of the base, and gave on ignition 41-32 per
cent. of Cr203, against 41 "43 as required by theory for the dichro
 mate.   It was subsequently found that the dichromate may be formed
 in some quantity by evaporating the aqueous solutions of the mixed

 under investigation.
    In addition to the foregoing, the following        new compounds    have
 been examined : —
                                  The Chromite.
    This compound separates from a warm saturated solution of the
 dichromate, cautiously neutralised with ammonium carbonate, in long
 dark-green needles.       The crystals are very efflorescent, and rapidly
 become opaque from loss of water.            They are sparingly soluble in
 cold, more readily in hot water, undergoing at the same time slight
 decomposition, with separation of brown flocks of chromic chromate.
 The salt is insoluble in alcohol, ether, carbon disulphide, and benzene,
 and has the composition       (CON2H*)12Cr23CrO*4H20.
    The following results were obtained on analysis.           The salt was

     The addition of an aqueous solution of picric acid to a solution of
 any of the salts of the base produces an immediate separation of the
 picrate in the form of beautiful green-yellow needles. The salt dissolves
 readily in alcohol, sparingly in benzene and water, and is practically
 insoluble in chloroform. The compound recrystallised from water

    This substance crystallises in the rhombic system, and has a well-
 marked hemihedrism with inclined faces.           The crystals consist of
 well-developed prisms with a large deeply striated brachypinakoid,
 terminated sometimes by six planes, sometimes by four equally
 developed planes, and sometimes by two prominent planes of * (111),
-with other minor planes. The form (210) is also present, but the
planes of this form are dull and deeply striated.         The prism planes
are also sometimes considerably striated, but the striations on m and
mj on the same crystal or on the parallel faces do not as a rule cor
respond.      The development . of the crystals is to a certain extent
shown by the accompanying diagrams, figs. 1 and 2, which repre
sent some of the crystals measured by me. The prism in fig. 2 is
placed horizontally for showing the hemi-pyramids more distinctly.

forming the preceding compound. This substance, which has the

  The crystals are dark-green in colour, and have bright and for the
most part well-developed faces.   They seem to have no good cleavage.
They crystallise  in  the anorthic  system, and the zones [m], [ctdZ]

The planes m, n, and c, though, as a rule, much more largely
developed than any others, were somewhat imperfect and often gave
several images.         Hence it has been necessary to combine all the
observations in order to obtain satisfactory elements.                     The following
elements were ultimately selected, as those which agreed best with the

                                          The Periodide.
   When a warm solution of iodine in potassium iodide is added to
a warm and moderately concentrated solution of the normal iodide, a
considerable crop of crystals separates out on cooling in transparent
brown-red micaceous scales. If, however, the solutions are heated to
 near the boiling point before mixing, or are more dilute, especially if
the quantity of iodine added is small, the crystals deposited are in the
form of long opaque black needles, having a well-marked green
reflection, which        is,
                         to    certain extent, lost on drying. Not unfre-
                                 a
quently, however, both forms are deposited from the same solution.
The apparent dissimilarity of form and general appearance led to the
analysis of the two modifications being conducted separately.            The
numbers obtained, however, are           identical, and lead  to the formula
(CON2H4)12Cr2I66I2,        being assigned to this remarkable substance.
The difference in appearance of the two forms                possibly due to
                                                                   is
certain of the faces in one being differently developed to those in the
other. Both yield apparently identical crystals when deposited by
spontaneous evaporation from alcoholic solutions, or from the nearly
boiling solution in aqueous potassium iodide.
   The substance dissolves freely in alcohol, very sparingly in benzene,
and      scarcely affected by chloroform, only just sufficient being dis
         is
solved to communicate         violet colour.

   This salt is precipitated in silky yellowish-brown needles when a
solution of iodine in potassium iodide is added to a solution of the
sulphate or any other salt of the base containing sulphuric acid.                 It
is practically insoluble in cold water, dissolving, however, to a small
extent     in hot water from which it crystallises on cooling in brown
needles.       The solvent action of water is not materially affected by the
presence      of   potassium iodide, and it is insoluble in the usual neutral
menstrua.          On boiling with water the compound is decomposed,
 iodine   to   the  extent of about two-thirds of the total amount present
escaping with the steam.              The composition     of this remarkable salt
would appear         to be  (CO.N2Ht)i2Cr2(SOj)3I21      4.

      When in the preparation of the preceding compound the qnantity
  of the base has been considerably diminished by precipitation, the
   further addition of iodine no longer produces a yellowish but a well-
   marked brown precipitate consisting also of fine needles.              The brown
   colour is not due to admixed periodide, as it is perfectly unaffected by
  alcohol or aqueous solution of potassium iodide, moreover it was
  formed in the presence of a considerable excess of ammonium sesqui-
  carbonate.
      The crystals are insoluble in all neutral menstrua, and decomposed
  by hydrochloric acid with effervescence and separation of free iodine.
      The analyses are rather unsatisfactory, but point to the formula
  (CONS!H'')12Cr2(COs)2I6.
     From the nature of the case           it is well nigh impossible    to see when
 the precipitation of one compound ends and the other begins, and
 there is no doubt that the sample analysed contained some of the
 preceding compound.              A better result wonld probably have been
 obtained by adding the dilute solution of the normal iodide to the
 solution of iodine and ammonium sesquicarbonate, so as to maintain
 an excess of iodine.

yellow plates is produced. This beautiful compound is sparingly soluble
in cold, more readily in hot water, especially in presence of alkaline
bromides, and crystallises out in large prismatic aggregations ;
alcohol especially when warm takes up the substance, freely decom
posing it and depositing the normal bromide, a similar result being
obtained with ether and carbon disulphide, in which, however, it is
much less soluble.      The crystals rapidly lose bromine on exposure to
the air, yielding bright-green pseudomorphs of the normal bromide.
A specimen of the compound in the form of micaceous scales exposed
for three days over lime gave 36-5 per cent. of bromine, against 36-78
required for the normal salt.
   Analysis leads to the conclusion that this substance has a similar
composition to that of the periodide, viz., (CON3H*)12Cr2Br66Br2.

   The well-marked crystallisations presented by the substances here
described, prove them to be definite compounds.                 Their empiric
formulae, as derived from analysis, are as to complication such as
chemists have been wont to expect only in organic substances ; and
the rational formulae provisionally assigned to them would hardh
have suggested themselves without the clues afforded by the materials
and processes employed in their formation. The examination of the
decompositions     which they undergo under varied conditions, is a
problem little more than touched upon, and the same may be said of
 the action of chromyl dichloride on substituted ureas, including

relation which the chromium bears to the rest of the elements in these
complicated  compounds.

   The crystals are of a dark-green colour, and are only translucent in
moderately thin plates.      They belong to the oblique system, and have
a very perfect and facile cleavage, perpendicular to the plane of
symmetry. This cleavage plane, though absent, or at any rate very
infrequent, as a natural plane, has been selected as the base. The
planes o(491) are much striated, parallel to their intersection with
one another, and give very bad reflections.               The general habit
of the crystals simulates that of a crystal of the rhombohedral
system with two rhombohedral forms.              The faces p(212) give the
best reflections ; the faces g(212) are not well developed, and the
reflections are indifferent.       The accompanying diagrams show the

III.   " Effect of Floor-Deafening on the Sanitary Condition of
       Dwelling Houses."       By Miss Etta Johnstone, University
       College, Dundee, and Thos. Cabnelley, Professor of
       Chemistry in the University of Aberdeen. Communicated
       by Sir fl. ROSCOE, F.R.S. Received February 7. 1889.
    " Deafening " is the material which is laid upon boards fitted in
between the joists of a floor to prevent the passage of sound into the
room below.      This material is used largely on the Continent and in
many parts of this country, especially in Scotland, and is supposed
to consist of a mixture of coarse mortar and smith's ashes, but
in general it appears to be of a much more questionable nature,
particularly in the case of low-class houses. It is also supposed by
some builders to prevent the passage of smell; but houses are known
to have been rendered uninhabitable by its presence, the cinders,
 which form the great bulk of tho substance, being more or less
contaminated according to the place whence obtained and other
attendant circumstances.
    With the object therefore of ascertaining whether this material was
a serious factor in the pollution and vitiation of the air of dwelling-
houses, we undertook the analysis of a number of samples from
 various classes of houses in Dundee, and the results obtained are
 recorded   in the present paper.
    Carnelley, Haldane, and      Anderson  (' Phil. Trans.,' B., vol.   178
 (1887), pp. 61-111) have proved that the number of micro-organisms
 habitually present in the air of a dwelling-house increases with the
 age of a building.      Indeed, some of the older buildings become
 perfectly infested with them, as shown not only by the results
 obtained by the above observers in houses and schools in Dundee, but
 also by those of Miguel in old and new houses in Paris.      Indeed, this
 floor-deafening when impure would appear to be a remarkably good
 medium for the propagation of bacteria, other conditions being
 favourable.
     Dr. Emmerich, of Leipzig, some years ago (' Zeitschr. f.-Biol.,' 1882)
 made experiments on the effects of this stuff with regard to the air of
 rooms, and also analysed numerous samples of pure material, some of
 which were obtained from new buildings on completion, and some
 from inhabited houses. He found that on washing the floors of
 rooms, shutting them up for some time, and then examining the air,
 there was a great increase of carbonic acid, which must have been
 dne to the putrefaction set up by the moisture on reaching the
 deafening, as all other known sources of carbonic acid were excluded.
     As a result of his investigations, he concluded that " there exists

  1889.]     Effect of Floor-deafening in Dwelling     Houses.        347
  nowhere in nature, not even in the neighbourhood of human dwellings,
  a (natural) soil so highly contaminated     with nitrogenous organic
 substances and their decomposition products as the deafening material
 under the floor of dwelling-rooms."
    As some of Emmerich's results appear to have been called in
 question, and for the purpose of ascertaining whether a similar state
 of matters exists in houses in this country, we obtained samples of
 deafening from dwellings in different parts of Dundee, through the
 kindness of Mr. Kinnear, of the Sanitary Department.           Some of
 these were taken from ordinary middle-class houses, others from one-,
 two-, and three-roomed houses of the poorer class, while two were
 obtained from houses (in Fish Street, Dundee) about 200 years old,
 and occupied by the poorest class of artisans.      The deafening from
the lower class of houses, and especially that from the oldest houses,
 had a most disgusting and filthy smell.     All the houses examined,
even those of the better class, had been built and occupied more than
twelve years. For analysis the material was passed through a wire
sieve of ^-inch mesh, and the percentage of fine dust and coarse
lumps noted. The fine dust was bottled, and the following sub
stances determined therein by the usual methods : — (1.) Moisture.
(2.) Total combustible matter (exclusive of moisture).     (3.) Chlorine.
(4.) Nitrogen.
    The results are given in the following table : —

350       Miss  E. Johnstone and Prof. Thos. Carnelley.         [Feb. 14,
   The above results show     : —
   (1.) That the quality of the deafening, as indicated by the per
         centage of chlorine, nitrogenous organic matter, and combustible
         matter, runs strictly parallel with the class of house, being by
         far the worst in the one-roomed houses, and the best in the
         largest houses.
    (2.) That the deafening employed in ordinary middle-class houses
         is in almost all cases practically free from nitrogenous organic
         matter and chlorides, and from any disagreeable smell, so that
         no objection can be raised to the use of deafening of the
         quality we have examined in this class of house.
    (3.) In the poorer class of houses (of three rooms and under)
         nitrogenous organic matter and chlorides are always present,
         the percentage bein£ especially high in the older houses, while
         in many cases the smell is very objectionable.      From this it
         would appear that the air in such houses may be very seriously
         polluted by the deafening, and thus give rise to ill-health.
   In reference to the above results we may remark : (1.) That the
cinders, which form the bulk of the deafening used in better class
houses are probably of good quality, owing to their being obtained
from a non-contaminated source, whereas in the poorer class of houses
inferior materials (and possibly ash-pit refuse, &c.) will doubtless be
made to serve for filling up the deafening space. (2.) The carpets in the
better class of houses are not usually lifted oftener than twice a year,
and of course the floors can only be washed at those times, so that the
necessary condition of moisture for the growth of micro-organisms is
not present to the same extent      as in lower-class houses, while at the
same time the carpet will act as a partial filter to micro-organisms
 arising from the deafening material. In the poorer class of houses,
however, everything would seem to favour the contamination of the
air from this source.       The floor boards are often plain jointed, and
simply laid side by side, so that when the floor is washed the water
has every facility for trickling down to the material             beneath.
 Further, all the household operations of washing, cooking, nursing,
 &c., have to be carried out in the one or two apartments, and hence
 the spilling of dirty water, slops, &c., on the floor, and percolation
 into the deafening below will be of pretty frequent occurrence.      The
 rooms are often overcrowded, and consequently the air is moist and
 warm, so that the increase and multiplication of micro-organisms
 would seem to be inevitable.
     It has been shown (Carnelley, Haldane, and Anderson, ' Phil.
 Trans.,' B. (1887), p. 61) that in passing from many to two- and one-
 roomed houses the air becomes more and more impure, especially with
 regard to the number of micro-organisms, whilst the death-rate

 largely increases, and the mean age at death diminishes.                   The results
 of the present paper show that the sanitary condition of the floor-
 deafening follows a similar order, thus : —

    The results obtained by the authors referred to above have also shown
that the micro-organisms do not come either from the breath (at least
in health), nor in large numbers from the outside air, so that it would
seem clear that they corao from some part of, or material in, the room
itself. Though our results are certainly not so marked as those of
Dr. Emmerich, they show, nevertheless, quite clearly that the
deafening material may be and is in the poorer class of houses a
source of contamination of the air of dwellings, in that it furnishes a
good and suitable medium for the growth of micro-organisms, and
gives off fcatid gases from putrefaction, provided the necessary factors,
moisture, warmth, and nitrogenous organic matter, are present.
   • Had it not been for the abnormally high results obtained in one of these
houses in which the drainage was very defective, these numbers would have been
very much lower, viz., 0-004 per cent. CI and 0 0057 nitrogen.         Indeed, eight of
the eleven houses examined were quite free from both chlorides and nitrogenous

    This communication forms part of an investigation on which one of

which grants have been received from this Society.*
    In this investigation the action of various compound ammonias,t
and also of some nitrites,J and allied bodies,§ has been examined.
    The plan of research required hydroxylamine (NH30), forming as
it does a link between these two classes of bodies, to be specially
examined.        The action of this body has recently become a subject of
experiment       by other workers, jj and it therefore seems advisable to
publish now one remarkable relationship between it and nitrites,
reserving for a later communication other results of this research.
Two of the most striking effects of nitrites are : their power (o) to
alter the colour of the blood,^[ and (6) to lower the pressure of blood
within the vessels.**
    Both of these properties are also possessed by nitroglycerine.tt and
Hay has shown that the effect of this substance is due to the fact that
it is decomposed in the blood with evolution of nitrous acid.Jf
    Hydroxylamine is a body in which two affinities of nitrogen are
saturated by hydrogen instead of by oxygen as in nitrous acid.                         Its
relation to nitrous acid will be seen by a comparison of their graphic
 formulae —

      It was shown       by Raimondo and Bertoni* to have the power of
   producing a chocolate-brown             colour of the blood, of lessening its
   oxidising power, and of producing a change in its spectrum, changes
  similar to those observed by Gamgee as consequences of the action of
  nitrites. I    LoewJ found it to be a powerful protoplasmic poison.
  From a consideration of its chemical properties, Binz§ was led to
  think that it must be reckoned amongst the bodies which cause
  paralysis of cells in the nerve-centres, either by setting free active
  oxygen or one of the halogens, and his experiments showed the
  correctness of his hypothesis.            Raimondo and Bertoni thought that
  during the reaction between hydroxylamine and blood nitrous acid
  was formed, and Binz obtained the reaction of nitrites from the blood
  of animals poisoned by it.
     It therefore seemed probable that it would affect the blood-pressure
  in a similar way to nitrites, and on testing it we found that it does.
  On injecting the hydrochlorate of hydroxylamine either into the
  veins or peritoneal cavity, it produces a fall of blood-pressure almost
  exactly similar to that produced by nitrite of amy], as will be seen by
 a comparison of the accompanying curves, in which the fall of blood-
  pressure is so much alike that it is almost impossible to tell from a
 mere inspection of the tracings which is due to hydroxylamine and
 which to amyl nitrite. As hydroxylamine itself is very unstable, and
 is readily converted into ammonia, we used the hydrochlorate, which
 we obtained from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams.                     As hydroxylamine
 is made commercially by the reduction of nitrites, it appeared possible
 that the specimen we employed might be contaminated by nitrites,
 and that its antion upon the blood-pressure might be due to impurity
 and not to the action of the hydroxylamine itself. On testing the
 specimen we employed by starch-paste and iodine with acetic, sul
phuric or hydrochloric acid we got no reaction, and Messrs. Hopkin
and Williams also told us that it gave no reaction with metaphenylene-
diamine.
     We may therefore regard the specimen as pure, and attribute the
fall of blood- pressure to the action of the hydroxylamine hydro
chlorate, and not to any impurities contained in it.

the presence of bile or its constituents has on the progress and re
sult of pancreatic digestion ; it includes the investigation of any such
influence   on the amylolytic, the proteolytic, and the emulsive fer
ments.     The present communication deals only with the first named ;
our experiments have been done chiefly with the pancreas and bile of
the pig, but another series in which these secretions in other animals
are being examined is in progress ; the effect of the presence of bile on
all amylolytic digestion, ex. gr., that of saliva and that of vegetable
diastase, is a subject which also seems to be worthy of investigation,
and is now receiving our attention. In the present communication
we detail the result of our experiments with the bile and pancreatic
amylolytic ferment of one animal only — the pig.
   The fluid to be digested has been made by boiling pure starch in
distilled water and carefully neutralising if necessary.          Starch
2 grams, water 100 c.c., has been found a convenient strength.      Pig's
bile has been used either in the fresh state or after careful drying at
a temperature not exceeding 27° C.       In the later form it was found
more convenient for preserving and for manipulation, as it could be
accurately weighed.     Glycerine extract of fresh pig's pancreas, and

a commercial     pancreatin made from pig's pancreas, and ascertained
to be rich in the amylolytic ferment, have been used.
    Our earliest experiments indicated that bile had a very notable
influence on the pancreatic digestion of starch ; it caused a rapid dis
appearance of the blue reaction of starch with iodine.
    Experiment A. — Five tubes, a, b, c, d, e, each containing 50 c.c. of
the starch mixture (2 per cent.).       With c 2-0 c.o. and with d and e
8-0 c.c. fresh pig's bile were thoroughly mixed.       Equal quantities of
glycerine   extract  of pig's pancreas were  then  simultaneously added to
    c, and d, and all five tubes were placed in a water-bath at 33° C.
The colour reaction of solution of iodine with the two control tubes —
a which contained the starch mixture alone, and e which contained
t he starch mixture and bile (8 c.c.) — remained unaltered      throughout
the experiment.        The changed colour reaction in the other tubes
was watched by mixing a drop of the mixture with iodine solution on
:i white porcelain plate.     The blue reaction in d rapidly disappeared,
being replaced      in  less than one minute by a pnrple and in two
minutes by a red colour ; the red colour became gradually fainter and
had entirely disappeared in ten minutes.          In b and c the blue reac
tion disappeared more slowly, a purple colour being still obtained at
the end of ten minutes ; no difference was perceptible in this respect
between 6 and c, a fact which indicates that the amount of bile present
must exceed the proportion added to c before any accelerating in
fluence was noticeable.
    By using weighed quantities of the dried bile it was proved that a
larger proportion of bile caused the blne reaction with iodine to dis
appear more rapidly than a small proportion.
    Experiment B. — Four vessels, o, 6, d, e, containing the starch
mixture 2 per cent. To b 0-6 percent. dried pig's bile, to d and e3 per
cent. dried pig-s bile were added and dissolved ; to a, b, and d equal
quantities of glycerine extract of pig's pancreas were added, and all
the vessels were placed in a water-bath at 33° C. ; d ceased to give any
colour reaction with iodine solution in five minutes ; at the same
moment the reaction given by 6 was reddish-purple, and by a purple ;
e  remained   unchanged.
    This increase of rapidity with increasing proportion of bile was
found to hold up to 4 per cent. of dried bile (equivalent probably to
at least 30 per cent, fresh bile).      Beyond this percentage we have
not made experiments ; a larger proportion of bile rendered the
mixture very thick and interfered with the colour reaction.
    It was also ascertained that the amount of sugar, estimated as
dextrose, formed under the conditions of Experiments A and B, was
greater when bile was present, and increased when the proportion of
bile was increased.
    Experiment C. — Four vessels, a, b, c, d, containing the starch

mixture    2 per cent.       To b 0-6 per cent. dried pig's bilp, and to c and d
2 per cent. dried pig's bile were added and dissolved ; to a, b, and c
equal quantities of glycerine extract of pig's pancreas were added and
all the vessels were placed in a water-bath at 34° C. The colour
reaction with iodine given by d was unchanged throughout, but a,
b, and c gave a varying colour reaction, and changing most rapidly
with c and least rapidly with a. After remaining in the water-
bath for eight minutes the vessels were taken out and their contents
boiled, to destroy the ferment, and the amonnt of dextrose estimated
by Fehling's method ; a contained 0-45 per cent., b 0-59 per cent., and
c 0-74 per cent.
   A large number of experiments were perfoimed of which the above
are quoted as examples, and the conclusion to which we were led
was that digestion of starch by extract of pig's pancreas                            was
hastened in the presence of pig's bile.              We next songht to ascertain
(1) whether this was a property of the bile solids as a whole, or of
one or other constituent ; and (2) the nature of this hastening action,
whether, thnt is to say, the bile only hastened the transformation of
 starch into dextrin, or whether there were also constant increase in
the amount of sugar formed.
   Firstly, as to whether the effect is to be ascribed to the action of
any one constituent of the bile. Pig's bile contains bile salts (chiefly
hyoglycocholate of sodium*), bile pigment, cholesterin, soaps, and
salts together with mucin. We found that an extract of dried bile
made with absolute alcohol retained the power of hastening pancreatic
digestion of starch, and finally that it was also possessed by the bile
salts.    It was found in this case also that the amount of sugar esti
mated as dextrose was greater as the proportion of bile salts added
to the mixture was increased up to 2 per cent., beyond which our
experiments have not gone.            Thus in one experiment the amount of
sugar   found    after    half   an hour's  digestion (a) in a mixture to which
0-6 por cent. of bile salts had been added = 103 per cent. ; (i) in a
mixture to which 2-0 per cent. of bile salts had been added = l-25
per cent. ; and (c) in a mixture to which no bile salts had been added
10 per cent. ; a large amount of starch mixture was used in this ex
periment and 0-8 per cent. pancreatin added.
    Secondly, as to the nature of the process, whether the bile hastened
the transformation of starch into dextrin, or whether there was also
an increase in the amount of sugar ; this was found to be a somewhat
difficult question to solve. The quantitative estimation of a mixture
of starch, dextrin, and sugar, or of dextrin and sugar was found to
present many difficulties.          The amount of sugar was readily estimated

 as dextrose   by Fehling's method, but we are unacquainted with any
 reagent which will effect the separation of dextrin from starch ; they
 can both, however, be precipitated by absolute alcohol.            We have
 made a quantitative estimation of the relative amounts of starch,
 dextrin, and sugar by the following method : two equal portions of
 the starch mixture, 2 per cent., were digested with equal quantities
 of dried pig's pancreatin,* rich in amylopsin, a certain proportion of
 bile salts (made from pig's bile) having been previously added to one.
 Digestion was allowed to proceed in the incubator until the reaction of
 starch with a solution of iodine had completely, or almost completely
 disappeared from the vessel to which bile salts had been added.        Both
mixtures were then rapidly boiled to stop the action.          The digested
 mixture was then poured into a dialyser (made of German sausage
 paper) and dialysed in running water for four or five days, thymol
being added to prevent decomposition (which did not occur) ; the
 dextrin, sugar, and most of the salts were thus dialysed away, and
the total residue (starch) was estimated by evaporating the dialysed
 liquid to small bulk and filtering into alcohol.        The precipitate was
caught    on a filter, dried at 100° to 110° C., and weighed.    The residue
of undigested starch was thus estimated.          The proportional amounts
of sugar and dextrin were estimated by dialysing the liquids di
gested under the same conditions as those just described, in distilled
water for four days, decomposition being prevented by the daily ad
dition of thymol. Equal quantities of the two dialysates, the one
containing sugar and dextrin, the other sugar, dextrin, and bile
salts, were evaporated to small bulk, the sugar estimated as dextrose
by Fehling's solution, the dextrin by precipitating a measured
quantity of each concentrated liquid by absolute alcohol, washing
with absolute alcohol to remove bile salts, drying at 100° to 110° 0.,
and weighing.
    The results are shown in the following experiments : —
    Experimetit D. — To one of two flasks containing 200 c.c. of the
starch mixture (2 per cent.) 0-6 per cent. bile salts was added ; 0-8 per
cent. pancreatin was then added to both flasks and the mixture digested
at 38° C. for two minutes.      The flask containing bile salts then gave
no reaction with iodine solution, while that which contained pan
creatin alone gave a purple reaction.        Both fluids were then dialysed
in cold distilled water for four days, decomposition being prevented by
the daily addition of thymol. Both dialysates, which were faintly acid
and contained no starch, were then evaporated to small bulk, and
each divided into two parts for the estimation of sugar and dextrin
respectively. The former was estimated as dextroso by Fehling's
process, the latter by precipitating under absolute alcohol, filtering,
drying at 100 — 110° C., and weighing. The result was : —

   The addition of bile salts therefore had increased the production
of sugar in the proportion 5 : 4, and that of dextrin in like pro
portion.
   Experiment E. — This experiment was conducted with the same
proportion of each ingredient and in the same manner, with the
exception that the fluids were dialysed in a stream of (tap) water ;
the total residue, after evaporation      and treatment with absolute
alcohol in the manner previously described, was estimated by drying
and weighing.      The residue in the fluid containing bile salts weighed
0-314 gram,    in  the fluid to which pancreatin alone was added, it
weighed 0-517gram. These residues contained starch and a trace of
peptone, but no bile salts nor sugar.
   Our conclusions may thus be briefly stated : — The effect of fresh
and dried bile in hastening the pancreatic digestion of starch in the
pig is due to the bile salts ; these salts possess the power of increasing
the amount not only of dextriu, but of sugar estimated as dextrose.
   The authors are not at present in a position to explain this in
fluence of bile salts ; the pancreatic solution of starch proceeds more
rapidly at first in laboratory experiments, and the retardation after a
short interval is very marked.      It is possible that the bile salts m<iy
favour its continuance by entering into combination with the bodies
which have this retarding effect.
II.  " The Innervation of the Renal Blood-vessels." By J. ROSE
      Bbadfobd, M.B., D.Sc., George Henry Lewes Student.
      Communicated by E. A. Schafeb, F.R.S. (from the Physio
      logical Laboratory of University College, London). Re
      ceived February 1, 1889.
   The following work was undertaken in order to map out the origin,
course, and nature of the renal nerves more accurately than had
hitherto been attempted.       It was considered (more especially in the
light of Gaskell's well-known work on the sympathetic) important to
decide whether the renal and other abdominal vascular nerves were
of two kinds, i.e., vaso-constrictor and vaso-dilator, or whether the
hitter nerves could not be demonstrated to exist.           This research was
carried out exclusively on the dog, inasmuch as this was the animal
used by Gaskell in his work.

1889.]          The Innervation   of the Renal Blood-vessels.            3G3
    The principal conclusions arrived at in this communication will       be
arranged under the following three headings : —
    I. The Origin and Course of the Vaso-constrictor Nerves.
    II. The Origin and Course of the Vaso-dilator Nerves.
    III. The Reflex Phenomena of the Renal Vessels.
    It will be necessary, however, to describe shortly the method em
ployed.     The general blood pressure and the volume of the kidney as
measured by Roy's oncometer were recorded simultaneously, together
with a time tracing and a lever marking the moment and duration of
the nerve excitation.     In this manner both the general and the local
effects of any given stimulation were determined simultaneously. The
method of preparation of the nerves was as follows : the roots of the
nerves were exposed inside the spinal canal, the posterior roots were
then divided inside the dura mater, and the entire nerve outside the
dura mater arranged for stimulation with suitable electrodes.             In
some cases the nerves were cut and ligatured and the distal ends
excited.     By the use of one or other of these methods, the danger of
the exciting current spreading to the cord, and so producing reflex
effects, was reduced to a minimum.           In many experiments this
danger    was  further eliminated  by dividing the cord above the level of
the nerves excited.
    In this communication a nomenclature is adopted which assumes
 that the dog has twenty dorso-lumbar vertebrae, of which thirteen
 are dorsal and seven lumbar.         For excitation an ordinary Du Bois
 coil was used with Helmholtz's modification, and the rate of interrup
 tion was varied, as will be mentioned more fully below from fifty per
 second to one per second.
    The anaesthetics used were chloroform and morphia, and after the
 completion of the necessary operative procedure, the animals were
 curarised, artificial respiration and anaesthetisation being maintained
 in the usual manner.
    It is well known that, when either the renal nerves or the splanch
 nic nerves are excited, a contraction of the kidney accompanied by a
 rise of blood pressure is observed.        On exciting the lower dorsal
 nerves inside the spinal canal the same general facts are observed,
 provided the posterior roots have been divided and care be taken to
 prevent the spreading of the exciting current to the cord.           Before
entering into further detail it is necessary to state that in order to get
these effects the rate of excitation must not be slower than five per
second.     Hence, unless otherwise mentioned, it is to be understood
that the rate of stimulation was a rapid one, i.e., fifty per second.
             I. Origin and Course of the Vaso-constrictor Nerves.
    No effects have been observed to follow the excitation of the peri
pheral    end   of a divided posterior root.      Furthermore,    the same

 result is  seen  to follow the stimulation of the divided anterior root.
and the stimulation of the entire nerve outside the dura mater after
previous section of the posterior root. Hence we may conclude that
 no efferent vasomotor     fibres are contained in the posterior roots.
    Excitation of the anterior roots, or of the entire nerve after pre
vious division of the posterior root, is followed by contraction of the
kidney and rise of general blood pressure when any nerve from the
6th dorsal to the 2nd lumbar is placed on the electrodes.         Excitation
 of the higher     nerves, e.g., the  4th or 5th dorsal, produces but slight
 effects on the general blood pressuj-e, and in the higher-ones still, i.e..
the 2nd or 3rd, the accelerator fibres are met with in abundance, and
hence a small rise of pressure (due to this cardiac effect) is produced.
 On the other hand, the 3rd lumbar has in many cases yielded no re
 sult on excitation, but occasionally a slight rise of general blood
pressure has been observed.           So that the 6th dorsal and the 2nd
 lumbar are practically the limits of the series of nerves, the stimula
tion of which causes any marked effects either on the kidney or on the
general arterial tension.
    The effects, however, are not equally marked with all these nerves.
 The lower dorsal nerves, i.e., from the 10th to the 13th, produce much
 greater effects, both on the kidney and on the general blood pressure,
 than either the nerves above them or those immediately below them.
 So that although all the nerves from the 6th dorsal to the 2nd
lumbar may contain fibres for the renal vessels, still their main
supply is derived from the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th dorsal nerves.
    It follows from the above description that there is no very great
separation between the paths followed by the nerves for the kidney
vessels and those destined for the vessels of the other abdominal vis
 cera.    However, the lower dorsal not only produce greater effects on
the kidney and on the general blood pressure than the upper dorsal
 nerves, but what is more important the two effects do not vary directly
 with one another.      Although usually a nerve producing a large renal
 contraction causes simultaneously a great rise of pressure, yet this is
by no means invariably the case, and a small renal contraction may
 be accompanied by a great rise of pressure and vice versa.         The 12th
 and 13th dorsal nerves, for instance, cause usually a great renal con
traction, but the accompanying rise of blood pressure is not so high
a s with some of the nerves above them.           Hence we must conclude
that   in  individual  cases there may be small variations in the number
 of fibres going on the one hand to the kidney and on the other hand
 to the other abdominal viscera.
    The contraction of the kidney occurs after a short latent period,
 and in a typical case it is sudden, marked, and very persistent, often
lasting long after the excitation has ceased. The kidney then com
mences slowly to expand and along with this expansion the blood

 1889.]           The Innervation  of  the Renal Blood-vessels.             365
 pressure   falls to its normal height. Generally the kidney does not
 quite regain its former volume, in other words, its vessels remain
 slightly contracted as a more or less permanent after-effect. This effect
 is so small that it is not accompanied by any appreciable rise of blood
 pressure.     In some cases after the excitation has ceased, the blood
 pressure   falls  slowly but slightly below its previous height and then
 slowly regains its normal leveL That is to say, the sadden and
great rise of arterial tension is followed by slight, slow, and gradual
 tall. This fall of blood pressure is accompanied by a slight contrac
 tion of the kidney, the volume of the latter following exactly the fall
and subsequent rise of blood pressure.             This result is only occa
sionally seen when quick rates of excitation are used, but it becomes
 taore frequent when such a rate as five per second is employed.
    It has been seen with most of the nerves, but it is more common with
 the upper than with the lower dorsal.           Its full significance will be
alluded to later, but this result is no doubt due to the excitation of
 vaso-diiator fibres, the kidney effect being a passive one due to
changes of blood pressure produced in other organs.
    In a very small proportion of cases a rise of blood pressure is
produced as usual, but the kidney effect is a mixed one, i.e., there is
first a slight expansion then a marked contraction. In a still smaller
number of cases a renal expansion has been observed, generally
accompanied        by a slight rise of the general blood pressure, but
occasionally no such rise has occurred.          When the kidney expansion
is accompanied by a rise of general arterial tension, it is no doubt due
 to the kidney vessels being passively dilated owing to active contrac
tion having taken place elsewhere. When, however, the expansion
of the kidney is unaccompanied by any rise of pressure, it is difficult
to avoid the conclusion that it is due to the excitation of actual vaso
dilator fibres ; however, better evidence than this will be adduced in
support of the existence of these nerves.
          II.  The Existence and Course    of the. Vaso-dilator Fibres.
    Hitherto no definite evidence has been adduced in support of the
existence of vaso-dilators for the vessels of the kidney. If, however,
the 11th, 12th, or 13th dorsal nerves be excited by slow rhythmical
0hocks, i.e., one per second, it will be found that expansion of the
kidney occurs unaccompanied by any rise of blood pressure.                This
renal expansion is marked in character and rather persistent in its
duration, that is to say, the organ does not return completely to its
original volume after the cessation of the excitation. It is clear that
the renal expansion is an active one, since the nerve stimulation has
produced no obvious effect on the blood pressure.                This striking
result is not so easily obtained      with   the  higher  nerves  ; with these
the same excitation produces a fall of blood pressure, accompanied
                                                                  2 B 2

366                            Dr.  J.  R. Bradford.                   [Feb. 21,
not by any expansion, but by a passive contraction of the kidney
vessels.     In other words, with these higher nerves a dilatation is
produced, not only of the kidney vessels, but also of the vessels of a
much larger area, and hence the renal dilatation is unable to mani
fest itself.
    This view is confirmed by the results obtained on excitation of the
splanchnic nerve. When this nerve is stimulated with quick rates,
the kidney, as is well known, undergoes great contraction, and there
is at the same time a large rise in the general blood pressnre. With
slow rhythmical stimulation, however,              I  have never succeeded in
getting any renal expansion.           This slow stimulation, however, causes
a large fall    in  the   blood pressure, accompanied by a marked renal
contraction. This renal contraction is obviously passive, since it not
only exactly follows the fall of blood pressure, but, when the exciting
current is shut oil, the blood pressure undergoes a sudden and tem
porary rise, and this rise is accompanied by a correspondingly transi
tory renal expansion.         In other words, the dilatation is one produced
in a large area, and the kidney vessels are affected secondarily.
Hence just as the renal constrictor fibres are best marked in the 11th,
12th, and 13th dorsal nerves, so the same is true for the dilator.
These, however, like the constrictors, probably exist in the higher
nerves, but for the reasons given it is almost impossible to demon
strate their existence positively, as they run with the dilator fibres
for the vessels of the other abdominal viscera.
    Excitation of the peripheral end of the divided vagus in the neck
causes of course marked contraction of the kidney, owing to its inhi
 bitory action on the henrt, which action is not obviated by the doses
of curare employed.         After small doses of atropine the stimulation of
the cervical vagus has no effect on the volume of the kidney.             Stimu
 lation of the   vagus   in  the thorax,  i.e., beyond   the point whore it gives
 off its cardiac fibres, has also no effect on the volume of the kidney.
 Thns we may conclude that there is no evidence to show that the
 vagus supplies any fibres to the renal vessels.
               III.  Thi Reflex Phenomena of        the Renal Vessels.
    Excitation of the central end of the divided seiatic causes, as shown
 by Roy, a contraction of the kidney accompanied by a rise of blood
 pressure.    This result I can confirm, as it occurs in by far the greater
 number of cases.         Occasionally, however, this nerve causes a slight
 expansion    of  the   kidney, but this is not only very small in amount.
 but it is also very rare.         Sometimes, as is well known, the central
 end of the sciatic causes a fall of blood pressure, and when this occurs
 it is accompanied by a renal contraction. The central end of a
 divided intercoxtal neroe causes a slight rise of blood pressure, accom
 panied by a small contraction of the kidney vessels.

 1889.]          The Innervation  of  the Renal Blood-vessels.           367
    The central end of the divided vagus in the rabbit causes a contrac
 tion of the kidney, accompanied of course by a rise of blood pressure.
In the dog this is also by far the most common result. In the cat, how
ever, and occasionally in the dog, the excitation of this nerve causes a
depressor effect, i.e., a fall of blood pressure, and with this fall a
passive shrinking of the kidney.        The central end of the depressor in
the rabbit or of the vagus in the cat causes, as just mentioned, a great
fall of blood pressure, accompanied by a passive contraction of the
kidney. Although the blood pressure fall is always a large one, the
effect on the kidney volume is but slight.        Here again this effect is
probably simply the result "of the great dilatation of the other abdominal
vessels, neutralising, so to say, the renal dilatation, and so causing an
actual diminution in the volume of the kidney. In a few cases in the
rabbit, where the blood pressure fall has not been very great, an
initial slight expansion of the kidney has been detected.
    The stimulation of the central end of a divided posterior root pro
duces in almost all cases a great rise of general blood pressure.       This
rise is not only large     in  amount, but it is very sudden, and     also of
rather short duration. The pressure remains at the maximum height
bnt a few seconds, and when the excitation is over falls towards its
normal height ; there is, however, generally a persistent after-effect,
that is to say, the pressure remains a little higher than it was pre
viously to the stimulation. There is no very material difference between
the results obtained with the lower dorsal nerves and those seen with
the upper ones, in both cases a large rise of pressure is obtained ;
on the whole, however, the reflex rise seen with the lower
nerves is somewhat greater than that obtained with the upper
nerves.      As a rule the rise of pressure is accompanied by a
contraction of the kidney, marked in amount, but not of such a
persistent character as that described above as following the excitation
of the peripheral end of an anterior root. Frequently the kidney
effect is a mixed one, i.e., a contraction followed by an expansion ;
not uncommonly, however, there is an initial expansion, the subse
quent course of which is interrupted by a contraction.            More fre
quently still no contraction of the kidney is seen, it is replaced by a
pure expansion, accompanied as before, however, by a great rise of
blood pressure. This effect, however, is most often obtained with the
lower dorsal nerves, e.g., the 10th to the 13th. Sometimes when the
stimulation of a posterior root gives the renal expansion and rise of
blood pressure, the application of the electrodes to the posterior
surface of the cord gives an equal rise of blood pressure, accom
panied, however, by contraction of the kidney. Hence the former
effect, i.e., the renal expansion, is the result of a more local excitation.
When the reflex excitation causes expansion of the kidney there is
profuse haemorrhage from the spinal wound.           Now this hemorrhage

368           The Innervation    of  the  Renal Blood-vessels.    [Feb. 21,
is not altogether to   be explained   as  resulting simply from the height
ened blood pressure, since an equal rise, produced say by the sciatio
and accompanied by contraction of the renal vessels, is not followed
by this profuse haemorrhage.        Hence it is probable that not only is
there a dilatation of the kidney vessels, but also of the vessels in the
lumbar region of the body wall, hence the haemorrhage.
    Rarely excitation of a posterior root causes a depressor effect, there
being a great f°ll of blood pressure, and then as usual the kidney
undergoes a passive contraction, owing to the large dilatation else
where.
   The results of reflex excitation can then be summed np shortly by
saying that the excitation of an afferent nerve causing a rise of blood
pressure is accompanied by a renal contraction, unless the nerve is one
of what may be called the renal area. In this case the rise of blood
pressure is accompanied as a rnle by either a renal expansion or else
by a mixed kidney effect.      If the afferent nerve causes a depressor
effect due to dilatation of the abdominal vessels, the kidney vessels
probably share in that dilatation, but this is not seen by any actual
renal expansion owing to this being overpowered by the dilatation
elsewhere, and hence the kidney undergoes a passive shrinking.
   The other conclusions of this paper are that the renal constrictor
fibres leave the cord through the anterior roots of the nerves extend
ing from the 6th dorsal to the 2nd lumbar inclusive.
   That, secondly, there are vaso-dilator fibres, as can easily be demon
strated with such nerves as the 11th or 12th dorsal, but that in all
probability they also extend from the 6th dorsal to the 2nd lumbar,
and for the reasons given above they cannot be demonstrated with
certainty in the upper nerves, since here they run with the vaso
dilator fibres for the vessels of the other abdominal viscera.
    Hence there is no evidence to show that the vaso-constrictor fibres
and the vaso-dilator fibres reach the kidney by different routes.
    Finally, the great splaochuic nerve contains not only vaso-con
strictor, but also vaso-dilator fibres, for the vessels of the abdominal
viscera.
    The expenses of this research        were partly   defrayed by a grant
 obtniued from the Royal Society.

 III.  " The Innervation of the Pulmonary Vessels."             By J. ROSE
       Bradford, M.B., D.Sc., George Henry Lewes Student, and
       H. Percy Dean, M.B., B.S., B.Sc. Communicated by E. A.
       Schafer, F.R.S. (from the Physiological Laboratory
       of University College, London). Received February 13,
       1889.
    Although hitherto most physiologists have considered that the
pulmonary vessels probably possessed a system of vaso-motor nerves,
yet no direct experimental proof of the existence of such a system
 has been obtained.         Still less has any evidence been adduced to
demonstrate      the actual anatomical     paths  by which such nerves, if
 they exist, reach the lungs.       Hence it seemed that the whole question
 was one deserving a further attempt for its solution. When this
 research was commenced, there were practically only two facts which
 could   be appealed to   in support of the existence of these nerves.
    Firstly, Lichtheim observed that in asphyxia a rise of blood-pressure
 may occur in the pulmonary artery unaccompanied by any rise in the
aorta.
    Secondly, it has been shown that in the frog, irritation of the skin
causes a contraction of the pulmonary vessels.
    It is clear that this second fact could not be used as an argument in,
support of the existence of these nerves in the mammal, since the
anatomical relations are so different in the two cases.
    With regard to Lichtheim's observation, it is evident that it affords
no very direct proof, since other conditions, such as venous distension,
might easily account for the rise of pulmonary pressure.
    It was felt by us that the only really reliable method would be to
excite one by one the roots of the spinal nerves, and to observe the
iffects of such stimulation on the aortic and pulmonary blood-
pressures simultaneously.
    The following method was employed : — A cannula, placed in the
carotid artery in the usual manner, was connected with a mercurial
manometer.        In a similar manner a second mercurial manometer was
then connected with the branch of the left division of the pulmonary
artery distributed to the lower lobe of the left lung. This vessel wus
reached from the back by resecting portions of two or sometimes
three ribs. In this way a record of the pressure in the left division
of the main artery was obtained, and also a means of detecting
changes of pressure in the main artery.             At the same time, the
minimum amount of lung tissue was thrown out of gear.
    The upper dorsal nerves were then exposed inside the spinal canal,
and were ligatured outside the dura mater. By cutting through the

370             Dr.   J.  R. Bradford and Mr. H. P. Dean.          [Feb. 21,
nerves between the spinal cord and the ligature, the peripheral ends
could be easily arranged for excitation.
   In this way      the fibres   of both anterior and posterior roots are
excited, but, as previously shown by one of us, no efferent vaso-motor
fibres can be demonstrated to exist in the posterior roots.        Hence for
our purposes this mode of excitation is practically equivalent to
exciting the anterior roots alone, and inasmuch as a comparatively
long stretch of tough nerve can bo obtained, the danger of the
exciting current spreading to the spinal cord, and so producing reflex
effects, is avoided.      The nerves were excited on the right side, on the
same side as the uninjured lung.
   The two blood-pressure curves were recorded simultaneously on the
same blackened surface, together with a time tracing and a lever
marking the duration of the excitation.
   The anaesthetics used were chloroform and morphia, and after the
nerves had been prepared, a small dose of curare was injected, and
artificial respiration maintained before opening the chest to insert the
pulmonary cannula.
   Before describing the results following excitation of the upper
dorsal nerve roots, it will be necessary to describe shortly the relations
existing between the systemic and pulmonary blood-pressures, and
more especially what effects are produced on the pressure in the
pulmonary artery by sudden alterations of the blood-pressure in the
systemic vessels.       It is necessary to do this, as otherwise in many
cases it might be urged that the effects of a given nerve excitation on
the pulmonary pressure were simply due to the reaction of the
pulmonary vessels to the accompanying carotid rise. In some cases
this objection has no force whatever, since there is no carotid rise or
there may even be a carotid fall.        In other cases, e.g., in stimulation
of the fifth dorsal neive, there is often a rise of blood-pressure in both
vessels, and so we see how important it is to get a clear notion as to
what effect a given rise of arterial tension has on the pulmonary
blood-pressure.
    Before describing the results we have obtained in this direction, it
 will be convenient to consider shortly the actual amount of the
pulmonary blood-pressure, and the manner in which it is influenced
 by artificial inflation of the lungs.
    The pressure is found to vary between 16 mm. and 20 mm. of
 mercury in different dogs, these being the animals we have always
 used in our experiments.        The pressure in the main artery is a few
 millimetres higher than this.
    The pulmonary pressure is very constant in its height, not only in
 the same animal during the course of an experiment, but also in
 different animals.      In this point it contrasts strongly with the aortic
 pressure, since the latter is very variable in amount after the necessary

 1889.]         The Innervation   of  the  Pulmonary   Vessels.         371
 operative procedure described above. The aortic pressure must fall very
 low indeed for the pulmonary pressure to be appreciably diminished
 in amount.      The following is an instance bearing out the truth of this
 statement.
    Section of spinal cord at level of seventh dorsal nerve caused the
 aortic pressure to fall from 106 mm. Hg to 52 mm. Hg.                  The
 pulmonary pressure fell from 16 mm. to 14 mm. Hg. Thus, while
 the aortic pressure fell to half its previous height, the pulmonary
 pressure only diminished by one-eighth of its previous amount.
    Artificial inflation of the lungs causes a rise of pressure in both
 systems followed by a fall during the subsequent expulsion of the
injected air. The pulmonary rise is more sudden and marked in
character than the aortic rise, but the rise and fall of pressure in the
two vessels are, as far as can be determined, quite synchronous.
    The effect of artificial inflations is the same, whether the vagi are
intact or whether they have been previously divided.
    We will now turn our attention to the effects produced on the
pulmonary blood-pressure by a sudden increase in the aortic pressure.
 It is evident that this rise of pressure in the systemic circulation
 must be produced in such a way as to avoid stimulating, if possible,
the vaso-motor centre reflexly, although, as we shall see later on, the
results obtained by reflex excitation are also valuable in deciding this
question.
    Three methods have been used by us to produce a large rise of
blood-pressure in the systemic circulation, and so to determine the
passive effect of this rise on the pulmonary circulation.       They are as
follows : —
    I. The excitation of the peripheral end of a divided splanchnic.
    II. The excitation of the lower end of the spinal cord divided in
the middle of the dorsal region, and care being taken that no spread
ing of the current to the central end occurs.
    III. Compression of the thoracic aorta.
I.   Results obtained by Excitation     of  the Peripheral End of a divided
                                  Splanchnic.
    The rise of systemic blood-pressure is of course considerable, in many
 cases it is doubled.    Tho rise of pressure in the pulmonary artery is
 not, however, very marked.        Thus in one case an excitation lasting
 48 seconds produced a rise of aortic pressure amounting to 64 mm. Hg.
 The accompanying      rise of pulmonary pressure was only 3 mm. Hg.
    The aortic pressure was rather more than doubled, having risen
from 50 mm. Hg to 104 mm. Hg, on the other hand, the pulmonary rise
 was from 13 mm. Hg to 16 mm. Hg, the mean rise being, however,
 2-5 mm.    Hg.
    These results are curiously similar to those mentioned above, where

372                Dr.  J. R. Bradford and Mr. H. P. Dean.          [Feb. 21
a  fall of aortic pressure from 105 mm. to      52 mm.  Hg was accompanied
by a pulmonary fall of only 2 mm. Hg.
    Thus in two different animals sensibly the same effects were pro
duced in the pulmonary pressure in opposite directions by practically
equal changes of pressure in opposite directions produced in the aortic
pressure.
        II.   Results obtained by Excitation of the divided Spinal Cord.
    Excitation of the lower end of the divided cord produces an enor
mous rise of general blood-pressure, but the accompanying rise of
pulmonary pressure is not only always small but it is frequently
absent.
    Thus in one case stimulation for 38 seconds caused a rise of general
blood- pressure amounting to 180 mm. Hg, and the simultaneous pul
monary rise was 6 mm. Hg.              This is an extreme case. In many
instances the pulmonary rise was less than this, even when the aortic
rise was quite as marked.         In this case the aortic pressure rose from
52 mm. Hg to 232 mm. Hg, and the pulmonary pressure from 20 mm.
Hg     to 26 mm. Hg, thus although the aortic pressure was quadrupled,
the pulmonary pressure          was only raised by less than one-third of
its previous aiuount.
            III. Results obtained by Compression of Thoracic Aorta.
    When this vessel is compressed about the middle of the dorsal
region by the finger introduced through the wound, the aortic pres
sure measured in the carotid undergoes a great and sudden rife,
followed on removing the finger by a transitory fall. If the compres
sion be maintained for only a short time, e.g., 10 seconds, then there
is no rise of pulmonary pressure, although, of course, the aortic
pressure will have been greatly augmented, in this case from 104 mm.
to 169 mm. Hg, a rise of 65 mm. Hg.
    If, however, the compression be maintained longer, then the pul
monary pressure rises as we see from the following experiment : — The
aorta was compressed for 30 seconds, and the aortic pressure rose from
71 mm. to 128 mm. Hg, and that in the pulmonary artery from 19 mm.
to 22 mm. Hg.
    In all three of the preceding series of experiments the pulmonary
rise is very small when compared with the enormous effects produced
in the aortic pressure.        In all these cases the pulmonary rise was
roughly one-twentieth of the simultaneous rise in the systemic cir
culation. Not only is the rise of pulmonary pressure small when
compared to the aortic rise, but the actual pulmonary rise is bnt a
small fraction of the total pulmonary pressure.          Thus, although some
of the above methods may double or even
                                               quadruple the aortic pressure.

 1889.]           The Innervation    of the Pulmonary     Vessels.           373
 yet none of them causes anything like a doubling of the pulmonary
 pressure.
     In other words, when a great aortic rise has succeeded in producing
 a pulmonary rise, the latter is not only small relatively to the aortic
 rise but also relatively to the pulmonary pressure itself. We may
 conclude that not only must a great rise of aortic pressure occur in
order to produce any appreciable rise of pulmonary pressure, but also
 that this rise must be of some duration.
     The further discussion of the mode in which a rise of aortic pressure
 produces a rise of pulmonary pressure will be entered into at the close
 of this communication. Having thus described shortly what may be
 called the mechanical effects of rises of aortic pressure on the pul
 monary circulation, we will now consider the results of reflex
 excitation of such nerves as the sciatic and vagus.
       Results of Excitation of the Central    End of  the divided Sciatic.
     It is well known that the rises of aortic pressure produced by the
excitation of this and other afferent nerves are frequently very con
siderable. This ia especially the case with the sciatic nerve.
    In one case the stimulation of the central end of this nerve gave an
aortic rise of 36 mm. Hg, and the accompanying pulmonary rise was
only 2 mm. Hg, i.e., one-eighteenth of the aortic rise, that is to say,
nearly the same ratio as that obtained in the previous experiments
described above in the passive reaction of the pulmonary vessels to
rises of general arterial tension.        In another instance, with an aortic
rise of 30 mm. Hg, there was no simultaneous pulmonary rise.
      Results following Excitation of the Central    End of divided Vagus.
     With this nerve somewhat different results are obtained.
    Thus, in one case, the aortic rise was 32 mm. Hg and the pulmonary
rise 4 mm. Hg, i.e., the relative ratio of the two effects being one-eighth.
This result was obtained in the same animal that previously gave with
the sciatic a ratio of one-eighteenth.          In the case of the vagus the
pulmonary       rise  was  double that observed  with the sciatic, although the
aortic rises were almost the same in the two cases, i.e., 36 mm. and
32 mm. Hg.          It is clear then that, although in this animal the vagus
and sciatic gave on stimulation practically equal effects in the systemic
vessels, yet the results on the pulmonary vessels were by no means the
same in the two cases.         Hence the only conclusion is that excitation of
the central     end   of the divided vagus caused a reflex contraction of the
pulmonary vessels and thus caused a heightened pulmonary tension.
    In the cat frequently and in the dog occasionally the stimulation of
the central end of the vagus causes a fall of blood-pressure          instead of
a rise, in many cases the fall of aortic pressure is considerable.          Thus

374              Dr. J.  R. Bradford and Mr. H. P. Dean.        [Feb. 21,
in one experiment the central end of left vagus was excited for
28 seconds and the aortic pressure fell from 112 mm. to 66 mm. Hg,
i.e., a fall of 56 mm. Hg.      The pulmonary pressure fell from 17 mm.
to 14 mm. Hg, i.e., a fall of 3 mm. Hg.
    This pulmonary fall is rather greater in amount than that previously
described as occurring after section of the cord in the dorsal regiou,
but it is not too large to be explained on the grounds of a passive effect
owing to the large aortic fall.
    It is, however, with stimulation of the posterior surface of the
spinal cord that the greatest relative effects are seen.       When this
mode of excitation is used the rise of pulmonary pressure is frequently
as much as one-tenth of the simultaneous aortic rise, i.e., the ratio is
higher than with any of the previous methods of experimentation.
    No doubt part of this effect may be due to the direct excitation of
 the pulmonary vaso-motor fibres, as will be shown below.       Probably,
however, the result is mostly due to reflex effects dependent on the
cord stimulation, and this is confirmed by the fact that excitation of
the central end of a divided posterior root of the upper nerves will
cause a great relative rise of pulmonary pressure.
    On the other hand, the excitation of the central end of a divided
intercostal nerve causes hut slight effects both on the pulmonary and
on the aortic blood-pressures.        Occasionally the central end of an
intercostal produces depressive effects similar to those just described
for the vagus.
    Having thus determined the relation existing hetween a given rise
of aortic pressure and the coincident passive pulmonary vise, and also
the effects resulting from reflex excitation of the cord, vagus and
sciatic, we will now pass on to the question of the existeuce and
paths of the vaso-motor fibres.
    If the upper part of the medulla oblongata he excited it will, of
course, be found that a large rise of aortic and pulmonary pressure
 will be observed.      If, now, the spinal cord be divided at about the
 level of the 7th dorsal nerve and its lower end excited, then just as
great or perhaps greater rise of aortic pressure will be observed, but
 the pulmonary rise will be either very small indeed or else entirely
absent.
    If the upper part of the medulla be now again excited, the rise of
 aortic pressure is small owing to the section of the cord, but the pul
 monary rise is as great as before. With stronger excitation this rise
 of pulmonary pressure becomes greater whilst the accompanying aortic
 rise is still comparatively small.    Thus, in one case, the excitation of
 the lower end of the divided cord caused an aortic rise of 150 mm. Hg.
 The accompanying pulmonary rise was less than 2 mm. Hg. On now
 exciting the medulla in the same animal the aortic pressure rose
 bo mm. only, owing to section of the cord, but the pulmonary pressure

   1889.]        The Innervation of   the  Pulmonary    Vessels.         375
   rose  from 16 mm. to 22 mm. Hg, i.e., 6 mm. Thus in the latter case
   the aortic rise was one-third of what it was in the previous experiment,
   but the pulmonary rise was three times as great.
       This experiment then clearly demonstrates that the pulmonary
   pressure is not dependent on the aortic rise, since the latter can be
   obtained without the former, and a pulmonary rise, very considerable
   in amount, can be obtained when the aortic rise is either small or
   large.             ,
       Hence this result points strongly to the conclusion that the vaso
   motor    centre can influence the pulmonary vessels directly. In the
    light of Gaskell's work on the sympathetic, we naturally turn to the
,  roots of the upper dorsal nerves, and we are enabled to map out the
    paths by which these vaso-motor nerves reach the lung.
       When the peripheral end of such a nerve as the 6th or 7th dorsal is
   excited a rise of pressure in both the pulmonary and aortic system is
   observed.     The pulmonary rise, although considerable, e.g., 3 or
   4 mm. Hg, is not out of proportion to the aortic rise which, with these
   nerves, may be as much as 30 or 40 mm. Hg. On ascending, however,
   very different results are obtained.    Thus in one case the 5th dorsal
   gave an aortic rise of 10 mm. Hg only, but the pulmonary rise was
   3 mm. Hg.      Clearly the latter was not a passive effect of the former.
   In another case the 4th dorsal gave an aortic rise of 20 mm. Hg, and
   a pulmonary rise of 4 mm. Hg.
       Perhaps, however, the most marked and conclusive result is seen
   with the 3rd dorsal nerve. This nerve frequently causes no aortic
   rise, and, indeed, sometimes actually a fall, e.g., 10 mm. Hg, but in both
   these cases there is a distinct pulmonary rise of 3 or 4 mm. Hg.       We
   sometimes get such a fall in the aortic pressure accompanied by a
   pulmonary rise with the 4th nerve and twice we have seen it with the
   5th nerve.
       As a rule these effects cannot be obtained when the accelerators
   produce marked effects, and hence no very definite results have been
  obtained from stimulation of the 2nd dorsal nerve. Often, however,
  the heart is already beating rapidly, so that irritation of the accelerator
  nerves causes no further increase in rate, and it is under these circum
  stances that the pulmonary vaso-motor fibres can be most easily
  demonstrated. Thus, as we pass from the 7th to the 2nd nerve, the
  effect of their excitation on the aortic pressure diminishes as we pass
  from below upwards, and the upper nerves may even cause a fall of
  pressure in systemic circulation. On the other hand, the effect on the
  pulmonary pressure seems to increase as we pass from below upwards.
  Hence we may conclude that the vaso-constrictor fibres for the lungs
  leave the spinal cord in the roots of the dorsal nerves from the 2nd
  to the 7th.
      An attempt    was made   to separate  the pulmonary nerves from the

376             The Innervation     of the Pulmonary   Vessels.    [Feb. 21,
cardiac    nerves in the branches of the ganglion stellatura and in the
annulus Vieussenii.          As yet, however, we have not been able to
separate the pulmonary vaso-motor fibres from the accelerator fibres.
   The objection will of course be made that the effects are slight,
and no doubt they are, but when we consider that enormous changes
in the aortic pressure produce such extremely slight effects, it is clear
that, small as these effects are, they conclusively show that they are
dependent      on the contraction    of the pulmonary vessels, and not on
any passive effect from the slight rises in the aortic pressure.
   There seems no doubt that the vaso-constrictor mechanism           of the
lungs is not very highly developed.         It is impossible to get anything
like a doubling of pulmonary blood-pressure by any kind of nerve
excitation, although the systemic blood-pressure can easily be doubled
or even quadrupled. The amount of possible contraction of the
pulmonary arterioles is probably not nearly so great as that of the
systemic vessels, and this view is confirmed by the results of asphyxia
on the pulmonary circulation.
             Results of Asphyxia on the Pulmonary Circulation.
   In asphyxia both        the aortic and the pulmonary blood-pressures
undergo a considerable rise, but the rise of pressure in the pulmonary
vessels lasts longer than that in the systemic, so that when the aortic
pressure is falling rapidly, the pulmonary may be at its highest point
   The rise of pressure occurs synchronously in the two sets of vessels,
and the general course of the two curves is the same, except that the
pulmonary rise is more gradual than the aortic rise. As a rule, the
sudden and great elevations seen on the aortic blood-pressure          carve
are   not  well seen   on tho   pnlmonaiy  trace, but notwithstanding this,
the maximum rise of the pulmonary pressure may be very considerable,
e.g.,  it may be doubled.
   If, however, so large an effect as this is seen, the aortic pressure
will have undergone a very much greater relative rise, i.e., it will
have been quadrupled.
   The Traube curves, so well marked on the aortic blood-pressure
tracing, are but faintly marked in the case of the pulmonary artery,
and hence     it is difficult to say whether the effects are direct or due
simply to passive reaction from the systemic circulation. It is probable,
however, that they are direct.
   The curious maintenance of the pulmonary pressure at such a
height as death approaches, when the aortic pressure has fallen
perhaps to half its previous height, is probably due to venous disten
sion as much as to the increased peripheral resistance, but this is a
point we wish to investigate further.

leading the cord through the roots of the uppermost dorsal nerves.
 No efferent vaso-motor fibres have been detected in the vagus nerve.
¦
   The pulmonary circulation is comparatively independent of the
systemic, and alterations in the blood- pressure of the latter must be of
large amount to affect the pulmonary blood-pressure.        It is probable
that no rise of aortic pressure can materially influence the pulmonary
blood-pressure, unless it is so great in amount or duration that the
heart muscle and valves are unable to cope with               it,
                                                        and so an actual
regurgitation     produced.
                      is
t   It  possible that the pulmonary blood-pressure can also be affected
         is
by rises of systemic pressure causing venous distension, and hence an
increased supply to the right side of the heart.
    Finally, although      undoubted from the results of this research
                                it   is
that the mammalian pulmonary vessels receive vaso-motor nerves, yet
•it isprobable that the vaso-motor mechanism        but poorly developed
                                                         is
us compared with that regulating the systemic arteries.
    In this respect   may be that the pulmonary system holds an inter
                           it
mediate position between the systemic arteries on the one hand and
the veins on the other.
    This question we hope to elucidate by a further research.      We also
hope that, shortly, we shall be able to give the results of our researches
on the vaso-dilator nerves of the lungs.

I. "  On the    Spectra of Meteor-swarms (Group III)."                     By   J.
    Norman Loukyek, F.R.S. Received February 14, 188t».
                              I.  Introductory.
   Up to the present time the prevailing idea has been that nebulae,
stars, and comets represent different orders of bodies in the cosmos,
and all classifications have proceeded on the assumption not only that
these bodies are variously constituted but that in the case of the
" stars " all are becoming cooler. In a paper communicated to the
Royal Society in 1865,* Dr. Huggins writes : " My observations, as
far as they extend at present, seem to be        in favour of the opinion that
the nebulae which give a gaseous spectrum are systems possessing a
structure and a purpose in relation to the universe, altogether dis-
                      * '

1889.]             On the Spectra    of  Meteor-swarms.                 381
 tinct and of another order from the great group of cosmical bodies to
 which our sun and the fixed stars belong."
    With regard to the most generally accepted classification of stars,
that of Vogel, Duner (" fitoiles a Spectres de la 3me Classe ") writes,
 " Selon la theorie il faudra
                                 que tot on tard toutes les etoiles de la
 premiere classe deviennent de la seconde, et celles-ci de la troisieme."
    Vogel, and before him, others, working on the assumption that all
 the heavenly bodies were reducing their temperature, practically
 included all stars between the hottest and the coldest in one class
 (Class Ila of Vogel).
    In previous papers to the Royal Society I have adduced evidence to
 show that all cosmical bodies are or have been meteor-swarms, that
at the present time some are increasing and some are reducing their
 temperature.    Thus, in the Bakerian Lecture, 1888, I demonstrated
 that nebulre and stars of Group    II (Class Ilia) are still increasing in
 temperature by the condensation due to gravity, and that the red
 stars of Group VI (Class III6) are at a nearly equal mean tempera
ture to stars of Group IT, but are cooling bodies.
    In these extreme cases the differentiation between the two groups
was comparatively easy.      In the case of those stars which are a little
less hot than the hottest, whether they are getting hotter or cooler,
the spectral difference cannot nearly be so well marked, as both
classes will have line spectra; but it was essential to my hypothesis
that these bodies should be resolvable into two groups, one increasing
and one decreasing in temperature, with spectra proper to each.
    The object of the present paper is to set forth the evidence which
 shows that this differentiation is possible, and to suggest the lines
 along which future researches on the subject might follow.
    In this paper, which is only to be regarded as preliminary, I pur
 pose to state the information already obtained with respect to
 Group III, and its relation to the two groups which bound it, in
order that the validity of the distinction that      I have drawn may be
further tested.     At present the observations are not sufficiently
detailed to enable a classification into species to be made, as was done
for Group II, so that we have to be contented with a general state
ment of the sequence of phenomena in passing from the early to the
later stages of the group.
    The observations lay no claim to great accuracy ; only small disper
0ion has been employed, and only a reconnaissance has been attempted.
The general method has been first to observe the differences between
0tars like Capella, which mostly resemble the sun, and those like
a. Cygni and a Tauri, which show marked variations. In this way
the criteria which are hereafter enlarged upon were determined.
    Particular attention was directed to the manner in which the
{lutings which form the special characteristic of Group       II died out in
                                                               2  C 2

 passing from Gronp        II to Group    III  ; and what other phenomena
 accompanied the transition, and what were the special phenomena
 which accompanied the gradual distension of the hydrogen lines in
 passing to Group IV.        There has not been a sufficient number of fine
 nights since the work commenced to enable this to be done com-
 pletely.
                     IL  General Statement of Conditions.
    A   general statement of the conditions of the problem was given in
 the Bakerian Lecture (p. 26) ; and      I  here reproduce the greater part
           I
 of what then wrote on the subject.
    " The passage from the second group to the third brings us to those
 bodies which are increasing their temperature, in which carbon radia
 tion and fluting absorption have given place to line absorption. At
 present the data already accumulated by other observers have not
 been discussed in such a way as to enable us to state very definitely
 the exact retreat of the absorption — by which I mean the exact order
in which the absorption lines fade out from the first members to the
last in the group. We know generally that the earlier bodies will
contain the line absorption of those substances of which we get a
paramount fluting absorption in the prior group.              We also know
generally that the absorption of hydrogen will increase while the
other diminishes.
    " The next group — the Fourth — brings us to the stage of
                                                                       highest
temperature,    to stars like a Lyrte,  and  the division between this gronp
and the prior one must be more or less arbitrary, and cannot at present
be defined.     One thing, however, is quite clear, that no celestial body
without all the ultra-violet lines of hydrogen discovered by Dr.
Huggins can claim to belong to it.
    " We have now arrived at the culminating point of temperature,
and next pass to the descending arm of the curve.           The Fifth Gronp,
therefore, will contain those bodies in which the hydrogen lines begin
to decrease in intensity, and other absorptions to take place in conse
quence of reduction of temperature.
    " It seems fair to assume that
                                       physical and chemical combinations
will now have an opportunity of taking place, thereby changing the
constituents of the atmosphere; that at first, with every decrease of
temperature and increase in the absorption, lines may be expected,
but it will be unlikely that the coolest bodies in this group will
resemble the coolest bodies in Group III.
   " Up to the present time observers have not recognised the import
ance of these considerations,     and since only one line of temperature,
and that a descending      one, has been considered, no efforts have been
made to establish the necessary criteria between Groups         III and V."
   It follows from the above that criteria are only possible        from   the

 fact that on the ascending side of the curve the varying volatilities of
 the meteoritic constituents of the swarms brought out by successively
 higher temperatures are in question, whilst on the descending side of
 the curve we have to deal with successive chemical combinations,
 brought about by a fall of temperature in a gaseous mass.
 III.  Relation   between   the  Early Species of Group      III and the Later
                               Species of Group    II.
     Since bodies of Group     III  are produced by the further condensation
                                          I
 of the condensing swarms which have included in Group II, there
 must be a close relation between the earlier species of Group         III and
 the later species of Group        II ; that is, if there be anything like the
 continuity which my hypothesis demands.               We know, for instance,
 that in the later species of Group II, there are flutings both dark and
 bright, and dark lines, amongst the latter being b, D, and E. As the
 lines are produced, so to speak, at the expense of the flutings, we
 should expect to find that lines of magnesium, sodium, manganese,
 and iron are the most prominent, especially in the earlier species of
 Group III. In a Orionis we have associated with the metallic flutings
the lines 6 and D, and both are well developed, E is also present, but
it is not nearly so strong as b or D. The F line of hydrogen is shown
as a thin line in a photograph of the spectrum taken by Professor
 Pickering, although, as far as         I  know, it had not been previously
recorded. With an increase in temperature, a condensing swarm
lik9 a Orionis would give a spectrum without flutings ; the magne
sium flutings would be replaced by b, and the iron fluting would be
 replaced by iron lines, of which E and the line at 579 would be the
most prominent. F is absent in most of the stars of Group II,
because the radiation of hydrogen from the interspaces is just suffi
cient to balance the absorption; but in bodies of Group III, the
interspacial radiation will have almost disappeared, and absorption
will be predominant. We shall thus have F appearing thin in the
early stages of Group III, and gradually thickening until it becomes
as thick as in a Lyrae.
    In the earliest stages of Group      III we should therefore expect to find
 F and E thin and b and D thick. As yet we have no evidence as to
the first appearances of dark b and D in Group II, but future obser
vations made with special reference to this point will at once indicate
in what species they first make their appearance as absorption lines.
    With the next increase of temperature F and E will thicken, but b
and D will show no marked difference.            With a further increase b and
D will lose their supremacy, and will be only of about the same thick
ness as F and E, because most of the magnesium and sodium would
 have been driven out with the first rise in temperature. Afterwards
 all the lines, except those of hydrogen, will gradually thin out on

account of the increased temperature.     Finally, the 8pectrum will be
of the type represented by   a Lyra.
   The question here arises, where are we to draw the line between
Group       II
            and Group       ? IIIIf my definition of Group-       as the     II
" mixed fluting " group be accepted, we must obviously draw the line
at the stage where carbon radiation disappears.      The iron fluting at
615 remains for a considerable time after this happens, so that the
earliest species of Group            III
                                   will be marked by the absorption
fluting of iron in addition to the characteristic line absorption. This
being the case, observations show that Aldebaran is a good example
of an early stage.
      IV.   The Relations of the Later Species        of Group       III to Stars of
                                  Group IV.
    The spectrum characteristic of Group IV is that of excessive
hydrogen absorption, with other lines exceedingly faint. In passing
from Group        III
                    to Group IV, therefore, the hydrogen lines must
thicken whilst the metallic lines thin. In a letter to M. Dumas in
1872 I suggested that possibly the simplification of the spectrum of
a star might be associated with the highest temperature of the vapour,
and that idea seems to have been accepted by other investigators
since that time.     It is now generally accepted that stars with thick
hydrogen lines (Group IV) are the hottest stars.
    The reason why we have hydrogen absorption in such great excess,
is,
 I     have little doubt, that most other substances have been dis
sociated by the intense heat resulting from the condensation of the
meteoric swarm.      We are, in fact, driven to this conclusion, because
the hydrogen which was originally occluded by the meteorites must
 have been driven off long before this temperature was reached.
    In passing from star like « Tauri to one like a Lyra2, the metallic
                          a
 lines would thin and disappear in some order determined by their dis-
 sociability or some other quality. The later stars of Group          are         III
 therefore very closely related to stars of Group IV, and the division
 between the two must be more or less arbitrary.        For simplicity's
 sake,I   have taken Group IV as the point of maximum temperature.
       V. The Observations having reference           to   Specific Differences   in
                                       Group   III.
  The observations have been made at the Astronomical Laboratory
at South Kensington by Mr. Fowi9r, assisted by Messrs. Baxandall
and Coppen (with the 10-inch equatorial and star spectroscope by
Hilger) in connexion with my own observations at Westgate (made
with a 12-inch mirror, kindly lent to me by Mr. Common, and a small
Maclean spectroscopic eyepiece).             All   measurements        and comparisons
suggested        by   my own observations      were made       by   my assistants, as at

 1889.]                  On the Spectra      of Meteor-swarms.                         385
present I have no means of doing this myself.   The stars selected for
observation were a few of the brightest hitherto known as belonging
to Class     Ila of   Vogel's classification.     A   few stars more advanced than
the    Ila   stars and a few less advanced were also observed in order that
the passage    from one group to the other might be determined.
    The main points to which attention was directed were (1) the
 relative intensities of F, b, E, D, both in the same star and from star
 to star ; (2) the lines which appear to be special to one group or the
 other   (III or V).
    The importance of observing the thickness of F in the spectrum of
a star, as compared with its thickness in other stars, is obvious, for it
at ouce enables us to fix the position of the star on the temperature
curve immediately we have determined whether its temperature is
increasing or decreasing.
    Details of the observations of the thirteen stars which appear to be
on the ascending side of the temperature curve are given below.       One
of these is a Group IV star, and one is a swarm of the last species of
Group II. The remainder belong to Group III.
   The stars are arranged in order of temperature, beginning with the
lowest, as far as the observations enable us to do this.       In general,
the observations have been limited to the region of the spectrum
lying between F and the iron fluting in the red at wave-length 615.
   The wave-lengths of the lines and flutings were determined by
direct comparison with the electric spark, and with the lines and
flutings seen when the various substances are volatilised in the
Bunscn burner.        On one or two occasions, comparisons were also
made with the spectrum of the Moon.
   a. Ceti. — F is fairly well seen, but it is not nearly so thick as 6 or
D, and not quite as thick as E.         D is pretty thick and lies in the
Mn (2) fluting (586). b is also thick.         The trio of lines* in the
green    is  present, the   most refrangible member   being the darkest.
Lines are present at about 579 aud 508 5, the former being the stronger.
Lines at 499 and 552 rather thin. The absorption Fe (1) fluting at
615 and Mn (2) are both present, but far less intense than in Mira
Ceti. The flutings Mn (1) 558 and Pb (1) 546, are also both feebly
visible. The brightest fluting of carbon at 517 is just perceptible.
This is therefore a very late star of Group II. It                is,
                                                         in fact, the most
advanced Group           II
                        star of which observations have at present been
made.

fluting at 615 is present, and is a little stronger than in Aldebaran. This
and the relative thickness of F lead to the conclusion that the star
falls between a Ceti and Aldebaran.           Carbon 517 has disappeared.
     a Tauri. —  F, E, and 499 are all about the same intensity, but none
of them are so strong as b or D. The trio is present, E being a little
thicker than the second and third members.            All three are seen to be
double when a high power eyepiece is employed.                579 is nearly as
thick as E and is stronger than 568. Groups of lines near 546 and
558 are fairly strong. 552 is also well seen.           The Fe (1) fluting in
the red (615) appears rather weak, and a pretty strong line runs
through it near the most refrangible edge. There is also a line
between 6 and 499, another between E and 5327, and many others.
The Mn (2) (586) fluting is possibly visible at times.

strongest line in the spectrum and b comes next.             579 and 568 are
both about the same intensity as E ; so is 540, whilst tho remaining
member of the trio is rather weaker.          The lines near 546 and 558 are
fairly strong,    as is also 499.    The iron  band in the red is absent.

a Cygni.       The trio is complete, all the three lines being very well
seen.     b is the strongest line in the spectrum and D is the next.       568
is present, but weaker than 579. The lines near 546 and 558 are
also certainly present. The line at 499 is about as thick as E. 552 is
present.
    e  Pega-i. — F is about as strong as in « Aqnarii ; D and 6 are about
equal and as strong as F. 579 is stronger than 568 but is not quite
bo strong as D.       E and 540 are not nearly as strong as 579 ; the other
member of tho trio (5327) is very distinct. 499 and the lines near 546
and 568 are all fairly strong.        552 is also present.
    a Aqnarii.   — F and 6 seem about equal in intensity in the spectrum
 of this star. D is not quite so strong as 6, but is a little stronger
 than E ; the other two lines of the trio are rather faint.       579 is about
 as   strong, or perhaps stronger, than E. 568 is much weaker than
 579.    499 is a fairly strong line. The lines near 546 and 558 are well
visible.

 about as strong as E, but the latter is barely visible.           499 and the
faint lines near 546 and 558 are present ; also an important line less
 refrangible than U, which was found by comparison with the electric
 spark to be near 598.       Another fainter line was seen near 612.

little fainter than b, but stronger than the other members of the trio.
579 and 568 are seen, the former being much the stronger; it is

much stronger than 568. 499 is faint but certainly present.             The
lines near 546 and 558 are also present.

G are thicker than in 7 Cygni, and therefore thicker than b or E,
whilst E is thicker than the other members of the trio. 579 is a
little stronger than 568. 499 and the lines near 546 and 558 are
about equal, but very faint.

               — All lines faint with the exception of those of hydrogen.
F and G both thick, b, D, and E are about equal in intensity. The
remaining two members of the trio are also as thick as E. 579 is
present, but 568 could not be seen.       There is also a line near G, about
450; it is seen in the Henry Draper Memorial photograph of the
spectrum of this star as a double, but it could not be resolved with
the power used.
     a Aquilce. — All lines very faint except those of hydrogen.      F and
G very thick. 6, D, and E very faint but about equal in intensity.
579 is not quite so strong as D. 499 is fairly well seen, as are also the
two lines near 546 and 558.
     a Lyrce.— All the lines except those of hydrogen are exceedingly
faint.     F is very strong but G is not quite so thick. 6 and D are fine
lines, and about equal in intensity. The trio is undoubtedly present
 as also the lines near 546, 558, and 579.
     The results of the observations which have been referred         to are
 embodied      in fig.  1.  The star at the lowest temperature is on the
 lowest horizon, and the one at the highest temperature is on the top
 horizon. The thicknesses of the lines have been greatly exaggerated
 in the diagram, in order to render the variations more obvious.

                                      Observations.
   The general conclusion to be drawn from the observations is that
there are several lines in the spectra of stars on the ascending side of
the temperature curve, which do not occur in stars with a spectrum
resembling that of the Sun, which must lie on the descending side of
the curve, as we know it to be cooling.
    Some lines, such as F, 6, D, and E, are common to both sides of the
curve, though the relative intensities are slightly different.
    The principal criterion in the visible part of the spectrum is the
double line about wave-length 540, which, with the two iron lines
E (5268) and 5327, forms the trio referred to in the observations.
Each member of the trio is seen to be double when a high power is
used.     These three equidistant lines, which are of nearly equal inten
sities, are well seen in Aldebaran and several other stars, but are not
soen as such in either Arcturus or Capella.
    Tn Arcturns and Capella, as in the Sun, there is a double line
(5403, 5404'9) which makes an almost equidistant trio when com
bined with E and 5327. Direot comparison with Group                           III  stars,
however, shows that the lines are not coincident.                     On one or two
occasions the spectra of some stars of Group                 III were compared with
the spectrum of the Moon ; in the absence of the Moon, compari
son was made with Arcturus or Capella.                        A comparison of the
Group     III   line with the Mn line at 540 referred to in previous papers
nhows a perfect coincidence with the dispersion employed ; and since
both are double we are driven to the conclusion that the 540 line
in stars of Group         III  is due to manganese.            Again, the double in
Group     V   is  considerably    weaker   than    E,    whereas   that in Group      III

 390                       Mr. J. N. Lockyer.                    [Feb. 28,
is very nearly as strong as E. The appearance presented to the eye
by the real trio in stars of Group      III  is accordingly very different
from that presented by the three lines in stars of Group V-.
   Besides the least refrangible member of the trio there are other
lines which are special to Group III.       One of these lies between F
and 6, at wave-length 499, as nearly as can be determined with small
dispersion. In some of the stars this line is very strong. It is only
seen as a very faint line in Capella, Arcturns, or the Sun, and is con
sequently an important criterion.      The nearest line of anything like
equal importance in Group V stars is the iron line at 495-7.
   Two lines, at 579 and 568 respectively, also appear to be special to
Group III. No lines of similar intensities are seen in either Capella,
Arcturns, or the Sun in those positions, although fainter lines are
seen.
   In Rowland's photographic      map of the solar spectrum there is a
line at 5659 which is much stronger than the one nearest to 568, and
this is not seen at all in Group   III  stars.    Only a very faint line is
indicated in the same map at 5791, there being a stronger line at
5763 which is not seen in Group    III  stars.    The two lines at 568 and
579 are, therefore, special to Group III. The line at 579 was com
pared directly with the low temperature         iron line at 579, and the
coincidence established with the dispersion employed ; this may,
therefore, be taken as due to iron. It may also be suggested that the
line at 568 is the double green line of sodium, which appears bright
in some of the bodies of Group I. Other lines referred to in the
observations are near 546 and 558, but it is not easy to distinguish
these from lines seen in stars of Group V.        There are several strong
lines seen in the solar spectrum in the neighbourhood of 546, and
there are also strong lines at 5573 and 5587.       In order to determine
whether these lines will serve as criteria or not, further inquiry with
greater dispersion  will be necessary.
   The magnesium line 5527 appears to be common to both Groups
III and  V, just as 6 is common to both.
   There seems to be no doubt, therefore, that criteria between Groups
III  and V have been determined by the observations, and we are now
in a position to assign the stars of Vogel's Class 11a to one group or
the other according as the lines which have been shown to be special
to Group   III are present or absent.
   One of the chief objects I have had in view in writing this paper is
to enable others to take up this important piece of work as soon as
possible when once the idea of increasing and decreasing temperatures
is generally  accepted.

                                           VII.    Tests.
   We have an important test of the accuracy of the preceding observa
tions in tracing the continuity of the lines in passing from the earlier
to the later species of the group. In the map which accompanies this
paper, the stars have been arranged in order of temperatures by
reference to the thickness of F, it being universally agreed that those
stars in which the hydrogen lines are thickest are the hottest.          With
the stars in this order we ought to find that if a line be visible in any
two of the stars, it is also visible in any other star of the group in
which F is of an intermediate thickness. On first arranging the
stars in this way, it was found that there were here and there breaks
in the continuity of the lines, but further observations, made with
special reference to the breaks, showed that the discontinuity was due
to the incompleteness of the first sets of observations.           The only
break now shown on the map is the apparent absence of Mg 5527 in
X Ophiuchi, and this was not discovered before the star had got too far
to the west to be re-observed.
   We have another test in tracing the variations in the intensities of
the various lines in passing through the series. Assuming that a
 sufficient number of stars have been taken, there ought to be no
 abrupt change in the thickness of a line in passing from star to star.
The temperature at which a line is at its maximum thickness will
depend on the volatility of the substance which produces              so that
                                                                          it,
all the lines need not necessarily have their greatest thicknesses in the
same star.       The continuity as regards the intensities of the lines          is
quite as perfect as could be expected from a preliminary survey.

646 and 558 have their greatest thickness in the earliest stage of the
group, gradually thinning out towards the last.         The remnant of the

as regards the intensities of the lines and the presence in each star of
the lines necessary for perfect continuity.
                  VIII.  Sequence    of Spectra in Group III.
    The general sequence of spectra in passing from the earlier to the
later species of Group     III is as follows, as far as the observations have
at present gone : —
    (1.) The hydrogen lines are thin. D is thicker than b. The iron
fluting is faint. 499, E, 5327, 540, 568, and 579 are thin. 546 and
558 are fairly thick.
    (2.) The hydrogen lines are thicker. F, D, and b are equally thick.
E, 5327, 540, 579, and 499 are much thicker, being nearly as strong
as F.     The iron fluting has gone.
    (3.) The hydrogen lines are very much thicker than the other lines.
D and 6 are equally thick. E is nearly as strong as b, while the other
lines are fainter.
     (4.) The hydrogen lines are very broad, while all the remaining
lines are exceedingly faint.
    Subsequent work will no doubt enable us to further divide these
sub-groups into finer species.
II. "On      the Magnetic Action          of Displacement- currents in a
        Dielectric." By Silvanus P. THOMPSON, D.Sc., B.A. Com
        municated by Professor G. Cabey Fosteb, F.R.S. Received
        February 19, 1889.
                                   (Abstract.)
    According to Maxwell's well-known views of electrostatic action,
 the variations of electric displacement which occur during the charge
 or discharge of a dielectric are to be regarded as equivalent to electric
 currents. No direct experimental proof of this point has hitherto
been forthcoming. The author having calculated out on the assump
 tion of the equivalence between displacement-currents and conduction-
 currents, what the effect would be of the charge or discharge of a
 condenser upon a delicately astatised needle placed near the edge of
 the condenser, concludes that the effects would be too delicate to be
 measurable.     He therefore resorted to a different method based upon
 the principle that, if a closed curve be drawn around the flux of
 electrostatic displacement, the line-integral of the magnetising force,
 reckoned once round this closed curve, will at any instant be a
 measure of the rate of change in the electric displacement through
 the curve.     Two forms of apparatus for realising this in an experi

mental way were constructed.       In the more satisfactory form of the
apparatus an iron annnlus surrounded by a coil of fine silk-covered
copper wire is embedded in a layer of paraffin wax between two glass
plates, and pieces of tinfoil are affixed on the outside surfaces of the
plates to serve as the coatings of a condenser.    The electric displace
ment passes through the aperture of the iron annnlus.        Any changes
in that displacement set up magnetic forces acting round the iron
annulus, which, thereby, is subjected to a varying magnetisation.      The
annnlus in turn sets up induction currents in the copper wire that
surrounds it, these induction currents bein^ received and rendered
audible in an ordinary telephone receiver. The condenser is connected
to a Ruhmkorff coil which rapidly charges and discharges it. The
sounds heard in the telephone receiver establish the reality of the
magnetic action of the variations in the electric displacement.
   The author points out that this device, which may be regarded as
a new kind of proof piano for exploring varying electrostatic fields, is
probably capable of other useful applications, such as the investiga
tion of specific inductive capacities.

 long time, as in the case which forms the subject of the present
 investigation, or the limit may be reached so rapidly that the change
  seems instantaneous.      This difference, however, is one of degree and
  not of kind. In the present case the masses of the substances mixed
  together were so large relatively to the masses undergoing change
  during the time over which the observations extended, that the masses
  of reacting substances were practically constant. Thus it happens
  that each set of observations was of a change proceeding with
  constant velocity. In the second reaction studied by Messrs. Harcourt
  and Esson —
                           H302 + 2HI = 2H20 + I2.
  the amount of change occurring daring each interval of time in
   which it was estimated was a considerable fraction of the total
   amount of potential change, as limited by the amount of hydrogen
   dioxide taken.    In this case, therefore, the observed intervals of time
   lengthened, being the time required for the performance        of the  same
   amount of chemical work with a continually diminishing          amount of
   active substance.

       An Investigation of   a Case   of gradual Chemical   Change.    397
    The measurement of these intervals of time (whether constant
 or increasing) during which the same amount of chemical decom
 position takes place, can he effected by taking advantage of a com
 paratively instantaneous change which may be made to go on in the
 same liquid, and one which is very familiar.
    When iodine is produced in a liquid by the action of hydrogen
 dioxide, or some other oxidising agent, on hydrogen iodide, the action
 is a gradual one, but the introduction of a drop of a concentrated
 solution of sodium thiosulphate at once converts the iodine into
 sodium iodide, and every molecule of iodine produced in the liquid
after the introduction of the drop will be instantly thus converted
 until the thiosulphate present is exhausted.       If a small quantity of
 starch is present in the solution, the moment at which the last trace
 of thiosulphate disappears will be signalised by the appearance of a
 blue colour in the liquid, the effect of the free iodine upon the starch.
 Thus, then, by the introduction of constant measured quantities of
 sodium thiosulphate, the rate of progress of the action between
 potassium or hydrogen iodide and some oxidising substance may be
 readily measured.     This is the principle and method of division into
 intervals in Messrs. Harcourt and Esson's classical research, and we
 have adopted it for the investigation of a similar case of chemical
change.
    The reaction chosen for investigation in the present case was one
 which liberated iodine indirectly.        When solutions of potassium
 chlorate and hydrogen chloride are mixed together, the mixture soon
 acquires a chlorous smell, and at once liberates iodine from potassium
 iodide, and as time goes on continues to liberate more. The exact
 nature of the primary reaction, producing the oxidising agent, has
 not been ascertained, nor whether the product is chlorine, some oxide
of chlorine, or a mixture of both. Various reactions are possible.
The one fact which is certain seems to be that in presence of an
iodide each molecule of chlorate salt is roduced to the corresponding
chloride entirely and without intermediate stages, and the equivalent
in iodine of all three atoms of oxygen set free. If it were the case
that the decomposition of the chlorate molecule took place in stages
there would be observed a considerable variation in the intervals
depending on the amount of intermediate products present, which
was not the case.
    A mixture of hydrogen chlorate and hydrogen chloride, both
dilute, reacts exactly in the same way as the mixture above, slowly
producing oxidising material which liberates iodine from potassium
iodide.    It is probably a reaction common to most solnble chlorates.
Part of the investigation has been concerned with such mixtures of
the two acids without any metallic salt. These have advantages, as
the reaction is not complicated by the presence of such salts. But

398          Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
potassium chlorate was more often employed, being easily obtained
and kept in a state of purity.
   Bunsen gives the following hypothetical equations for a reaction
between hydrogen chloride and any chlorate (the equations are given
with hydrogen chlorate, for simplicity).         But in these the number of
molecules of chlorate reacting is arbitrarily limited to two. Without
this limitation, it is obvious that the list of possible reactions may be
indefinitely extended.

          1:5                2HCIO3 + IOHCI =      6C12  +63^0.
    In our  experiments    the quantity of reacting substances was always
such that, except for     chaDge in sodium thiosulphate, the composition
of the mixture was sensibly the same at the end of the experiment
as at the beginning. Each experiment was not carried to any definite
limit, but was concluded as soon as the constant velocity of change in
the mixture had been ascertained by the observation of several
intervals corresponding to successive additions of thiosulphate.
    The following considerations show the constancy of the composition
of the mixture throughout an experiment.                  Each drop of thio
sulphate corresponded, on an average, to the decomposition of three-
millionths of a gram of potassium chlorate in each cubic centimetre
of the mixture. Now, the smallest amount of potassium chlorate
ever used was O01263 gram in each cubic centimetre, and of this
only 0-000003 gram would have disappeared when as many as
 10 drops of sodium          thiosulphate had been added.           This is an
 alteration of about O02 per cent. Or, to state it otherwise, in the
 case of one of the greatest velocities observed, when each interval
 was hardly greater than a minute, there was 0-03788 gram potassium
 chlorate in each cubic centimetre, and this was disappearing at the
 rate of 1*826-millionths of a gram per minute.             Speaking roughly,
 it would take about 24 hours, proceeding at             this  rate, to cause a
 difference of   I  per cent. in the amount of salt present.
     Messrs. Harcourt and Esson represented             the variation of the
 intervals they    observed   with  the  mass   present,   y, as a logarithmic
 curve with asymptote meeting it when y                =   00.    The constant
 intervals obtained    in the  present  investigation   would    be  represented
 in a portion of the curve produced to a great distance in the direction
of the asymptote, this portion being sensibly a straight line parallel
to the asymptote, so that the time observed for each interval is
 constant.

      An Investigation of   a Case  of gradual Chemical    Clianye.  399
   In our ordinary    mode of working the reaction batween chlorate
and chloride occurred in presence of iodide.       In or ler to examine
the reaction when only chlorate and chloride were present and the
products of their reaction were not at once reduced, and thus
removed, the following experiments were made.          Through a vessel
containing a mixture of hydrogen chloride and potassium chlorate,
kept at a constant temperature of 30°, a certain volume of air could
be drawn at a fixed rate.    The air, thus charged with a part of what
ever gas was liberated in the mixture, was drawn through a series of
washing-tubes containing potassium iodide.         The liberated iodine
was determined at the end of equal intervals of time.       It was found
that comparatively little oxidising gas was evolved.      At the end of
20 hours the amount of gas dissolved in the mixture, capable of
liberating iodine, was determined, and this quantity also was found
to be very small.    The remarkable diminution in the rate of forma
tion of oxidising substance when no iodide was present will be
evident when it is stated that whereas, in the presence of iodide, the
change proceeded at such a rate that in 20 hours the amount of
iodine set free would have corresponded to 6700 c.c. of the standard
thiosulphate, the oxidising material formed in absence of an iodide
only  set free iodine corresponding to 100 c.c. thiosulphate.
   The action was also found to be reversible in sunlight. Some of
the mixture of potassium chlorate and hydrogen chloride, which had
acquired a deep yellow colour, was exposed for a short time to bright
sunlight ; the solution became colourless, and was found to liberate
no iodine.    In our experiments, in presence of an iodide, we found
sunlight to have no effect upon the rate of change.
   It would thus appear that when the oxidising substance is produced
in presence of an iodide it does its oxidising work at once and is re
moved, and the change proceeds uniformly.          In the absence of an
iodide, however, the oxidising substance accumulates in the liquid,
and its further production is impeded probably by the occurrence of a
reverse action.
   Though the potassium iodide appears thus to be a necessary ingre
dient of the mixture if the change is to proceed at a uniform rate, it
does not take part in the primary reaction ; for otherwise variation in
the amount of potassium iodide in the mixture, other things being
unaltered, would produce very marked differences in the rate. That
this is not the case was proved by an experiment, the results of which
are shown in the following table : —

                    L 0-02496 gram hydrogen chloride.
   The potassium iodide present during successive intensities was
n X 0-000001978 gram, and n varied from 1 to 12.
   It will be noticed that there is at first a slight acceleration with
increase of potassium iodide, but very far from proportional to the
increase, as would be the case if the reaction depended primarily on
the amount of iodide present. After n = 5 the further multiplication
of the small quantity produced little if any change in the rate. Per
haps the minute amount of iodide present during the first few obser
vations was insufficient for the immediate amount of the chlorine and
 chlorous oxides formed.
    In fact the above numbers, besides showing that the liberation of
iodine is a separate reaction, not the primary one, seem also to indi
 cate that though with the quantity of potassium iodide usually taken
 this secondary reaction is instantaneous compared with the primary
 one, if the quantity is much decreased the former does take up a
 time which is comparable with that of the latter, and so may produce
 an appreciable retardation.
    We shall return to the consideration of variation of potassium
 iodide later on, but have pointed this out to emphasise further the
 observation already made, that time must be a factor in all changes,
 but in very few does the connexion come within our powers of obser
 vation, so that other changes compared with these few are called
 instantaneous.
    The amount of potassium iodide generally used in our experiments
 corresponds to n = 60 in this series.      In other sets of observations
 some of which are recorded in Tables XI, XII, and XIII, p. 417 — 419,
 the effect of adding larger amounts of potassium iodide was tried. The

 effect is to produce a slight addition to the rate, proportional to the
amount of iodide added. A similar result has been obtained with
 potassium chloride, and in view of these results we conclude that
 potassium    iodide acts only as an indifferent salt, and does not imme
 diately promote the reduction of the potassium chlorate, but only
 serves to prevent the accumulation in the liquid of chlorine or chlo
 rine oxides precisely as the presence of thiosulphate serves to prevent
 the accumulation of iodine.
                                   Fig. 1.
    The apparatus employed in all our experiments was the same as
that used by Messrs. Harcourt and Esson, and consisted of a cylinder
of white glass 310 mm. high and 64 mm. in diameter; at a distance
of 213 mm. from the base a fine line was etched round the cylinder
marking a volume of 792 c.c. The cylinder was closed with an india-
rubber stopper perforated with three openings, through which passed
a thermometer and an inverted funnel tube. The third hole was
ordinarily closed with a cork, and served to give access to the con
tents of the cylinder. The inverted funnel tube was connected with
an apparatus for the generation of carbon dioxide.
    The method of proceeding was as follows : — Into the cylinder pre
viously filled with carbon dioxide was brought the weighed quantity
of potassium chlorate to be employed, with sufficient water to dissolve
it. To this was added a measured volume of hydrogen chloride of

  known strength, together with 10 c.c. of potassium iodide solution
  containing Ol gram of the salt and 10 c.c. of clear starch solution,
  raixtnre being rapidly made after each addition by the passage
  of large bubbles of carbon dioxide from the inverted funnel.
  These bubbles of gas, with a diameter equal to half that of the
  cylinder, served to stir the liquid and also to exclude the air. A
  few drops of a dilute solution of thiosulphate were added to keep
  down the blue colour till all was prepared for observation.      There
  was a line scratched on the funnel stem, and this mark and one of the
 graduations of the thermometer were made to coincide with the plane
  of the line round the cylinder. The temperature of the liquid was
  brought up to the required point, then the cylinder was placed on a
 levelling stand, and water was added till the lower surface of the
 meniscus just coincided with the plane of the marked line.       Mean
 while a number of small measures of a concentrated solution of sodium
 thiosulphate had been prepared.     These measures must be equal or
 have a known ratio to each other ; they must also be of small volume,
 in order that their addition may not materially affect the dilution of
 the liquid.   These measures were obtained in the following way : — A
 series of tubes about 8 inches long, having a lateral orifice about
 1£ inches from the end, such as would be made for the purpose of
joining on another tube at right angles, were mounted on a carriage,
each tube having a separate rest, and all the orifices being in one line.
 By the turn of a screw connected with a rack and pinion these tubes
could be brought exactly under a siphon delivering drops of thio
sulphate.     The siphon and its reservoirs stood on a bracket attached
to a pillar of solid masonry to prevent vibration.    The whole was en
closed in a glass case like that of a balance, the front of which was
shut down during the time of collection of the drops.          The time
of formation of a drop was generally about half a minute. The width
of the reservoir containing the thiosulphate is so great in com
parison with the quantity of solution taken for any one set of experi
ments that the available length of the siphon and the rate of flow,
upon whose constancy that of the drops depends, varies in no appre
ciable degree.     At the end of each experiment the value of the
drops employed was determined by means of a standard iodine
solution.
    When the observations were to be made the cylinder was placed
on a sheet of white paper in a good light, opposite a clock beating
seconds.     The paper lay on an iron plate, which could be heated at
once, and by a lamp if necessary, and thus the cylinder could be
kept at any desired temperature by moving it nearer to or further
from the heated end of the plate.     When once the most convenient
spot has been selected, a mere touch with the hand was all that was
required to maintain the temperature constant.

      An Investigation of    a Case  of gradual Chemical   Change.    403
   The observations were made by looking down on the column of
fluid and watching the appearance of the disk forming its upper sur
face.   As soon     as the   change   is  complete a  blue  shade  shoots
rapidly across the brightly illuminated disk, and there is no difficulty
in ascertaining the exact second of the change ; the observer listens
to the beat of the clock and counts the seconds whilst watching the
disk. As soon as the blue colonr has appeared, the minute and
second are noted, and a drop of thiosulphate is brought into the
cylinder.    The end of the tube charged with a drop is plunged
into the liquid through the opening for that purpose, and moved up
and down, active stirring being carried on by means of the bubbles of
carbon dioxide. The intervals date from one appearance of the colour
to the next reappearance, and as the rate is not affected by the presence
of a small amount of iodine or a small diminution in the amount of
iodide, it is clear that the fact of the addition and admixture of the
thiosulphate not following immediately upon the appearance of the
blue colour, does not disturb the uniformity of the rate of change.
    The potassium chlorate employed in our experiments was purified
by recrystallisation.
   The hydrogen chlorate was prepared by the cautious addition of
sulphuric acid to a solution of pure barium chlorate until no milki-
ness was produced either by further additions of hydrogen sulphate
or barium chlorate. The barium sulphate precipitate was then filtered
off.   The solution of hydrogen chlorate thus obtained contained no
chloride.
   The potassium iodide solution was prepared by dissolving 80 grams
of recrystallised and fused potassium iodide in 8 litres of water.
   The starch solution employed was prepared by adding a magma of
starch and water, containing about 5 grams of starch to about 300 c.c.
of boiling water, and allowing the whole to boil briskly for a few
minutes. When cool, the liquid was transferred to a cylinder and
covered over.     On standing, the upper part of the liquid become per
fectly clear ; of this 10 c.c. were taken by means of a pipette.
   The hydrogen chloride solution was prepared by diluting pure
acid till 100 c.c. contained 18-823 grams of hydrogen chloride.
   It may be of interest here to give the details of an actual experi
ment.
   Taken — 30 grams of potassium chlorate, 200 c.c. hydrochloric acid
(containing 18-823 grams hydrogen chloride in 100 c.c.), 10 c.c. of
a clear starch solution, and 10 c.c. of a solution of potassium
iodide (containing 0-01 gram potassium iodide per c.c.). A few drops
of a dilute solution of thiosulphate were added to discharge the
colour due to the iodine liberated before it was possible to com
mence observations.

examine the effect of variation of the former acid on the rate of
change ; we next consider the effect of variation in hydrogen chloride

sium chlorate.
   In this reaction we examine the effect on the rate of variation in
the amount of hydrogen chloride, the potassium chlorate being kept
constant.     We then briefly touch on the results obtained by varying
the potassium chlorate.
   We next consider the effect of variation in the amount of potas
sium iodide present, used as an indicator of the performance of a
definite amount of chemical work.
   We lastly discuss the effect of variation in the temperature at
which the reaction of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen chlorate takes
place.
                      Variation in Hydrogen Chlorate.
   A   series  of observations were made in which the quantity of
hydrogen    chlorate was varied in arithmetical progression, the hydrogen
 chloride being kept constant.          When each of the numbers repre
senting velocity   of decomposition was divided by a number represent
 ing the amount of hydrogen chlorate present, the series of numbers
 obtained was approximately an arithmetical progression, the differ
ence being a small one. So that if u represents the hydrogen
chlorate, R the rate of decomposition, a formula by which the latter
may be calculated from the former is of the form
                               R = tt(A+Bw),
 where A and B are constants.

   The connexion between the velocity of decomposition and the
amount of the decomposing substances present is of exactly the same
nature as that established in a similar way by Messrs. Harcourt and
Esson, viz., that the velocity varies in the first place directly with
the mass of the substance present, and that in the second place the
presence of the substance causes a slight acceleration in the rate
irrespective of its being decomposed.            It has already been con
clusively  shown  by their  work   and  that  of  other experimenters on the
same lines that the presence in the liquid of any substance which,
as far as is known, has no chemical action upon the essential in
gredients,   and may therefore        be considered        to remain inactive
during the change nevertheless has its specific effect, accelerating or
retarding upon the velocity of the change.            But Harcourt and Esson
pointed out that the decomposing substance itself likewise exercised
this secondary influence.      It does so in this case, and the second
term in the empirical formula represents this secondary effect.

                         Variation in Hydrogen Chloride.
    Having satisfactorily established the relation of the rate of change
 to the amount of one of the reacting snbstances, namely, hydrogen
 chlorate, we naturally sought to find the connexion between the
 rate and the amount of hydrogen chloride — the other reacting sub
 stance.    It might be expected that the effect of variation in the
hydrogen chloride would result in equations of the same form as
those given above.        Various series of observations were made to in
vestigate   this  point. The amount of acid was varied in arithmetical
progression, and the rates obtained were divided by the quantity of
acid present in each case to see if anything approaching an arithme
tical progression could be obtained.
    No such relation appears to exist, as is shown by the following
 example : —

    The first four or five numbers in the third column might perhaps
be brought      into an arithmetical progression without any serious
alteration, but taken as a whole, the series of experimental results
cannot be thus interpreted. It appears then that the effect of hydro
chloric acid is not, like that of chloric acid, of two kinds, viz., (1) a
primary one due to its being a decomposing substance, and (2) a
secondary one of the nature above described.              Yet it can hardly be
supposed     that  it   acts   merely  in   a  secondary way as a substance
present and not decomposed, for its effect is proportionally much
greater than that of chloric acid itself. Thus in the above series
when the quantity of acid is only a little more than doubled (v = 10

408          Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
and v   = 20) the rate in the second        case is abont twelve times that
in the former.
   We have however proved by trial that chloric acid of itself, with
out hydrochloric acid, when mixed in the cylinder with the other in
gredients, will evolve oxidising material. The rate is exceedingly
slow : —
                 HCl =    0.
              HC103 = 6 x 51-5.                Bate = 0 000000564.
              Temp. = 20°.
   It is possible that two reactions are going on at the same time, one
with chloric acid alone, the other substances preseut having merely
their specific effect, and also the action between chloric acid and
hydrochloric acid, both producing oxidising material.
   Now amongst the various attempts made to find empirically the
law of connexion between variation of hydrochloric acid and varia
tion of rate, one result arrived at was that second differences of the
rates are approximately constant.           Especially is this noticeable for
smaller quantities of acid.       The first differences thus resemble an
arithmetical progression. The next table consists of the same rates as
in Table IV, compared with a series of numbers obtained by recalcu
lation after substituting for the first differences of these a. true
arithmetical progression, being the one they most nearly approach.
The constant difference in this case would be 0-000095. Beginning
from v = 11, we get the following results : —

       An Investigation of a   Case of gradual Chemical    Change.     409
rapidly. Now if two reactions of the nature above described are
really taking place, it would lead us to conjecture a connexion
expressed by the following equation : —
                 R = ku(l+*u+pv) + k'uv(l     + a.'u+p'v),
u and v representing as usual the quantities of hydrogen chlorate and
hydrogen chloride present, the other letters constants.
    This expression is of the form
                             R = A+Bu + Cu2,
when v is the only variable, and a series of such rates for which v
 was varied in arithmetical progression would have its second
differences   constant.  Possibly the coefficient (3 is negative, i.e., the
 presence of hydrogen chloride interferes with and retards the     decom
 position of hydrogen chlorate by itself. This would explain      why, in
 the rates obtained with larger quantities of hydrogen chloride   (v  =  17
 to v = 20), the ordinary formula
                              R = k'v(l+p'v)
 more nearly expresses the results obtained ; the reason of this being
 that in the presence of a large quantity of this acid the other reaction
may be altogether stopped. All this, however, is conjectural. A
 second series obtained could not be brought into partial agreement
 with the formula above ; yet other mixtures of potassium chlorate
 and hydrogen chloride gave series of numbers of exactly the same
 character as this first one. These series we shall give later. The
 variation of the rate with the amount of hydrogen chloride present is
 evidently by no means a simple one. The interpretation of its com
 plications that we have suggested can scarcely be considered fully
 established.   It would, however, account for the facts observed.
     Since in the main reaction which we desired to study, viz., that
 between potassium chlorate and hydrogen chloride, there would be
 produced during the reaction some amount of potassium chloride by
 the decomposition of the chlorate, we determined the effect of the
 addition of potassium chloride to the mixture of the two acids,
 hydrogen chlorate and chloride.
     We have already referred to the fact that in gradual reactions, such
 as the present, substances which remain in the solution apparently
 unchanged throughout the whole reaction yet exercise their specific
 inflnence, accelerating or retarding, on the velocity of the change,
 hence it becomes important to ascertain the effect of the potassium
 chloride.    When the potassium chlorate and hydrogen chloride are
 mixed together, the latter being always in some excess, there is
 double decomposition, and potassium chloride and hydrogen chlorate

  410     .     Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
  are   formed.      If the action is a complete one, all the potassium
  chlorate will be converted into chloric acid and potassium chloride
  formed in corresponding amount.               There is a good deal of evidence
 in favour of the completeness of the decomposition in the cases we
 have investigated.         Indeed it is perhaps to be expected a priori that
 when a stronger acid, such as our hydrochloric, is in great excess, it
 might entirely turn the weaker acid out of combination. If this be
 the case, it follows that in this reaction also the reacting substances
 are, as before, chloric and hydrochloric acid, and that potassium
 chloride is present as a " neutral substance.

    The effect of potassium chloride in the mixture is thus an
accelerating one, and takes place in accordance with the formula
already mentioned, the rates increasing in arithmetical progression
approximately as the quantity of salt present is similarly increased.

formed to some extent as soon as the potassium chloride was added,

(6 x 51*5 millionth-gram-molecules) and hydrochloric acid (13 x 65-11)
supposing that complete double decomposition had taken place.             For
comparison, therefore, a mixture was made containing initially these
amounts of potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid with this
result : —
                          Rate obtained = 0-00337.
                          Rate in table = 0-00333.
This result might, of course, be taken merely to mean that the same
state of saline equilibrium had been attained in both cases, but it has
been already pointed out that the effect of progressive additions of
potassium chloride, giving a result expressible by a formula like the
above, is to show that it remains an unaltered substance in the
mixture.
    In the experiment detailed below, the salt was added to a mixture
made with potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid, and therefore it
is presumed that it contained already some potassium chloride,
obtained by saline decomposition.       The results then obtained were of
 the same nature as before : —

 It  will be seen that the salt added continnes to have its specific
 accelerative   effect, and  though at the end the whole quantity of
 potassium chloride present was 8x5- 15 millionth-gram-molecules,
 there is no sign whatever of the saline equilibrium being upset. The
 quantity of hydrochloric acid present is about double this (16 X 63- 11
  -2x51-5).
    In all these experiments, the highest precision in adding the
 potassium chloride was not possible, as it was necessary to add the
 solid salt to a liquid of standard volume, and a slight variation of the
 conditions of the experiment besides the one contemplated was thus
 inevitable.

412          Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
   Bat we think there can be no doubt of the truth of the important
conclusion we make from these experiments, that in all the mixtures
we have made with potassium chlorate and hydrogen chloride (the
molecular ratio varying from about 1 : 2 to 1 : 12) there is complete
and immediate donble decomposition, leaving in the mixture potassium
chloride, hydrogen chlorate, and excess of hydrogen chloride ; ^nd
that the reaction producing oxidising material takes place between
the two acids alone.
   For the facts are briefly these. Corresponding to each mixture
of potassium chlorate and hydrogen chloride, we may make a
mixture containing of hydrogen chlorate the amount corresponding
in molecular weight to the potassium chlorate, and of hydrogen
chloride the amount as before less the quantity required to decompose
the potassium chlorate.     Then the rate in this second mixture will be
a little slower than that in the first. If now the amount of potassium
chloride corresponding molecularly to the potassium chlorate be
taken, divided into a small number of equal quantities, and these
added separately to the second mixture, the rate will increase by an
equal quantity for each addition (as upon the introduction of any
neutral salt), until when all has been added the rate is approximately
the same as that of the first mixture.
   The following are further examples of the correspondence between
the two sorts of mixtures : —

       An Investigation of     a Case    of gradual Chemical          Change.    413
     We are now in a position to discuss the results obtained in the
 investigation which Mr. Harcourt originally proposed that we should
  make, viz., the action of hydrogen chloride on potassium chlorate.
     We shall first discuss the results obtained by varying the hydrogen
 chloride, keeping the potassium             chlorate fixed.        The hydrogen
 chloride varied from v = 20 to v = 10.              After the double decom
 position  mentioned,    the  amount   of  acid  present is v X 65"11 — u x 51'5.
 As u is constant, the acid varies in arithmetical progression.               In the
 following  table  u =  3, and  thus   corresponds   to   the chloric   acid results
 in Table IV as far as the amounts of acid go, and only differs from
 it in having present a certain quantity of potassium chloride.                It is,
 therefore, to be expected that the variation will be of the same
 nature, and this we find to be the case.

    By inspection it will thus    be seen    that the third column is not an
arithmetical progression.        If,  however, we treat the series in the
other way, we find the second differences of the rate to be approxi
mately constant.        Then substituting for the first differences the
nearest exact arithmetical progression and re-calculating the rates,
we get a series in which the calculated and observed numbers agree
fairly well between v = 16 and v = 10, just as in the corresponding
chloric acid series given in Table IV (b).

    The numbers here again coincide fairly well except for the highest
 values of v, and this is consistent      with the theory that the decom
 position of chloric acid by itself is checked when the quantity of
 hydrochloric acid is large, for here we have a larger quantity of
 chloric acid produced than we had before, and a larger amount of the
 hydrochloric acid is required before the decomposition of the chloric
 acid alone is checked by the latter.

       An Investigation of a   Case   of gradual Chemical     Change.    415
    We have obtained a series in which the amount of potassium chlo
 rate employed was as high as six units.         Here, as with the case of
 the corresponding quantity of chloric acid, no approach to an inter
 pretation could be attained.
    All these things show that the effect of varying hydrochloric acid
 with chloric acid or with potassium chlorate is the same, though of
 what exact nature that effect is, we have not yet fully determined.
 No doubt the rate obtained for the decomposition of chloric acid
 alone is too slow to account satisfactorily for the numbers not follow
 ing a law similar to that for variation in chloric acid first established.
    Series of experiments were made in which the amount of potassium
 chlorate used was alone varied, the hydrochloric acid being constant
 as regards the amount added each time.          It will be seen, however,
 from the potassium chloride results that we were not varying the
 potassium chlorate only in this case, but really were varying both
 this salt and the acid. For after saline decomposition —
                  HC103 per cent.    =ttx   51-5.
                  HCl                =  vx 65-11  -mx   51-5.
 The variation of rates in these series, therefore, must follow a very
 complicated law. We have, however, drawn a series of curves, re
 presenting the variation of rate in this part of the investigation (p. 416).
  - The curves are thus drawn : —
  , A series of
                 equidistant base lines (marked by broken lines) are
 taken, one base line corresponding to each quantity of hydrogen
chloride used, and therefore marked at the extremity with a number
representing that quantity.
    Along these base lines are marked off lengths corresponding to the
quantities of potassium chlorate taken, and then lengths representing
the rates are measured perpendicular to these. The distance between
two blue lines represents —
   0 00018  (6HCI + 6KI + KCIO3 = 7KC1 + 3H20 + 3I2) in millionth-
                                   grams.
    The lower curves cross the base lines above them, but this does not
interfere with their comparison with the others.
    It is worth observing, however, that in nearly all the cases tried,
K/w decreased instead of increasing with u, after u = 4 or after u = 5 ;
owing of course to the fact that the amount of hydrochloric acid is
decreasing as u increases.    In fact it may be inferred that dRjdu has
a root between 4 and 6.
    We now turn our attention to the behaviour of another constituent
of our mixture, viz., potassium iodide. We spoke of the part it
played in our experiments in the introduction to oar paper, but now
                                                               2 E 2

416 Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
       An Investigation of   a  Case  of gradual Chemical Change.          417
we come to consider more particularly its action and the effect of its
variation on the rate of decomposition.
                     Variations in Potassium       Iodide.
   It has been already pointed ont that      it is essential to the uniformity
of the rate of change that there should be potassium iodide present,
for in our preliminary experiments we showed that the reaction was
stopped if the oxdising material was allowed to accumulate in the
liquid instead of being removed by its reaction, with potassium iodide.
At the same time there is no evidence to prove that potassium iodide
takes part in the primary reaction.        If we examine a few cases in
which the amount of iodide was varied we shall soon see what sort
of influence it exercises.     The quantity used in all our experiments
was as a rule 0'76 millionth-gram-molecnle per c.c., a very small
quantity in proportion to the other ingredients.
   In the following table, in the initial experiment the amount used
was very much smaller, 0'00946 m.g.m., and similar quantities were
added one by one and their effect upon the rate ascertained.

The rate in the same mixture in the ordinary experiments when the
usual quantity (0-76 m.g.m.) of potassium iodide was introduced was
000554.
   It thus appears that when the quantity of the substance present
initially is very small, doubling the amount produces a marked in
crease of the rate, but after a certain amount has been added, further
small quantities produce no marked result. Such a series then does not
correspond to the ordinary form of variation with quantity of neutral
salt, but one would be led to infer that if we call 0'0054 the normal
rate we shall only get this rate when the amount of iodide present is
                                                                  2  it 3

 great enough, a retardation     following    any  diminution of the iodide
  beyond this minimum necessary, and our experiments fully bear this
 out.   The reason probably is that there is a tendency for molecules
 of oxidising material to begin to accumulate in the liquid if they do
 not immediately find molecules of potassium iodide to react with.
 In other words, whereas we are accustomed to consider the second
 reaction   between chlorine or oxides of chlorine and potassium
 iodide, to be instantaneous, this is trne only when the amount of
 potassium iodide present is beyond a certain minimum.              In the
 mixture above the minimum is between 0-03784 m.g.m. and
 0-0473 m.g.m. per c.c., and after that the rate of decomposition
 remains practically stationary until the amount present is 0-113o2
 m.g.m. per c.c.

 quantities at a time, beginning with about half the usual quantity

    There is a slight increase at the beginning of the series when the
quantity of iodide is doubled ; after this the rate remains practically
stationary for several increments.       There is, however, a marked in
crease bet ween z = 3 and z = 11, but not so rapid as at the beginning
of the series.   The reason for the indistinctness of form is evidently
the fact that the effect of variation of the iodide is within the limits of
experimental error.      It was, therefore, deemed advisable to vary the
iodide by larger quantities.      In the following series single grams of
the substance were introduced into the cylinder, one after the other.

    Here we have a series in which the rate increases distinctly with
 the amount of iodide, and it is not far from an arithmetical pro
 gression, certainly within the limits of experimental error. The
 establishment of this relation would of course show that the varia
 tion of potassium iodide has the same sort of influence as any neutral
 salt, and one would therefore class it with potassium chloride in this
 investigation.     On the other hand, it seems evident that the cases are
 not exactly parallel ; double decomposition between this salt and
 hydrogen chloride must go on, with a production of potassium
 chloride and hydrogen iodide. The hydrogen chloride present is
 decreased by a quantity equivalent to the amount of potassium chlo
 ride produced, and the hydrogen iodide produced will have its
 specific influence different from that of the former acid. At any rate
one cannot be surprised at not finding the progression quite as well
marked here as for potassium chloride.
    We will now turn to the results obtained by varying the tempera
ture at which we made observations.           This was done in the manner
described in the introduction.
                           Variation in Temperature.
    The temperature at which most of our experiments were conducted
was 20° C. We found any variation in temperature had a marked
effect on the rate.      A  rise of temperature of 5° practically doubled
the rate of decomposition, and a fall in temperature of 5° halved the
rate at any point. In general if the temperature was varied in
arithmetical progression the rate varied in geometrical progression.

    We see from the above tables that the ratios vary with the differ
 ences between the snccessive temperatures.               They are, however, quite
 independent of the quantity of each substance present. This is clearly
 shown in the following table, in which the rates obtained with varied
 quantities of potassium chlorate at 25° and 30° are compared.                    It
 will be seen that the ratio is constant.          A similar result was obtained
with varied quantities of potassium iodide, the ratios in this case also
being independent of the amount.

   It  will be seen that the rate almost doubles itself for the rise
of  5° between 25° and       30° in the above instances.
   A great number of experiments were made in which the tempera
ture was varied by successive differences of 3°, or 2°, or 1° ; but the
numbers observed could not be considered quite satisfactory owing to
the intrusion of experimental errors, so it was generally found advis
able to increase the temperature 5° at a time, thus making a marked
difference in the rate.       We deduce from this result the average value
of the coefficient or ratio for the variation in temperature of 1°.

        An Investigation of       a Case  of gradual Chemical      Change.    421
    The formula embodying these results takes the same form as that
 in Messrs. Harcourt and Esson's reaction, in which it may be remem
bered the rate of decomposition doubled itself for a difference of 10°             <
 in temperature, whilst in our reaction it is doubled for every 5".
    The formula is thus expressed : —
                                      R, = Roe",
 where t is temperature,        R0 rate at 0°, R< is rate at t°, h is a constant.
 The rough approximation that the rate doubles itself for 5° would
 give k = 0-3010/5 = 0'0602. The value of k is determined from experi
 ment as —
                                   log R,— log R<-5
                                                    '
                                           5
 and the mean of a large number of experiments                gives it   as about
00585.
    h is, however, not absolutely constant, but is found to vary slightly
 with the temperature (t) for which it is determined.             It is larger for
 a low temperature range of 5°, and smaller for a difference of 5° at a
 higher temperature.         In fact, speaking roughly, between 0° and 15°
 the rate is a little more than doubled by a rise of 5° ; between 20°
and 35° it is a little less than doubled. The following table will show
the amount of variation from this ratio : —

    h is thus seen    to vary slightly with the temperatures between which
it is determined.         The same secondary variation was noticed by
Messrs. Harcourt and Esson iu their reaction. On comparing column 4
with column 5 it will be seen that their mean value is almost the
same.      At present it is difficult to extricate tho secondary variation
from experimental error, especially as a greater range of temperature

422          Mr. W. H. Pendlebury and Miss M. Seward.
cannot be taken.      At temperatures above 35° the starch-iodide colour   j
is very difficult to perceive, as it loses its distinctive blne tinge and I
acquires a purple colour.       At temperatures below 0°, though the I
starch colour is then a most beautiful blue, yet the change proceeds I
so slowly that it becomes difficult to hit, even within a few minutes, !
the point at which the blue colour has definitely appeared.          Hence  I
the range of temperature is somewhat limited.
   This brings our work to a conclusion.          There are several points   I
which still need elucidation ; their interpretation has seemed, so far,      I
beyond our powers.       We can only add a few facts to the pile now         I
rapidly accumulating, out of which should grow a comprehensive               1
theory of chemical dynamics.
   The facts established by the investigation may be thus summa
rised : —
   Dilute solutions of hydrogen chlorate and hydrogen chloride when
mixed together slowly liberate oxidising material, chlorine and
oxides of chlorine.
   If no substance which can be oxidised is present, the accumula
tion of this oxidising material in the liquid soon stops the reaction.
   In the presence of an iodide from which iodine can be liberated,
and afterwards disposed of by means of sodium thiosulphate, the re
action proceeds regularly and with a constant velocity — constant
because the quantity of the substances decomposed bears an infinitely
small relation to the quantity present.
   The actual rate varies with the quantity of hydrogen chlorate, in
the first place directly as it is the substance decomposed, and in the
second place with a small acceleration proportional to the quantity,
the substance thus having a coefficient of acceleration independent of
its being that undergoing decomposition.        Thus
                              R = oQ(l   + &Q),
where    R  is rate of decomposition, Q quantity.       The variation with
quantity   of hydrogen   chloride is not of so simple a nature. This acid
would seem to have (1) an effect of the secondary order above men
tioned (accelerative) on the decomposition          of hydrogen chlorate
alone ; and in addition to this (2) an effect of both primary and
secondary order as above on the decomposition of hydrogen chlorate
by hydrogen chloride.
   The addition of potassium chloride to the liquid has a small accele
rative effect on the rate proportional to its quantity.
   If a mixture of solution of potassium chlorate and hydrogen
chloride is made (in molecular proportion between 1 : 2 and 1 : 12),

     During the past year I have continued the work described in a
  former communication on the relative densities of hydrogen and
  oxygen,* in the hope of being able to prepare lighter hydrogen than
 was then found possible.          To this end various modifications have been
 made in the generating apparatus.                  Hydrogen has been prepared
 from potash in place of acid.           In one set of experiments the gas was
 liberated by aluminium.           In this case the generator consisted of a
 large    closed   tube  sealed  to  the remainder of the apparatus ; and the
 aluminium was attached to an iron armature so arranged that by
 means of an external electro-magnet it was possible to lower it into
 the potash, or to remove it therefrom. The liberated gas passed
                                                      j
 through tubes containing liquid potash, corrosive sublimate, finely
 powdered solid potash, and, lastly, a long length of phosphoric anhy
 dride. But the result was disappointing; for the hydrogen proved
to be no lighter than that formerly obtained from sulphuric acid.
     I have also tried to purify hydrogen yet further by absorption in
palladium. In his recent important memoir,J " On the Combustion of

 Mr. Keiser describes experiments from which it appears that palladium
 will not occlude nitrogen — a very probable impurity in even the most
 carefully prepared gas.    My palladium was placed in a tube sealed, as
 a lateral attachment, to the middle of that containing the phosphoric
 anhydride ; so that the hydrogen was submitted in a thorough manner
 to this reagent both before and after absorption by the palladium. Any
 impurity that might be rejected by the palladium was washed out
 of the tube by a current of hydrogen before the gas was collected for
                                                       I
 weighing. But as the result of even this treatment have no improve
 ment to report, the density of the gas being almost exactly as before.
    Hitherto the observations have related merely to the densities of
 hydrogen and oxygen, giving the ratio 15 884, as formerly explained.
 To infer the composition of water by weight, this number had to
 be combined with that found by Mr. Scott as representing the ratio
 of volumes.    The result was
                            i^i4 =
                              1-9965
                                         15-914.
    The experiments now to be described are an attempt at an entirely
 independent determination of the relative weights by actnal combus
 tion of weighed quantities of the two gases. It will be remembered
 that in Dumas's investigation the composition of water is inferred
from the weights of the oxygen and of the water, the hydrogen being
 unweighed.     In order to avoid the very unfavourable conditions of
 this  method,   recent workers have made it a point to weigh the
hydrogen, whether in the gaseous state as in the experiments of
Professor Cooke and my own, or occluded in palladium as in Mr.
Keiser's practice.    So long as the hydrogen is weighed, it is not very
material whether the second weighing relate to the water or to the
oxygen.     The former is the case in the work of Cooke and Keiser, the
latter  in the preliminary experiments now to be reported.
    Nothing could be simpler in principle than the method adopted.
Globes of the same size as those employed for the density determina
tions are filled to atmospheric pressure with the two gases, and are
then carefully weighed.      By means of Sprengel pumps the gases are
exhausted into a mixing chamber, sealed below with mercury, and
thence by means of a third Sprengel are conducted into a eudio
meter, also sealed below with mercury, where they are fired by
electric sparks in the usual way.      After sufficient quantities of the
gases have been withdrawn, the taps of the globes are turned, the
leading tubes and mixing chamber are cleared of all remaining gas,
and, after a final explosion in the eudiometer, the nature and amount
of the residual gas are determined.      The quantities taken from the
globes can be found from the weights before and after operations.

 1889.]                On the Composition   of Water.                427
 From the quantity of that gas which proved to be in excess, the cal
 culated weight of the residue is subtracted.    This gives the weight of
 the two gases which actually took part in the combustion.
    In practice, the operation is more difficult than might be supposed
 from the above description. The efficient capacity of the eudiometer
 being necessarily somewhat limited, the gases must be fed in through
 out in very nearly the equivalent proportions ; otherwise there would
 soon be such an accumulation of residue that no further progress
 could be made. For this reason nothing could be done until the
 intermediate mixing chamber was provided.           In starting a com
 bustion, this vessel, originally full of mercury, was charged with
 equivalent quantities of the two gases. The oxygen was first admitted
 nntil the level of the mercury had dropped to a certain mark, and
 subsequently the hydrogen down to a second mark, whose positiou
 relatively to the first was determined by preliminary measurements
 of volume.      The mixed gases might then be drawn off into the
 eudiometer nntil exhausted, after which the chamber might be re
 charged as before.      But a good deal of time may be saved by
replenishing    the  chamber   from the globes simultaneously with the
exhaustion into the eudiometer.      In order to do this without losing
the proper proportion, simple mercury manometers were provided for
indicating the pressures of the gases at any time remaining in the
globes.    But even with this assistance close attention was necessary
to obviate an accumulation of residual gas in the eudiometer, such as
would endanger the success of the experiment, or, at least, eutail
tedious delay.     To obtain a reasonable control, two sparking places
were provided, of which the upper was situate nearly at the top of
the eudiometer.     This was employed at the close, and whenever in
the course of the combustion the residual gas chanced to be much
reduced in quantity ; but, as a rule, the explosions were made from
the lower sparking point.      The most convenient state of things was
attained when the tube contained excess of oxygen down to a point
somewhat below the lower sparking wires.           Under these circum
stances, each bubble of explosive gas readily found its way to the
sparks, and there was no tendency to a dangerous accumulation of
mixed gas before an explosion took place. When the gas in excess
was hydrogen, the manipulation was more difficult, on account of the
greater density of the explosive gas retarding its travel to the
necessary height.
   In spite of all precautions several attempted determinations have
failed from various causes, such as fracture of the eudiometer and
others which it is not necessary here to particularise, leading to the
loss of much labour.      Five results only can at present be reported,
and are as follows :  —

   This number       represents   the atomic     ratio of oxygen and hydrogen
  as deduced immediately from the weighings with allowance for the
  unburnt residue.          It is subject to the correction for buoyancy
  rendered necessary by the shrinkage of the external volume of the
  globes when internally exhausted, as explained in my former commu
  nication.*      In these experiments, the globe which contained the
  hydrogen was the same (14) as that employed for the density deter
  minations. The necessary correction is thus four parts in a thousand,
  reducing the final number for the atomic weight of oxygen to
                                         15-89,
 somewhat lower than that which             I  formerly obtained (15-91) by the
 use of Mr. Scott's value of the volume ratio.              It may be convenient
 to recall that the corresponding number obtained by Cooke and
 Richards (corrected for shrinkage) is 15-87, while that of Keiser is
 1595.
      In the present incomplete state of the investigation,           I  do not wish
 to lay much stress upon the above number, more especially as the
 agreement of the several results is not so good as it should be.
 The principal source of error, of a non-chemical character, is in the
estimation of the weight of the hydrogen. Although this part of the
 work cannot be conducted under quite such favourable conditions as
 in the case of a density determination, the error in the difference of
the two weighings should not exceed 0 0002 gram. The whole weight
 of the hydrogen used is about 0-1 gram ;f so that the error should
not exceed three in the last figure of the final number.                    It is thus
scarcely possible to explain the variations among the five numbers as
due merely to errors of the weighings.
    * The necessity of this correction was recognised at an early stage, and, iF       I
remember rightly, was one of the reasons which led me to think that a redetermina
tion of the density of hydrogen was desirable.        In the meantime, however, the
question was discussed by Agamennone (' Atti (Rendiconti) d. R. Accad. dei Lincei.'
1885), and some notice of his work reached me.       When writing my paper last year
I  could not recall the circumstances ; but since the matter has attracted attention   I
have made inquiry, and take this opportunity of pointing out that the credit of first
publication is due to Agamennone.
    t  It was usual to take for combustion from two-thirds    to three-fourths   of the
contents of the globe.

   At the  close of operations the residue in the eudiometer was oxygen,
occupying 7 8 c.c. This was at a total pressure of 29-6 — 16-2 = 13-4
inches of mercury.          Subtracting 0-4 inch for the pressure of the
water vapour, we get 13-0 as representing the oxygen pressure.                  The
temperature was about 12° C. Thus, taking the weight of a cub.
cent. of oxygen at 0° C. and under a pressure of 76-0 cm. of
mercury to be 0-00143 gram, we get as the weight of the residual
oxygen

    In several cases the residual gas was subjected to analysis. Thus,
 after the determination of February 2, the volume was reduced by
 additions of hydrogen to 1*2 c.c. On introduction of potash there
 was shrinkage to about 0-9, and, on addition of pyrogallic acid, to
 0-1 or 0-2.   These volumes of gas are here measured at a pressure of
 I atmosphere, and are, therefore, to be divided by 3 if we wish to
 estimate the quantities of gas under standard conditions.                 The final
 residue of (say) 0-05 c.c. should be nitrogen, and, even if originally
 mixed with the hydrogen — the most unfavourable case — would involve
 an error of only             in the final result.       The 0*1 c.c. of carbonic
 anhydride,   if  originally    contained   in   the    hydrogen, would be more
 important ; but this is very improbable.            If originally mixed with the
 oxygen,   or due   to   leakage through      india-rubber     into the combustion
 apparatus, it would lead to no appreciable error.

 and thus not manifest itself under the above tests. In another experi
 ment the water of combustion was examined for acidity, but without
 definite indications of nitric acid. The slight reddening observed
 appeared to be rather that due to carbonic acid, some of which, it
 must be remembered, would be dissolved in the water.            These and
 other matters demand further attention.

 tion apparatus has all been done at home by my assistant, Mr.
 Gordon, on whom has also fallen most of the rather tedious work
 connected with the evacuation of globes and other apparatus, and with
 the preparation of the gases.
II. " On    the Wave-length of the Principal Line in the Spectrum
       of  the Aurora."        By William Hugglvs, D.C.L., LL.D.,
       F.R.S.     Received February 19, 1889.
    Notwithstanding the large number of determinations by different
observers, since Angstrom in 1867, of the wave-length of the prin
cipal (and frequently the only) line in the spectrum of the Anrora,
this value has not yet been accepted as definitely fixed with the
degree of accuracy which is required for a final inquiry into its
chemical origin.       The uncertainty within rather wide limits, which
seems still to obtain, has arisen mainly from the circumstance that in
nearly all cases the observations have been made with a small direct-
vision spectroscope, and under conditions which do not admit of an
accurate determination of the value sought for.            About half the
number of some twenty-four observers agree pretty well, but among
the results given by the others the differences are very large in
relation to the accuracy which is required, though they are not
greater, perhaps, than was to be expected from the circumstances
under which the observations were made.
    I think it is very desirable, therefore, that I should pnt on record
some observations of the spectrum of the Aurora which I made in
the year 1874, but which up to the present time have remained
unpublished.      These observations were made with a powerful spectro
scope, and under conditions which enabled me to determine the
wave-length of the principal line within narrow limits of error. The
spectroscope was made by Sir Howard Grubb on the automatic
principle of his father, Mr. Thomas Grubb. It is furnished with two
" Grubb " compound prisms ; each has 5
                                                square inches of base, and
gives nearly     twice  the  dispersion of a single prism of 60°, namely,
about 9° 6' from A to H.

diameter.     The definition is very good.           Though the automatic
arrangement works well,          Ialways take the precaution to measure
only  small  differences   of position of the line to be determined from
lines near     it,
                the wave-lengths of which are known.
   The observations were made on February               1874. There was
                                                               4,                              a
brilliant Aurora, showing a whitish light a direct-vision spectro
                                                         ;
scope resolved this light into a brilliant line in the vellow and a
faint continuous spectrum.
   The " Grubb
                   "
                      spectroscope was directed from the window of the
observatory upon the brightest part of the Aurora.               In the first
instance,  an estimation    by eye  was made   of  the position of the bright
line by comparing        in the instrument with the spectrum of spirit
                         it                                                             a
lamp.    The  bright   line  was seen to fall on the more refrangible side
of the line for which Watts gives the wave-length 5582,* Angstrom
and Thalen 5583,t by from one-fifth to one-fourth of the distance of
this line from the beginning of the band. If we take one-fourth, we
have   X 5569'6     one-fifth gives X5572'3.
                     ;                            The mean of these values
gives for the
                              Aurora line 5570'9
                                              A.

   The cross-wires of the spectroscope were then brought upon the
line, and the reading 3476 showed the line to fall about midway
between two strong lines in the spectrum of tin,    5564 and    5587 X                \
respectively, according to my measures.    The  position of the cross
                                                 J
was then compared directly with those lines in the spectrum of an
induction spark taken between electrodes of tin. The further details
of this comparison are not given in my note-book, but the result
only, which placed the
                              Aurora line at       X   5571                                 (2).
   Consulting my map of the chemical elements,     found that there
                                                                I
was a line of tellurium very near this place, namely, at      5575,                 X       I
therefore brought the spark from tellurium before the slit, when the
cross appeared on the more refrangible side of the tellurium line.
The measure of the distance of the cross from this line came out
equal to 0003. The place given in my paper for this line of tellurium
           X
is 5575. Thalen gives for the same line 5574'1.§      If we take the
mean of these values and deduct 0003, we get for
                         The line of the Aurora        \  5571      5                       (3).

spectrum, and        I made use of these also for a further determination of
the place of the Aurora line. The cross, after having been placed
upon the line of the Aurora, was confronted with these lines in the
spectrum of iron.
    The condensed          account in my note-book does not give further
particulars of this comparison, but states only that the place of the
                            Aurora line came out      \ 557l-5                  (4).
Summing up these determinations we have —
                       (1)  Eye-estimation               X 5570-9

                       (4)  From iron                      5571-5
    From these values        I think that we are justified in taking for the
 Aurora line, as a position very near the truth,
                                     \557l ±0-5                                 (5).
    Among the numerous determinations of other observers, those of
 Professor H. C. Vogel in 1872* seem to me to have great weight.                   A
 direct-vision spectroscope with a set of five prisms was used. The
reduction of the readings of the micrometer into wave-lengths was
 based upon the repeated measures of 100 lines of the solar spectrum.
    The screw had been thoroughly examined.                After each observation
 of the Aurora line, readings were taken of the lines of sodium or of
 hydrogen. The observations extended over four nights. On three
 nights four separate readings were obtained; on the fourth night
 two only. Vogel gives as the mean result of the fourteen obser
 vations,
                              Aurora line   \ 5571 3 + 0 92                      (6).
     Perhaps     I should state that I find, from a remark in my note-book,
 that at the time of my observations in 1874 I was not aware of
 Vogel's results, and        I could not, therefore, have been biassed in any
 way by them.
    The recent observations on the spectrum of the Aurora by Gyllen-
 skiold, at Cap Thordsen, in 1882, deserve special mention.                f   With
 a Hoffmann spectroscope, furnished with a scale, he obtained                at Cap
  Thordsen in 1882 a mean result of A, 5568 + 1 -6 ; later, in 1884, at
  Upsala, with a Wrede spectroscope furnished with a micrometer
  screw, a mean value for the Aurora line, X. 5569 + 6*2.           J  Gyllenskiold

   Now, though Angstrom's original value X 5567 may not be quite
accurate,    his observation fixed a limit towards the red beyond which
the Aurora line cannot lie.                  Angstrom says, " sa lumiere etait
presque monochromatique,                et consistait d'une seule raie brillante
                     "                                            " du groupe connu
situee a. gauche         (on the more refrangible side)

this calcium-group is accurately known ; according tof

   It  is certain, therefore,        from Angstrom's first observation in 18G7
alone,   that the     Aurora       line  lies well on the more refrangible side
of wave-length 5580.              This limit towards the red was confirmed
afterwards by Angstrom himself ; he says later that the yellow line
falls almost midway between the second and third line of the shaded
carbon group.J The positions of these lines of comparison are,
                                                 \
according to Angstrom and Thalén, 5538 and X 5583.§
   It follows that Krafft's values, X 5586, X. 5587, and X 5595, must be
from some cause inaccurate. A possible explanation may be found
in the small number of solar lines employed by Krafft for the reduc
tion of the measures into wave-lengths.               The curve was drawn through
the six   Fraunhofer       lines   B,  C, o, D,  E,  and   b.   There was no control
for the curve between D and E, and a very small deviation of the
curve from its true position here would be sufficient to account for
the position of less refrangibility of from X 0016 to X0024, which his
measures give for the Aurora line.
   It should be stated that Krafft expresses regret that more attention
could not be given to the spectroscopic observations.                      He says :—
" Leider gestatteten die obligatorischen Beobachtungen nicht, den
spectroscopischen          Untersuchnngen die gehorige Aufmerksamkeit
angedeihen       zu    lassen                      Ich glaubte ausserdem         diese
Messungen um so mehr auslassen zu konnen, als der Platz der ge-
wohnlichen Nordlichtlinie oft nnd sehr genau bestimmt ist."

the  Aurora : —

                              think that           I
                                             ought to point out that Mr.
 Lockyer's recent statement J that : — " The characteristic line of the
aurora is the remnant of the brightest manganese Anting at 558," is
 clearly inadmissible, considering the evidence we have of the position
of this line.
    In support of this statement Mr. Lockyer says : — " Angstrom gave
 the wave-length of the line as 5567, and since then many observers
 have given the same wave-length for it, but probably without making
independent determinations. Piazzi Smyth, however, gives it as 558,
which agrees exactly with the bright edge of the manganese fluting.
R. H. Proctor also gives the line as a little less refrangible than
Angstrom's determination.          He says : — ' My own measures give
me a wave-length very slightly greater than those of Winlock and
             '
 Angstrom ('Nature,' vol. 3, p. 468)."
    By reference to Gyllenskiold's table it will be seen that the probable
errors of the determinations by Piazzi Smyth and Proctor, 5579 + 9'5
and 5595 + 25-0 respectively, § are too large to entitle these measures
to special weight.
   Mr. Lockyer says further : — " Gyllenskiold's measures with the
Wrede spectroscope also give 5580 as the wave-length of the charac
teristic line. I feel justified, therefore, in disregarding the difference
between the wave-length of the edge of the manganese fluting and
the generally accepted wave-length of the aurora line."
    Gyllenskiold's single measure of 5580, on which Mr. Lockyer relies,
differs widely from the values which Gyllenskiold himself assigns
to this line, namely, from observations at Cape Thordsen in 1882,
\  5568 + l-6, and from observations at Upsala in 1884, with the
Wrede spectroscope, X 5569 + 6"2.

   In this memoir the author first calls attention to detached observa
tions made in his earlier memoirs relating to the manner in which a
medullary axis is developed in the interior of each of the primary
vascular bundles of the Carboniferous Lycopodiacae.       He then traces
the changes undergone during the development of a small branch-
bundle in Lepidodendron Harcourtii.  This is followed by a descrip
tion of a small new species of Lepidodendron, which he named
L. mundum, and in which the peculiar development of the mednlla is
clearly demonstrated.
     In   a second   new    species,    named
                                         Lepidodendron   intermedium, a
 peculiar and apparently early form of exogenous zone is shown to
 exist.   When describing, in his previous memoir, Part XI (see Plate
 49, fig. 11), the stem now designated Lepidoderidron fuliginosum, he
 showed that, in     it,
                      we have an example of the most rudimentary and
 least perfectly developed form of an exogenous zylem yet seen
amongst these Carboniferous Cryptogams. In this example, but a fen-
radiating laniinffl of vascular tissues make their appearance in the
innermost cortex. In the L. intermedium, now described, though these
few laminae are represented by         continuous cylindrical zone of
                                            a
tracheids, and though the laminae are arranged in radial order, thev
are still imbedded in a mass of cellular tissue, much in excess of what
constitutes the medullary rays in the higher types of Lepidodendroid
organisation.
   A fourth new species of Lepidodendron      described under the name
                                                     is
L. Spenceri, in young states of which no medulla        visible; but in
                                                          is

lignified scalariform tracheids are seen, enclosed within an outer
series of perfectly lignified ones. Here we have obviously an example
of the centripetal development of a vascular bundle, reminding us of
what is the normal mode of growth amongst the bundles of all recent
Lycopods.
   A fifth new species, Lepidodendron parvulum, is also described ;
after which the author points out the differences between the mode
of development of the cellular medulla of these exogenous Cryptogams,
and that of the representative     organ amongst the Dicotyledonous
Exogens. Amongst the ordinary Exogens the growing tip of a stem
or branch is a mere aggregation of cells, which mass is soon sepa
rated into two zones, in addition to the formation of the epiderm, by
the development within it of a ring of vascular bundles.        The cells
enclosed within this ring become the medulla or pith, and those
external to it constitute the cortex.   In this instance the cells about
to form the medulla exist, prior to their becoming defined as a medulla
by the first development of the vessels which enclose            it,
                                                              and which
vessels will ultimately grow into a woody, or zylem, zone.        Such a
pith subsequently undergoes but a very limited enlargement. In most
cases a time arrives when        grows less with age, and ultimately
                                it
almost disappears   ;but in the Lepidodendra, though the tip of each
growing stem was, in the first instance, also      cellular mass, what
                                                    a                                is
designated an axial solid bundle of vessels was developed in the centre
of the new growth almost at its very commencement.            But    was       it
only after this growth had made some progress, and the twig had
become clothed externally with numerous leaves, that the first traces
of a medulla began to appear in the centre of the bundle.       It thus    is
clear that the medulla of these Carboniferous Lycopods        not geneti
                                                                 is
cally homologous with that of an ordinary exogenous flowering plant.
But the stage of growth of the stem at which this medulla first
appeared has differed remarkably in various species of Lepidodendron,
a remark equally applicable to the first formation in them of a true
exogenous zone.
  The axial vascular medullary bundle expanded into a hollow
cylinder under the internal pressure of the growing medulla,
which latter not only attained to considerable dimensions, but was
a  persistent organ.    This ring enclosing the medulla, supplied
the vascular bundles going to leaves and branches.       The author
demonstrates that the branches are supplied with such bundles in two
ways. When the growing stem divides dichotomously, which        does       it
as amongst living Lycopods, the medullary vascular cylinder splits
into two equal halves. But, besides this mode, the author shows that
very frequently comparatively small segments are cut completely out
of the vascular cylinder, in which a gap    thus left where the bark
                                               is
and the medulla meet. The angular segment thus detached develops,

II. "A     Method of examining Rate of Chemical                 Change in
       Aqueous Solutions."         By G. GORE, F.R.S.            Received
       January   11, 1889.
                                 (Abstract.)
    This research supplies an outline of  a method   of examining chemical
                                                                       " to
change,    based upon the application of the " voltaic balance
measuring the relative amounts of voltaic energy of electrolytes (see
'
  Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 44, pp. 151, 294), and the rate of chemical
change is indicated by alterations in amount of such energy.
    The author gives an example of two liquids, viz., a solution of
equivalent proportions of potassic iodide and chlorine, and one of
chlorido of potassium and iodine, which, although having the same
ultimate chemical composition, are greatly different (viz., as 1*0 to
31-76) in voltaic energy, and in a moderate degree different in colour.
The latter of these is a nearly stable liquid, and does not readily alter
in chemical composition at 13° C., whilst the former is extremely un
stable, continually losing voltaic energy, and becoming darker in
colour at that temperature, until it nearly acquires the chemical com
position and properties of the other mixture.
    From the results obtained it is concluded — 1st, that the aqueous
 solution of equivalent proportions of potassic iodide and chlorine de
composes spontaneously at 12° C., with gradual formation of potassic
chloride and liberation of iodine; 2nd, that the change of chemical
 composition   is attended    by considerable loss of voltaic energy ;
3rd, that more than six days are necessary to effect the complete
 chemical change at that temperature ; and, 4th, that the rate of
 chemical change is much greater at the commencement of the action
 than towards its termination. Further, that the solution of potassic
chloride and iodine increases slightly in energy during the mixing.
    The influence of dilution, time, temperature, light, agitation, and
 mode of mixing upon the chemical change was examined.               It was
 found that the degree of dilution of the constituent liquids of the
 potassic iodide and chlorine solution during the act of mixing largely
 affected the amount of chemical change which occurred during mix
 ture, but with the solution of potassic chloride and iodine the strength
 of the liquids had no such effect. The effect of dilution appears to be

 1889.]    Rate   of Chemical      CJiange   in Aqueous Solutions.                441
related to the degree of mobility and diffusibility of the particles, and
is largely modified by the degree of stability of the mixture.
   Temperature had great effect upon the solution of potassic iodide
and chlorine. Heating the liquid to about 100° C. during two minutes
was attended by great loss of voltaic energy, considerable increase of
colour, and about 99"8 per cent. of the mixture was changed into
potassic chloride and free iodine ; the amount of change was as great
as that which took place during 18 days at 12° C.      Similarly heating
the solution of potassic chloride and iodine had but little effect ;               it,
however, slightly increased its voltaic energy and decreased its colour,
and so far changed   itinto the other mixture (?).
   Exposing the solution of potassic iodide and chlorine to diffused
daylight during 18 dull winter days at about 12° C. did not appear to
greatly alter the rate of chemical change, as shown by alterations of
colour and of voltaic energy.    Light somewhat retarded the action.
   Strong agitation during one minute of the freshly made solution
appeared to slightly increase the amount of chemical change which
occurred during mixture.
   In making this solution the amount of chemical change which took
place during mixing was about        per cent. more
                                     5                 the chlorine solu
                                                           if
tion was added to the solution of iodide than      the order of addition
                                                    if
was reversed.
    The results of the experiments show that the solution of potassic
 iodide and chlorine was very unstable, highly sensitive to rise of tem
 perature, had a great tendency to lose its voltaic energy, to change its
 chemical composition, and approach that of the other mixture          that   ;
 the solution of the latter was very much more stable, and much less
 sensitive to heat, but had a feeble tendency to absorb energy, to

 potassic iodide and chlorine.    The effect, therefore, of heating both
 liquids was to produce two portions possessing similar chemical com
position and properties, but much more nearly resembling the chloride
 than the iodide mixture, and consisting of about 0'23 part of potassic
iodide, 74'49 of potassic chloride, 126-8 of iodine, and O'OW? of
chlorine.

                                 (Abstract.)
   In this investigation the author has measured, by means of the
" voltaic balance," the amounts of relative voltaic
                                                              energy or of
chemical affinity for zinc,   of nearly 250 aqueous   solutions  of dissolved
chemical compounds, at ordinary atmospheric temperatures.           The sub
stances include compounds of elements        with elements ;  elements   with
monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic acids ; acids of all these classes with
each other; elements with monobasic, hibasic, tribasic, and tetrabasic
salts ; monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic acids with all these classes of
salts ; and all these classes of salts with each other in great variety.
The method employed htis been already described (see ' Roy. Soc.
Proc.,' vol. 44, pp. 181, 294), and he offers the results thus obtained
as additional evidence in support of the conclusion, that " ever;/ elec
trolytic substance or mixture when dissolved in water unites chemically
in dpfinite proportions by weight with every other such dissolved body,
provided no separation of substance occurs;" and that "there may
probably be discovered thousands of such compounds, which only
exist whilst in aqueous solution, and are decomposed on evaporating
or crystallising their solutions."     The present research has shown the
existence   of nearly 250.
   The formulae of the compounds, together with the amounts of
energy, are arranged in the form of a table as a volta tension series of
electrolytes, commencing with I + CI, which gives a plus number of
 + 11,686,507, and ending with 2(H3N + KHO) + (K2C03 -hNa2SOs),
which gives a minus one of —959,817.            The whole of the formal®

   IV. " Note        on the Free Vibrations of an infinitely long Cylin
           drical Shell."         By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S. Received
           February 26, 1889.
        In a recent memoir*        Mr. Love has considered this question among
   others    ; but he has not discussed his result [equation (95)], except in
   its application to a rather special case involving the existence of a
   free edge.       When the cylinder is regarded as infinitely long, the pro
   blem is naturally of a simpler character; and I have thought that it
   might be worth while to express more fully the frequency equation, as
   applicable to all vibrations, independent of the thickness of. the shell,
   which are periodic with respect both to the length and the circum
   ference of the cylinder.
        In order to prevent misunderstanding, it may be well to premise
   that the vibrations, whose frequency is to be determined, do not
  include the gravest of which a thin shell is capable.                    If the middle
  surface      be   simply    bent,  the   potential energy of deformation is of a
  higher order of magnitude than in the contrary case, and according
  to the present method of treatment the frequency of vibration will
  appear to be zero. It is known, however, that the only possible modes
  of bending of a cylindrical shell are such as are not periodic along the
  length, or rather have the wave-leilgth in this direction infinitely long.f
  When the middle surface is stretched, as well as bent, the potential
  energy of bending may be neglected, except in certain very special
  cases.
       Taking cylindrical co-ordinates (r, 0, s), and denoting the displace
 ments parallel to z, 0, r by u, v, w respectively, we have for the
 principal elongations and shear at any point (a, 0, z)J —

This is the ordinary formula for the longitudinal vibrations of a rod,
the fact that the section is here a thin annulus not influencing the
result to this order of approximation.
    Another extreme case worthy of notice occurs when                  s is very great.
Equation (24) then reduces to
                   k*[Jfi-p*-tt] [fc3-2(M+l)             Ca2+s2)]  =0                (34)  ;
so    that k- becomes a function of n and s only through (°2 + «2), as
might have been expected from the theory of plane plates.                       The first
root relates to flexnral vibrations ; the second to vibrations of
shearing, as in (18) ; the third to vibrations involving extension of
the middle surface, analogous to those in (22).
    It is scarcely necessary to add, in conclusion, that the most general
deformation of the middle surface can be expressed by means of a
series of such as are periodic with respect to z and 0, so that the
problem considered is really the most general small motion of an
infinite cylindrical shell.
    [Another particular         case    worth notice     arises when s    =   1, so    that
(24) assumes the form

As we have already seen, if /* be zero, one of the values of k2 vanishes.
If n be small, the corresponding value of kr is of the order fi*. Equa

    This paper contains an account of    a  large number of experiments
made with the object of determining the velocity of waves of com
pression caused by explosions under water.
                                                                        "
    The method adopted depended on the use of a certain " gauge
devised for the occasion, whereby the arrival of the disturbance at a
given point was transmitted to a chronograph.
    The disturbances themselves were caused by submarine explosions
of dynamite and guncotton in quantities varying from nine ounces to
fonr pounds.
    The distance over which the velocity was measured was about
200 yards.
    The water was that of the Pacific Ocean in the harbour of Port
 Jackson, N.S. Wales.
    The chronograph was of the falling pendulum description, and
 fired the charge automatically.
     The absolute time was obtained by comparing the chronograph
 tuning fork with an astronomical clock.
     The distance was obtained in terms of the standard yard of N.S.
 Wales by means of trigonometrical survey.          The chief results for
 the range quotod are as follows : —

   The subject of the paper of which this is an abstract, is the deter
mination of the rate of change of the velocity of the propagation of
an explosion in gaseous explosive mixtures.
   It has been noticed by several investigators, viz., MM. Berthclot
and Vielle, MM. Mallard and Le Chatelier, and Professor H. B. Dixon,
F.R.S. , that explosive gaseous mixtures after ignition do not reach
their maximum velocity of propagation at once, but that a certain
maximum velocity is attained soon after initial ignition.
   In order to investigate this interesting period, which may be called
the acceleration period of an explosion, chronographic measurements
of a peculiar nature were found necessary.
   It was at once evident that but little advance in this branch of the
subject of explosions could be made nnless exceedingly minute periods
of time could be measured with certainty.

 452             Ignition  of an explosive  Gaseous  Mixture.      [Mar. 21,
    It  was not possible to work with the pendulum chronograph (good
 as  this instrument is for other branches of research), as its length of
 traverse is too limited, and the difficulty of subdividing tuning fork
 traces is found to be very great, since the velocity of the pendulum
 varies from zero up to a maximum during its swing ; this being so, a
 new form of chronograph has been devised to meet as far as possible
 all the requirements of the case, by means of the instrument.          The
 following results have been obtained : —
    1. The -j <5^o7jth second can be measured with ease, and periods of
 time differing from -j^th second to j-g^goth second can be recorded
 on the same moving surface.
    2. The surface      which receives the record moves at a velocity
 which is practically constant during the traverse of 50 cm. ; also its
 velocity can be varied between wide limits.
    3. A large number of time records can be made side by side, all
records being made in straight lines.
    4. Fractions of recorded vibrations of a fork can be subdivided by
means of a micrometer microscope.          This is not the case with vibra
tions recorded on a surface attached to a pendulum, where the velo
city varies from zero up to a maximum at the middle of the swing.
    The electromagnetic styli, by means of which events are marked,
are so constructed that their period of " latency
                                                      " is almost
                                                                  absolutelv
constant, and their electromagnets are so wound that no sparking
takes place on breaking the circuit.
    A moving surface is carried on a carriage, which is propelled by
means of a falling weight, which after a certain velocity has been
attained is removed, the surface then moves with a velocity which is
found to be practically constant, for the limits between which a time
record is made.
    The chronograph is used in conjunction with a steel tube in which
the explosions take place.      At even distances along the axis of the
tube, conducting bridges, eight to ten in number, of Dutch metal
insulated from the tube, are placed ; each bridge is connected electri
cally with a recording stylus, so that as each bridge is broken by the
explosion, a mark is made on the surface of the chronograph ;
these markings when duly interpreted provide data for constructing
a curve, which indicates        the rate at which the velocity of the
explosion is changing during its propagation.
    The rest of the paper treats of the methods by means of which the
errors due to the use of electromagnets in chronographic work have
been dealt with and reduced as far as possible.

III.  " On an Effect of Light upon Magnetism." By SHELFORD
         Bidwell, M.A., F.R.S. Received March 11, 1889.
   Several    experimenters      in the early part of the present century
tried to magnetise iron and steel by the action of light,* but I do not
know of any recent attempts in this direction, and of late years the
thing has been generally regarded as impossible.                   Under ordinary
circumstances there can be little doubt that this is the case, but, if a
certain condition is fulfilled, we might,          I think, expect to find some
evidence of the action of radiation upon the magnetism of iron.
   The condition is that the susceptibility of the bar AB to be operated
upon shall be greater (or less) for a magnetic force in the direction
AB than for an equal one in the direction BA.                This paper contains
a short preliminary account of a series of experiments which have
been undertaken with iron bars having this property.                      Much yet
remains to be done, which will require a considerable amount of time,
and for which special apparatus must be constructed.                   In the mean
time, the results already obtained appear to possess sufficient interest
to justify their publication.
   The method of preparing the bars is as follows : A piece of soft
iron rod, which may conveniently be 10 or 12 cm. long and from 0-5 to
1 cm. in diameter, is raised to a bright yellow heat and slowly cooled.
When cold, it is placed inside a solenoid, through which is passed a
battery current of sufficient strength to produce a field of about 350
or 400 C G.S. units.        The iron when removed from the coil is found
to be permanently magnetised, and its north pole is marked for the
sake of distinction with red sealing-wax varnish.                 The bar is then
supported horizontally        and   in   an  east  and  west   direction   behind a
small reflecting magnetometer, and over it is slipped a coil, which is
shunted with a rheostat, the resistance of which can be gradually
increased from 0 to 26 ohms.              The coil can be connected by a key
with a single battery cell, which is so arranged as to produce a
demagnetising force inside the coil. The resistance of the rheostat
is slowly raised, so that more and more current passes through the
coil, the battery key being alternately lifted and depressed until the
magnetometer indicates that the iron bar as a whole is perfectly
demagnetised.       The strength of the demagnetising force required
varies according to circumstances : it is generally about one-thirtieth
or one-twenty-fifth of the original magnetising force.
   After this treatment the iron rod does not differ, so far as ordinary
tests will show, from one which has never been submitted to mag-

netic  influences.        Nevertheless, as is well known, it possesses certain
properties which distinguish it from a piece of really virgin iron. In
the first place, the magnetisation induced by a force acting in such
a direction as to make the marked end a north pole, is greater
than that caused by an equal force in an opposite direction.             Again,
if such a bar be held horizontally east and west (to avoid terrestrial
influences), and tapped with a mallet, the marked                  end at once
becomes a north pole.          A similar effect follows if the rod be warmed
in the flame of a spirit-lamp.         Lastly, if it be placed inside a coil and
subjected to the action of a series of rather feeble magnetic forces, of
equal strength but alternating in direction, the marked end will
generally become a north pole, even though the last of the alternate
forces may have tended to induce the opposite polarity.
   A rod treated as above described appears to be remarkably sensi
tive to the action of light.          When such a rod is placed behind the
magnetometer,         and illuminated by an oxyhydrogen lamp about
 70 cm.   distant,   there  occurs an immediate deflection of from 10 to 200
scale divisions,* the magnitude of the effect varying in different
 specimens of iron.           As the action of the light is continued, the
deflection slowly increases.         When the light is shut off, the magneto
meter instantly goes         back   over   a range equal to that of the first
sudden deflection, then continues to move slowly in the backward
direction towards zero.
    The first quick movement        I believe may be due to the direct action of
radiation, and the subsequent slow movement to the gradually rising
temperature of the bar.          With a thick rod (1 cm. in diameter) the
slow movement is barely perceptible, extending over only one or two
scale divisions in the course of a minute, the spot of light becoming
almost stationary after the first sudden jump.             With a thin rod the
sudden effect is generally smaller, while the slow after-effect is
 greater and may continue until the spot of light passes off the scale.
    As a general rule the magnetic effect is such as to render the
marked end of the rod a north pole : occasionally, however, it becomes
a south pole, but in such cases I have always found that the polarity
is comparatively feeble.         It may even happen^ that the marked end
becomes north when certain portions of the rod are illuminated, and
south when the light acts upon other portions.             This is probably due
to irregular annealing and a consequent local reversal of the direction
of maximum susceptibility : it indicates that the light effect is local,
and is confined to the illuminated surface.           In one remarkable speci
men, which happens not to have been annealed at all, the sudden
effect and the slow effect are in opposite directions.          When the light

   is turned upon this rod, there is   at first a sudden deflection of twenty
   magnetometer-scale-divisions to     the left, the spot afterwards moving
   slowly and steadily towards the      right. When the light is shut off
   there occurs at once a jump of      twenty divisions further towards the
   right before the spot begins to move back in the zero direction.
      Some attempts have been made to repeat the experiments with light
  polarised by means of a Nicol's prism ; but, either because the largest
   prism at my disposal was too small (its aperture being barely 2 cm.),
  or because too much of the radiant energy was absorbed by the spar,
   I failed to get any magnetic effects whatever with the prism in either
  position.
      [Professor Silvanus Thompson has quite recently been kind enough
  to lend me a very large and excellent Nicol's prism. From a few
  experiments already made with this instrument it appears that the
  action of the light is quite independent of the plane of polarisation. —
  March 16.]
      There can be no doubt whatever of the reality of the effects here
  described : they are perfectly distinct, and are at any time reproducible
  with certainty. The only question is how much of them is primarily
  caused by the action of light, and how much by mere incidental
  change of temperature.       But taking all the circumstances into con
  sideration,  I  think the evidence is in favour of the conclusion that
  the instantaneous magnetic change, which occurs when a prepared iron
  bar is illuminated, is purely and directly an effect of radiation.
        IV. "  Recalescence of Iron."        By J. Hopkinson, F.R.S.
                          Received March 7, 1889.
     Professor Barrett has observed that      if an iron wire be heated to a
 bright redness and then     be allowed   to cool, that this cooling does not
 go on continuously, but that after the wire has sunk to a very dull red
 it suddenly becomes brighter, and then continues to cool down. He
 surmised that the temperature at which this occurs is the temperature
 at which the iron ceases to be magnetisable.         In repeating Professor
 Barrett's experiments,    I found no difficulty in obtaining the pheno
 menon with hard steel wire, but       I failed to observe it in the case of
soft iron wire, or in the case of manganese steel wire. It appeared
to be of interest to determine the actual temperature at which the
phenomenon       occurred, and also the amount of heat which was
liberated. Although other explanations of the phenomenon have
been offered, there can never,     I think, have been much doubt that it
was due to the liberation of heat owing to some change in the
material, and not due to any change in the conductivity or emissive
power. My method of experiment was exceedingly simple.               I took a

cylinder  of hard steel,   6-3 cm.  long and   5*1  cm. diameter,  cut   a
groove in it, and wrapped in the groove a copper wire insulated with
asbestos.  The cylinder was wrapped in a large number of coverings
of asbestos paper to retard its cooling, the whole was then heated to
a bright redness in a gas furnace, was taken from the furnace and
allowed to cool in the open air, the resistance of the copper wire being
from time to time observed.       The result is plotted in the accom
panying curve,   in  which   the  ordinates  are the logarithms of the
increments of resistance above the resistance at the temperature of
the room, and the abscissae are the times.    If the specific heat of the
material were constant, and the rate of loss of heat were proportional
to the excess of temperature, the curve would be a straight line. It
will be observed that below a certain point this is very nearly the
case, but that there is a remarkable wave in the curve.       The tempe
rature was observed to be falling rapidly, then to be suddenly
retarded, next to increase, then again to fall.        The temperature
reached in the first descent was 680° C. The temperature to which
the iron subsequently ascends is 712° C.      The temperature at which
another sample of hard steel ceased to be magnetic, determined in
the same way by the resistance of a copper coil, was found to be
690° C.   This shows that within the limits of errors of observation
the temperature of recalescence is that at which the material ceases
to be magnetic.   This curve gives the material for determining the

quantity of heat liberated.       The dotted lines in the curve show
the continuation of the first and second parts of the curve, the
horizontal distance between these approximately represents the time
during which the material was giving out heat without fall of tempe
rature. After the bend in the curve the temperature is falling at the
rate of 0-21° C. per second. The distance between the two curves is
810 seconds. It follows that the heat liberated in recalescence of
this sample is 173 times the heat liberated when the iron falls in
temperature 1° C. With the same sample I have also observed an
ascending curve of temperature.      There is in this case no reduction
of temperature at the point of recalescence, but there is a very
substantial reduction in the rate at which the temperature rises.
V.   " Electrical   Resistance   of  Iron at   a High Temperature."
            By  J. Hopkinson.     Received March 14, 1889.
   Auerhach, Callendar, and I think also Tait, have observed that the
temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of iron is abnormally
high.    So far as I know no one has pushed his observations to the
temperature at which iron ceases to be magnetic.
   The accompanying curve shows the results of experiments made
 upon a very soft iron wire.    The abscissae are the temperatures as
 estimated by the resistance of a copper wire, the ordi nates represent
 the resistance of the iron wire having unit resistance at 20° C.     It

will be    seen  that the temperature coefficient of iron ranges from
0-0048 at the ordinary temperature to 0-018 at a temperature just
short of 855° C. ; it then suddenly changes to about 0-0067. The last
coefficient can only be regarded as a somewhat rough estimate.
   This temperature being a higher temperature than I had observed
previously in any case as the temperature at which a sample of iron
ceases to be magnetic, it appeared desirable to ascertain whether the
iron wire differed from other samples in this respect.          A ring was
formed of the wire, and was wound with a primary and secondary
coil, and the resistance of the secondary was determined when the
magnetisability of the iron disappeared.          It was found that this
resistance was the resistance which corresponded to a temperature of
870° C. ; this temperature agrees with that at which the discontinuity
in the resistance curve occurs, within the limits of errors of observa
tion.

   It is well known, that quite apart from a tendency to separate more
or less completely into different mixtures during solidification, certain
mixtures of molten metals show a tendency to separate into two alloys
of different densities on standing fused for some time.            Lead and zinc
and bismuth and zinc have been shown by Matthiessen and von Bose
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 11, p. 430) to form two such mixtures. We
find that aluminium and zinc or aluminium and bismuth also behave
in the same way. In each case two different alloys are formed, one con
sisting of the heavier metal with a little of the lighter one dissolved
therein, the other of the lighter metal containing a small quantity of
the heavier one.
   On the other hand, tin will alloy indefinitely in all proportions with
any one of the four metals, lead, bismuth, zinc, or aluminium, the
mixtures exhibiting no particular tendency to separate into two
different alloys on simply remaining at rest in a fused condition,
although in certain cases more or leas separation is apt to occur during
solidification, owing to partial formation of eutectic alloy.         On quickly
cooling a mass of 60 to 80 grams of mixed metal, fused in a small
narrow crucible and kept molten for some hours, an ingot is obtained,
the highest and lowest portions of which exhibit sensibly the same
composition on analysis ; no more difference being observed than may
reasonably be attributed to surface oxidation and volatilisation whilst
standing molten, and to incipient formation of eutectic alloy during
the act of solidification. Thus the following figures were obtained
with two ingots of zinc and tin, and similarly in the other cases : —
                                          Zinc.       Tin.      Zinc.     Tin.

  Various other metals, e.g., cadmium, antimony, silver, &c., appear to
  behave like tin in this respect.
     It occurred to us that it would be of interest to examine the
  behaviour under similar conditions of ternary mixtures where two of
  the ingredients are not miscible together in all proportions (like
  aluminium and lead), whilst the third is miscible indefinitely with
  either of the other two (like tin). A priori, it would seem probable that
  such mixtures would behave in a fashion similar to mixtures of
  alcohol, ether, and water.       It is well known that these three fluids can
  be mixed together in certain proportions so as to form a single homo
  geneous liquid, not separating into two different layers on standing ;
  whilst, on the other hand, certain mixtures of alcohol and ether, when
  agitated with water, ultimately form two different fluids, the heavier
 one consisting of water containing in solution some alcohol and ether,
 the lighter one of ether retaining the rest of the alcohol and some
 water.    By parity of reasoning it might be expected that with certain
 proportions a single stable alloy would result, whilst with others the
 mass would divide into two different ternary mixtures.            In point of
 fact this  is precisely  what   occurs.
    For a variety of reasons we selected the alloys of lead, tin, and zinc
 for our first experiments : these metals are easily obtained in quantity
 and of fair purity ; the mixtures are fusible at temperatures easily
 attained and controlled ; and the analysis of the resulting alloys is
comparatively simple and easily executed with accuracy, no unim
portant point when some 200 to 300 different alloys are to be ex
amined, as we found to be ultimately necessary.          Our first preliminary
experiments indicated that when the lead and zinc are present in
proportions not widely different (between the limits 3 to 1 and 1 to 3),
the quantity of tin requisite to prevent separation into two different
alloys was from     i  to f- (33 to 40 per cent.) of the total mass, i.e., such
mixtures, after standing quiescent in a molten state for several hoars
and then cooled, gave ingots exhibiting sensibly the same composition
at top and bottom.        For example, the following figures were obtained
with five different mixtures where the tin was always not less than
35 per cent. of the whole, whilst the zinc and lead varied in their ratio
between the limits 1 to 2 and 2 to 1 or thereabouts : —

These figures are the results of the analysis of the ingots obtained by
melting the various mixtures in a crucible, well stirring together for
 some minutes, pouring into the red-hot bowl of a plugged clay
 tobacco-pipe, and keeping molten for some hours whilst at rest, and
finally quickly cooling by removing the source of heat (a bunsen
burner).    The differences between the compositions of the top and
bottom portions of the ingots are obviously no greater than what may
be reasonably ascribed to surface oxidation and volatilisation, and
possible slight variation introduced through partial separation into
differently fusible alloys during solidification.
    On the other hand, the following figures were obtained with three
other mixtures, in which the tin constituted respectively about 9, 20,
and 27 per cent. of the whole, whilst the zinc and lead were in the
ratios 2 to 1, 1 to 1, and 1 to 2 in the three cases respectively : —

   These and various other similar experiments led ns to the con
clusion that the greater the proportion of tin present (provided it
does not exceed the limiting amount heyond which no separation
takes place) the more zinc is contained in the heavier alloy, and the
more lead in the lighter one ; but that the distribution of the tin
throughout the entire mass is by no means nniform, the lighter alloy
containing the greater percentage when the proportion of tin in the
total mass is low, and vice versd when it approaches towards the
limiting amount ; so that with a particular proportion of tin in the
total mass uniform distribution as regards weight percentage occnrs,
but with no other proportion.
   These first indications appeared to be of sufficient interest to be
worth following np by the examination of a large number of mixtures
so as to enable curves to be drawn representing the variations in
composition of the heavier and lighter alloys relatively to one another
and in the distribution of the tin throughout the compound mass.
Accordingly, we first of all attempted to find out whether a moderately
large variation in the temperature at which the mass was kept molten
had any great influence on the end result ; for if not, obviously much
laborious work would be saved, thermostats and arrangements for
keeping constant temperatures for long periods of time together and
such like devices, involving much complexity of working, being far
less indispensable than would otherwise be the case.           For this pur
pose   we  prepared  two  series  of  mixtures,   in each   of  which equal
 quantities of lead and zinc were weighed np with varying quantities
of tin. The metals were melted in a crucible (previously heated to a
dull red heat) with a little cyanide of potassium, well stirred together
with a clay rod for some minutes, and then poured into the red-hot
 bowl of a plugged clay tobacco-pipe and kept therein molten for four
 to five honrs. In the first series the bowl was kept hot in the flame
 of a bunsen burner lapping all round the bowl ; in the second, the heat
 was intensified by surrounding the bowl with a clay cylinder so as to
 jacket it. A bundle of pieces of thick platinum rod heated in exactly
 the same way and transferred to a calorimeter, gave with bowls not

jacketted temperatures varying in different experiments between
 550° and 580°, and averaging exactly 565° ; whilst when heated in
 pipe bowls jacketted with the cylinder, temperatures were indicated
varying between 675° and 705°, and averaging 689°, or 124° higher than
before.* It may therefore be fairly assumed that the average tem
 perature at which the mixtures were kept molten was not far from
 124° higher in the second series than in the first.
     After the requisite time had elapsed the lamp was removed, as also
 the jacketted cylinder when employed ; in a few minutes the contents
 of the pipe-bowl were solid, when the clay was broken away from the
 somewhat conical compound ingot formed.                   After filing away about a
 couple of millimetres from the outside, the top and bottom portions
 were cut off by a cold chisel or saw and analysed.                    Usually a well-
 marked line of separation between the heavier and lighter alloys
 formed and was easily distinguishable ; as long as the tin percentage in
 the total mass was low, this line was approximately in the middle of
 the mass, but with larger proportions of tin the dividing line gradually
 rose until the limit was being approached, beyond which no separation
 took place, when the dividing line was so near to the upper surface as
 to render it impossible to saw off even a thin layer of lighter alloy
without intermixture with more or less of the heavier one.
     The analysis in all cases was made as follows : a weighed portion
 (usually from 5 to 8 grams) was boiled with diluted pure nitric acid
 in a well-covered capacious beaker until complete oxidation was
 effected ; the liquid was then diluted and allowed to stand till cold
 and filtered. No appreciable quantity of tin was ever found in
 solution. t The filtrate was evaporated to a small bulk with excess of
 pure sulphuric acid, and the lead sulphate produced collected and
weighed ; the filtrate and washings from this sometimes contained
traces of lead ; if so, these were precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen

of 1050 grams ; the thermometer read to yjj of a degree centigrade. Taking the

bonate from the acid fluid ; wherefore we first precipitated it as sul

the precipitate in dilute hydrochloric acid (after collection on a filter)
before precipitating as carbonate.            Any traces of zinc not thrown
down thus were precipitated by adding a few drops of ammonium
sulphide to the filtrate and thus estimated, whilst any traces of
alumina and iron contained in the zinc oxide were determined and
subtracted (after weighing) by dissolving in hydrochloric acid and
supersaturating with ammonia.               Usually these various filtrate and
other corrections were all but infinitesimal : the analyses generally
added np to 99-8 to 99-9 per cent., and the percentages finally quoted
are usually reckoned upon the sum of the tin, lead, and zinc found
as 100 ; in some cases, more especially with the lighter alloys, the tin
and lead only were determimed, the zinc being taken by difference.

    Besides   these    forty ingots, however,           a  number of others were
obtained,    yielding numbers on analysis not agreeing at all well with
the forty, more especially as regards the lighter alloys.                 In all cases
the figures    were   just  such    as would   be obtained    if complete separation
by gravitation had not taken place, so that the lighter alloy retained
a little of the heavier one disseminated through it, and vice versa;
just as when ether and certain aqueous liquids are agitated together,
a kind of froth forms, which takes a long time before it entirely
separates, forming two clear liquids. As the experiments subsequently
detailed render it certain that these abnormal ingots were simply
cases where the separation was imperfect, the figures obtained with
them are not included in the above tables, but it is obvious that this
same sonrce of error may have applied to a lesser extent even to some
of the forty ingots not rejected.            No doubt this was actually the case
in some instances, on which account the curves obtained on plotting
the above figures show a certain amount of sinuosity and irregularity.
The error from this canse, however, as subsequently shown, is not
 serious ; so that the concordance between the curves got from the two
series of analyses respectively is sufficiently marked to show that no
 very considerable influence is exerted by a difference of temperature
amounting to some 124°, on the way in which a given mass of lead,
 tin, and zinc divides itself on standing molten.
    Three noteworthy curves are thus obtainable : —

 abscissa; and the zinc percentages as ordinates.

sents the corresponding curves of the second kind, and fig. 3 those
of the third kind.     Obviously, in each case there is little difference
between the continuous and dotted lines, so that it may be fairly
concluded that the effect of variation in temperature from 565° to
689° is negligible as compared with the experimental errors, more
especially those due to imperfect separation by gravitation of the two
alloys from one another.
   The curves representing the distribution (fig. 3) are remarkable.
As long as the tin percentage in the total mass is less than about six
teen the lighter alloy contains more tin than the heavier one ; at
about this point (representing some 14 per cent. in the heavier and
18 per cent. in the lighter alloy) the difference becomes a maximum
after which the difference diminishes, until at about 28 per cent. the
same percentage of tin is contained in both alloys. After this the
heavier alloy contains more tin than the lighter, the difference con
tinually increasing.
        Cames retarding Separation of Lighter and Heavier Alloy.
   Before proceeding further we thought it desirable to trace out the
causes rendering separation      incomplete,   even after some hours'
standing. At first we attributed it to the influence of traces of im
purities in the metals used, but on repeating the observations in
pipe-bowls with the purest samples of each metal obtainable, we still
occasionally got irregular results, showing that this was not the sole
cause.   Next we thought that the error might be due to the partial
formation of eutectic alloys during solidification, in such a way that

 the portions of the ingots analysed did not truly represent the com
 position of the lighter and heavier alloys whilst molten.                 To avoid
 this we devised an arrangement whereby we could draw samples
 from the molten mass whilst still fluid. This consisted of a crucible
 holding some 500 to 600 grams of molten alloy, with a hole drilled
 through the bottom, closed by a conical plug worked up and down by
 means of a screw and lever. At the required moment, by turning the
 lever the plug could be slightly raised by the screw, so that a little of
 the lowest layer of molten metal escaped through the valve thus
opened into an ingot mould placed to receive it.             Simultaneously the
top layer of molten metal could be sampled by a hot porcelain spoon.
 The crucible wns surrounded by a cylindrical clay jacket to keep in
the heat, which was supplied by a number of bunsen burners arranged
so as to form a ring of flame between the crucible and jacket.                   Ap
 parently    there was   no reason   whatever     why  this  arrangement     shonld
not work successfully ; but in practice we did not succeed in getting,
 by its means, any results at all on which reliance could be placed.
 The analyses indicated that instead of this arrangement giving more
complete separation than the pipe-bowls, it hardly ever gave so com
plete a one ; on drawing samples at different times, instead of the
separation      gradually becoming more perfect as time elapsed, the
opposite was often the case, some intermixing influence being ap
parently at work, which frequently was more powerfnl than the
effect of gravitation in causing the lighter and heavier alloys to
separate from one another.         For instance, the following numbers were
obtained in one experiment, indicating very incomplete separation as
compared with the pipe-bowl results : —

    In another case no sensible separation at all was brought about
after either four or eight hours with a mixture that separated readily
when fused in a tall narrow crucible.
    These particular two experiments are extreme cases as to irregu
larity ; but still, in almost every instance, the figures obtained with
the valve crucible were such as to show that the separation of heavier
and lighter alloys from one another therein was extremely imperfect.

     In  these cases it was clear that the formation of eutectic alloys during
     solidification was not the cause of the irregularities observed, whence
     presumably the same is true for the less irregular results obtained
     with the pipe-bowls. Ultimately we traced the cause to convection
     currents set up through unequal heating of the walls of the contain
     ing vessels at different levels, and found that the imperfect separation
    could be almost completely obviated by so heating the mass as to
    avoid this inequality of temperature.            This we ultimately effected by
    employing crucibles very long in proportion to their diameter (large
    test-tubes moulded on a core from a plastic mixture of fireclay and
    syrupy silicate of soda, diluted with about three times its weight of
     water), heated by immersion in a bath of molten lead some 8 or 9
    inches deep, contained in an iron cylindrical vessel (the lower two-
    thirds of a mercury bottle), surrounded by a concentric clay jacket
    and heated by a number of bunsen burners playing into the annular
    interspace.      The molten metals being well intermixed in a crucible
    (with   a little  potassium cyanide), the mixture was poured into a red-
    hot clay test-tube, which was then quickly transferred to the hot lead-
    bath, the month of the tube being covered with a heavy iron cap so as
    to depress the test-tube into the lead to such a depth that the top of
    the molten metal inside was some 2 inches below the surface of the lead
   in the bath whilst the tube was kept vertical. Under these conditions,
   practically complete separation was always brought about after six to
   eight hours in the lead-bath.

position. To diminish oxidation, a reducing atmosphere was main
tained in the upper part of the lead-bath by covering it loosely with a
lid and passing a jet of coal-gas inside. In some few instances the
test-tubes were not weighted down with iron caps, so that the level of
the metal inside was above the top of the lead ; under these circnm-
stances the upper part of the metal was largely heated by convection,
find in all such cases it was found that the lighter alloy retained some
of the heavier alloy interspersed through       the convection currents

   The figures obtained with the depressed tube are perfectly normal
(vide infra), whilst those obtained with the other are such as to show
that, owing to the convection currents set up, a little of the lighter
alloy was still intermixed with the heavier, whilst a considerable
amount of the heavier one was interspersed throughout the lighter
one.

     On plotting these numbers as before, it is at once evident that the
 curves thence obtained differ but little from those obtained in Series
 I  and II, excepting in being more regular, what differences exist being
 such as are obviously due to the more nearly complete separation now
 obtained in all cases ; whence it may reasonably be inferred that the
  conclusion previously arrived at is correct, viz., that a variation in
 temperature between 565° and 689° makes practically no difference in
 the way in which a given mass of metal divides itself on standing
 molten.     This conclusion is corroborated by the results described
 below, obtained with two other series of mixtures containing lead and
 zinc in the proportion 1 to 2, in the first of which a mean temperature
 close to 650° was employed, and in the second a temperature about
 100° higher; the curves deduced from the two series respectively
 differing from one another only by amounts barely, if at all, outside
 the limits of experimental error.
          Experiments with Lead and Zinc in Unequal Proportions.
    We next made several series of observations with lead and zinc in
unequal proportions and varying quantities of tin, with the object of
finding out how far the distribution of tin between the two resulting
alloys is influenced by the relative masses of metals present.              If the
alloys formed when completely separated from one another are re
spectively saturated solution of zinc in lead containing tin (bottom)
and saturated solution of lead in zinc containing tin (top), it should
result that the two first curves obtained as above described will be the
                                                                   2   I 2

same no matter what may be the relative proportions of zinc and lead
in the total mass ; and this, in point of fact, we find to be the case.
But it does not follow therefrom that with a mass of metal containing
a> per  cent. of tin the same pair of alloys will be obtained, no matter
in what relative proportions the zinc and lead may exist in the re
maining 100— x per cent. ; and, in point of fact, we find not only that
a different pair results for each variation in the relative proportions of
zinc and lead in such a case, but, further, that the curves representing
the relative distribution of tin in the two alloys are not the same for
all proportions between zinc and lead in the total mass. When zinc
predominates the curve rises less rapidly, the maximum difference in
tin percentage is attained later, and the point of equal distribution of
tin throughout the entire mass lies further from the origin than when
the zinc and lead are present in equal proportions in the entire mass ;
and vice versd when lead predominates.
    Thus the following values were obtained from a series of sixteen com
pound ingots, prepared in the lead-bath at an average temperature of
close to 650°, the masses remaining fused for about eight hours in each
 case, the proportions between zinc and lead in the metals weighed np
being uniformly 2 to 1.

   On plotting these two series it is obvious that the curves are prac
tically identical in both cases ; indicating, as above shown, that little,
if any, sensible difference is brought about by a considerable tem
perature variation in the way in which a given mass of metal divides
itself on standing. On the other hand, whilst the solubility curves of
zinc in lead-tin and of lead in zinc-tin thence derived are sensibly the
same as those derived from Series III, the tin distribution curves are
by no means identical therewith, especially with the highest tin per
centages.

the proportions 1 to 2. The following values were obtained from
twenty ingots fused about eight hours at a temperature close to 650°.

   On plotting these numbers it becomes evident that whilst the solu
bility carves of zinc in lead-tin and of lead in zinc-tin thence derived
are sensibly identical with those obtained from Series III, IV, and V,
the tin distribution curve is different from either of those obtained
with zinc and lead in the proportions 1 to 1 and 2 to 1.

and the ordinates zinc percentages for curve No. 1, and lead percent
ages for curve No. 2.         The two curves are not widely different at first.
but latterly curve No.       1 distinctly overlies No. 2.
  Fig. 5 represents the mean tin distribution curves derived fromtho
preceding observations, No. 1 being that derived from the experiments
where the zinc present was double the lead, No. 2 where the two
metals were in equal proportions, and No. 3 where the lead was
double the zinc. The maxima obtained correspond respectively with
the ordinate values 4-7, 4-6, and 3-7, and are situated at about the
abscissa values 15, 14, and 12 respectively.                  The crossing points
(points    of equal  tin  distribution    as regards weight percentage through
the mass) are respectively close to 29-0, 28-5, and 25-2 per cent. of tin.

zinc in heavier alloy, mean = T67; and 1*17 — 1*22 of lead in lighter
alloy, mean = 1*20. Obviously this arises from the fact that the
method of working adopted by Matthiessen and v. Bose did not allow
of so complete a separation taking place as was effected in our experi
ments, as they employed a far shorter time.
   Variation in mean Composition through Oxidation and Volatilisation.
   In melting and mixing together the metals employed, it is quite
impossible to avoid some loss by oxidation, even when a luminous gas
flame is directed into the crucible so as to maintain a reducing
atmosphere therein.        Moreover, some amount of volatilisation, espe
cially of zinc, takes place, owing to prolonged heating at 650 — 750°.
A number of observations made with mixtures that did not separate
into two alloys showed that the total quantity of tin in the final ingot
is but little, if at all, less than that originally weighed up ; some lead
is lost and more zinc, roughly averaging about twice as much as the
lead.    The total amount of loss, however, even after eight hours'
heating, is not very great; as a rule, ingots were made for which
about 80 grams of total metal were weighed up ; the weight of final
compound ingot was generally near to 77 grams (excluding mechanical
losses during stirring and transference to the clay test-tubes), about
3 grams representing the loss by oxidation and volatilisation.          In a
few cases a larger amount of oxidation took place, but comparatively
 rarely with careful handling.      The result of this action is to cause an
increment in the mean percentage of tin in the mass to the extent of
 something like one twenty-fifth of its value (i.e., a mass originally
containing 25 per cent. of tin will ultimately contain about 26).
 Simultaneously the ratio of zinc to lead is altered ; only to a small
 extent if these metals were originally in the proportion of 2 to 1,
but relatively more if the zinc were present to a lesser extent.
    In the foregoing experiments the proportions subsisting between
zinc, lead, and tin referred to are uniformly those in which the metals
were weighed up for use, and consequently not quite the same as those
actually subsisting in the compound ingots finally obtained; these
latter probably contained zinc and lead in ratios near to 2 to 1, 0-96 to
1, and 0-46 to 1, respectively, on the average.
                             Summary of Results.
   When a mixture of lead, tin, and zinc in the molten condition is
well stirred up by mechanical means and then left to itself for some
hours at as nearly as possible a uniform temperature, a single homo
geneous alloy results if the proportion of tin present is not less than
three-eighths of the whole ; but if materially less tin than this is

present, the mass divides itself into two different ternary alloys, lead
predominating in the heavier one and zinc in the lighter one. This
phenomenon      is entirely distinct from the segregation of alloys durin-r
solidification, in consequence of formation of eutectic or other differ
ently fusible alloys.
   If there is little or no inequality of temperature at different parts
of the mass, separation by gravitation only is complete in a few hours,
at any rate when tolerably pure metals are employed ; but if the
mode of heating is such that convection currents are set up, the
separation is greatly interfered with, and in extreme cases almost
entirely prevented.
   The heavier alloy is a saturated solution of zinc in lead containing
tin, and the lighter one a similar solution of lead in zinc containing
tin. No matter what the relative proportions between lead and zinc
in the original mass, the two alloys always correspond to two conju
gate points on the solubility curves of zinc in lead-tin and of lead in
zinc-tin.
   But little, if any, difference in the way in which a given mass
divides itself is noticeable, whether the temperature at which the
molten mass is maintained is below 600° C. or above 700° C.
   The tin contained in the mass does not distribute itself equally in
the two alloys except when present in one particular proportion,
which varies with the ratio of the zinc to the lead in the entire mass.
With less tin than this the lighter alloy, and with more the heavier
one, takes up the higher percentage of tin.
   Curves drawn representing the tin present in the heavier alloy as
abscissae, and the (+ or — ) excess of tin in the lighter alloy over
that in the heavier one as ordinates, are found to differ with the ratio
of zinc to lead in the entire mass. They always possess the same
general features, viz., rising from the origin to a maximum elevation,
then sinking down again to the base line, and crossing it so as to
become negative; but the position and height of the maximum, the
crossing point, and the general dimensions of the curve vary with the
ratio of zinc to lead in the mass.
   As a result of this, whilst an indefinite number of different mix
tures may be prepared, each one of which will give the same heavier
alloy, the lighter alloy simultaneously formed will be different in each
case ; and conversely.
   When no tin is present, lead dissolves zinc to such an extent as to
form an alloy containing 1*24 per cent. of zinc, and zinc dissolves lead
forming an alloy containing 1*14 per cent. of lead ; the higher values
found by previous observers being slightly incorrect through imper
fect separation.
   Before attempting to theorise on the causes leading to the remark
able way in which tin is distributed in these ternary alloys, we desire

   parallel cases, such as the ternary alloys obtained by adding tin to
   the immiscible pairs of metals, zinc and bismuth, aluminium and
   lead, and aluminium and bismuth ; or by similarly employing other
   metals instead of tin.   Nothing abuormal appears to characterise the
   solubility curves of zinc in lead-tin and of lead in zinc-tin ; in each
   case the amount of one metal dissolved by the other increases as the
   quantity of tin present increases, in such a way that the curves are
  somewhat concave upwards.

      In the year 1839 Gauss published his celebrated Memoir on
  Terrestrial Magnetism, in which the potential on the earth's surface
  was calculated to twenty-four terms of a series of surface harmonics.
  It was proved in this memoir that if the horizontal components of
  magnetic force were known all over the earth the surface potential
  could be derived without the help of the vertical forces, and it is well
  known now how these latter can be used to separate the terms of the
  potential which depend on internal from those which depend on
  external sources.      Nevertheless, Gauss made use of the vertical
  forces in his calculations of the surface potential, in order to ensure
  a greater degree of accuracy.        He assumed for this purpose that
  magnetic    matter was   distributed through the interior of the earth,
  and mentions the fair agreement between calculated and observed
 facts as a justification of his assumption.     In the latter part of the
  memoir it was suggested that the same method should be employed
 in the investigation of the regular and secular variations.
     The use of harmonic analysis to separate internal from external
 causes has never been put to a practical test, but it seems to me to
 be specially well adapted to inquiries on the causes of the periodic
 oscillations of the magnetic needle.
     If the magnetic effects can be fairly represented by a single term
 in the series of harmonics as far as the horizontal forces are con
 cerned, there should be no doubt as to the location of the disturbing
 cause, for the vertical force should be in the opposite direction if the
 origin is outside from what it should be if the origin is inside the
 earth. As the expression for the potential contains in one case the
 distance from the earth's centre in the numerator, in the other case
in the denominator, and as the vertical force depends on the diffe

rential coefficient with regard to the distance from the earth to the
centre, each single term in the series is of opposite sign according to
the location of the cause ; but what is true for each single term need
not be true for the sum of the series. By a curious combination of
terms the vertical forces might possibly be of the same sign on
whichever of the two hypotheses it is calculated. In any case, how
ever, the differences between the two results will be of the same
order of magnitude as the vertical force itself.     If it were then a
question simply of deciding whether the cause is outside or inside,
without taking into account a possible combination of both causes,
the result should not be doubtful, even if we have only an approxi
mate knowledge of the vertical forces.
                   I
   Two years ago showed that the leading features of the hori.ontal
components for diurnal variation could be approximately represented
by the surface harmonic of the second degree and first type, and that
the vertical variation agreed in direction and phase with the calcula
tion on the assumption that the seat of the force is outside the earth.
The agreement seemed to me to be sufficiently good to justify the
conclusion that thej greater part of the variation is due to causes
outside the earth's surface.     Nevertheless, it seemed advisable to
enter more fully into the matter, as in the first approximate treat
ment of the subject a' number of important questions had to be left
untonched.    I now publish the results of an investigation which has
been carried out, as far as the observations at my disposal have
allowed me to do. My[original conclusions have been fully confirmed,
and some further information has been obtained, which       I believe to
be of importance.
   I have made use of the observations taken at Bombay, Lisbon,
Greenwich, and St. Petersburg.      The horizontal components of the
diurnal variation during the year 1870 were in the first place reduced
to the same system of coordinates and to the same units. If we
remember that experience has shown the diurnal variation to be very
nearly the same for places in the same latitude, except near the
magnetic pole, and also that it is symmetrical north and south of the
equator, we may for a given time of day assume the horizontal
components known over eight circles of latitude, four of which are
north and four south of the equator.     If we chose the period of the
year for which the reduction is made to be that corresponding to the
summer months in the northern hemisphere, we must take the
variation in the southern hemisphere to be the same as that found
during the winter months north of the equator.        This was done in
one part of the inquiry ; in the other the mean of the whole year was
taken, and in that case the same values hold north and south of the
equator, with the same sign for the force towards geographical north,
and opposite sign for the force towards the geographical west.

 1889.]       The  Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism.               483
    From the horizontal components the potential was calculated in
 terms of a series of surface harmonics. It was found that in order
 to represent both the summer and the winter effect with sufficient
accuracy thirty-eight terms were necessary.             In this calculation the
 vertical forces were not made use of at all.
    Unfortunately we do not possess complete records for the vertical
 force variation during the year 1870, except at Lisbon ; but the type
 of that force is very nearly the same from year to year, varying only
 slightly in amplitude. It is shown that, as far as the conclusions
drawn in the paper are concerned, an accurate knowledge of the
amplitude of the vertical force is not required.              I have chosen for
comparison the vertical force of Bombay in the year 1873, and for
 Greenwich in 1882. As regards St. Petersburg, vertical force records
exist for 1870, but they have not been corrected for temperature
variations of the magnet, and are therefore of doubtful importance.
I   have therefore used the St. Petersburg observations for 1878, in
addition to those for 1870.
    From the potential, as calculated from the horizontal components,
we can deduce the vertical force, either on the assumption that the
variation is due to an outside cause, or that it is due to an inside
cause ; and compare the vertical forces thus found with the vertical
forces as actually observed.
    If we put both into the form
                                  r„ cosw (t — 1„),
we can obtain an idea of the agreement as regards amplitude and
phase for each harmonic term. The following tables give the results
for n =     1  and n  = 2, that is, for the diurnal and the semi-diurnal
variation.

the most important station, not only on account of its geographical
position, but also because the observed vertical forces apply to the

 1889.]      The  Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism.          485
 same year as the calculated ones, the result is strikingly in favour of
the    outside force.    The results for Greenwich argue in the same
direction. As regards St. Petersburg, the results for 1870 neither
agree with one nor with the other hypothesis, and it has already been
mentioned that the observations for 1870 are doubtful, but the results
for 1878 agree well with the hypothesis of an outside disturbing force.
    Table   III gives the comparison for amplitude. It is seen that the
 observed amplitudes are throughout smaller than the calculated ones.
 If curves are drawn representing the results of Tables I, II, III, it is
 clearly seen how well the calculated vertical forces agree ' with the
 observed ones as regards phase, if we assume the cause of the varia
tion to be outside.
    If we then take it as proved that the primary cause of this varia
 tion comes to us from outside the earth's surface, we are led ro
consider that a varying magnetic potential must cause induced
 currents within the earth, if that body is a sufficiently good con
 ductor. These induced currents might be the cause of the apparent
reduction in amplitude. As my colleague, Professor Lamb, has given
considerable attention to the problem of currents in a conducting
sphere,    I consulted him, and he gave me the formulae by means of
which the induced currents can be calculated. His investigation is
given in an appendix to the paper.        The result is very interesting.
 If the earth is treated as a conducting sphere, the observed reduction
in amplitude is accounted for, but 'that reduction should be accom
 panied by a change of phase which is not given by observation. We
can reconcile all facts if we assume, as suggested by Professor Lamb,
 the average conductivity of the outer layers of the earth to be very
 small, so that the reduction in amplitude is chiefly due to currents
induced in the inner layers. If the conductivity inside is sufficiently
large, a considerable reduction in amplitude would not be accom
panied by a sensible change of phase.         We have arrived, therefore,
at the following result :  —
    The vertical forces of the diurnal variation can be accounted for if we
as0ume an outside cause of the variation, which induces currents in the
earth, and if the earth's conductivity is greater in the lower strata than
near the surface.
    Professor Balfour Stewart's suggestion that convection currents in
the atmosphere moving across the lines of the earth's magnetic forces
are the causes of the daily variation, gains much in probability by
this investigation. If the daily variation of the barometer is accom
panied by a horizontal current in the atmosphere similar to the
tangential motion in waves propagated in shallow canals, and if the
conductivity of the air is sufficiently good, the effects on our magnetic
needles would be very similar to those actually observed.              The
difficulty as to the conductivity of the air is partly met by the author's

investigation of the behaviour of stses through which electric dis

   It will be interesting to    follow oat the investigation, especially
with a view of examining the influence       of sun-spot variation.     The
question of magnetic disturbances is more complicated, but as mag-
netical observatories are being established in many countries, the time
may not be far distant when we shall be able to bring the irregular
disturbances within the reach of calculation.
   In order to facilitate the necessarily long computations, the author
makes an appeal to the heads of magnetic observatories to reduce the
regular variation according to the method adopted by Wild at
St. Petersburg, or that in use at Greenwich, the two being nearly
identical. The variations should also be reduced to the geographical
coordinates, instead of to magnetic coordinates.

    When the lumbar vertebrae of a native Australian, or of several
other low races of man, are placed in apposition, the centra form a
curved column, with the concavity directed to the front. In other
words, the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae are not moulded as in the
European, but are wedge-shaped in the opposite direction.            This con
dition can      be expressed   and  contrasted   in  the   different  races by
formulating a lumbo-vertebral index. In calculating this index the
anterior vertical diameter of the vertebral body is taken as the standard,

and as equal to 100.*         A lumbar   vertebra, therefore, with an index of
100, may be regarded           as  neutral ; it is equally deep in front anil
behind, and can in no way contribute to the formation of a curve in
the antero-posterior direction.         A vertebra, on the other hand, with
an index of 100 + , is shaped in a fashion unfavourable to the forma
tion of a curve with the convexity directed forwards ; its posterior
vertical depth is greater than its anterior vertical depth.                Again, a
vertebra    with    an  index   of 100—   is moulded   in  a manner     favourable
to the formation of a curve with the convexity looking forwards.                  It
is deeper in front      than  behind.
    In seventy-six European spines, and in seventeen spines of abori
ginal Australians, the average indices obtained for the several lumbar
vertebrae were as follows : —

    The difference brought out by these figures is very marked. Indeed,
in this respect the Europeans and Australians constitute the two
extremes : no race shows an index lower than that of the European,
and no race presents an index higher than that of the Australian.
    In the investigations which I made three years ago into the con
stitution of the lumbar curve in Man and the Apes, I was very early
 convinced that little could be learned regarding the character and
degree of the curve from the lumbo-vertebral iudex. I was led to
 adopt this conclusion as the following facts became apparent : —
     1. In European spines a high index is not unfrequently associated
 with a high degree of curvature.

 marked than in the European.
    My views upon this point were expressed as follows : — " From the
 differences exhibited by the lumbo-vertebral index, some might be
 inclined to argue that the European had assumed the erect attitude
 at a period antecedent to the low races.      Such a deduction would be
 altogether untenable.     The difference in the form-adaptation of the
 lumbar bodies with reference to the curve in a European and in a low
 race can easily be explained when we reflect upon the difference in
 their habits. The European, who leads a life which rarely necessitates
 his forsaking the erect attitude except as an intermittent occurrence,
 and then for short periods, has sacrificed in the lumbar part of the
 vertebral column flexibility for stability.  It is evident that the deeper
 the bodies of the vertebrae grow in front the more permanent. stuble,
 and fixed the lumbar curve will become, and the more restricted will
 be the power of bending forwards at this region of the spine.          The
 savage in whose daily life agility and suppleness of body are of so
 great an account, who is frequently called upon to pursue game in a
 prone position, and climb trees in search of fruit, preserves the
pithecoid condition of vertebrae in the lumbar region, and on account
of this a superior flexibility of the spine must result
 There is no reason to suppose that this condition is associated with a
 smaller degree of curvature in this region."
    Still in the absence of fresh spines of the lower races, where the
lumbar region, composed of combined vertebral bodies and inter
vertebral disks, could be examined, proof positive upon the degree
and character of the lumbar curve was wanting. For more than three
years I have made every endeavour to obtain the vertebral colnmn
of a native Australian, Negro, Andaman, or Bushman.                Through
the kindness of my friend Professor T. P. Anderson Stuart, of
Sydney University, I have at last succeeded in securing the spine of
an Australian girl, aged sixteen.     It was sent in a zinc box, in which
it was packed with great skill and care. The curvatures were there
fore in no way interfered with, and it arrived in a very perfect con
dition. The erector muscles had been partially removed, but not to
such an extent as to produce any material alteration in the flexures.
   The flatness of the doretal curvature and the strongly marked
cervical curve were the points in the Australian spine which on
cursory examination chiefly attracted attention. In other respects it
was apparently little different from the vertebral column of a
European. The strong backward bend of the cervical part wa-
perhaps the most striking feature.        The flexibility of this region of
the spine and the strength and elasticity of the ligamenta subflava

           The   Spinal Curvature in an Aboriginal Australian.             491
 were very remarkable,        and altogether confirmed the view which I had
 formerly expressed upon this point from an examination of the cervical
 neural spines of the native Australian.*
    In order that     precise  information regarding the curvatures might
 be acquired, the spine was thoroughly frozen, and then divided in the
 mesial plane with a saw. A very successful section was obtained,
 and when the spine was still in the frozen condition, with all its parts
 immovably fixed, a tracing was taken of each cut surface, and the
 intervertebral disks and vertebral bodies were measured.                    At
 intervals the spine was returned to the freezing mixture, so as to
 keep it thoroughly consolidated until all the details required were
 ascertained.
    In the accompanying woodcut the tracing of the spine section,
 reduced by photography, is represented.          Similar tracings taken from
 the spines of an Irish female, aged thirty-five, and a young female
 Chimpanzee, reduced to a corresponding size, are placed on either side
 of the Australian spine for purposes of comparison.
    The flatness of the dorsal curve in the Australian is very pro
 nounced, and is more marked than in the Chimpanzee, in which both
of the primary curvatures (dorsal and sacral) are notably deficient.
Tt further resembles the Chimpanzee in the high degree of cervical
curvature which it exhibits.
    Points of Inflexion. — In determining these we have not examined the
curvature formed by the anterior face of the vertebral column. The true
curvature of the vertebral column is that of its axis, and it is this that
we have tested. The central points of the bodies of the vertebrae and
of the intervertebral disks were carefully ascertained, and a mean
curve was drawn through them.             In European spines the point at
•which each curve gives place to that which succeeds it is very
constant, and is not affected, so far as my observations go, by the
degree of curvature in the different regions.          The cervico-dorsal point
of inflexion in the European is situated in the disk between the
second and third dorsal vertebrae. The lumbo-dorsal point of inflexion
in the female is placed in the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, but
in the male it is a little lower down. The lumbar curve gives place to
the sacral curve at a point in the lumbo-sacral disk.
   In the Australian spine a greater portion of the dorsal column in
involved in the dorsal curve. Above, this curvature only gives way to
the cervical convexity in the disk between the first and second dorsal
vertebrae, whilst below it includes the last dorsal vertebra, as in the
European male, and the change to the lumbar convexity is effected in
the dorso-lumbar disk.
   These are points of comparatively trifling importance.           The great
distinction between the Australian and European spine is found in the
               •  '
                    Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' July, 1880.

 manner in which the lambar convexity gives place to the sacral con
 cavity. In the European this takes place in the lumbo-sacral disk of
 cartilage, and is sharp and sadden, forming a very decided angle.        In
 the Australian it is so gradual and undecided that in the first instance
 I sketched the lumbar curve so as to include the first sacral vertebra.
 Such   a curve  line, however, falls about  1 mm. behind the central point
of the lumbo-sacral disk.       It  is bust therefore  to consider that the
lumbar curve,     as  in the European, ends in that disk. But the sacral
concavity    does not  begin at once. If the central points of the lumbo
sacral disk, the first sacral vertebra, and the first sacral disk be joined,
it will be found that they lie in a straight line, and that the sacral
concavity only begins in the first sacral disk. The close association
which is thus established between the first piece of the sacrum and
the lumbar column is very largely due to the oblique position which is
assumed by the last lumbar vertebra.         This is a striking peculiarity,
and constitutes perhaps one of the most characteristic features of the
A ustralian spine.        In my " Cunningham Memoir " I describe a
European spine, in which the first sacral vertebra is actually included
in the lumbar curve, but this was brought abont in a different
manner.      It was not due to a shifting of the last lumbar vertebra,
but to a shifting of the first sacral element which had separated
itself from its neighbours, and thus become associated with the
lumbar column.
   A glance at the tracing of the Australian spine is sufficient to show
that the lumbar column is constructed upon principles which are
calculated to render it exceedingly flexible and elastic.        When we
look at the corresponding region of the European an impression of
great stability is conveyed to the mind.
   In the Chimpanzee, the cervico-dorsal point of inflexion, as in the
European, is placed in the disk between the second and third dorsal
vertebrae. In the spine figured in fig. 1 the dorsal and lumbar axial
curves meet in the central point of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, but in
the other specimens which I have examined, the point of demarcation
between these curves corresponded to the central point of the inter
vertebral disk between the twelfth and thirteenth dorsal vertebra-.
The flatter dorsal curve of the Australian therefore involves a greater
length of the vertebral column than the corresponding deeper curve
in the Chimpanzee and European.
    But, further, the lumbar axial curve in the Chimpanzee involves
one or two of the sacral vertebrae.       In the spine of the female Chim
panzee figured in the text, the first and second sacral vertebrae are
included, but in other specimens examined, only the first sacral
element falls into the line of the lumbar curve.       An important grada
tion is thus established by the Australian spine, in which the first
sacral vertebra has just escaped being included in the axial curve of

             The Spinul Curvature in an Aboriginal Australian.                 493
the lumbar region, and occupies a place which renders it impossible
to associate it either with the cnrve above or the carve below.
    in the Chimpanzee the first sacral vertebra is brought into associa
tion with the lumbar region by the slight degree of backward incli
nation of the sacrum; but another factor also comes into play,
although to a much less extent, and that is the oblique position of
the last lumbar vertebra.
    Let us examine these two factors which exercise so marked an
influence in produoing this modification of the curvature in the
Australian and Chimpanzee spines.                  The sacro-vertebral angle can
be tested in a variety of ways, but the most convenient method is to
prolong the axis lines of the last lumbar and first sacral vertebite, and
determine the angle which is formed at the point of intersection. In
the spines of five European females the average angle thus obtained
was 137° 40'.          But I am inclined to think that in typical cmses the
angle    in  question is not so open.       In the young female figured in the
text, it is only 117° 20' ; whilst in the Australian it was determined
to be 141°.       In the young Chimpanzee, on the other hand, it attains
a magnitnde of 166°.            But before coming to a definite decision upon
this point,      it  is well   to  test the matter in another way.          This is
rendered necessary by the peculiar position of the last lumbar vertebra
in the Australian and also, but to a less degree, in the Chimpanzee.
Let us take the axis line of the fourth lumbar vertebra in the human
spines, and the third lumbar or corresponding vertebra in the Chim
panzee, and note the angle which is formed by the intersection of this
 by the axis line of the first sacral vertebra.             The angles obtained by
this method for the three spines fignred are :            —
                 European.             Australian.            Chimpanzee.
                    114°                  120c                    156°
    So far, then, as      it is possible to draw     a  conclusion from one spine,
 we   may say that the sacral obliquity in the Australian is not so
 marked as in the European.              At the same time it is right to state
 that  I  have examined individual European spines which exhibited a
 sacro-vertebral angle as open if not more so than that of the Aus
 tralian. In these cases, however, special causes existed for this small
 degree     of sacral obliquity.
    The peculiar position occupied by the last lumbar vertebra               in the
 Australian can be rendered evident by ascertaining the angle                which
 is formed by the intersection of its axis line by the axis line             of the
 fourth lumbar vertebra.            The following are the angles thus        deter
 mined    : —
                            European.               Australian.

494                           Dr. D.   J.  Cunningham.
It    is this obliquity of the last lumbar vertebra in the Australian
which has the effect of so nearly placing the first sacral vertebra in
the line of the axial lumbar curve.
     In Troglodytes the last lumbar vertebra* is closely associated with
the sacrum.          This constitutes a striking character of the column
 when seen in mesial section.            At first sight the vertebra in question
appears to belong to the sacrum.                  The intervertebral disk which
intervenes is very thin ; indeed, in a young specimen, it is not much
thicker than those interposed between the sacral elements, and it
cannot be compared for a moment with the thick pads between the
lumbar vertebrae. This intimacy of relationship is still further borne
out by the examination of the macerated skeleton, because it is
extremely common to find the last lumbar vertebra either fixed to the
sacrum by osseous union, or taking on sacral characters by the
assumption of the characteristic sacral aiae or rib elements.                  Of the
twelve skeletons of Troglodytes, in which the lumbo-sacral region is
mentioned in the catalogue of the Museum of the Royal College of
Surgeons in England, seven are described as presenting this pecu
liarity.
    In the European and in the Australian, the last lumbar vertebra
is separated from the sacrum by a thick pad of intervertebral
substance.        Nevertheless, we occasionally find in the human spine
the last lumbar vertebra either fused to the sacrum or developing on
one or both sides a sacral ala.               Professor Kollman, of Basel, has
recently exhibited at the Anatomische Gesellschaft at Wurzbnrg
(May, 1888), a series of specimens in which the different gradations
of this anomaly were illustrated.!             During the last four or five years
about seventy-five sacra and last lumbar vertebrae have been ex
amined in -the macerated state in the Anatomical Department of
Trinity College.         From these I have obtained one specimen in which
 the fusion between the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae is almost
complete, and three fifth lumbar vertebrae with a sacral ala developed
 on one or both sides.         We have little information on this point in so
 far as the spines of the low races are concerned ; but it is somewhat
 significant that in five Australian and in two Andaman skeletons,

     Lumbar Curve. —A single glance at the tracing obtained from
  the mesial section of the Australian spine, and which has been
  reproduced      in fig. 1, will be sufficient to dissipate any doubt
  that may be remaining regarding the presence of a lumbar convexity
  in the vertebral column of this race.              Not only does it exist, but
  it is present in a very pronounced form. Sir William Turner, who
  has studied the lumbar vertebrae of several of the low races, has
  endeavoured to arrive at the proper lumbar curvature by careful
  articulation of the vertebrae.          " The upper border of the superior
  articular facet of the vertebra below was placed in the same trans
  verse plane as the upper border of the inferior articular facet of the
 vertebra above."t In the Australian he was led to believe that above
 the level of the lower border of the fourth luuibar vertebra the
 lumbar column was faintly concave forwards.                  At the same time he
  carefully guards himself by insisting that true and trustworthy
 evidence upon this point can only be acquired by the actual exami
 nation of the fresh spine.
     A convenient although a somewhat arbitrary way of determining
 the degree of prominence in the lumbar region in sectional tracings
 of the spine is to draw a straight line from the anterior extremity
 of the lower surface of the last lumbar vertebra to the anterior end of
 the upper surface of the first lumbar vertebra (vide fig. 1). By the
 eye we can readily judge the amount of projection which lies in front
 of this line in the different tracings, but for accurate comparison it is
 advisable to formulate an index.              This can be done by taking the
 length of the lumbar column (measured from the centre of the Vpper
 surface of the first lumbar vertebraj to the centre of the lower
 surface of the last lumbar vertebra), as the standard and equivalent
to 100, and then comparing it with the distance between the inter
 secting line and the point of greatest prominence.                   A high index
will indicate a strongly pronounced curve, and a low index a feeble
 degree of curvature.        The indices of the lumbar curve ascertained in
this way from the three tracings in fig. 1 are the following : —-
                  European.          Australian.          Chimpanzee.

496                         Dr. D.   J. Cunningham.
   The European and the Australian present to all intents and
purposes an equal degree of prominence.               The Chimpanzee exceeds
them both in this respect.          It may be well to state that the index
expressed by the spine of the European closely corresponds with what
I have found to be the average (9-5) for Irish females. On the other
hand, when we consider the long period required for the full
development and thorough consolidation of the lumbar curve in the
human spine, we are forced to admit that it is highly improbable that
the index obtained for the Australian expresses the average degree of
curvature for that race.         The girl from which it was taken was said
to be sixteen years old, and the condition of the epiphyses, &c.,
afforded abundant evidence that the age had not been overstated.
Now Balandin,* who has examined the vertebral column in different
subjects at the tenth, twelfth, sixteenth, and twentieth year, assures
us that in none of these has he found consolidation of the lumbar
curve.     He considers that it does not become absolutely stable until
ailult life. Unfortunately we do not possess a sufficient number of
tracings of mesial sections of the young spine to come to a decided
opinion npon this point ; but in the beautiful drawing which is given
by Dr. Symingtont of such a section of a girl, aged thirteen, the
lumbar curve is very feebly marked.                I  am inclined to consider,
therefore, that further investigation will probably show that the
carve index of the Australian girl is slightly below the adult
standard.      The investigations which       I carried out npon living Bush
men, and which are recorded in my " Cunningham Memoir," certainly
seemed to indicate that in that race, at any rate, the lumbar curve in
the erect attitude is in excess of what we find in the European.                 Of
course the greater flexibility which I believe the spines of the black
races 'possess would tend to exaggerate the curve iu the standing
posture, and at the same time produce the opposite effect when the
spins was relieved from its superincumbent burden.
    In the Australian spine the point of greatest projection in front of
the intersecting line which we have used to determine the degree of
lumbar prominence is the anterior border of the upper surface of the
fourth lumbar vertebra.          This corresponds with what we find in the
European male, but in the European female the most projectiug point
is placed higher, and is formed by the anterior border of the lower
surface of the third lumbar vertebra.             But the true summit of the
lumbar curve is the point of maximum axial curvature, and in the
Australian this is situated in the centre of the fourth lumbar vertebra.
Again this is identical with what we observe in the European male,

   but in the European female the summit of the axial curve is placed in
   the disk, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.
     In two particulars, then, the Australian spine resembles the vertebral
  column of a European male more than that of a European female,
  viz., in the point of maximum curvature in the lumbar region, and in
  the fact that the curvature does not include the last dorsal vertebra.
  The youth of the girl from which it was taken may account for these
  peculiarities : the spine may not have had time to acquire its special
  sexual characters, or its full degree of lumbar curvature.
     It is self-evident that when a curve is established in a region where
  the vertebral bodies are not moulded in accordance with it, the pro
  duction of the curvature must be due to the shape of the interver
  tebral disks.      The difference in height between the anterior and
 posterior surfaces of the European lumbar vertebrae (with the excep
  tion of the fifth) is so slight that it can have little influence in deter
 mining the curve in this region. The difference is to be regarded as
 the consequence and not as the cause of the curve.             The lumbar con
 vexity is mainly produced by the intervertebral disks, and when we
 reflect upon the manner in which the curvature is called into existence,*
 we can readily understand why this should be so.              In the Australian
 spine the lumbar prominence is produced entirely by the interverte
 bral disks. The vertebral bodies, with the single exception of the
 fifth, are fashioned in a manner unfavourable to the production of a
 curve of which the convexity is directed forwards.
     The table (pp. 498-9) gives the proportions and indices of the lumbar
vertebrae and intervertebral disks in the Australian and European
 spines figured in the text, and also for purposes of comparison the
indices of the same parts in four additional European spines.
     The index of the lumbar vertebrae in the Australian girl (101 "4) is
low when we consider that for this race the average index is 107"8.
But this average has been largely obtained from males, and there is
every reason to believe that the index of the female is very consider
ably below this. The four female Australian spines which measured       I
when preparing my " Cunningham Memoir," gave an average lumbo-
vertebral index of 103*1, and of these one had an index of 100'9, and
another an index so low as 96'7. To all intents and purposes, there
fore, the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae in the spine of the Australian
girl are neutral in so far as the production of a lumbar curve is con
cerned.      The intervertebral disks are the parts which determine the
curvature, and in conformity with this they present the low index
of 49'5. A very special feature in this spine is the small amount of
depth exhibited by the lumbar disks posteriorly. It is a character
which at once appeals to the eye when the tracing of the mesial
section is examined.          The two disks which contribute most largely

   In this table the indices of the intervertebral disks have been calculated in the
same manner as those of the vertebral bodies. The anterior vertical depth in each
case has been taken as the standard, and equal to 100.       By multiplying the poste
rior vertical diameter by 100 and dividing the result by the anterior vertical
diameter, the indices have been arrived at.
to the curve are the fourth and fifth. The indices of these are 28-6
and 38-4 respectively.
    The European spine which we have selected for comparison with
the Australian spine also presents a somewhat low lumbo-vertebral
index, viz., 91 -0. The intervertebral index is consequently higher
                                         Fig. 2.

 than   is usually the case.   Perhaps the average which is given in the
 table for the four Irish spines more nearly expresses the relative share
 taken by vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks in the production
of the curve.      In these the average lumbo-vertebral index is 96-3
and the average intervertebral index 65-6.
     In analysing the composition of the axial curve in the lumbar
 region of the Australian spine, I have had the advantage of the advice
 and assistance of my friend and colleague Professor Alexander, of I he
 Engineering School in Trinity College, Dublin.      The drawings which
 illustrate this point were executed by him. The axial lumbar curve
 was found to be composed of the segments of three circles.      Thus the
 portion of the curve which traverses the central points of the fifth
 lumbar vertebra and of the disk immediately above and below it, con
 stitutes one arc ; the central points of the third and fourth lumbar
 vertebra, and of the third and fourth intervertebral disks, are traversed
 by the arc of a second and larger circle ; whilst the line passing
 through the central points of the dorso-lumbar disk and of the fir>-t.
 second, and third lumbar vertebrae with the intervening disks, forms
 the segment of a third and still larger circle. Segments of three
 circles can also be detected in the axial lumbar curve of the European,
 but the parts entering into the formation of these are different. The
 fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae with the fourth and fifth disks are
 ranged in the arc of the lowest and smallest circle ; the second, third,
 and fourth lumbar vertebrae with the two intervening disks, constitute
 the segment of another circle ; whilst the twelfth dorsal vertebra and
the first and second lumbar vertebrae, with the interposed disks, form
the segment of a third circle.
    As I have explained in my " Cunningham Memoir," where I have
entered somewhat fully into this point, the composition of the differ
ent arcs of the axial curve is one into which many fallacies may
creep.     Slight inaccuracies in the tracing or a deviation from the
mesial plane in sawing the spine will tend to vitiate the results.
    The radii of the three arcs which build up the axial lumbar curve
present very different lengths.        In the lower part of the lumbar
column of the Australian the bend is much sharper and more sudden
than in the European.        This is rendered evident when the radii of
the two lowest arcs are compared with each other.             Again, the
highest segment in the European shows very little deviation from a
straight line. It presents a radius more than twice the length of the
highest segment in the Australian spine.          In the European ihe
lumbar curve is more uniform and gradual throughout. The lengths
of the radii of the different arcs of the two spines were ascertained to
be as follows : —

   The interposition of a straight piece between the lumbar and sacral
curves of the Australian spine is well seen in fig. 2.                    It certainly
offers  in  this respect a marked contrast to the European, in which
the sacral curve breaks off at once from the lumbar curve.
   Relative Lengths of the different Regions of the Vertebral Column of
the Australian. — Aeby* has called attention to the fact that in the two
sexes, and at different periods of life, remarkable differences are
found in the relative lengths of the different regions of the vertebral
column.       The method which we have adopted for ascertaining the
degree and quality of the spinal curvature affords us at the same
time a very accurate means of comparing the Australian with the
European from this point of view.                 The measurements were made
along the fore surface of the spine, and the results obtained showed
that the Australian spine corresponds in this respect in the closest
manner with the vertebral column of the adult European female.                      Its
total length from the base of the sacrum to the tip of the odontoid
process was 526 mm.          The cervical region measured 112 mm., the
dorsal region 241 mm., and the lumbar region 173 mm.
   In order that we may compare the relative length of each of these
regions with what we find in the European, let us regard the fore
surface of the movable column as being equal to 100.                  The following
table shows the close similarity which exists in this respect between
the Australian girl and the adult European female : —

    In the above table, I have also introduced the proportions which
Aeby gives for the sixteen-year-old girl. It is carious that the Aus
tralian girl should approximate more nearly the adult European
female.
    Proportion of Bone and Cartilage in the Lumbar Region of the Spine.
— When       the tracings which are reproduced in fig. 1 are closely
examined, it becomes apparent that in the lumbar region the constituent
elements, viz., the bones and the intervertebral disks, are not present
in corresponding proportions in the different spines.                  The vertical
diameters of the bodies of the lumbar vertebra differ very appre
ciably in the three spines, and with this there is a difference in the
thickness of the intervertebral disks.               In order that we may the
more easily contrast the spines from this point of view,                    I  have
formulated an index which may be termed the Sagitto-vertical lumbar
index.     In calculating this, the sagittal diameter measured from
the centre of the posterior face to the centre of the anterior face
of the vertebral body is taken as the standard and equal to 10Ct.
The proportion between this diameter and the vertical diameter,
measured from the centre of the upper surface to the centre of the
lower surface of the vertebral body, can thus be readily expressed.
A high index will indicate a long vertebral body ; a low index, on
the other hand, will indicate a short vertebral body.                  In the table
which follows I have introduced the Baboon, Macaque, and Orang,
with the view of enabling us to decide whether or not the difference
exhibited in the sagitto-vertical lumbar index of the European,
Australian, and Chimpanzee is one from which any important deduc
tion may be drawn.
    Two points are rendered very manifest by the above figures, viz.,
(1), that there is a rapid and decided increase in the length of the
lumbar vertebral bodies as we pass from the European, through the
Australian, Chimpanzee, and Baboon to the Macaque ; and (2), that
as the bones elongate the cartilaginous disks become shortened.
    The difference in relative length of the lumbar vertebrae in the
European and Australian is very marked, the sagitto-vertical index of
the former being 80-9, and of the latter 87-0.                It must be borne in
mind, however, that I have only had an opportunity of examining
the one Australian.*         Again, it is remarkable that the Orang in the
height of its vertebrae should show such a decided deviation from
other Apes, and approach so closely to Man. A mesial section through
the Orang renders this character apparent to the eye.f
    In estimating the vertical depth of both vertebral bodies and inter-
   * There are striking sexual differences in this respect. In the male, the bodies
of the vertebra are more compressed.     Eight skeletons of female Andaman Islanders
afforded a sagitto-vertical lumbar index of SXV4.

vertebral disks, the measurements were made along the axial line of
the column.         The spines were divided in the mesial plane when
thoroughly frozen, so that there was no reduction in the depth of the
cartilaginous disks through the bulging out of their central soft
portions.      In the European we find the largest proportion of carti
lage   in the   construction of the lumbar region.             In four female spines
the average was found to be 357 per cent. cartilage to 64 3 per cent.
bone.*      In the Australian the amount of cartilage is reduced in con
formity with the lengthening of the vertebral bodies; the proportion
is 306 per cent. cartilage to 69-4 per cent. bone.                 Iu the Apes, a still
further reduction in the amount of cartilage is manifested ; even in
the Orang with vertebrae proportionally as short as those of a
European, the amount of cartilage in the lumbar part of the spine is
relatively much less, viz., in the European 35-7 per cent., and in the
Orang 27 per cent.             In the Chimpanzee, the marked fall in the
amount of cartilage is in a measure due to the extremely thin disk
which intervenes between the last lumbar vertebra and the base of
the sacrum.
   In the erect attitude of Man the greater amount of cartilage lessens
the shocks transmitted upwards through the column.                        In the prune
or semi-prone position of the trunk the same provision is not so
necessary.
" The Principles of training Rivers through Tidal Estuaries,
        as illustrated        by Investigations into the Methods of

    The conditions affecting the training of rivers in the non-tidal
portions of their course by jetties, or rubble embankments designated
as training walls, arc well understood.                 Training walls substitute a
straightened       uniform    channel    for  irregularities    and varying widths,
improving the flow of the current and rendering it uniform, so that
scour occurs in the shallow, narrowed portions, and more uniformity
   * Aeby   gives the proportion  of bone and cartilage in the different regions of the
European spine at different ages, but as he measured the front aspect only of the
vertebrae and disks, his results cannot be compared with the above.         In front and
behind the   vertical diameters  of the  disks  and  vertebral bodies are modified by the
npinal curvatures.    To obtain the most accurate information regarding the relative
proportion    of bone  and cartilage in a region, the different elements should un
doubtedly  be   meas°red  along the axial curve.

              Principles of training Rivers through Tidal Estuaries.               503
   of depth is attained. In very winding rivers, the additional precaution
   has to be taken of somewhat reducing the width where the deepest
   channel shifts over from the concave bank on one side to the concave
   bank on the opposite side at the next bend lower down, so as to reduce
   the shoal which is found near the point of contrary flexure by con-
   centrating the current at this place.
      The training of the outlets of sediment-bearing rivers inlo tideless
   seas is determined by the same principles; for a definite discharge is
   directed and concentrated between training walls or piers, so as to
  scour a channel across the bar formed, in front of the outlet, by the
  accumulation of deposit dropped by the enfeebled issuing current.
  The increased velocity of the current through the contracted outlet
  carries the silt into deeper water, where it is either borne away by
  any littoral current, or again forms a bar, after a lapse of time
  depending on the depth, which can be removed by an extension of the
  training works.
      The training also of the upper part of the tidal portion of rivers
  has been effected on similar principles to the non-tidal portion, wiih
  satisfactory results, even though the problem is, in this case, com
  plicated by the changes in the direction of the current, and the
  requisite maintenance of the tidal capacity.
      In the lower parts, however, of tidal rivers, where the tidal flow
  predominates, it is difficult to determine the proper width for a trained
  channel, which, whilst narrow enough to secure an adeqnate depth,
  should not very materially check the tidal flow to the detriment of
  the outlet.        Moreover, where the estuary is large, consideiable doubt
  may exist as to the best direction for the training walls ; and the
  establishment of training walls in a wide estuary, where the flood tide
 is charged with silt, has resulted in extensive accretions,* and corre
 sponding reduction of tidal capacity, by the concentration of the tidal
 flow and ebb in the trained channel, and a consequent enfeeblement
 of the currents at the sides, favouring deposit.                      The principles,
 indeed, upon which the training of tidal rivers should be based, are in
 a very undefined and unsatisfactory condition, as exemplified by the
 conflicting opinions of engineers whenever important training works
 through estuaries are proposed, as exhibited with reference to the
 schemes for training works in the upper estuary of the Mersey,f for
 which the Manchester Ship Canal promoters sought powers in 1883
and 1884, and as at present exist about the extension of the training
works in the Nibble estuary.             J    This is due to the various conditions

involved, which differ more or less in each case, and thus render it
difficult to lay down general rules for guidance from argument* based
on analogy.     One of the most important considerations is the form of
the estuary ; and in this respect no two estuaries are alike, as their
form is the result of complex geological and hydrological conditions ;
and it suffices to contrast the Mersey and the Ribble, the Dee and the
 Tay, the Clyde and the Tees, the Seine and the Loire, to indicate the
varieties of forms which may have to be dealt with.         Other circum
stances affecting the problem are the rise of tide, the tidal capacity
 and general depth, the fresh-water discharge, the silt introduced by
the flood tide or brought down by the river, the condition of the sea
 bottom in front of the mouth, and the direction in which the tidal
current enters the estuary.     The positions also of ports established at
 the sides of estuaries require special consideration in determining
the proper line for a trained channel. These numerous and variable
conditions have often led engineers to enunciate the opinion that each
river must be considered independently by itself. This view, how
ever, if strictly adhered to, by excluding the experience derived from
previous works, would prevent any progress in the determination of
general principles for the improvement of navigation channels through
estuaries; each training work would form an independent scheme,
bnsed upon no previous experience, and might or might not produce
the results anticipated by its designer.     Unfortunately also it is im
possible to proceed with training works by the method of trial and
error; for besides the cost of modifying the lines of training walls,
 if t he desired results are not produced, these works generally effect
such extensive changes in an estuary, that it would be impracticable
 to restore the original conditions, or to modify materially the altered
position.
    It might be possible to deduce general rules for training works
 from a careful consideration of a variety of types of estuaries, espe
 cially those in which training works have been carried out ; and I
 have commenced an investigation of this kind.         This method of in
 quiry, however, requires a variety of data which it is difficult to obtain
 for most estuaries, and must depend upon a careful estimate of the
 relative influence of each of the variable conditions, and a train of
 reasoning from analogy which might not be accepted by engineers as
 conclusive.    Accordingly, it would be of the very highest value to
 river engineers, and of considerable interest from a scientific point of
 view, if a method of investigation could be devised, which might be
 applied to the special conditions of any estuary, and the results of any
 scheme of training works determined approximately beforehand, in
 a manner which could be relied upon from the fact of their depending
 on an assimilation to the actual conditions of the case investigated,
 and not on arguments based upon the effects of similar works under

  more or less different conditions.The following description is there
  fore given of the results of investigations, carried on at intervals
  during more than two years, with reterence to the proposed extensions
  of the training works in the Seine estuary, which appear to afford a
  fair assurance that a similar method, applied to any estuary, would
  indicate the effect of any scheme of training works, provided the
  special conditions of the estuary were known.
                           Investigations       about the Seine   Estuary.
      The training works in the lower portion of the tidal Seine, com
    menced in 1848, had reached Berville in 1870, when the works were
   stopped, in the interests of the port of Havre, on account of the large
   unexpected accretions which were taking place hehind the training
   walls, and at the sides of the wide estuary below them.* The original
   scheme, proposed in 1845 by M. Bounieeau.f comprised the extension
   of the trained channel to Honfleur on the southern side of the estuary,
   and the prolongation of one or both of the training walls towards
   Havre at the north-western extremity of the estuary, as in any
   scheme, the interests of both these ports, on opposite sides of the
   estuary, have to be considered.    The works are acknowledged to be
   incomplete ; aud great interest has been evinced, particularly within
  the last few years, in the question of their extension, so that the
  shifting channel between Berville and the sea may be trained and
  deepened, and the access to Honfleur improved, without endangering
  the approaches to Havre. The objects desired are distinctly defined ;
  but the means for attaining them have formed the subject of such a
  variety of schemes, that hardly any part of the estuary below Berville
  lias not been traversed by some proposed trained channel, except the
 portion lying north of a line between Hoc and Tancarville points,
 which is too far removed from Honfleur to be admissible lor any
 scheme. Altogether, including distinct modifications, fourteen schemes
 have been published in France within my knowledge, seven of them
 having appeared within the last five years. The schemes also exhibit
                                                        J
 great varieties in their general design (Plate 2, figs. 1 and 3 ; Plate 3,
 figs. 1 and 2 ; and Plate 4, fig. 1), illustrating very forcibly the great
 uncertainty which exists, even in a special case where the conditions
 have been long studied, hs to the principles which should be followed in
designing training works. It is evident that no reasoning from analogy
could prevail amongst such very conflicting views ; and having had the
0ubject under consideration for a long time, the idea occurred to me in
.August, 1886, of attempting the solution of this very difficult problem
by an experimental method, which might also throw light upon general

 principles for guidance in training rivers through estuaries.            Tl«e
 estuary   of the  Seine    is in some respects peculiarly  well adapted for
 such an investigation, for old charts exhibit the state of the river
 before the training works were commenced, and recent charts indicate
 the changes which the training walls have produced, whilst the
 various designs for the completion of the works, proposed by ex
perienced engineers, afford an interesting basis for experimental
 inquiries into the principles of training works in estuaries.     If, in tbe
 first place, it should be possible to reproduce in a model the shifting
channels of the Seine estuary as they formerly existed, and next. after
inserting the training walls in the model as they now exist in the
 estuary, the effects produced by these works could be reproduced on a
 small scalp, it appeared reasonable to assume that the introduction,
 successively, in the model of the various lines proposed for the exten
sion of the training walls would produce results in the mudel fairly
resembling the effects which the works, if carried out, would actually
produce.
    When the third Manchester Ship Canal Bill was being considered
by Parliament in 1885, Professor Osborne Reynold* constructed a
working model of the portion of the Mersey estuary above Liverpool
on behalf of the promoters of the canal, with the object of showing
that no changes would be produced in the main chaunels of the estuary
by the canal works which had been designed to modify very slightly
the line of the Cheshire shore above Eastham.            This model was, 1
believe, the first experimental      investigation  on an  estuary by artifi
cially producing the tidal action of flood and ebb on a small scale:
and Professor Reynolds' experiment showed that a remarkably close
resemblance to the main tidal channels in the inner estuary could be
produced on a small scale.
    As the Mersey model did not extend into Liverpool Bay, the tidal
action produced        was very definitely directed along the confined
channel representing the " Narrows
                                          " between
                                                     Liverpool and Birken
head ;   and  this  tidal flow was not perceptibly influenced by the rela
tively very small fresh-water discharge.       In the Seine, however, there
is no narrow inlet channel to adjust exactly the set of the flood tide into
the estuary ; and the large fresh-water discharge of the Seine, with a
basin about eighteen times larger than the Mersey basin, forms r.n
important factor in the result.       The tide in a model of the Seine has
to be produced in the open bay outside the estuary at a suitable angle
whitfh had to be determine 1 ; and it was essential for the success of
the Seine experiments that accretion should be produced in the model
of the Seine estuary under certain circumstances, which was a con
dition which did not enter into the Mersey problem.            Accordingly,
the very interesting and valuable results obtained by Professor
Reynolds, in his model of the Mersey, could afford no assurance that

         Principles of training Rivers through Tidal Estuaries.          509
experiments involving essentially different and novel conditions would
lead to any satisfactory results.        I therefore restricted the require
ments for my experiments within the smallest possible limits, and
contented     myself with the simplest means, and the limited space
available in my office at Westminster.
    Description of Model of the Seine Estuary. — The model represent
ing the tidal portion of the River Seine and the adjacent coast of
 Calvados, extending from Mar tot, the lowest weir on the Seine, down
to about Dives, to the south-west of Trouville, was moulded in Port
 land cement by my assistant, Mr. Edward Blundell, to the scales of
jjJu     horizontal and T-J-jj vertical. The first is the scale of some of
 the more recent published charts of the Seine — and even at that
 scale the model is nearly 9 feet long ; whilst I made the vertical
 scale one hundred times the horizontal, as the fall of the bed of the
 tidal Seine is very slight, and the rise of spring tides at the mouth,
 being 23 feet 7 inches, amounted to an elevation of the water in the
 model of only 0'71 inch.       There are two banks at the mouth of the
estuary, between Havre and Villerville Point, known as the Amfard
and Ratier banks, which emerge between half-tide and low water, and
divide the entrance to the estuary into three channels.           Through all
 the changes in the navigable channel at the outlet, these banks always
appear in some form or other in the low-wnter charts, either connected
 with the sandbanks inside the estuary, or detached.            On examining
 the large chart drawn from the survey made by M. Germain in 1880,
 I found that rock and gravel cropped up to the surface over a certain
 area on these banks, and accordingly I introduced solid mounds at
 these places to represent tho hard portions of the Amfard and Ratier
 banks, %vhich are permanent features in the estuary.            As a rocky
 bottom is found near Havre, and also at       Villerville Point on the oppo
site side of the outlet, Amfard and Ratier banks are doubtless the
remains of a rocky barrier which in remote ages stretched right
across the present mouth of the river.          Where the rocky bottom lies
 bare near Havre and    Villerville,    the model was moulded to the exact
depths shown on the chart of 1880 ; but in other places the cement
bottom was merely kept well below ^he greatest depth the channel
had attained at oach place, whilst the actual bed of the estuary in the
model was formed by the flow of water over a layer of sand.
    Arrangements for Tidal and Fresh-water Flow. — The mouth of the
Seine estuary faces west ; but the tidal wave comes in from the north
west, and the earliest and strongest flood tide flows through the
northern channel between Havre and the Amfard bank ; whilst the
influx through the southern Villerville channel occurs later, and is
stronger towards high water.         Accordingly, the tidal flow had to be
introduced from a northerly direction, at an angle to the mouth of the
estuary ; and the line of junction of the hinged tray, producing the

  510                   Mr. L. F. Vernon-Harcourt.
 tidal rise and fall, was made at an angle of about 50° to a line running
  from east to west in the model, so that the tidal flow approached the
 estuary from a point only about 5° to the west of north-west.          The
 tray was made of zinc, enclosed by strips on three sides to the height
 of the sides of the estuary ; and it was hinged to the model, at its
  opeu end, by a strip of india-rubber sheeting along the bottom and
  sides, so as to make a water-tight joint with sufficient play at the sides
  to admit of the tray being tipped up and down from its outer end.
  The rise and fall of the tray was effected by the screw of a letter
  press, from which the lower portion had been detached, by raising and
  lowering the upper plate of the press, half of which was inserted
  under the tray. After the requisite amount of sand had been intro.
  duced to raise the bottom to the average level, the model was filled
  with just enough water for the surface of the water to represent low
 water of spring tides when the tray was down and the screw at its
 lowest limit ; and the tray was made of such a size that, when the
 screw was raised to its full extent, the water in the model was raised,
 by the tipping of the tray, to the level representing high water of
 spring tides.     The water representing the fresh-water discharge of
 the Seine was admitted into the upper end of the model from a tap
 in a small tin cistern; and the efflux of a similar quantity of water
 was provided for at the lower extremity of the estuary, on its northern
 side near the tray, by a cock with a larger orifice placed at such a level
 as to allow the water to flow out into a second cistern, of similar size,
 during the higher half of the tide.
     First Results of Working the Model. — The construction of the model
 was commenced in October, 1886, and its working was commenced in
 November.       Though the Portland cement was convenient for mould
 ing   in a small space and in the absence of appliances, it did not prove
 satisfactory for retaining water at first. The model was purposely
 made in two halves, and the straight joint was subsequently made
 water-tight ; but, nevertheless, cracks occurred at various places
 through which the water leaked, and they had to be repaired as they
 appeared ; and the bottom of the model was eventually coated with
 thick varnish, and after a time the leaks ceased. The flexible india-
 rubber hinge, from which I had anticipated some trouble, leaked very
 little from the beginning, and on being fitted with greater care in
 introducing a tray of somewhat different form, no leakage occurred.
     Silver sand was used in the first instance for forming the bed of the
estuary.      From the outset, the- bore at Caudebec, indicated by a
sudden     rise of the water, and the reverse current just before high
water near Havre, called the " verhaule," were very well marked.
The verhaule is evidently a sort of back eddy, on the northern
shore, occasioned by the influx of the tide, and by the final filling of
the estuary from the southern channel ; whilst the bore appears to

         Principles of training Rivers through Tidal Estuaries.              511
result from the concentration of the tidal rise by the sudden contrac
tion of the estuary above Quillebeuf.  The period given to each tide
in working was about 25 seconds, which appeared fairly to reproduce
the conditions of the estuary.* After the model had been worked for
a   little time, the channels   near Quillebeuf    assumed lines 'resembling
those which previously existed ; and a small channel appeared on the
northern shore, by Harfleur and Hoc Point, which is clearly defined
in the chart of 1834. The main channel also shifted about in the
estuary, and tended to break up into two or three shallow channels
near the meridian of Berville, where the influences of the Hood and
ehb tides were nearly balanced.      The model, accordingly, fairly repro
duced the conditions of the actual estuary previous to the commence-
of the training walls; though the channel in the estuary did not
attain the depth, as represented by the proportionately large vertical
scale, which the old channels possessed, owing, doubtless, to the com
paratively small scouring influence which the minute currents in the
model possess. The sand, in fact, cannot be reduced to a fineness
corresponding to the scale of the model, whilst the friction on the
bed is not diminished equivalently to the reduction in volume of the
current. Silver sand had been used on account of its being readily
obtained, its purity, and absence of cohesion, as it was hoped that the
water, by percolating freely through        it, would more readily shift it.
A film, however, seemed by degrees to form over its surface, reducing
considerably its mobility and as the action of the water on
                            ;                                           it  con
sisted merely in rolling the particles along the bottom, this sand did
not prove satisfactory for producing the requisite changes when the
training walls were inserted in the model. It became, therefore,
essential to search for a substance which the water could to some
extent carry in suspension for a short period.
   Trial   ofVarious Substances for Forming the Bed          of  the Estuary. — -
Some substance was required, not necessarily sand, insoluble in water,
easily scoured, and therefore not pasty or sticky, and sufficiently fine
or light to be carried in suspension to some extent         by  the currents in
the  model,  and  not merely  rolled  along  the  bottom   like the silver sand.
A variety of substances of low specific gravity, and in powdered form,
were accordingly tried in succession during the first half of 1887.
Pumice in powder proved too sticky and flower of sulphur was too
                                           ;
greasy to be easily immersed in water.           Pounded coke was too dirty
to be suitable, and particles of    it floated.    Violet-powder became too
pasty   in water    and
                     ;  fuller's   earth  and   lupin seed exhibited similar
defects.    The grains of coffee grounds were too large in water, and
moved up and down in the currents too readily whilst fine sawdust
                                                        ;

                       and

formed in it.     The powder obtained from Bath brick, which war
experimented upon for some time in the model, both without and with
training walls, yielded more satisfactory results, as besides affording
shifting channels like the silver sand, it accumulated at the sides of
the estuary when the training walls were introduced in the model.                           It,
however, gradually became too compact, so that the current could no
longer produce much effect on         but asit ;   probable that souk

state, the material might have proved more subject to scouring
influence.

   Results   of  Working Model with Bcgshot Sand. — The bed of the
estuary having been formed with the sand obtained from Chobham
Common, after the model had been worked for some time, the channel
assumed a form very closely resembling the chart of the Seine
estuary of 1834.*      Accordingly, the first stage of the investigation
was duly accomplished by the reproduction of a former state of the
estuary in the model, with the single exception of         decidedly smaller
                                                                       a
depth in the channels, except in places where the scour was consider
able, which    isreadily accounted for by the circumstances of the case
It probable that with a larger model, and especially
   is                                                            the bed was       if
not so nearly   level  as in the  Seine,  the depth  would  approach nearer
to the proper distorted proportion as compared with the width.
   The close correspondence of the channels in the model with an
actual state of the estuary in its natural condition, confirms, in a con
siderably more complicated case, the results previously achieved                            by
Professor Reynolds with reference to the upper estuary of the Mersey,
and affords a fair certainty that, with adequate data, the natural con

                               ;
to conform, as far as practicable, to the actual conditions. The fine
particles of the sand accreted behind the training walls and the                                 ;
channel between the walls was scoured out, corresponding precisely
to the changes which have actually occurred in the estuary of the
Seine.   The foreshores at the back of the training walls were raised
up in some parts to high-water level, whilst in other places the
accumulation was somewhat retarded by the slight recoil of the water
from the vertical sides of the model, and by the wash over the vertical
training walls, these forms being necessitated by the great distortion
of the vertical scale of the model. On the whole, however, the
accretion and scour in the model correspond very fairly to the results
produced by the existing training walls in the estuary.     The accretion,
moreover, in the model, extended beyond the training walls on each
side, down to Hoe Point on the right bank, obliterating the inshore
channel close to Harfleur, which had been reproduced in the model,
and down to Honfleur on the left bank, corresponding in these
respects also to the actual changes in the estuary.*           The main
channel also, beyond the ends of the training walls, was compara
tively shallow, and was unstable, reproducing the existing conditions
in the estuary.
   The experiments relating to this stage extended over        year and                      a                    a

obtaining the resulting accretion on         small scale. Without the

 Training Works.  — As the first and second steps in the investigation,
by the aid of the model, had furnished results which corresponded very
fairly with the actual states of the estuary of the Seine before and
after the execution of the training works, the final stage of the
investigation, for ascertaining the probable results of any extensions
of the training walls, could be reasonably entered upon.    In selecting
the lines of training walls to be experimented on,         appeared ex                it
pedient  to adopt those  which have  been designed, after careful study,
by experienced engineers, both on account of the results from these
being far more interesting than those of a variety of theoretical
schemes, and also in the hope that some assistance might thereby be
rendered to French engineers in the prosecution of this important

their being taken as types of schemes for throwing light upon the
principles on which training works should be designed in estuaries.
Accordingly, the third stage in the investigation consisted in extend
ing the training walls in the model, in accordance with t he lines of
gome of the schemes proposed ; and, after working the model for some
time with each of the extensions successively, the several results were
recorded, as shown in Plates 2 and 3, and Plate 4, figs. 1 and 2.                     The
lines of training walls experimented on in the model were taken, with
one exception, from five out of the seven most recent schemes pro
posed, as these five schemes are, I believe, the only ones which are
still put forward for adoption.             The lines shown on Plate 4, fig. 3,
represent merely a theoretical arrangement of training walls, inserted
for a final experiment in the model, to ascertain the effect of the most
gradual enlargement of the trained channel which the physical con
ditions of the estuary would have admitted of at the outset, whilst
maintaining the full width at the mouth.
    Scheme A. — The first arrangement of extended training walls inn . -
duced into the model was taken from a scheme, some of the main
features of which were proposed in an earlier scheme in 1859,* and
which was put forward in an amended form in 1886.f The design,
as inserted in the model, consisted of an extension of the parallel
training walls from Berville down to Honfleur, and the formation of
a breakwater across the outlet, from Villerville Point on the southern
shore of the estuary, out to the Amfard bank, thus restricting the
mouth to the channel between Amfard bank and Havre.                       The lines of
these works were formed in the model with strips of tin, as shown
on Plate 2, fig. 1 ; the northern training wal was kept low, and the
southern wall was raised to the level representing high water of neap
tides ; whilst the strip representing the breakwater was raised above
the highest tide level, thus forcing all the flood and ebb water to pass
through the Havre Channel.              The results obtained in the model with
these arrangements, after working it for about 6000 tides, are indi
cated on the first chart (Plate 2, fig. 1).             The channel between the
prolonged     training  walls    had   a  fair depth    throughout, partly owing
to the concentration of the fresh-water discharge between the walls,
and partly from the retention of some additional water in the channel
at low water, by the hindrance to its outflow offered by a sandbank
which formed in front of the ends of the training walls. A deep hole
was soon scoured out in the narrowed outlet by the rapid flow of the
water tilling and emptying the estuary at every tide.                   The absence,
however, of connexion between the direction of the flood tide current

through the outlet and the ebbing current from the trained channel,
aided by the accretion of sand in the sheltered recess behind the break
water, led eventually to the formation of two almost rectangular bends
in the channel, one just beyond the training walls, and the other near
Hoc Point in the model. This tortuous channel, moreover, was
shallow, except at the bends and the outlet ; and a bar was formed a
short distance beyond the outlet.             The contraction of the mouth of
the estuary by the breakwater interfered so much with the influx of
the tide into the estuary as to render it impossible to raise the tide
inside to its previous height ; and the reduction in height of the tide
was clearly marked at Tancarville Point in the model.                       Sediment
accumulated in the estuary beyond the trained channel, being brought
in by the rapid flood current. and not readily removed by the ebb,
except in the trained channel and near the outlet ; and this accretion,
by diminishing the tidal capacity, gradually reduced the current
 through the outlet, and consequently the depth of the outlet channel.
 A considerable accumulation of sand took place outside the break
 water, along the southern sea-coast, so that the bank opposite
 Trouville in the model was connected with the shore, and the
 foreshore advanced towards the end of the breakwater (Plate 2,
 %     1).
     Scheme B. — The second arrangement of training walls inserted in
 the model, below Berville, was taken from a scheme proposed in 1888,
 representing a modification, by another engineer, of the design from
 which Scheme A was copied.* It comprised the retention of the break
 water from Villerville Point to the Amfard bank, the most essential
 feature in Scheme A ; but the extension of the northern training
  wall was dispensed with, whilst the southern training wall was pro
 longed, in a continuous curve, from Berville to Hnnflenr (Plate 2,
 fig. 2), and eventually to the Amfard bank, connecting it there with
 the extremity of the breakwater (Plate 2, fig. 3). A slight widening
  out of the existing trained channel, by an alteration of the end portion
  of the northern training wall, completed the arrangement of the
  model.1    The results obtained by inserting the training wall down to
  Honflenr, and then working the model for about 3500 tides, are
  shown in Plate 2, fig. 2 ; and those obtained after the prolongation
  of the southern training wall to the breakwater, and working the
  model for abont 3700 tides, are shown in Plate 2, fig. 3.             The channel
  followed pretty nearly        the  concave   line    of the  prolonged southern
  training wall, between Berville and Honfleur in the model, except
  near Berville ; but the depth of water was less regular than in the
  previous experiment, owing to the diminished concentration of the
  ebb from the absence of the northern training wall.                   The channel

between       Honfleur and Amfard was tortuous as before, bnt its direc
tion was different.         The deep hole at the outlet, the bar beyond, ari
 the advance of the southern foreshore beyond the breakwater,
reappeared again with very similar features to those in the first
scheme, except that the sandbank did not quite reach the outaidt
face of the breakwater at low water.                (Compare fig. 2 with fig. 1 ia
 Plate 2.)
    The results which followed from working the model with thf
southern training wall prolonged to Amfard, are shown in Piatt-                       i
fig. 3.      The main alteration from the former experiment naturally
occurred between Honflenr and Amfard                  in the model, a continnoie
channel being formed along the new                piece of concave training wall
 whilst the general depth inside the estuary was improved as far as
 the meridian of Hoc Point.               The channel, however, above Honflenr
was not improved, owing apparently to the want of uniformity
between the directions of the flood and ebb currents in the model.
 The other features remained very similar to the former case, excep:
that the end of the sandbank beyond the breakwater was slightly
eroded, whilst deposit took place between the extended training wall
and the breakwater.           (Compare fig. 3 with fig. 2 in Plate 2.)
    Scheme 0.    —  The third arrangement of training walls experimented
upon     in the  model    was chosen from a design published in 1885.*               It
consisted of an enlargement of the original trained channel below
 Quillebeuf, by a modification of the southern training wall from
Quillebeuf, and of the northern training wall from Tancarville, and
the extension of the northern wall to Amfard and Havre, and the
southern training wall to Ratier, as shown on Plate 3, fig. 1.                     The
trained channel        was   thus   given    a  curved, gradnally enlarging      form,
and was directed into the central channel of the model, between
Ratier and Amfard, the Villerville and Havre channels behi£
practically closed near low water.             The effects of working the model
for about 6500         tides   with    this  arrangement of training walls art
indicated on the chart (Plate 3, fig. 1). The main channel kept near
the concave southern training wall for some distance below Bfcrville,
and then gradually assumed a more central course between the train
ing walls towards the outlet, passing out just to the south of the
Amfard bank. The channel thus formed had a good, tolerably uniform
depth, together with a fair width, owing apparently to the flood and
ebb tides produced in the model following an unimpeded aud fairly
similar course.       Deposit occurred behind the training walls on each
side ; and the foreshore advanced in front of Trouville in the model,
in consequence of the shutting up of the Villerville Channel.

the model was selected from the most recent design* proposed by an
engineer who had previously submitted schemes in 1881f and 1886. %
The trained channel was widened out by an alteration of the southern
wall from Quillebeuf, and the northern wall from Tancarvilte, more
than trebling the width betweon the training walls at Berville in the
model        ; and the walls were extended in sinuous lines to Havre on the
northern          side, and Honfleur on the southern side, as shown on
Plate 3, fig. 2, thus forming a winding trained channel rapidly
enlarging near its outlet. The model, with these lines of training
walls, was worked for about 5000 tides, with the results indicated on
 the chart. Deep channels were scoured out close along the inner
 concave faces of the training walls in the model ; but shuals appeared
 over a considerable area of the newly trained channel ; a bar stretched
 across the deep channel where it shifted over from the south to the
 n irth training wall, about half way between Berville and Honfleur;
 and a large sandbank, emerging above low water, occupied the centre
 of the outlet opposite Honfleur.               Deposit also occurred at the sides
  of the estuary behind the training walls.
       As it was of importance to ascertain to what extent accidental
  modifications in the arrangement of the sand in the preparation for
  an experiment might affect the result, the lines of training walls
  described above were inserted a second time in the model, after the
  subsequent scheme E had been experimented                       upon, rendering it
  necessary to replace afresh both training walls, and to remodel the
  sand so as to represent approximately the present condition of the
  estuary.         The model was prepared for this second experiment in the
  usual way, without any special endeavour to secure coincidence with
   the first experiment in the initinl arrangement of sandbanks and
   channels. The condition of the low-water channels in the model,
   after working the model with this arrangement of training walls for
   the second time for about 5400 tides, is shown on Plate 3, fig. 3.
   The main features of the trained channel in the charts of the two
   experiments exhibit a very fair resemblance, considering the modifica
   tions which any alterations in the initial condition might produce,
   and the naturally variable state of the channels in a wide outlet.
    The deep channels reappear in the second chart at the inner concave
   faces of the training walls, with intervening shoals; a large sandbank
    is again visible at low water along the north training wall, opposite
    La Roque and Berville in the model ; and the sandbank in the centre

 though smaller        in extent owing to alterations in the channel ; and
 the deep place        at the end     of the southern training wall, close             to
 Honfleur, is the       same in both charts.
       Scheme    E. — The fifth arrangement of training walls introduced
 into the model was taken from a design* published in 1888, which is
 a mojlification of a scheme, presented in 1886, by a Committee of
 experts       appointed    by the French Goverument to consider the
 question.f Tn tne scheme as laid down in the model, the trained
 channel in the bend between Qnillebeuf and Tancarville, where the
 depth was greatest, was enlarged in width by setting back toe
 southern training wall ; the original width of the channel was
retnined at the point of inflexion opposite Tancarville, and the
channel was widened out below La Roque by a modification of the
lines of both training walls down to Berville.                   The training walls
 were also extended beyond Berville in sinuous lines, as shown on
Plate 4, fig. 1, the southern wall being carried down to Honflenr, and
the northern wall not quite so far. The portion forming the last
bend of the northern training wall was kept low, whilst the others
were made high, according to the design.                    Both in this and the
preceding arrangement              of   training    wells   experimented        on, the
expanding trained channel was somewhat restricted in width along
the portions near the charges of curvature, to make it conform to
the principles which experience has laid down for training winding
rivers in their non-tidal course, as previously mentioned. The results
obtained, after working the model for about 3700 tides, are represented
on the chart (Plate 4, fig. 1). The channel between the training
walls was somewhat shallow in places; and though a deep channel
was formed along the inner concave face of the southern wall
between La Roque and Berville, a shoal emerging above low water
appeared along the concave face of the last bend of the northern
training wall. This bank appeared to be due to the protection the
extremity of the bend afforded from the action of the flood tide in the
model; whilst the ebb followed the central flood-tide channel, instead
of passing over to the concave bank as would have occurred with the
current of a non-tidal river. The main channel beyond the training
walls, which, though of fair depth, was somewhat narrow and
winding, was also unstable ; for in the early part of the experiment,
its outlet was in the central channel between Ratier and Amfard in

       the model,   whilst at the close of the experiment it had shifted, as
       shown,   to   the Havre channel.           Accretion occurred behind the
       training walls in the model ; and some silting up took place in the
       Villerville Channel and along the foreshore in front of Trouville,
      owing apparently to the preference of the main channel for the
      other outlets, and the diminished capacity of the estuary resulting
      from accretion.
          This arrangement       of training walls was further investigated by
      working the model for about 6300 tides more, with the results shown
      on Plate 4, fig. 2.      The chief features of the estuary in the model
     showed only slight changes from the state previously recorded (Plate
      4, fig, 1), with the exception of the main channel which had shifted
     again to the central ontlet ; whilst the northern foreshore above low
     water extended over part of the former site of the channel.              The two
     conditions of the estuary, represented by Plate 4, figs. 1 and 2, have
     therefore the interest of exhibiting in the model a shifting channel,
     such as actually exists at the present time in the Seine estuary below
     Berville.
         Scheme    F. — The last experiment was made on an arrangement of
    training walls inserted in the model, making the trained channel
    expand as gently as practicable between Aizier and the sea, whilst
    retaining the natural width at the outlet (Plate 4, fig. 3). This is the
    form of channel which theory indicates as the most suitable;* for
    whilst it facilitates the influx of the flood tide, it prevents, as far as
   possible, the abrupt changes in the velocity of a river in passing from
   its estuary to the sea, which are so prejudicial to uniformity of depth
   in a channel. It was therefore of interest to ascertain what results
   would be produced by this theoretical arrangement of training walls
  in the model, which, in order to leave the outlet free, and thus avoid
  favouring a progression of the foreshore outside, had to provide a
  wide channel near Honfleur compared with the restricted width
  available at Quillebeuf. The direction of the channel between Aizier
  and Quillebeuf, together with the cliffs bordering the river at Quille
  beuf and Tancarville Points, determined the maximum width obtain
  able at Quillebeuf, and the direction of the channel from Aizier to
  Tancarville ; and the            extension   of the training walls in the model
 from this point was              regulated by the necessity of passing close to
 Honfleur at the south, and not impeding the approach to Havre on
 the north. The effects produced in the model by working with this
arrangement of training walls for about 7300 tides are indicated on
the chart (Plate 4, fig. 3). The southern training wall was kept
above high-water level all the way to its termination at Honfleur in
the model, but the northern training wall was gradually reduced in
height from nearly opposite Honfleur towards Havre. The trained

channel    had  a good   width at low water throughout, in spite of the
distance apart of the training walls in the model, the whole channel
being below low-water level, except near the southern wall between
Berville and Havre, and against the northern wall nearly opposite Hoc
Point, where banks emerged slightly above low water.         The channel,
moreover, was distinctly, though slowly, improving with the con
tinuance of the working, and the banks diminishing.       There was also
a fair depth in the channel,         the shallowest place being opposite
Berville, whilst a deep place -was formed just above, near the sonthern
wall between La Roque and Berville.           The depth in all the outlet
channels was well maintained ; and though deposit naturally took
place behind the northern training wall, no accretion was visible
along the foreshores outside.
          Considerations affecting Experimental Training Works.
     The value of experiments resembling those just described depends
entirely upon the extent to which they may be regarded as producing
effects approximately corresponding, on a small scale, to those which
training works on similar lines, if carried out in an estuary, wonld
actually produce.       If the effects of any training works conld be
foreshadowed by experiments in a model, the value of such experi
ments, in guiding engineers towards the selection of the most suitable
design, could not be overestimated.
   Some of the influences at work in an estuary cannot possibly be
reproduced in a model — such as winds and waves.           Winds coming
from different quarters are variable in their effects; but the directioc
of the prevailing wind indicates the line in which the action of the
wind has most influence, which may be exerted in reinforcing the
flood or ebb currents, and may aid or retard accretion by blowing the
silt-bearing stream more into or out of the estuary.       Waves are the
main agents     in  the erosion of cliffs along open sea-coasts, and in
stirring up sand in shallow places ; and the material thus put in sus
pension may be transported by tidal currents, aided by wind, into an
estuary, and be deposited under favourable conditions.     These circum
stances affect    the  rate  of accretion, which cannot be investigated
experimentally, as it is impossible to reproduce in a model the propor
tion of silt in suspension, which, moreover, varies in any estuary with
the state of the weather and tide, and the volume of fresh water
discharged.     Inside an estuary, also, waves in storms may erode the
shores at high tide, and modify the low-water channels; but the first
effect is very gradual, and the second is intermittent — only occasionally
occurring.
    The main forces acting in any tidal estuary are the tidal ebb and
flow and the fresh- water discharge, which are constantly at work ; and
they regulate the size of the channels in an estuary, and for the most

   part their direction, aa well as the limits of accretion. These are the
   forces which can be reproduced in miniature in a model, as proved by
   the close concordance in the channels obtained by experiment with
   the actual conditions of the Mersey, and with a previous state of the
   Seine estuary ; and this similarity of results would not have occurred
   if the other influences noticed above were at all equally potent.
      Training walls mainly modify the direction and action of the tidal
   ebb and flow and f resh- water discharge ; and, therefore, it is reasonable
   to suppose that the results in a model, due to these alterations, would
   correspond to their actual effects in an estuary, provided the important
   element of accretion could be also reproduced. This was satisfac
  torily accomplished in the second stage of the investigation, proving
   that the miniature influences produced in the model corresponded, in
  this case also, with the forces acting in the estuary. Accretion is
   promoted by training walls in an estuary where matter is carried in
  suspension ; but the action of waves in modifying the channels is
  stopped by the intervention of training walls.                     Accordingly, the
  further the training walls are extended, and the more an estuary is
  protected by works such as those indicated in Plate 2, the more is
  the modifying influence of waves eliminated, and therefore the more
  are experiments in a model likely to correspond with the conditions of
  estuaries under similar conditions.
      Other considerations also afford grounds for supposing that the
  effects observed with training walls in a model fairly correspond with
  the results which such works would produce in an estuary.                          The
 charts of the experiments show that definite results followed from
  certain lines inserted in the model, and that modifications in these
  lines were followed by modifications in the results. (Compare Plate 2,
 figs. 1, 2, and 3, and Plate 3, fig. 2, with Plate 4, fig. 1.)              Moreover,
 the results produced with the model agree very closely with the
 results which, in the two earliest schemes experimented upon, it was
 stated, before the experiments were begun, would follow, if the works
 indicated by lines in the charts were actually earned out in the Seine
 estuary.*

 following extract from ' Instit. Civ. Engin. Proc.,' vol. 84, p. 35G :— The narrowing
of the mouth of the estuary of the Seine would at first promote scour, and increase
 the depth in that part of the channel, and for a little distance above and below.
This contraction, however, would impede the influx of the flood tide, and cause
changes in the velocity of the current through the narrow neck, and in the wide
estuary above, promoting the deposit of silt brought in by the tide. This accretion
would be greatly aided by the prolongation of the training walls to Honfleur, so
that eventually the greater portion of the estuary comprised between Tanearville,
 Hoc Point, and Honfleur would be raised to high-water level. This large reduction
in tidal capacity would reduce the tidal current through the narrowed entrance, and
,consequently diminish again the depth in the channel.       Moreover, this reduction of
                                                                        2 m 2

    It would     be impossible to determine           by experiment the time any
changes in        an estuary would occupy.             The figures, in fact, giving
the number of tides during which each experiment was worked, are
not even intended as an indication of the rate of change in the modej,
and much less as any measure of the period required for such changes
in an estuary, but merely as a record of the comparative duration of
each experiment. It was observed, however, that the changes were
most rapid where the modifications effected by the lines of walk
inserted in the model were greatest (Plate 2), and slowest where the
lines in the model produced             the least alterations.       (Plate 3, fig.      1,

      Principles for Training Tidal Rivers          deduced  from Experiments.
    The foregoing investigations, viewed merely as experiments, with-
ont any reference to their bearing on the Seine, may serve for
indicating some general principles applicable in training tidal rivers
through wide estuaries.               Direct experiment for each estnary is
undoubtedly preferable to abstract reasoning, where such experiment
is possible, as it reproduces the special conditions of the estuary to be
investigated. Nevertheless, general principles may be of value in
guiding the choice of designs to be investigated, so as to avoid waste
of time in testing unfavourable schemes, and also in cases where the
conditions of an estuary are not sufficiently known to afford a correct
basis   for experiment.
    The experiments may be divided into three classes, namely : —
    (i.) Outlet of estuary considerably restricted, and channel trained
inside towards outlet. (Plate 2.)
     (2.) Channel trained in sinuous line, expanding towards outletE
 but kept somewhat narrow at changes of curvature. (Plate 3. figs. 2
 and 3, and Plate 4, figs. 1 and 2.)
     (3.) Channel trained in as direct a course as practicable, and
 expanding regularly to outlet. (Plate 3, fig. 1, and Plate 4, fig. 3.)
     The experiments of the first class exhibited a deep outlet, and a
 fairly continuous channel inside, where the training works were pro
 longed to the outlet.          The channel, however, was irregular in depth
 tidal flow in and out of the lower estuary would favour the natural         heaping-up
 action of the sea on the sands outside ; so that eventually, not only would the initial
 deepening of the narrowed outlet be lost, but the good depths in the b°y outside the
 estuary would be imperilled."

           Principles of training Rivers through Tidal Estuaries.       523
 near the outlet ; and a bar appeared in front of the outlet outside.
 The breakwater also, extending across part of the outlet, favoured
 deposits both inside and outside the estuary, by producing slack water
 in the sheltered recesses.
    The second class of trained channel was designed to profit by the
 scour at the concave face of bends, so clearly exhibited at the first
 bend of all the charts, and to continue the depth thus obtained by
 restricting the width between the bends, on the principle adopted for
 winding non-tidal rivers. Experiment, however, did not bear out the
 advantages anticipated from this system, probably owing to the variable
 drection of the flood tide at different heights of tide, its being checked
 in its progress by the winding course, and not acting in unison with
 the ebb from the difference in its direction and the width of the trained
 channel near the outlet.       The main stream in a non-tidal winding
 river always follows a tolerably definite course; whereas the flood
 tide tends gradually, as it rises, to assume as direct a course as
 possible.    The difference, therefore, in the conditions of a non-tidal
 and tidal river, in this respect, is considerable.
    The third class of trained channel afforded a wide, tolerably uniform
 channel in the experiments; the flood tide was less impeded in its
 progress than with the other forms of training walls, and appeared to
 act more in concert with the ebb.
    The experiments, accordingly, indicate that the only satisfactory
 principle for training rivers, through wide estuaries with silt-bearing
 currents, is to give the trained channel a gradually expanding form,
 with as direct a course as possible to the outlet. The rate of increase
 of width between the training walls must be determined by the special
 conditions of the estuary.     If the outlet is very wide, and the gradual
expansion in width cannot be commenced a considerable distance up
an estuary, some restriction in width at the outlet may be expedient
to avoid a too rapid expansion.       It is evident that the widening out
adopted in the last experiment (Plate 4, fig. 3) was carried to its
utmost limits, from the continuance of sandbanks inside the trained
channel, and that, regarding merely the improvement of the
channel, it might have been preferable to restrict its width at the
outlet as effected in Scheme C (Plate 3, fig. 1). At the same time, it
must not be inferred, from the existence of these sandbanks, that the
distance apart of the training walls was much too great in the last
experiment ; for the width apart of the training walls necessitated
the inclusion of a greater extent of sandbanks within the trained
channel at the outset, and also rendered the rate of improvement in
the channel more gradual, so that the improvement in the channel
both in direction and depth was still progressing at the close of the
experiment, and the sandbanks in the channel were in process of
removal, and not being formed.         The choice in such cases, where the

524                        Prof.   J.   C. Ewart.
widening ont cannot be commenced far np, appears to lie between the
ntmost improvement of the channel at the expense of accretion on
the foreshores outside, and the maintenance of the depths over the
foreshores beyond the outlet accompanied with a somewhat less good
channel in the estuary.       In some cases, deposit on the foreshores
at the side beyond the outlet might be of no importance, and then the
river channel should be primarily considered ; but         on the contrary,
                                                         if,
accretion on the foreshores outside       undesirable, the outlet must be
                                         is
maintained by a greater widening out of the training walls. The
actual direction of the training walls must be determined, in each
case, by the general direction of the channel above, the situation of
ports on the estuary, the position of the outlet, and the set of the flood
tide at the entrance.
   Concluding Remarks. — In terminating this record of my investiga
tions, and the general principles for training works which they seem
to indicate,  desire to acknowledge the care with which my assistant,
              I
Mr. E. Blundell, has carried out the tedious task of working the tides
in the model, and prepared the charts of the experimental results from
which the illustrations accompanying this paper have been drawn out.
Eddies at sharp edges, due to distortion of scale, appear to have ex
cessive scouring effect in a model       ; whilst the action of the more
regular currents exhibits a deficiency in scouring power, as previously
noted.   Though the actual depths of the channels, however, are too
small for the distorted vertical scale, reliance, I think, may be placed on
the general forms and relative depths of the channels obtained in a
model.    It possible that the inadequate depth might be remedied by
              is
the employment of    a  finer or lighter material for forming the bed of
the model, or by using   a   liquid of greater density than water; but
sand and water have the unquestionable            advantage of being the
substances which actually effect the changes in estuaries.

   Although the cranial nerves of Hexanchus, Echinorhinus, and
Scyllium have been fully described, and the segmental valae of the
nerves of Elasmobranch fishes repeatedly considered, the nervous
system of Lmmargus has hitherto escaped notice.    This    probably
                                                               is
to be accounted for by anatomists taking for granted that Lmmargus
agreed in the arrangement of its nerves with Echinorhinus and other
Spinacidce.

            On the    Cranial Nerves of Elasmobranch Fishes.           525
    I  have not yet had an opportunity of comparing Lmmargus with
 either Hexanchus or Echinorhinus, but    I have satisfied myself that the
 accounts given of the cranial nerves of these forms are not applicable
 in several important respects to the cranial nerves of Lcemargus, nor
 yet to the nerves of the common skate (Raia batis).       Further, I find
 that when, having mastered the arrangement of the cranial nerves of
 Lcemargus and Raia, one turns to Petromyzon, Scijllium, Galeus, and
 other familiar forms, it is impossible to accept many of the statements
 hitherto made as to the nature, distribution, and segmental value of
 the cranial nerves of vertebrates.
    In this preliminary communication I propose to describe shortly
the cranial nerves of Laimargus and Raia, reserving for a future
paper a comparison       between the nerves of Laimargus and other
 Elasmobranchs, and the consideration of the segmental value and the
more important modifications of the cranial nerves in the chief sub
divisions of the vertebrate group.
                    I. The Cranial Nerves of Lreniargus.
   As the olfactory and        optic nerves closely resemble those of
llexanchus, it is unnecessary to refer to them in this preliminary note,
and instead of beginning, as is usually done, with the oculo-motor, I
shall first describe the ophthalmicus profundus.
    1. The Ophthalmicus              —
                           Profundus. This nerve has usually been said
to belong either to the oculo-motor or to the trigeminal.      It presents
a root, more or less distinct, a root ganglion, and a trunk which gives
off a number of well-marked branches.           Although the segmental
value of the ophthalmicus profundus need not now be discussed, it
may be mentioned that since van Wijhe demonstrated                 that it
possessed a ganglion, its right to rank as a separate cranial nerve has
been deemed worthy of consideration.            Although Marshall and
Spencer concluded that there was nothing in support of the view that
the root of this nerve belonged to the trigeminal, and believed that its
trunk was a branch of the oculo-motor, Gegenbaur has recently
stated that he considers the ophthalmicus profundus with its ganglion
as part of the trigeminal.        Very different views have been held
as to the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus.            By Marshall
and Spencer the ganglion was said to belong to the oculo-motor,
and was identified as the ciliary ganglion. Beard, on the other
hand, considers the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus as
homologous with the Gasserian ganglion, while he thinks the ciliary
ganglion probably corresponds to a sympathetic ganglion. Believing,
with van Wijhe, in the possible existenco of two ganglia, ono on the
ophthalmicus profundus and one (the ciliary) in connexion with the
oculo-motor, Beard has given to tho ganglion of the ophthalmicus

526                       Prof. J.  C. Ewart.
 profundus the name of meso-cephalie.      He further states that there
 can be no doubt that the ciliary (as distinguished from the meso-
 cephalic) ganglion of lower vertebrates is exactly homologous with
 the ciliary ganglion of mammals.
    The ophthalmicus profundus nerve (1, fig. 1) in Lcemargics arises by
 several rootlets (2 — 5) from the side of the medulla immediately in
 front of the main root of the trigeminal, and runs outwards in contact
 with the anterior surface of the trigeminal to enter the large foramen
 which serves for the passage of the trigeminal, and the anterior
 portions of what may best be known as the facial complex.        As the
 ophthalmicus approaches the foramen it partly blends with the trige
 minal, and while in the foramen it communicates with this nerve by

              On  the Cranial Nerves of Elasinobranch Fishes.          527
  several  small branches.     On escaping from the cranial wall the
  ophthalmicus    profundus  separates from the trigeminal and presents a
  slight swelling, the meso-cephalic ganglion (Beard), or ciliary gan
  glion (Gegenbaur and others). This ganglion lies dorsal to, but only
  very slightly in front of, the large Gasserian ganglion of the trige
  minal (3, fig. 1). From the ganglion the trunk extends forwards over
  the external rectus muscle to pass under the rectus superior towards
  the eyeball, from which it bends inwards between the superior oblique
  and internal rectus muscles, to reach the suout by penetrating the
 pre-orbital process of the cranium.
     The more important branches of the ophthalmicus profundus are
  (1), a small branch which passes outwards above the superior rectus
 muscle; (2), two or three ciliary branches (ci., fig. 1), which run
 forwards under cover of the rectus superior to enter the eyeball — to
 these ciliary branches delicate filaments pass from the deep branch
 of the oculo-motor ; (3), small branches which pass outwards in
 front of the eyeball ; (4), branches to the skin, and subcutaneous
 tissue of the suout and to the rostral cartilage.   I have been unable to
 trace any branches from the ophthalmicus profundus to either the
 mucous canals or the ampullae of the sensory tubes : long and slender
branches, however, seem to be distributed to the tubes which extend
 from the ampullae to open through the skin.
     2. The Oculo-motor Nerve. — Although this nerve does not necessarily
stand in the same relation to the ophthalmicus profnndus as does the
ventral root to the dorsal root of a spinal nerve, it will be con
venient to deal with it before considering the trigeminal. The oculo
motor has been ranked very differently by different observers.
Marshall and Spencer considered it of segmental value, and Gaskell
has recently stated that it retains in its root vestiges of a ganglion.
Van Wijhe looks upon the oculo-motor as forming the ventral (motor)
root of the ophthalmicus profundus, whilst Gegenbaur neither admits
that it has the rank of a segmental nerve nor feels satisfied that it
represents the ventral root of the ophthalmicus profundus.
     The oculo-motor (2, fig. 1) in Loemargus arises by a number of
delicate rootlets (5 — 7) from the under-surface of the mid-brain, on
a level with the posterior end of the optic lobes and in line with the
abducens and spinal nerves.         Passing outwards it escapes from the
cranial cavity by a special foramen, and bends round the orbital pro
cess of the palato-pterygoid arch to reach the rectus superior, where
it divides into a superficial and a deep branch.            The superficial
supplies    the  superior  and  internal  recti muscles,  the deep branch
passing under the rectus superior sends filaments to the inferior
rectus and4inferior oblique muscles, and, as it runs over the pedicle,
it sends one or two exceedingly delicate twigs to the ciliary branches
of the ophthalmicus profundus.           I have been unable to find any

528                        Prof.  J.  C. Ewart.
ganglionic cells that might represent a root ganglion in any part of
the oculo-motor nerve or any representative of a ciliary ganglion, in
addition to the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus, or even any
communication between the oculo-motor nerve and the ganglion of
the ophthalmicus profundus, which has apparently been often de
scribed as the ganglion of the oculo-motor nerve, i.e., as the ciliary
ganglion.
   3. The   Trigeminal  Nerve. — Hitherto anatomists      have,   with few
exceptions, described the trigeminal nerve as arising in Elasmobranchs
by several roots, but there has seldom been complete agreement as to
either the number or position of the roots, and hence great confusion
has arisen.     Marshall and Spencer did much to remove this con
fusion by showing that the so-called dorsal root of the trigeminal
undoubtedly belonged to the facial. They described the trigeminal
as arising by a small anterior non-ganglionic root and a large posterior
ganglionic root.    Their small anterior root evidently corresponds to
the root of the ophthalmicus profundus, the ganglion of which they
transferred to the oculo-motor.
   In Lcemargus the origin of the trigeminal (3, fig. 1) is easily
made out.     When the rootlets of the ophthalmicus profundus are
removed, the trigeminal is found to spring from the side of the
medulla by a single large root (the posterior root of Marshall and
Spencer), which lies in a line with the ventral roots of the facial
complex.     The root of the trigeminal passes forwards and, blending
with the ophthalmicus profundus, enters the foramen under cover of
two of the subdivisions of the facial complex, viz., the, ophthalmicus
superficialis and buccal.    As it passes through the foramen it pre
sents a distinct swelling — the Gasserian ganglion.      The trunk of the
nerve at once divides into two large branches       —  the maxillary and
mandibular. A third but slender branch (the superficial ophthalmic
branch of the trigeminal) springs either from the trunk or from the
mandibular. Two very slender nerves, which leave the root as it
crosses the cranial cavity, pass upwards through the walls of the
cranium towards the skin in front of the ear capsule.
   The branches of the trigeminal are : (1) the superficial ophthalmic
which runs first along the inner and then obliquely over the upper
surface of the ophthalmicus superficialis of the facial complex, to
pass through a special canal in the pre-orbital cartilage and send
branches   to the subcutaneous    tissue of the snout, especially   in front
of the proorbital process.     (2) The maxillary branch. This nerve
runs forwards and outwards under the eye muscles, dividing on the
way into branches, which reach the under surface of the snout
and terminate in the vicinity of the anterior labial and palato-ptery-
goid cartilages. The trunk and its various branches are intimately
related to the buccal subdivision of the facial complex.           (3) The

             On  the Cranial Nerves of Elasmobranch Fishes.               529
mandibular branch.       This large nerve first gives off a number of small
twigs which pass nnder the buccal division of the facial to assist in
supplying the muscles in front of the spiracle.       It then divides into
branches which pass forwards and outwards supplying the mandi
bular and other muscles, and finally sends branches to the skin in the
 vicinity of the mandibular arch and the posterior labial cartilage.
 Some fibres from both the maxillary and mandibular nerves penetrate
 between the sensory tubes, and lie in close contact with the mucous
 canals, but in no case have   I found them terminating in the ampul lae      ,
 or penetrating the mucous canals to end in the sensory tissue lodged
in their cavities.
     The Facial Complex. — In describing the cranial nerves of Hexanchus,
 Gegenbaur considered the trigeminal and facial nerves as forming a
single group, and he included amongst the roots of the trigeminal
 the roots of two nerves (ophthalmicus superficialis and buccal) now
 all but universally acknowledged as belonging to the facial.
     While in the higher vertebrate the trigeminal nerve is of far more
importance than the facial, in the lower fishes it is otherwise ; for
while the trigeminal proper consists of but a single root the so-called
facial is made up of three large roots, one of which seems to be
double.    Hence, instead of grouping the trigeminal and facial nerves
together, it will be more convenient to consider the facial nerves by
themselves and speak of them as the facial complex.           This complex
includes four separate nerves, viz., (1) the ophthalmicus superficialis,
 (2) the buccal, (3) the palatine, and (4) the hyomandibular. In the
meantime it is only necessary to mention that the enormous develop
ment of the so-called facial is owing to the presence of a complex
system of lateral sense organs —sensory tubes and mucous canals.
    4. The Ophthalmicus Superficialis. — This nerve (4, fig. 1) arises by a
large root from the so-called trigeminal nucleus which occupies the
most dorsal portion of the medulla.      The root, in a large fish, lies on a
higher level (by about 4 mm.) than the other roots of the facial
complex, and it is also the most posterior root, i.e., the furthest from
the suout.    Arising far apart from the other divisions of the facial it
runs forwards and then bends downwards to roach the buccal nerve,
with which it freely communicates as it passes through the cranial
walls at a higher level than the trigeminal and ophthalmicus pro
fundus. Immediately beyond the walls of the cranium it presents a
ganglionic swelling, which consists of large bipolar cells, similar to
those of the Gasserian ganglion.       The main trunk of the nerve then
arches round the conical orbital process of the palato-pterygoid arch,
and extends forwards above the eye muscles to send branches to the
sensory tubes and mucous canals of the suout.
    In Lcemargus the ophthalmicus superficialis of the facial supplies
(1) the ampullae of the sensory tubes on the dorsal aspect of the suout,

     530                         Prof.  J. C. Ewart.
     and (2) the cranial, rostral, subrostral, and nasal mucous canals.*
     These canals are described by Garman, one of the latest writers on
     the subject, as being supplied by the trigeminal.           It may be men
     tioned that the minute branches for the cranial canal spring from the
     trunk of the nerve as it passes through the orbit and reach the surface
     by piercing the cartilage of the roof of the orbit at short and nearly
     regular intervals. A remarkable bundle of fibres runs obliquely
     across the upper border of the ophthalmicus superficialis at its origin,
     and reaching its anterior surface turns abruptly downwards to lie first
     in front of and afterwards under the buccal nerve. These fibres then
     form a plexus from which numerous twigs proceed to the conjoined
     roots of the hyomandibular and palatine nerves ; they probably even
     tually reach and end in ampulke and mucous canals.
        5. The Buccal Nerve. — This nerve (5, fig. 1) springs by a large root
     from the side of the medulla, behind and on a slightly higher level
     than the root of the trigeminal. As the root passes outwards, it lies in
     the groove formed by the roots of the trigeminal and the posterior
     portion of the facial complex.      After communicating freely with the
     ophthalmicus superficialis, it escapes with it through the cranial
     walls. Leaving the ophthalmicus superficialis, it comes into close
1    contact with the outer surface of the Gasserian ganglion, and then lies
  i  between the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal.
     As the buccal nerve leaves the Gasserian ganglion, it presents a
     distinct swelling which is crowded with large bipolar cells.              This
     may be called the buccal ganglion.         The buccal nerve beyond the
    ganglion comes into intimate relation with the maxillary nerve, and
    as it runs forward under the contents of the orbit, it breaks up into
    branches which eventually reach the ampullae and mucous canals of
    the snout not supplied by the ophthalmicus superficialis.          The buccal
    nerve also sends branches to the anterior portion of the occipital
    mucous canal, and to the posterior part of the cranial mucous canal,
    and it sends a branch backwards which disappears under the hyo
    mandibular cartilage.       Further, by means of branches which run
    outwards, behind or under the contents of the orbit, the buccal
    nerve supplies the orbital and suborbital canals, apparently without
    any assistance from the maxillary and mandibular branches of the
    trigeminal.
        The Palatine and Hyomandibular Nerves. — These nerves arise by a
    large root which lies between the trigeminal and auditory nerves, and
    partly under cover of the buccal nerve.         This root is augmented by
    fibres from the plexus which, as mentioned above, is formed in con
    nexion with the bundle of fibres that arches downwards from the
    ophthalmicus superficialis. Having received these additional fibres,
       * The  names used for the mucous  canals are those of Agassiz as modified by
    Garman.

             On the Cranial Nerves of Elasmobranch Fishes.              531
 the common root arches backwards, and enters a large foramen along
 with the auditory nerve. Leaving the auditory, it runs forwards
 through a canal in front of the auditory capsule.      Having proceeded
 some distance (about 5 cm. in a large fish), it divides into two branches,
 a large branch (the hyomandibular) that proceeds outwards behind
 the spiracle, and a smaller branch (the palatine), which bends down
 wards towards the roof of the month.       When the common trunk of
these nerves is carefully studied, it is found to consist of two separate
bundles, a small bundle which seems to be continuous with the
palatine nerve, and a larger bundle which is continuous with the
 hyomandibular nerve.     At the point of bifurcation there is a large
collection of ganglionic cells, some of which lie in the palatine nerve
and may be known as the palatine ganglion. Further, the two
nerves are connected in front of the apparently compound ganglion
by a number of fibres which have a somewhat plexiform arrange
ment.
    6. The  Palatine Nerve. — This nerve (6, fig. 1) at once gives off a
number of branches (prespiracular) which are distributed to the
tissues in front of the spiracle.    The main trunk sends numerous
branches to the roof of the mouth.        Continuous with what may be
 known as the root of the palatine nerve, a distinct bundle of fibres
runs outwards under the hyomandibular nerve (from which it receives
one or more small branches), and passing over the hyomandibular
cartilage, runs forwards to end in the fold of mncous membrane lying
between the hyoidean and mandibular cartilages.          I  look upon this
long slender nerve as corresponding to the chorda tympani of higher
vertebrates.
    7. The Hyomandibular Nerve. — This nerve (7, fig. 1) which increases
immensely in size, beyond the ganglion, is chiefly concerned in supply
ing the large group of ampulla that lies external to the spiracle, but
it also supplies the mucous canals not already referred to, with the
exception of the aural mucous canal and the canal of the lateral line.
It further sends a branch backwards to muscles lying over and within
the hyomandibular cartilage and the branchial apparatus.
    In describing the facial complex, I have referred to a special
ganglion on the ophthalmicus superficialis, to another on the buccal,
and to a compound ganglion in connexion with the hyomandibular
and palatine nerves. Gegenbaur considers the palatine nerve of Elas-
mobranchs as homologous with the great petrosal nerve of mammals.
                                  I
 If this comparison holds, which have every reason to believe it will,
the interesting question arises — Is there any relation between the
palatine ganglion of the Elasmobranch and the spheno-palatine gan
glion of the mammal ? And this leads to the further question —
 Are the ganglia of the ophthalmicus superficialis, buccal, and hyoman
dibular nerves related to the geniculate, otic, and submaxillary ganglia

   532                          Prof.  J.  C. Ewart.
  of the higher vertebrates ? These and other questions            I shall hope
   to deal with in a future paper.
      8. The Trochlearis  Nerve. — This nerve (8, fig. 1) arises from the side
  of the brain immediately behind the optic lobe. It passes forward and
  upwards to pierce the cranium a considerable distance in front of the
  oculo-motor, it then dips downwards and outwards under the ophthal
  micus superficial to supply the superior oblique muscle.               I have
  been unable to find any sensory branch passing from this nerve in
  Lcemargus, and in no part of its length does it contain ganglionic
  cells.
     9.  The Abducens. — This nerve (9, fig. 1) has a striking resemblance
  to the anterior spinal nerves.        It arises by three or four extremely
  slender rootlets which are      in  a line with the rootlets of the oculo
  motor in front and the spinal nerves (ventral roots) behind.              The
  rootlets unite to form    a trunk which at first lies midway between the
 auditory and glossopharyngeal nerves.            The trunk proceeds forward
 and perforates the cranial wall to reach and supply the external rectus
 muscle.      The abducens nerve, like the oculo-motor and trochlearis, is
 devoid of ganglionic cells. It cannot be said to be specially related to
 the facial complex — to form as has been suggested its motor root.
     10. The Auditory Nerve. — The auditory nerve (10, fig. 1) lies imme
 diately behind and slightly ventral to the common root of the ventral
 portion of the facial complex.       It runs outwards behind these nerves
 and enters the same cranial canal and at once divides into branches
 for the auditory apparatus.         Although there is no distinct swelling,
 the root, some distance from its origin, is crowded with ganglionic
cells.
     11.  The Glossopharyngeal Nerve. — This nerve (11, fig. 1) has been
 long considered one of the most primitive and typical of the cranial
nerves. It arises from the side of the medulla in front of and in a line
with the rootlets of the middle portion of the vagus, but under cover
of the anterior portion of the vagus.           The number of rootlets varies,
but there is usually one largo rootlet and two or three slender ones, and
it receives a twig from one of the rootlets of the anterior portion of
the vagus.      The rootlets together form a small rounded nerve, which
passes     backwards   and outwards through a special canal under the
auditory capsule to reach and give two large branches (pre- and post-
branchial) to the walls of the first true branchial cleft and a small
branch (pharyngeal) to the pharynx.                -When midway through the
walls    of the cranium  it  presents  a  distinct  swelling which is crowded
with ganglionic cells. Immediately beyond the ganglion a small
dorsal branch takes its origin, which passes upwards through the
cranium to reach the skin over the auditory region.           Apparently this
dorsal branch does not assist in supplying either mucous canals or
sensory tubes.

            On  the  Cranial Nerves of Elasmobranch Fishes.           533
    The Vagus Complex. — The vagus has been long held to represent a
large number of nerves which, in most vertebrates, gradually coalesced
as   the branchial region became reduced in size or otherwise altered.
Balfour states that the vagus arises in Elasmobranchs by four gan
glionic roots, while more [recently Beard and van Wijhe agree in
describing the vagus as first appearing in the form of an unsegmented
band which later blends with an epiblastic sensory thickening above
the four posterior branchial clefts.      The nerve for the second true
 branchial cleft is said, at an early period, to separate from this mass
and develop a ganglion.      Later the three posterior branchial nerves
 appear, but for these it is said there is usually only a single ganglion
which, however, ventrally " shows a division into three portions."
While the anterior portion of the vagus is described as supplying the
second branchial cleft, the nerve to the lateral line is described as
arising as a secondary formation from the epiblastic sensory thicken
ing above mentioned.       The lateral line nerve is usually described as
springing from the common trunk, but Balfour, impressed with the
importance of this nerve, says it
                                        " may very probably be a dorsal
sensory branch of the vagus." That this surmise is practically correct
will appear from what follows.
    In  Lcemargus   the vagus complex (12, fig. 1) arises by numerous
rootlets disposed in three separate groups, an anterior group including
two or three rootlets, a middle consisting of over twenty, and a pos
terior group of five or six rootlets.     Hitherto the anterior portion of
the vagus has been usually spoken of as Vagus I, or the nerve of the
second branchial (first vagus) cleft.      In Lcemargus the anterior divi
sion of the vagus appears to be almost entirely concerned in supplying
the mucous canal of the lateral line, and hence it may be known as
the lateralis nerve, or nerve of the lateral line. Its right to be con
sidered as a special nerve becomes all the more evident when it is
 mentioned that in some, if not all cases, it presents a ganglionic swell
ing. The lateralis nerve (I, fig. 1) seems in many respects comparable
to the ophthalmicus superficialis of the facial complex, and like this
latter nerve it springs from the side of the medulla on a higher level
than the other divisions of the group to which it belongs.      In several
cases I have found it arising by one large root and a small accessory
rootlet dorsal to and slightly in front of the roots of the glosso
pharyngeal. Having sent a twig from its small rootlet to the glosso
pharyngeal, it extends backwards to enter and traverse with the rest
 of the vagus the long cranial canal that runs backwards and out
 wards behind the auditory capsule.       Soon after entering the canal ic
seems to blend with the rest of the vagus, but with care the whole or
at least most of the fibres springing from above the glossopharyngeal
 can be shown to be directly continuous with the nerve of the lateral
 line. Soon after entering the canal it gives off a slender branch which,

534                         Prof.   J.   C. Ewart.
leaving the lateralis, arches upwards to supply the aural mucous
canal and the anterior portion of the canal of the lateral line. Before
escaping from the cranium the lateralis gives off another slender
branch which is distributed to the succeeding portion of the lateral
line. The rest of the lateral line is supplied by numerous slender
fibres which spring from the lateralis as it passes backwards towards
the tail.
   In addition to the lateralis there are five other nerves in Lcemargus,
belonging to the vagus complex, viz., an intestinal and lour branchial
nerves.    The first branchial nerve (the Vagus                   I
                                                         of most authors),
which is made up of the rootlets which lie immediately behind the
root of the glossopharyngeal     nerve, lies at first in close contact with
the lateralis.    This nerve (26, fig. 1) presents a distinct ganglionic
swelling  as  it passes through the vagus canal.      Before escaping from
the canal it breaks up into the three characteristic branches — post-
and pre-branchial and pharyngeal.         The three posterior branchial s
(3
   —  5 b, fig. 1) and the intestinal          (*-,
                                             fig.     are derived from the

common    trunk.    This  trunk contains  numerous     ganglionic cells. In
a large fish the compound ganglion (g, fig.          may reach a length of
                                                             1)
six  or seven   inches.   Each  of  the  branch  ials gives off the three
usual branches, while the intestinal passes backwards towards the
intestine and other structures. From the common trunk three or
four slender filaments which extend outwards at a deeper level than
the branches of the lateralis may represent dorsal branches of the
posterior branchial nerves. It may be added that the vagus complex
has no ventral roots    ; the so-called ventral roots of the vagus re
present spinal nerves which have probably lost their posterior roots.
In their distribution these nerves       — sp., fig.
                                          (1      2      agree with spinal

rather than with cranial nerves     ;two of them penetrate the occipital
region  of the skull  on their way to  the surface.
                  II.   The Cranial Nerves            of   Raia batis.
   The cranial nerves of the skate, with the exception of those belong-
ing to the vagus complex, closely resemble the corresponding nerves
of Lcemargus, hence, with the exception of the vagus, little more is
necessary in the meantime than a short reference to their respective
ganglia.
     The Ophthalmicus profundus. — The root of this nerve (1, fig. 2),
    1.
in Raia   more intimately connected with the root of the trigeminal
           is
than in Lasmargus.   The position and relations of the ganglion are of
special interest. In Lcemargus the ganglion of the ophthalmicus pro
fundus was situated some distance behind, and       had no connexion
                                                                  it
with, the oculo-motor nerve. In Raia the ganglion of the ophthalmicus
profundus lies some distance in front of the Gasserian ganglion, partly
under cover of the rectus superior muscle and over the deep branch

            On the Cranial Nerves   of Elasmobranch Fishes.          53ft
of the oculomotor.     Further, the ciliary nerves, instead of springing
from the trunk of the nerve some distance in front of the ganglion.
as in Lcemargus, usually spring from the under surface          or outer
margin of the ganglion, and hence the branches (ciliary) of the
oculo-motor nerve, in passing to join the ciliary branches of the pro
fundus, have to pass under the ganglion of the ophthalmicus pro
fundus ; the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus thus seems to
be in a sense connected with the oculo-motor nerve, which doubtless
explains why so many observers have described the ganglion of the
ophthalmicus profundus as belonging to the oculo-motor. Were the
root and trunk of the ophthalmicus reduced to slender filaments, the
conditions found in some of the higher vertebrates would be arrived
at, and the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus would appear to
belong to the oculo-motor rather than to a branch of the trigeminal
or an entirely separate nerve.
   The oculo-motor, pathetic (2, 8, fig. 2), and abducens resemble the
   vol. xlv.                                                  2 N

corresponding nerves in Lcemargus, and, as in Lcemargus, they never
present ganglia in any part of their course.
    There is the usual ganglion on the trigeminal nerve, and this nerve
(3, fig. 2), as in Lcvmargus, divides into maxillary (3', fig. 2) and
mandibular (3", fig. 2) branches, and sends a superficial ophthalmic
branch to the snout along with the ophthalmicus superficialis of the
facial.    The facial complex, again, consists of four nerves, viz.: — (1)
the ophthalmicus superficialis (4, fig. 2), with a large ganglion, which
lies immediately above and in front of the Gasserian ganglion ; (2)
the buccal (5, tig. 2), with a ganglion lying over the origin of the
mandibular branch of the trigeminal; (3) the palatine (6, fig. 2),
(with an indistinct root containing ganglionic cells) which gives off
palatine and prespiracular branches, and a branch which extends
outwards to unite with fibres from the hyomandibular and bend
round the hyomandibular cartilage, and eventually reach the floor of
the mouth behind the mandible, thus resembling the chorda tympani ;
and (4) the hyomandibular nerve (7, fig. 2), which is chiefly distri
buted to mucous canals and the ampullae of sensory tubes.              To the
hyomandibular a large bundle of fibres is contributed, as in Lcemargus,
from the upper border of the ophthalmicus superficialis.
    The auditory nerve (10, fig. 2) lies in contact with the hyoman
dibular, and has numerous ganglionic cells in its root.
    The glossopharyngeal       nerve (11, fig. 2) rnns forwards from under
the root of the lateralis nerve, and, bending backwards, passes out
wards through a canal which opens into the floor of the cavity of the
auditory capsule.         Passing through the cavity of the capsule, the
nerve next penetrates its outer wall, and at once expands to form a
large oval gang1 m, from which the usual branches take their origin.
A dorsal branch, which reaches the surface of the head, does not seem
to supply any portion of the occipital or aural mucous canals.
    The vagns complex (12, fig. 2) in some respects seems to be more
primitive in the skate than in any other Elasmobranch. It may be
 said to consist of six nerves, all of which can be readily distinguished,
 and each nerve presents a distinct ganglion. These nerves are (1) the
 lateralis       fig. 2), which springs by a special root above and. in front
               (I,
 of the glossopharyngeal nerve.         The ganglion of the lateralis varies
 in position, being sometimes situated nearly two inches beyond the
 point at which the nerve issues from the cranium, in other cases
 only half an inch from its point of exit. A slender branch arising in
 the vagus canal arches upwards to supply the anterior portion of the
 canal of the lateral line, the aural, and part of the occipital mucoos
 canals.    The main trunk of the lateralis     is   distributed to the rest of
 the canal of the lateral line and to the posterior pleural canal.

 vagns escapes from tho^crahium, , while the. fourth (5 6, fig. 2) is
 united with the intestinal nerve--(vfig--2y until the level of the fifth
 branchial cleft is reached.              In each of the three anterior branchial
 nerves the ganglion is situated within a short distance of the point of
 bifurcation into the post- and pre-branchial branches.                       The ganglion
of the fourth nerve lies in contact with the common trunk from
 which it springs. (.3.) The intestinal nerve (t., fig. 2) passes back
wards, and has its ganglion immediately beyond the point where it
separates from the last branchial.                  Sometimes one (1 sp., fig. 2), or
two ventral roots of spinal nerves arise under cover of the roots of the
vagus and escape through the occipital region of the cranium, but as
in Lcenuirgus they never unite with any of the fibres of the vagus, and
there is no reason for considering them as ventral roots of the vagus
complex.

of Lc°margus required              for the investigation.

   The following determinations of the magnetic elements among the
Caribees or Windward Islands were made in August, 1886, on the
occasion of the Eclipse Expedition of that year to Grenada.
   The instruments employed were magnetometer Elliott No. 61, and
Dip Circle Dover 83, belonging to the Science and Art Department.
   The method of observation was similar to that adopted in the
Magnetic Survey of the British Isles for epoch January 1st, 1886, for
which these instruments were also employed.

 II.  " Experiments on the Resistance of Electrolytic Cells." By
        Capt. H. R. Sankey, R.E. Communicated by W. H. Preece,
        F.R.S. Received March 21, 1889.
                                    (Abstract.)
    It was observed during the course of some experiments on the
 electrolytic deposition of copper that the resistance of the electrolytic
 cells employed was greater the lower the current density, and the
 experiments described in this paper were undertaken to inquire more
 definitely into the matter.
    Many physicists have already observed the same effect, and have
 ascribed it to a resistance at the junctions of the electrodes with the
                             "              "
 electrolyte, and called it transfer          resistance.
    In these experiments a prismatic electrolytic cell of triangular
 cross-section    was employed, and the area of the electrodes was equal
 to that of the cross-section of the liquid. The electrodes experimented
 with    were    electrotype copper, lead, zinc, and platinum, and the
 electrolytes,    solutions of CuS04 of various sp. gr., neutral and
 acidulated, of ZnS04, MgS04, NaCl, Na^CO3, dilute H2S04, Ac. The
 electrodes were placed at different distances apart, but in general had
 an area of 50 square cm.
    All the measurements were made by noting the swing of a
 Thomson's reflecting galvanometer, used as a potentiometer,                      and
 standardised before each trial by means of a Clark's cell.
    The current was measured by observing the potential difference
 across a known resistance.
    The P.D. of the cell was proportional to the swing of the spot of
 light.
    The counter E.M.F. was obtained by taking the swing on breaking
 the circuit, the galvanometer being connected across the terminals of
 the cell ; but this swing is not proportional to the C. E.M.F. existing
 in the cell whilst the circuit is completed.              Readings were, there

 542                       Capt. H. R. Sankey.                      [Apr.  4, *
 fore, taken to obtain the fall of the C.E.M.F. on breaking the circuit,
 so as to obtain the correction to be applied to the reading.            This
 correction was found to vary considerably according      to  the electrodes
 and the electrolytes   ; with acidulated CuS04 solutions and electro
 type copper electrodes it varied from 3 to 15 per cent.
    A variety of tests were made to ascertain what degree of depend
 ence could be placed on these measurements of C.E.M.F., because, of
 course, on them the whole matter rests.         Probably the most con
 clusive of these tests was the measurement of the resistance (by the
 method employed in these experiments) of an arrangement, consist
 ing of a box of coils and of an electrolytic cell of very large area,
 whose resistance might be neglected, but which supplied a C.E.M.F.
 The measured resistances agreed, within 2 per cent., of the resistance
 unplugged in the box.
    The conclusion come to is that the C.E.M.F. was determined with
 a fair degree of accuracy, sufficient to show the existence of a transfer
resistance.
    The resistance of the electrolyte itself was measured in some cases
by finding the P.D. across two cross-sections of the liquid, by means
of fine wires dipping into the liquid at a known distance apart. This
resistance was found to be (as might be expected) independent of
the current density.
    Deducting the resistance of the electrolyte as thus obtained from
the resistance of the cell gave the " transfer
                                                " resistance.
    In commencing each trial a current of about 2-7 milliamperes was
passed through the cell for some time, which was found to increase
the resistance of the cell up to a limit depending on the previous
history of the electrodes.
    The current was then increased by approximately doubling it each
time until it reached about 370 milliamperes. It was found that as
the current increased the resistance diminished, rapidly at first, more
slowly afterwards (set A).
   After applying the 370 milliamperes current, the current was
again suddenly reduced to about 2- 7 milliamperes, and it was found
that the resistance had become much smaller, but that it immediately
began to increase again, somewhat rapidly at first (set B).
   A few minutes afterwards the current was again increased, as in
set A, and the resistance was found to diminish as the current
increased, but more slowly than in set A (set C). When a current
of 370 milliamperes was reached, the resistance in both set A and
set C were practically equal, and the transfer resistance was small.
   The figure shows one of the trials with acidulated CuS04 solution
and lead electrodes.      The sudden rise in the resistance (set A)
occurred at the moment the cathode became covered with copper. In
this figure the thick line shows set A, the thin line set C, and the

 1889.]   Experiments on    the Resistance   of Electrolytic Cells.   543
dotted lines the resistance of the electrolyte obtained during set A and
set C.
   A great many trials were made, some few of which are given in the
paper. All give evidence of a transfer resistance diminishing as the
current increases.
   The view is expressed that the " transfer " resistance is not due to
a non-conducting layer being formed on one or both electrodes, since if
such were the case the resistance would increase as the current in
creases, and would be greater after the application of a strong current
than before. It is suggested that this transfer resistance may be due
to some molecular interaction at the junction of the electrodes with
the electrolyte, offering a greater resistance to weak currents than to
strong, and the reduction of the resistance after the application of a
strong current supports this suggestion, in that the disturbance set
up by the strong currents would probably last for some time.
   A trial was made with acidulated CuSO^ solution and electro-
copper electrodes under identical conditions, with the exception of
the area of the electrodes, which was varied.       It was found that the
transfer resistance per unit area was sensibly the same for same
current density.
   The effect of temperature was also inquired into, but only to a
limited extent. With weak currents the transfer resistance diminished
very rapidly as the temperature increased, and at about 70° C. the
transfer resistance was very small.

      for the Epoch January 1, 1886." By A. W. ROCKER, M.A.,
      F.R.S., and T. E. Thobpe, B.Sc, Ph.D., F.R.S. Received
      (in abstract) April 11, 1889.
                               (Abstract.)
   Two magnetic surveys of the British Isles have been made previous
to that of which an account is given in this paper.         The necessary
observations were taken    between  the years 1834-38   and  1857-62, and
the results were reduced to the epoch 1842-5 by Sir E. Sabine (- Phil.
Trans.,' 1870, p. 265).    The stations in these were very irregularly
distributed over the area under investigation, the declination was
determined at but few places, and the force in the earlier survey was
only determined relatively to London.
   In the five years 1884-88, both inclusive, the authors have made an

 1889.]         A  Magnetic Survey   of the British Isles.          547
exhaustive survey of the United Kingdom.          They have observed at
200 principal and a number of secondary stations, and at all the
principal stations, except three or four, all the magnetic elements
have been determined.
   The two sets of instruments employed have been carefully com
pared with each other at the Kew Observatory in 1884, 1886, and
1887, and are in remarkably good accord.     All the observations were
made by the authors except the dip observations at eight stations in
Scotland, for which they have to thank Mr. A. P. Laurie, Fellow of
King's College, Cambridge.
   The chronometers were frequently compared with Greenwich by
means of the 10 a.m. time signal, for leave to receive which the
authors are much indebted to the good offices of Mr. Preece, F.R.S.
   The probable errors of the observations are as follows : —
             Declination                 + 0'-699
             Horizontal force            ± 0 00028   (M.V.)
             Dip                         + 0'-51
In   this computation, only declination observations which are in all
respects independent are included.       The horizontal force observa
tions are also as independent as is possible for nearly simultaneous
observations, and the dips compared are those taken with the two
needles.
   The authors propose the name isomagnetics for the class of curves
which are drawn through points at which the values of one of the
magnetic elements are constant, and in which isogonals, isoclinals,
&c., are included.
   To determine the form of the isomagnetics, they divided the area
of the survey into nine overlapping districts, and found for each a
linear formula which connected the value of the element with the
latitude and longitude. By means of this formula they calculated
the value of the element at points where the lines of longitude corre
sponding to whole degrees east or west of Greenwich intersect lines
of latitude which correspond to half degrees.            Where several
districts overlap, the mean value was taken.      From the values thus
obtained at a series of points regularly distributed all over the
country, the isomagnetics     were approximately determined.       The
forms of these curves were slightly irregular, and equations were
framed to represent smooth curves which passed through their
mean directions. Theso were the equations to the terrestrial or un
disturbed isomagnetics.
   These are compared with those obtained in the earlier surveys, and
the secular change is fully discussed.
   The calculated values of the elements are then obtained for every
station, and by comparing these with the observed values, the magni

548             A  Magnetic Survey    of the British Isles.      [Apr. 11,
tude and direction of the disturbing force     at each station was deter
mined.
    It was found that the Malvern     Hills attract the north pole of the
needle strongly.
    The well-known fact that the difference of the declination at Kew
and Greenwich is much greater than the difference of longitude will
explain, is found to be connected with a widespread regional mag
netic disturbance within the area of which these observatories lie.
    Several methods of argument all point to the conclusion that the
centre of this disturbance lies between Windsor and Reading, and a
little to the north and east of the latter town.       Towards this point
all the calculated disturbing forces in the neighbourhood converge.
    The authors adopt, as a working hypothesis, the view that this
attraction is due to the same cause as that observed at the Malverns,
viz., the presence of igneous rocks, and they prove that the range cf
the disturbance extends from Kenilworth to the Channel, and from
Salisbury to the North Sea, a total area of about 10,000 square miles.
    As the centre is approached the excess of the observed downward
vertical force above that given by calculation increases, and it reaches
a maximum at Reading close to the point which a study of the hori
zontal forces had indicated as the centre.
    Extending the same method to the rest of the country, though this
has not been studied by them in the same detail as south-eastern
England, the authors prove (1) that the results obtained on re- visiting
the same station indicate that even in disturbed districts, the direction
of the disturbing force can in general be determined by a single set
of observations to within 15°, and in most cases to within a much
 smaller limit; (2) that the directions of the disturbing forces were the
same when Mr. Welsh surveyed Scotland in 1857 as they are now ;
 (3) that the horizontal disturbing forces tend towards districts in
 which the vertical disturbing force is a maximum ; (4) that certain
regions in which crystalline rocks occur display a marked attraction
on the needle ; (5) that in certain other regions, and notably iu lines
running respectively from London to the South Wales coal-field and
from the Lincolnshire Wolds to the Lake District, though no crystal
 line rocks appear on the surface, magnetic attractions, similar to that
 observed near Reading, are in play, which indicate the existence of
 crystalline rocks at no great depth ; (6) that there are in Great Britain
 five principal regions of the two kinds referred to in (4) and (5),
 towards which the horizontal disturbing forces act.        Their positions
 may be defined approximately by means of the following lines, which
pass through their central parts, viz., («) the line of the Caledonian
 Canal ; (/3) a line somewhat to the west of the basaltic masses in the
 Western Isles ; (7) a line passing through the Scotch coal-field, iu
 which crystalline basaltic rocks occur ; (£) a line certainly parallel to,

   A  physician, who may be designated as A, undertook to live for
twenty-eight days on distilled water and whole meal. Each day a
certain quantity of the meal was ground by himself, weighed, and
made either into cakes or porridge by means of distilled water.
   The excreta were forwarded to me for analysis.
   The experiment may be divided into three stages: — (1) A period of
eight days, during which the insufficient quantity of 16 ozs. (453-59
grams) of whole meal was taken ; (2) a period of fourteen days,
during which 20 ozs. (566-98 grams) of whole meal were taken ; (3)
a period of seven days during which 28 ozs. (793 77 grams) of whole
meal were taken.

     At  the end of the first period, during which the insufficient quantity
 of 16 ozs. was taken, there was a loss in weight of 7 lbs., the breath
 ing capacity       seemed     a  little increased, but the tests showed no other
 marked deviation from the above.                       During the second period, in
 which the meal was increased to 20 ozs., there was a farther loss of
 3 lbs.     During the third period, when 28 ozs. were taken, this loss of
 weight ceased and          a  slight gain was recorded.
     During the whole twenty-eight days, A suffered, according to his
 own account, but trifling inconvenience : the bodily functions were
 regularly performed, the mental capacity unaltered ; there was a
 marked absence of indigestion, the sleep was sound, and there was no
 deterioration of muscular power.                   On the other hand there was
 a marked decrease of sexual power as well as desire.                     The appearance
 of A during and at the end of the experiment was not that of perfect
 health.      The features were pinched ; there was slight anaemia.
     The measurements and tests as determined in Mr. Francis Galton's
 laboratory were as follows : —

   During this last period there was retention of nitrogen. The phos
phates were pretty well balanced, that is, ingestion was nearly equal
to excretion, 83'6 per cent. of the total dry substance was digested,
but only 36 per cent. of the fat. It is to be noted that there was an
undiminished urinary output of chlorine and sulphur.
   The constant undiminished excretion of sulphuric acid as sulphate
by the urine and a small quantity of unoxidised sulphur by the intes
tinal canal, although only traces were found in the flour itself,
rendered it desirable that there should be a control experiment upon
some other person.       Accordingly, an Oxford graduate, upon whom
every reliance could be placed, undertook to live for one week upon
whole meal and distilled water. This gentleman will be referred to
as O.
   0 lived   a sedentary  life, was of a slight build, and weighed 137 lbs.
at the commencement of the experiment.             He took also each day a
measured quantity of olive oil, the oil being mixed with the whole
meal and baked with it.         The quantity of whole meal taken daily
varied from 16 — 22 ozs. The solid excreta of the last three days only
were collected for analysis, and the urine of the last two days.

     O, therefore, digested       88-1   per cent. of dry substance ingested;
 93 per cent. of the fat disappeared.             There was (practically) nitro
 genous    and  phosphoric acid equilibrium ; there was some retention of
 salts, perhaps to   be  attributed to the small quantity of liquid O drank.
 Sulphur    was excreted,      although only traces were ingested, and the
 excretion of chlorine was small.
    At the end of the experiment 0 was in good health. He had lost
 a little in weight — 1*25 lbs.
    The importance of obtaining exact information of the nutritive
powers of bread as the basis of ordinary diet need scarcely be accen
tuated.     The quantities of whole meal consumed per diem were, it is
obvious, deficient in nitrogen, in fat, and in salts. Both of the
gentlemen who undertook the experiment lived an ordinary town life,
that is, they daily took moderate exercise, but their pursuits involved
no manual or hard labour, and therefore must be classed as sedentary j
but a less supply than 18 grams of nitrogen and 5 grams of fat
would not be likely to keep either of them for a long period in the
highest health.       The excretion of sulphate by the urine and of
unoxidised sulphur by the bowel is interesting and demands still
further experiment; considering that sulphur is an essential com
ponent of albumen, too little attention has hitherto been paid to its
study as a food, but it is obvious that once it is accepted that the
external supplies of sulphur were cut off, the sulphur found must have
been derived from sulphur stores in the body, with possibly a trifling
amount condensed in the lung from breathing London air.
    If the excretion by the bowel be considered waste, then on an
average 15-6 per cent. of the total nitrogen in the bread or whole
meal is not in an assimilable form ; about 37 per cent. of the fat is
also not digested, and 51 -8 per cent. of the ash also passes away.

    Second     Series   of Results    of the Harmonic Analysis of
        Tidal Observations." Collected by G. H. Dabwin, LL.D.,
        F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College and Plumian Professor
        in the University of Cambridge. Received January 18,—
        Read February 7, 1889.
     A collection of results by Major Baird and myself has been already
  published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,' No. 239, 1885 ; and
                     1
  the present paper brings together new results which I have been able to
  collect since the date of that paper.     I begin with some remarks on
  the sources of information, and on the observations at each station.
  A table of the latitudes and longitudes of the places of observation is
  prefixed to those of the harmonic constants.
                                    Dover.
     In  the Second Report of the Committee of the British Association
.on the "Tides of the Euglish Channel and the North Sea" (1879), the
  following passage occurs : —
     " The importance of an accurate knowledge of the tides at Dover
  in particular, in connection with those of the entire English Channel,
  being soon made evident to the Committee, as well as the great advan-
. tage which would ensue from the establishment       of a self-registering
  tide-gauge at    that place, the matter   was brought by the Chairman
.under the notice of the Board of Trade; the request being further
  supported by the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Earl Granville.
  The Board of Trade received the request most favourably, and con
  sented to establish at their own expense a self-registering gauge, at a
  site some distance down the Admiralty Pier, where a tide-well had
  been made during the original construction of the pier ; its connection
  with the water outside being at a level twelve feet below the low
  water of ordinary spring tides.       The gauge, embracing Sir William
   Thomson's latest improvements, has been constructed and erected by
  Messrs. A. Lege and Co., under the direction of Mr. Edward
   Druce, C.E., the resident engineer in charge of the Admiralty Works
   at Dover.    It will remain, of course, in the hands of, and under the
  control of the Board of Trade."
      In 1886 another Committee of the British Association, appointed to
   consider the tides of Dover, exhibited to the meeting the tide-curves
   for Dover for the four years 1880-83, and it was stated that the
   Minister of Public Works of Belgium had presented to the Secretary
   of the Committee copies of the self-registered tide-curves for Ostend
  for several years. A comparison of the high and low waters at the
  two ports during one lunation is given in the Report of this Com
  mittee.

                Harmonic Analysis    of Tidal    Observations,         557/
     Mr. J. N. Shoolbred, the Secretary of both Committees, was instructed
  to intrust the curves to me, in order that they might be submitted to
 harmonic analysis.     He afterwards was so good as to obtain from
 Mr. Drnce the continuation of the Dover curves. As the reduction
 of the whole series of curves would have been very expensive, it was
 determined that only the curves for 1883-4-5 should be treated ; these
 years were selected because there was reason to suppose that the
 curves were more accurate than the earlier ones.
     To meet the expense of the reduction, Sir William Thomson obtained
 £50 from the Royal Society Grant, and this sum was afterwards
handed to me. The amount would, however, have been altogether
 insufficient if Major Baird had not interested himself in the matter,
 and introduced me to Mr. E. Connor, of the Tidal Department of the
 Survey of India. Mr. Connor then generously offered to devote his
spare time to the work, and undertook the superintendence of the
native computers at Poona.       The reductions of three years of Dover
curves, and of the same three of Ostend curves, have been made with
all the thoroughness and care of the Indian work. The computations
themselves are now in my hands, and the curves have been returned
to   Mr.  Shoolbred.
    The tidal record was frequently interrupted at Dover, for there are
34 days wanting in 1883, 57 days in 1884, and 72 days in 1885. The
gaps are only of a few days at a time, except from September 24 to
October 26, 1885.
    The zero of the Dover gauge is said to be 8-67 feet below the
Ordnance datum, and therefore 11*33 feet above the "international
datum," which is stated in the British Association Report (1879) on
Levels to be 20-00 feet below English Ordnance datum.
    The reduction of the tide curves shows that the mean sea level at
Dover was, in 1883, 0-52 foot; in 1884, 0-46 foot; and in 1885,
0-21 foot above Ordnance datum.
    The French Nivellement General is 2-625 feet below Atlantic
M.S.L., and 1*992 foot below Ordnance datum. Hence Atlantic
M.S.L. is 0-633 foot above Ordnance datum. Thus Dover M.S.L.
was, in 1883, 0-11 foot ; in 1884, 0T7 foot ; and in 1885, 0-42 foot below
Atlantic M.S.L.
    It appears from the Ostend curves that Ostend M.S.L. was, in 1883,
0-25 foot ; in 1834, 0 37 foot; and in 1885, 0 21 foot above Ordnance
datum, and therefore in 1883, 0-38 foot ; in 1884, 0-26 foot ; and in
1885, 042 foot below Atlantic M.S.L.            Thus Ostend M.S.L. was
below Dover M.S.L. by 0-27 foot in 1883 ; by 0-09 foot in 1884; and
they were the same in 1885. By reference to the Atlantic M.S.L. we
see that by far the larger part of these remarkable oscillations depends
on Dover.
    But it is nearly incredible that the sea at Dover should have been

               Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations.                    559
tions in the working of the gauge, the gaps being 64 days in 1883,
64 days in 1884, and 14 days in 1885.
   It has already been remarked that the Ostend observations were
apparently well made, although, perhaps, not of the very highest
perfection.
   The results are referred to Ostend local time.
                                  Heligoland.
   The results for Heligoland are taken from Dr. Borgen's paper on the
Tides of South Georgia and Kingua- Fjord,* where they are given inci
dentally as a means of testing a proposed method of reduction. The
observations appear to have been made in 1882, and the reductions
were, I believe, made by Dr. Borgen. The heights were given in
centimetres, but have been rednced to feet.
             Copenhagen, Nanortalik,    Angmagsalik, Godthaab.
   I  owe these observations    to Dr. Crone, of Copenhagen, by whom,         I
believe, the reductions were performed.
   The observations at Nanortalik and Angmagsalik were made by a
Danish Expedition between 1883 and 1885. At the latter station the
observations were very short, and Dr. Crone has only attempted to
determine the mean lunar interval of 4h. 6 m., or * of M2.
   The heights were given in centimetres, but have been reduced to
feet.
   The observations at Godthaab were made by the Danish Polar
Expedition of 1882-3 ; they extended from July 16 to August 31,
1883.
   Dr. Crone has written     a paper  entitled " Flux   et Reflux de la Mer
a  Godthaab."
                       South Georgia and Kingua-Fjord.
   These observations were made by the Arctic and Antarctic expedi
tions of the German Government.         The observations in South Georgia
were made with a self-registering tide-gauge, those at Kingua-Fjord
by the officers of the ship. The observations were reduced by Dr.
Borgen, of Wilhelmshaven, and further information will be found in
the paper referred to above.
   The gauge was erected in South Georgia in January, 1883, and was
in operation until the end of April, when it was put out of order by
heavy weather.        The observations began again on 21st May, and
continued until 2nd September, with breaks of only a few hours or of
a day caused by ice.      The means of the values derived from the two
periods of observation are given below.

560                        Prof. G. H. Darwin.
   At Kingna-Fjord, the head of the expedition, Dr. Giese, charged
M. Hiihleisen with the duty of making the observations.              The
observations    began on 22nd July at 6 a.M., and continued until 1st
 September,   8  p.m., a period of 41 days.    The height of water was
observed every two hours, and also every five minutes about high and
low water.      From these observations a continuous tide-curve was
formed which was treated by harmonic analysis.
   Dr. Borgen informs me that the values of k for the dinrnal tides
Kjf 0, P, as printed in his paper, require correction by 180°. This
arose from the fact that the observations, as subjected to reduction,
began at midnight.      The correction has been made in the table below.
The heights are given in metres by Dr. Borgen, but have been reduced
to feet.
                             Kerguelen Inland.
   These results are from a letter of Dr. Borgen to me, dated   July  -22,
1887.    He writes:—
   " I have just finished the calculation of the tides at Kerguelen
Island, Betsy Cove, where we had a self-registering tide-gauge put
up by the officers of H.M.S.

of observing the transit of Venus in 1874. The observations com
mence at noon November 16, 1874, and close at noon January 29,
1875. Some difficulties, which arose from choking up and partially
destroying the pipe in which the float moved, caused two inter
ruptions of five and nine days. From this cause, and because the
weather in that region is rather boisterous (we noticed 450 hours out
of a quarter of a year, or 2,160 hours, with a velocity of the wind
higher than 15 metres per second), I am inclined to think the
constants are not quite so satisfactory as they would have been in a
calmer ocean."
    The results have been reduced from centimetres   to feet.
                        The Hudson Straits Stations.
   The observations at these stations were taken under the super
vision of Lieutenant Gordon, R.N.         The length of observation at
each station was short, and the results must be correspondingly
uncertain. The dates at which the observations began are entered in
the table below, together with the periods.
   The obsei vations at Port Burwell were taken every two hours, and
at all the other stations, besides the bi-hourly measures, observations
were taken at intervals of five minutes about the times of high and
low water.    The reductions were made by Lieutenant Gordon, with
the assistance of Professor Carpmael, of Toronto.
   During the observations at Ashe Inlet, and at Stupnrt's Bay, the
Straits were choked with ice, and this may have exercised some
influence on the tides.

   In  an appendix to the ' Report of the United States Coast Survey
for 1885, Professor Ferrel gives the results of harmonic analysis
applied to tidal observations at this station. A map shows the sites
of the tide-gauges at Governor's Island and at Sandy Hook.
   Mr. Ferrel's treatment of the tide Mt differs from that recom
mended in the Reports of the British Association, and his entry for
Mj is therefore here omitted.
   In the preface to the previous collection of results a memorandum
by Mr. Ferrel, about the phases of the tides, was quoted. In a foot
note, added after the paper had been presented, I remarked that it
was not easy to accept Mr. Ferrel's memorandum as conclusive of the
identity of treatment of the American tides with the procedure
recommended by the British Association.         The same reason, which
then caused me to feel this doubt, applies to the present series of
results, and it will therefore be well to state the case somewhat more
fully than was possible in the footnote referred to.
   In the ' British Association Report for 1883 ' the equilibrium theory
of tides is developed so that each tide is represented by a positive
cosine.   Now, there are two of the tides, viz., those initialled L and
X, in which the development naturally leads to a negative cosine, and
if these terms are to appear as positive cosines, 180° must be added to
the argument.      It follows, therefore, that if Mr. Ferrel retains the
cosines in the negative form, the angles k for L and X, as tabulated
by him, must be augmented by 180°, in order to bring his results into
accordance with ours. Now, it may be observed that in all the results
tabulated by the U.S. Coast Survey, the tides L and A. are apparently
in diametrically the opposite phase from that of all the other semi
diurnal tides.
   That this is actually the case appears physically so improbable that
I conjecture, even in the face of Mr. Ferrel's memorandum, that he
uses a different convention as to the tides L and X, and that to read
his results in our notation his values of k should be augmented by
180°. I here tabulate, however, the values as I find them.
   Whilst speaking of this point, it is impossible not to refer to the
very remarkable peculiarity of the tide K.3 in the results for Sandy
Hook in the previous collection, and for Governor's Island here. It
is obvious that all the semidiurnal tides of true astronomical origin
should be nearly in the same phase, but here we have a single tide
exactly inverted as compared with the rest.       Is it possible that by
some accidental      change of sign 180° can have been erroneously
imported into the result?

   I have no information about these observations.              The results were,
however,      kindly placed at my disposal for this collection by Mr.
Roberts.      They were given me in the form which was used before the
publication of the Report of 1883 to the British Association, and I
am responsible for the reduction to the standard form.
   Mr. Roberts performed the reductions of the observations himself,
and has published the tide tables for the two ports ou behalf of the
Goveruments of the two colonies.            He proposes to write a paper on
these tides, which will doubtless give the information which is here
wanting.
                                  Indian Stations.
   Major Baird and Mr. Connor have sent me for publication the
values of the constants at a large number of stations in India.
   I have divided them into two groups.             The first of these comprises
stations for which results were published in the paper by Major Baird
and myself in the - Proceedings of the Royal Society.'              Many years of
observation are thus added to the previous ones, and the mean values
of the constants given below include the values given in our paper of
1885. The station at Karachi is especially valuable for tidal theory,
since we now have results for nearly a whole lunar cycle of nineteen
years.     The second group comprises a number of ports, for which
the constants have been only hitherto published in the prefaces to
the Indian Tide Tables*
   The constants for certain tides initialled 2N, MN, MK, 2MK are
now given for the first time.f           The first of these, 2N, is the elliptic
semidiurnal tide of the second order.            It appeared from the develop
ment of the equilibrium theory that it might be easily sensible, and
the values now given prove that this is the case. The other three,
MN, MK, 2MK, are shallow water tides arising from the interference
of the principal lunar tide M2, 1st, with the larger elliptic tide N,
2ndly, with the luni-solar diurnal tide K,, and 3rdly, with the lunar
diurnal tide O. The two latter of these, viz., MK and 2MK, also arise
                                 M4 with O, and from M4 with Kj.
from the interference of                                                      The
values appear to be all fairly consistent from year to year at the
riverain stations, but at other places they are obviously quite without
significance.
                                 Mean Sea Levels.

mined from each year of observation.

   Major Baird has now caused to            be   sent the mean sea levels with
reference   to the zeros of the several        tide-gauges.  The reference of
the zero of any gauge to a bench-mark ashore has principally a local
interest.    Full statements on this head are given in the prefaces to
the Indian Tide Tables, but these are not reproduced.
   The table of mean sea levels which follows immediately comprises
all the stations in which more than a single year of observation has
been reduced.       The day of the month, prefixed to each series of
results, denotes the first day of the year for which the mean sea level
is given.
   In the Fourth Report to the British Association on ' Harmonic
Analysis' (1886), it is shown that the oscillations of mean sea level are
far too large to be explained by' the known astronomical inequality
with a period of nearly nineteen years.
   This is not a convenient occasion for the discussion of the present
series of values, but I remark that 1882 was a year in which the
whole Indian Ocean stood low, whilst 1885 was one in which it stood
high.
   If  variation in the Sun's temperature is the cause of variation of
sea level, we might expect to find a periodicity with a period of ten or
eleven years.     It is then worth noticing that at Karachi there is a
minimum in 1 872 and again in 1882.* The observations are clearly
insufficient to do more than to raise the question.
    [Captain Wharton has been good enough to give me Mr. Russell's
 results for mean sea level at Sydney, and it is interesting to note the
 very large oscillation of level, with a minimum simultaneous with
 that at Karachi. ]t                                             . . .

612         Dr. G. Harley.         The Structural Arrangement of the
" The Structural Arrangement of the Miueral Matters in
         Sedimentary and Crystalline Pearls." By Geobge Hakley,
         M.D., F.R.S. Received March 6,—Read March 28, 1889.
                                        (Abstract.)
    The author began by giving a sketch of what has hitherto been
written on pearl structure, and pointed out that since Rondelet*
threw out the idea that pearls are merely diseased concretions
occurring in the Mollusca in the same way as other morbid calculi
occur in the Mammalia, and Reaumnrf said they are misplaced
pieces of organised shell, in the same way as loose cartilages in human
joints are misplaced portions of the cartilaginous structures sur
rounding them, the opinions of all subsequent writers have bnt
oscillated between these two antagonistic theories.                 The two chief
exponents of pearl structure           in  modern times   —   Meckel in 1856,J and
M6bius§ in 1858 — have ranged themselves on opposite Bides ; the
former advocating the views of Rondelet, the latter espousing those of
his opponent Reaumur; while Bronn,jj a still more recent writer, has
evidently a difficulty in deciding which of the theories is the correct
one.      For, while the whole tenour of his remarks leads one to believe
that he favours the shell-formation theory of Reaumur, he speaks of
pearls as being lime concretions (Kalk-Konhretionen) , and pearl-like
calculi (Perlen-artige Konkrementen), which he would be unlikely to
do were he firmly convinced in the validity of Reaumnr's theory.
    It is thus seen that it is still an unsettled question whether pearls
belong to the animal or the mineral kingdom.                   And no one who has
 worked at the subject, and knows its intricacy, can be the least
surprised at our very best authorities being still unable to decide as
 to which of the two antagonistic theories is the best.                   For, while
there are undoubtedly many potent data in favour of each view,
there are, at the same time, not a few grave objections in the way of
a ready acceptance of either, as the following facts prove : —
    1. As was demonstrated            by the exhibition of specimens, many
pearls (off-coloured ones) of the sedimentary variety so closely
resemble the carbonate of lime calculi met with in the Mammalia, and
the carbonate of lime pisolite concretions from the mineral waters of
 Carlsbad, as to be absolutely undistinguishable from them, either by
 the naked eye or with the aid of a microscope.

        Mineral Matters in Sedimentary and Crystalline Pearls.                   613
    2. All these three kinds of concretions are formed in consecutive
 strata round a nucleus, and the strata are not only independent and
 separable from each other, but so loosely adherent that they can
 be shelled off like the different layers of an onion, leaving the sub
 jacent layers so perfect that their enucleated portions constitute for
 themselves a perfect pearl, a perfect calculus, or a perfect pisolite
 concretion.
    3. By the specimens exhibited, it was shown that the outward
 appearance of a pearl is in no case a reliable criterion of its internal
 structure, a dull-white sedimentary pearl appearing exactly the same
under the microscope as a beautifully brilliant iridescent one ; while
a black-coloured pearl may possess in its interior a snow-white pearl,
another of the purest water may consist of nothing but a dirty
greasy lump of river clay, being in reality merely thinly coated over
with iridescent pearl substances.
    4. Thin sections of sedimentary        pearls, when viewed with a high
power in a good light, have all niore or less a granular appearance,
in. general best marked along the lines of stratification.
    5. All sedimentary pearls have nuclei round which the concentric
strata are regularly arranged, the nucleus being sometimes small,
sometimes exceedingly large in proportion to the size of the pearl.
And, contrary to the opinion of De Filippi,* who asserts that the
nucleus is invariably an Entozoon, it may consist of inorganic as
well as of organic foreign material — a pellet of clay, a particle of
Band, a fragment of bone or of iron, a piece of Beaweed, or even an
entire animal.
    In the second division of his subject, the author demonstrated by
specimens that just as a sedimentary pearl closely resembles the sedi
mentary concretions met with in the mineral as well as in the animal
world, so in like manner the crystalline form of pearl has its exact
counterpart not alone in organic cholesterin gall-stones and carbonate
of lime calculi, but in mineral nodules of wavellite rock and balls of
iron pyrites.
    As regards the nuclei of crystalline pearls, it was shown that in
most instances they are identical with those met with in the sedi
mentary variety of pearls, though sometimes no nucleus whatever is
to be met with even after prolonged search. Consequently, the author
inclines to believe that crystalline pearls in some instances begin (as
in the case of natural as well as artificially prepared calculi of
 the carbonate of lime, as Raineyt showed), by the mere aggregation
 and coalescence of mineral molecules.
    The author also called attention to Bronn's statement that pearls
 have often a crystalline nucleus, adducing evidence in favour of the

614     Mineral Matters in Sedimentary and Crystalline Pearls.
view that the so-called crystalline nucleus is in many cases but the
centre, and therefore really an integral part of the pearl's crystal
line strncture ; while, again, in other instances, the appearance is due
to the section having been carried a little on one side of the pearl's
centre, and a consequent cutting across of some of the hexagonal
basaltic-like prisms, producing in the centre of the pearl a tesselated
crystalline appearance.
   Bronn further asserts that in the centre of pearls are occasionally
found cells containing calcspar, which has arrived there by a process
of infiltration from without. This appearance, the author thought,
could be better explained on other grounds, and he exhibited the
microscopic section of an oxalate of lime human urinary calculus with
a crystalline centre, surrounded by a sedimentary zone exactly as is
seen in some pearls, but where no idea of infiltration could possibly be
entertained.
   A good section of a crystalline pearl, while showing basaltic-like
prisms radiating from the centre to the circumference, equally well
shows that it, too, like the sedimentary variety, is formed in concentric
layers of stratification. In this respect it not only bears a marked
similarity to the carbonate of lime concretions formed artificially in
gum-water, but an equal analogy to the sulphate of baryta stalactites
found in the caves of Derbyshire, where, of course, it is impossible to
attribute the structural arrangement of their mineral matters to the
influence of vital energy.
   Microscopic sections of crystalline pearls not alone convey the
idea that the prisms branch and interlace with each other, but that
they are in some instances of a fusiform shape, like the so-called
fusiform cells Carpenter described in shell structures; but these
appearances, as the author demonstrated,             are simply dae to the
section having cut the prisms across at different angles.               Moreover,
the prisms     are striated,  but  this striation,   as  well   as  the   feathery
frond-like appearance some of them present, does not, he thinks,
exist in the mineral matter, but in the animal membrane which
surrounds each individual prism, and which, as he previously
showed, is an integral part of the pearl, amounting to 5-94 per cent.
of its total weight.*       The feather-like appearance, he fancies, is
merely dne to wrinkling of the dried animal matter.
                 a                                                It was further
pointed out that each individual prism is made up of a number of
brick-like segments. Some with a high power appearing striated (6),
others granular (a) with knob-like bodies at their corners, and tube
like lines near their layers of stratification.
   The discussion of the arrangement of the animal matter is deferred
until after the mineral structure of hybrid, so-called cocoa-nut, and
fossil pearls has been considered.
