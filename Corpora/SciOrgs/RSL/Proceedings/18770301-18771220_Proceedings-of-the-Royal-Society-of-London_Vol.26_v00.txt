  I. " Note      on   the    Electrolytic Conduction of some Organic
        Bodies."      By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., Fullerian
        Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution, and Alfred
        Tribe, F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry in Dulwich College.
        Received January 27, 1877.
     During our early researches* on the copper-zinc couple it naturally
 occurred to us that we were employing a special means of electrolysis
 acting at insensible distances ; but the first organic substances which we
  succeeded    in decomposing by means of this agent were such as are
  usually considered non-electrolytic — for instance, iodide of ethyl ; and
  we obtained the remarkable result that when some of these were mixed
 with alcohol they were much more readily decomposed, although pure
 alcohol itself is not attacked by the couple of dissimilar metals.            From
 time to time we experimented with external batteries of 10 or 50 cells
 of Grove, in order to obtain some direct evidence of the electrolyzability
 of these compounds in the ordinary way, but with only negative results.
 On the 26th of April, 1875, however, we made a series of experiments,
 employing 100 Grove's cells, and obtained results which we did not
 pursue further at the time, but which we think interesting, especially in
 connexion with the experiments on other but similar bodies which
 Dr. Bleekrode has lately communicated to the Boyal Society, and a short
 notice of which appears in the last Number of its ' Proceedings.'
     "We used for the experiments a glass tube, about 5 millims. diameter,
 closed at one end, into which were fused two platinum wires, about

1   millim. apart. The liquids were placed in this tube, and the wires
connected with the terminal wires of the battery, an ordinary astatic
galvanometer being placed in the circuit. The results obtained are as
 follows : —
    Ethyl Iodide.— Nil.
    Alcohol. — On making contact the galvanometer-needle showed a de
 flection of 20°, and a slight commotion of the liquid was observable.
 The alcohol gradually warmed up until it boiled, the deflection of the
 needle increasing the whole time.      Gas was apparently given off in
 minute quantity from the negative electrode ; but it was difficult to be
 certain of this.
    Equal volumes of Alcohol and Ethyl Iodide. — There was a deflection
of 30° on making contact, gradually rising. Great commotion ensued,
the liquid rapidly circulating round the poles, as in the annexed diagram,
accompanied by a browning of the liquid. Not certain about the evolu
tion of gas — apparently a few minute bubbles from the positive pole.
The liquid boiled in about 4 minutes, the deflection being then 60°.
    Ethyl Bromide. — Nil.
    Equal volumes of Alcohol and Ethyl Bromide. — Violent commotion on
making contact, the galvanometer being deflected to the stops.         The
liquid quickly boiled.      Gas apparently given off from the negative
electrode.
    Chloroform.
                — Nil.
    Equal  volumes  of Alcohol and Chloroform.

 flection to stops.   The mixture very quickly boiled.
    Ethyl Acetate, Propylene Bromide, Amyl and Isobuiyl Iodides gave nega
tive results.     When mixed with equal volumes of alcohol they behave
similarly to the mixtures referred to above.
    Our results, preliminary as we considered them to be, show that the
iodides of ethyl, isobutyl, and amyl, the bromides of ethyl and propylene,
the acetate of ethyl, and chloroform are practically non-conductors to a
battery-power     of 100 cells Grove, and that alcohol is to some extent

traversed by the current.     They show also that when these liquid non
conductors are mixed    with  the feeble conductor alcohol, the conductivity
of the mixture is greater than that of alcohol alone, which offers at least
a partial clue to the readiness with which such mixtures are decomposed
by the copper-zinc couple.
   The very considerable development of heat in these liquids, which
conduct the electric current with great difficulty, is a circumstance
worthy of notice. In these cases it is evident that it does not result
from any chemical change, because the decomposition, if any thing at all,
is utterly insignificant in amount.                                           <
II. " On the    Protrusion of Protoplasmic Filaments from the Glan
      dular Hairs of the Common Teasel {Dipsacus sylvestris) ."
      By Francis Darwin, M.B.                Communicated by Charles
      Darwin, F.R.S. Received January 30, 1877.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The protoplasmic structures described in the following communication
are connected with the glandular hairs or trichomes found on both sur
faces of the leaf of the common teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris). The trichomes
are of two kinds, differing in a marked manner in shape.         The form of
gland from which alone the protoplasmic filaments issue is shown in the
diagram. The gland consists of a multicellular pear-shaped head, supported
on a cylindrical unicellular stalk which rests on a projecting epidermic
cell. The whole structure projects about ^ of a millimetre (  ^   inch) above
the surface of the leaf.
   The filaments issue from inside the gland-cells, reaching the surrounding
medium by passing through the external cell-wall of the gland.            The
point where protrusion takes place     is on  the summit of the gland, and
usually at the point of junction of several radiating cells at the centre
of its dome-liko surface.      The act of protrusion is rapidly effected ; a
previously naked gland may be seen to send forth a minute thread of
trembling protoplasm, projecting from its summit freely into the sur
rounding water.      The filament grows by clearly visible increments, and
may ultimately attain the length of nearly one millimetre.      The filaments
appear to pass through the substance of the external cell-wall of the
glands, as no apertures to allow of their passage have been observed.
   Under normal circumstances the filament presents the appearance of a
delicate and elongated thread slightly clubbed at its free end, and ani
mated by the perpetual tremble of Brownian movement.           The distal end
of the filament is often attached to the gland, thus forming a loop. Ex
tremely delicate filaments of great length are often seen entangled in
elaborate and complex knots, or several filaments may be seen issuing
from a single gland.

   The substance of which the filaments are composed is gelatinous,
transparent, highly refracting, and devoid of granules.  It is in a great
measure soluble iu alcohol, is stained by tincture of alkanet, and not
blackened by osmic acid, and is coloured yellow by iodine. These reac
tions, when combined with results of various physiological tests, show
that the filaments contain resinous matter in some way suspended in
protoplasm.
   The most remarkable point in the behaviour of the filaments is their
power of violently contracting.  The act of contraction commences by
the filament becoming shorter and thicker at a number of nearly equi
distant points, situated close together near the free end of the filament.
The curious beading thus produced spreads rapidly down the filament,
which ultimately runs violently together into a ball seated on the top of
the gland.   In other cases contraction takes place without any previous
appearance of beading.
    Filaments frequently break loose but retain their vitality, and are still
capable of contraction although separated from their parent glands ; and
this observation is of importance, as proving that the movements of the
filaments are not governed by forces residing within the glands, but that
the filaments are composed of an essentially contractile substance.
    The contraction of the filaments is produced by the following causes : —
   Dilute acids (from 1 to £ per cent.) — Sulphuric,                        hydrochloric,    acetic,
citric, and osmic acids.

    The evidence derived from the experiments, of which the results are here
briefly summarized, appears to be strongly in favour of the view that the
filaments contain true living protoplasm, and that the sudden movement
above described       true act of contraction
                         is   a                  for     the latter hypothesis

                                          it            that reagents of widely
different natures, such as dilute solutions of acetic acid, of camphor, and

6                  Mr. F. Darwin       on the  Protrusion of             [Mar. 1,
of gold-chloride, should produce identical chemical effects. Osmic acid
is well known to kill protoplasmic structures without making them con
tract.    This characteristic reaction holds good with the filaments of the
teasel when treated with sufficiently powerful solutions of osmic acid
(e.g. 1 per cent.).     When killed in an extended position, they cannot be
made to contract with strong acetic acid. This observation is of import
ance in another way ; for it proves that the violent movements caused by
dilute acetic acid are of a " vital," and not simply of a chemical nature.
Moreover the general character of the reagents and other causes (such
as heat, &c.) by which contraction is produced is quite consistent with
the belief that the filaments are protoplasmic in nature.
    An important series of phenomena are produced by the following
fluids : — dilute solutions (| or | per cent.) of carbonates of ammonia,
potassium, and sodium, and infusion of raw meat.              If a filament under
the microscope is treated with a drop of | per        cent,  solution of carbonate
of ammonia, the following changes occur.            The filament contracts, but
almost instantly recovers itself, and is once more protruded.             The fila
 ment, however, does not regain its original form or general appearance :
instead of consisting of thin elongated ropes of a highly refracting sub
 stance, it is converted into balloon-like or sausage-shaped masses of very
transparent, lowly refracting matter.            These transparent masses are
remarkable for the spontaneous changes of form and other quasi-amceboid
 movements which occur among them.
    Dilute infusions of meat cause a similar effect, astonishing         quantities
 of transparent matter being produced.
    It has been shown that the filaments are protoplasmic bodies, containing
 a large   quantity of resinous matter.         The question next arises, with
 what process in plant-physiology         is the protrusion of filaments homo
 logous  ?
    The leaf-glands of the     teasel are similar in general structure to many
 glandular   hairs  which   produce resinous and slimy secretions, and, like
 these gland", they contain bright drops of secreted resin lying in the
 centres of the gland-cells ; they also resemble many glandular hairs in
 being often capped with accumulations of secreted matter.              Now these
 accumulations     stain red with alkanet, yellow with iodine, and are largely
  soluble in alcohol ; that is to say, they consist of substances which have
 the same reactions as the filaments.        There is, in fact, no doubt that the
 caps of resinous matter on the teasel-glands are produced by the accu
 mulation of dead filaments.       According to this view, the act of protrusion
 is essentially a process of secretion : the resin issues from the gland-
 cells, mingled with a certain amount of true protoplasm ; and it is only
 from the death of the living or protoplasmic part of the filaments that
 the resinous accumulation results.          This view of the act of protrusion
 corresponds with the theory of secretion held by some physiologists, viz.
 that secreted matter      is produced by the dissolution      or death of proto

plasm — that, for instance, the oil in a fat-cell is the result of the dis
integration of a plastid or individualized mass of protoplasm formed in
the cell by endogenous cell-formation.
    The protrusion of protoplasmic filaments from the glands of the teasel
appears to bear an obscure relationship to the phenomena of
                                                                   " aggrega
      "
tion in Drosera and several other plants.         In both processes we have
homogeneous highly refracting protoplasmic           masses, which undergo
amoeboid movements, and are       in  some unknown way connected with the
 absorption of nitrogenous matter.       In Drosera the protoplasmic masses
 remain within certain cells ; in Dipsacus they are protruded through the
 cell-wall.
    When     we  begin to inquire as to the function of the filaments, the
answer seems at first to be sufficiently plain ; but this is very far from
 being the case.    The connate leaves of the teasel form cup-like cavities,
which     become   full of rain and dew and in which many drowned
insects accumulate.       The glands at the base of the leaves are thus
exposed to a highly nitrogenous fluid.      And since such fluids are known
 to produce a remarkable effect on the filaments exposed to them, it seems
 probable that the filaments are in some way connected with the assimi
lation of food material.      It seems probable that, either with or without
 the assistance of their filaments, the glands do absorb some nitrogenous
 matter ; for changes of their cell-contents occasionally occur which can
only thus be interpreted.        But on account of the rarity and uncer
tainty of these aggregation changes within the glands, but little weight
 must be allowed to the phenomena as a proof of the absorbing capacity
 of the glands.        Some other points in the structure of the plant
render it almost certain that the connate leaves are specially adapted to
 serve some useful purpose.       Kerner is probably right in believing that
the   "  cups
              " of the teasel are of use to the plant in keeping off nectar-
 stealing ants and other wingless insects ; but unless this is their only
function, it seems probable that the connate leaves have been to a certain
extent adapted for the capture of insects whose decaying remains are
absorbed by the plant.     The leaves are smooth and steeply inclined, and
form a pair of treacherous slides leading down to a pool of water.
    It is worthy of note that the leaves of the first year's growth, which
do not form     cups, are not smooth, but bristle with long sharp hairs ;
moreover in Dipuicus pilosus the leaves (of the second year's growth) are
not sufficiently connate to form cups, and they also are rough with hairs.
These facts seem to show that the smoothness of the second-year leaves
in D. sylvestris is a specially acquired quality.    Another special point of
structure in D. sylvestris may be noted.          The stems are everywhere
armed with sharp prickles, except where they are covered by the water
in the " cups ;
                  "
                      and here they are quite smooth, so that no ladder
of escape is afforded to the drowning victims. Even if we grant
from the above considerations that the filaments proJruded from the

glands are in some way connected with the absorption of nitrogenous
matter from the putrid fluid in the cups, we are far from understanding
the whole of the problem ; for precisely similar Jilament-protruding
glands are found on the seedling leaves of D. sylvestris and on the second
                                      "    "
year's leaves of D. pihsus ; and as no cups are formed in either of these
                                       with absorption of the products
cases, the filaments cannot be connected
of decay.     The only view which suggests itself is that the filaments
absorb ammonia from the dew and rain.                  Recent researches have shown
that certain leaves    have the power of absorbing an appreciable              quantity
of ammonia     ;   and this fact lends some           probability   to the view    above
advanced.
   To recapitulate.  Protoplasmic filaments are protruded from the leaf-
glands of the teasel ; and the only theory which seems at all capable of
connecting the observed facts is the following : — That the glands on the

                                             is   a                        for     ;
it will be found  that   when the angles of incidence and emergence are
unequal (as in the half-prism), the angular separation between two pencils
of parallel rays       increased or diminished according as the angle of
                      is
emergence      greater or less than the angle of incidence. In consequence
              is
of this the angle between tho pencils corresponding to any two lines in

angle between the pencils coming from the two edges of the slit will, for
any monochromatic light, also be increased in nearly the same ratio, and
thus the lines in any spectrum become broader as they are further sepa
rated by virtue of this property, and the purity of the spectrum remains
unaltered.      In fact the half-prism is from this point of view equivalent
to a cylindrical magnifier, a property which may prove most useful in
the construction of the spectroscope, leading to the substitution of three
or, at the most, four half-prisms for the long train of fifteen or twenty
isosceles prisms now used. For this purpose direct-vision prisms will
be most suitable ; but          I propose to begin by considering the simpler
                                                                                    "
case of a half-prism of flint. The expression " Magnifying-power                      may
be conveniently extended to the property in question, which, as will be
seen presently, is strictly analogous to that of a lens ; for it will be found
that the same law holds with combinations of prisms as with other optical
combinations,       viz. the magnifying-power         is the ratio    of the breadth of
the incident to the breadth of the emergent pencil*.
     In consequence     of the property of the half-prism stated       above,  it becomes
necessary to distinguish between separation accompanied by increased
 breadth of tho lines and separation in terms of this breadth.               If the sense
                "
 of the term dispersion" had not been fixed by usage, it might very well be
                                               "

                                                                for the other ; but it
 will undoubtedly be more in conformity with received ideas to define
 " dispersion " as the angular length of the spectrum, whilst the term
 " purity " may be used for tho ratio of this angular length to the angular
 breadth of the spectrum lines (expressed in terms of the angular width of
 the slit). In the case of an isosceles prism, for which the magnifying-
 power is 1, the dispersion and purity are equal.
     I will therefore distinguish the two positions in which a half-prism can
                                                         " Magnifying " and " Dimi
 be placed with respect to the incident rays as
 nishing," according as the perpendicular face is turned towards the slit
 or away from it. It will be found that the first position will be suitable
 in cases where wide separation of the lines is required, and the second
 where great purity in tho spectrum is of importance ; but before entering
 on this point and on the further comparison with the ordinary combina
 tions of isosceles prisms, it is desirable to find a convenient expression for
 the dispersion in different cases, confining this term to the efEect of the
 variation in the refractive index.
    * This law follows at once from the principle of conservation of energy, since the
 total energy of all the pencils which pass through the slit and fall (in a state of paral
 lelism) on the prism is measured by the product of the breadth of the pencil into the
 angular width of the slit. If, therefore, by the refraction at any surface the breadth of
 the pencil is diminished, the angular breadth of the monochromatic image of the slit
  must be increasod, the narrower pencils being spread over a larger angle, since the
  total energy remains constant.    This is of course the ordinary law of brightness of
  optical images ; a more formal proof from purely geometrical considerations is given
  in the text.

    These results might also have been obtained by considering the prism
 as made up     of two half-prisms separated by a thin plate of air. The dis-
 persion of the first half is — S and this is magnified mi times by the second,
 ¦which    also adds its own dispersion A       , thus giving—'   . m +A =2A ' .

 This will    be seen   at once to be equivalent to the algebraic process em
 ployed.
     The above results may be summed up as follows : —
     1. The purity of a half -prism magnifying is equal to the dispersion of
 a half-prism diminishing, and is the product of the dispersive power of
 the glass and the tangent of the angle of the prism.
     2. The dispersion of a half-prism magnifying is equal to the purity of
 a half-prism diminishing, and is m times the purity of a half-prism
 magnifying.
    3. The purity and dispersion of an isosceles prism are equal, and are

 must be understood as denoting the magnifying-power,            dispersion, and
 purity of a half-prism magnifying.
     Confining our attention for the present to the ordinary form of a
 spectroscope in which d<f>'= — ty'=0, the most imporiant question to be
 considered is the irrationality of dispersion, which in fact fixes the limit
 to the refracting angle of the prism, unless the spectroscope is to be used
 only for one part of the spectrum.
    The formula for the dispersion is chiefly useful as giving the irra
 tionality, which is seen to increase with the dispersion, but in a more
 rapid ratio.     In fact if we put AA and AH for the dispersions correspond-
 ing to the     same   small value of   — for   the Fraunhofer lines   A  and H,
i. e.  the values of the scale of the spectrum at those two points, we have
      log ^5   = log tan       log tan ^A=

    In   practice, however, it will be more convenient to express the ratio
in  terms of the magnif ying-powers for A and H ; thus

  Thus the two forms of compound prism may be considered together ;
but there is this important distinction, that the refraction at the outer
surface of the crown corrects irrationality of dispersion in the direct-
vision prism, since the angle of refraction is greater for the red rays,
whilst in the ordinary compound prism the irrationality is greatly
increased.   At the same time the refraction at the outer surface of the
crown slightly decreases the dispersion for the whole spectrum in the
direct-vision prism, and slightly increases it in the other form ; but this
effect is produced in the latter case by spreading out the violet rays, and
in the former by bringing them closer together, the dispersion for the red
rays being about the same for the same angles of refraction in the two
forms, as will be seen more clearly when an actual case is taken. Thus
the apparent superiority of the ordinary compound prism turns out to be
illusory, being gained by inequality in the scale ; and this is aggravated
by corresponding loss of light for the violet rays, as the deviation at both
refractions is greater than for the red rays.   On the other hand, both the
scale and the loss of light are equalized throughout the spectrum in a
properly constructed direct-vision prism, which is therefore, indepen
dently of its practical convenience, the best form of compound prism for
general use.

     In    order to fix the ideas, let us take the same flint, as in the case of the
simple prism, and for the crown glass                                    /ua       =1-510, ^H= 1-530.                     Then

  The first term increases with i//, or the angle of the half-prism of flint,
which should therefore be as large as practicable, consistently with good
definition and moderate loss of light     also increases with m but in that
                                                                   :    it                                            ;
case the second term increases too in so                                       far           as m depends on x-             It will
therefore be desirable to find the rate of variation of m with x, supposing
\pand     to remain constant.

    The advantage of the direct-vision prism is thus clearly shown, whether
as compared with a compound prism of the other form, or with two
simple prisms of the same kind of flint and giving the same dispersion.
    In fact the direct-vision half-prism here considered gives nearly the
 same dispersion as a simple prism of 64°, with less loss of light and
 without the great irrationality which makes the dispersion in the other
 case merely illusory.
    It is to be remarked that there still remains the irrationality in the
 variation of the refractive index for glass, which may, however, be par

22                    Mr. W. H. M. Christie            on the           [Mar. 1,
tially corrected in the direct-vision    prism by increasing the angle of the
crown.     The prism would, however, no longer be direct-vision, even for
the ultra-violet, the deviation being negative and considerable in amount
for the visible rays.
    So far the case has been considered in which the pencils for different
parts of the spectrum all pass in the same direction through the prism
 (parallel to the base), and the collimator and telescope are moved ; but it
is also possible to keep the collimator and telescope fixed and to turn the
prism merely.       In the former plan, which is that usually adopted, the
limit to the angle of the prism is fixed by the condition that the angle of
incidence or emergence for the violet at the oblique face must not be too
large, or, in other words, that the angle of refraction must not be very
near the critical angle for the violet, which is smaller than that for the
red; and consequently great dispersion is accompanied with correspond
ing irrationality, except in the case of the direct-vision prism.        If, how
 ever, the deviation be kept the same for all parts of the spectrum — which
 can be done by turning the prism (provided it be not isosceles) — this
objection is got rid of, and at the same time the construction of the
 spectroscope is made much more simple.            The refracting angle of a half-
 prism, whether simple or compound, can thus be increased, so as to give
the most suitable dispersive power for the middle of the dispersion spec
trum (about F) when the pencil is incident perpendicularly on the first
 face.   By turning the prism successively in one direction or the other,
 so as to increase the angle of refraction for the red or diminish it for the
violet, the different parts of the spectrum can be made to emerge suc
 cessively in the same direction, and the dispersive and magnifying-powers,
 as well as the loss of light, will be sensibly constant throughout the spec
 trum, the dispersion at the first face being extremely small.         Of course,
 if the whole spectrum     be included  in  the   field  of view there will be the
 usual inequality of scale ; but such an extent of field can only be used
for viewing a spectrum with small dispersion ; and for purposes of mea
 surement, the part examined must be brought to the middle of the field.
 It may be remarked that the dispersion may be reduced to about one half
by turning the half-prism till the angles of incidence and emergence
 become equal, when it acts as an isosceles prism at minimum deviation.
 This property is useful for the examination of faint objects, the decrease
in dispersion being further accompanied by an increase in the transmitted
light. The spectrum, however, would in this case be thrown some 3°
out of the centre of the field, and a motion either of the viewing-tele-
scope or of the eyepiece would be necessary.
    Tn fig. 3 is shown the course of a pencil of red rays (full lines) and of
violet rays (dotted lines) within a direct-vision half -prism as it is turned
about a centre in the manner just described.             The rays, whether red or
violet, emerge parallel to their original direction, the diagram represent
ing the course relative to the prism as      it is turned.

  Taking the ease of a single half-prism with fixed collimator and spec
troscope,we may increase the refracting angle (or the angle of refraction
for mean rays), and thus obtain much larger dispersion.     In comparing
the three forms of prism (simple, direct-vision, and ordinary compound),
the irrationality was the most important consideration ; but this does not
here enter into the question.  The direct-vision prism, however, has still
the advantage, as compared with the compound prism, of giving a more
convenient form of spectroscope, whilst, as we can now use very deep
angles for the flint, the dispersion at the exterior                                        surface of the crown
hardly affects the resulting dispersion.
   As compared with a simple half-prism of flint, there is the advantage
of being able to make    (or the angle of the flint) nearly twice as large,
                                           i//'

 careful consideration,    I have by       the help of the preceding Tables calcu
lated the loss in passing through trains of half-prisms] having respec

 (which  I will call   A and    B)   have been used        in two experimental spectro

 examples.

    It will be seen that     for equal dispersion           the loss of light is slightly
 greater for a train of half-prisms B ; but this is fully compensated for by
 the diminished absorption, as fewer prisms will be required.

1877.]               Magnifying-power of the Half-prism.                      25
  In   considering    the most advantageous combination of prisms in a spec
troscope,   it will  be  necessary to bear in mind the different purposes for
which the instrument is used.         The requirements in a spectroscope may
thus be   divided   into  the following heads : —
    (1) Wide separation of the lines, with little loss of light and moderate
purity in the spectrum.
     (2) Great purity in the spectrum.
    (3) Wide separation of the lines accompanied by considerable purity.
    In (2) and (3) loss of light is of secondary importance. For measuring
the displacement of lines in the spectra of stars and work of a similar
 character (1) must be specially considered ; and here the width of the slit
 is determined by the size of the star's image rather than by the angle
 subtended at the object-glass of the collimator.     With prisms of fair size
 sufficient purity will usually be obtained for measurement of the strong
 lines without limiting the slit further ; the most important point is large
 aperture in the equatoreal, as the amount of light collected varies with
 the aperture.      This will readily be seen by considering that the angle
  subtended by the diffraction image of a star at the optical centre of the
  object-glass (or mirror) varies inversely as the aperture ; hence for prisms
  of a given size the purity of the spectrum will be the same for all aper
  tures, if the focal length of the collimator correspond.
   For a bright-line spectrum, such as that of the solar prominences, which
is seen projected on the continuous spectrum of the sky and of which the
visibility depends on the contrast with the background and not on the
absolute brightness, (2) is of the greatest importance         ;    whilst special
attention must be paid to (3) in the case of the sun.
   We may compare three arrangements of prisms : — (1) Half -prisms mag
nifying ; (2) Half-prisms  diminishing ; (3) Whole prisms ; but in doing
this we must take account of the width of the slit and the breadth of the
pencil as determining the purity of the spectrum and its brightness. At the
 same time, as the size  of the prisms practically fixes the limit to the power
 of the spectroscope, the quantity of glass used in the different cases should
 also be borne in mind.     This latter consideration is important, because in
 a train of half -prisms magnifying the breadth of the pencil is diminished
 in the ratio 1 : m with each half-prism (the height remaining unaltered),
 and the reverse takes place with a train of half-prisms diminishing.      Thus
 in both cases the half-prisms may be made narrower and narrower in
 geometrical progression, starting with that end which begins with a per
 pendicular face. The difference between the two cases        is,
                                                                that in the first
 case the train (counting from the slit) begins with the broadest prism, and in
 the second case with the narrowest, so that with the latter arrangement
 we have   a narrower pencil and consequently less light. In the case of         a
 train of whole prisms the pencil       isnarrower than for the half-prisms
 magnifying, in the ratio of    1   m.
                                    :    The thickness of the glass through
 which the rays pass      another important consideration
                         is                                   ;  and from this
 point of view the half-prism train has      a great advantage.     The breadth

                        Mr. W. H. M. Christie          on the                 [Mar. 1,
of the spectrum, as compared with the height of the              slit, should also be
taken into account, for this affects the brightness              directly.    Hitherto
advantage has not been taken of the circumstance                 that the height of
the slit is practically unlimited (except in the case            of stars), and that
therefore   it is unnecessary to magnify the spectrum in this direction.
                                                                          " is obvious,
Thus the advantage of the train of " half-prisms magnifying
since the breadth of the spectrum is left unaltered.            In spectroscopes as
ordinarily constructed, the breadth of the spectrum is magnified at the
same time as the separation of the lines, and thus a high magnifying-
power is accompanied by a great decrease in the brightness, the latter
varying inversely as the square of the power.               By using a cylindrical
eyepiece, however, this objection may be removed ; and there would appear
to be no practical difficulty in this plan, since little or no enlargement
of the breadth of the spectrum is required.                 For bright-line spectra
generally   a  Ramsden    eyepiece    with  cylindrical   lenses  would answer the
purpose well, the height of the slit being sufficient to give a convenient
breadth to the spectrum without any amplification in this direction ; but
for viewing the solar prominences the magnifying-power                  should be the
same   in both directions    ;  and thus with the train of       " half -prisms dimi
nishing," which, as will       be seen, gives great   purity in the spectrum with
a corresponding      decrease     in the breadth of the image of the slit, the
magnifying-power        of the eyepiece must be high in the direction of
the breadth of the slit, and low in the perpendicular direction.               An eye
piece formed with a cylindrical concave or Barlow lens (within the prin
cipal focus of the viewing-telescope) and an ordinary convex field-lens
in combination with a convex cylindrical eye-lens, would produce this
effect, the axes of both cylindrical lenses being parallel to the slit.
   The effect of such an eyepiece may easily be investigated.
   Let fvft be the focal lengths of the concave and convex cylindrical
         /
lenses, the focal length of the convex field-lens, and F the focal length
of the viewing-telescope ; then,      if M, M'  be the magnifying-powers       parallel
and perpendicular to the slit,
   For the rays in the perpendicular plane, suppose the concave cylindri
cal lens to form an enlarged image on the field-lens, which will therefore
 produce no effect, this image being at the principal focus of the cylin
drical eye-lens.
   Then if v be the distance from the concave lens of the focus after re

     The second train of half-prisms in (4) and (5) may be placed between
 the eye-lens and the eye, and will then conveniently replace the cylin
 drical magnifier.       The prisms may in that case be very small; their
 dispersion, however, will not be magnified by the eyepiece, and they will
 therefore add but little to the dispersion or purity.
    In fact if M be the magnifying-power of the viewing-telescope, the
     r
 dispersion   would be   (M+l)"a"-1.          — and (M+l)^-^i.                             r

    This is on the supposition that the second train has the same magni
fying-power as the first.
    Now for the same brightness of spectrum, neglecting loss of light by
 reflexion and absorption, we must have ba=m"bi and b3=mbv the breadth
of the slit being increased to compensate for the decrease in the breadth
of the incident pencil. Where this is not practicable (as for star-spectra)
the train of "half-prisms magnifying" has the advantage of greater
brightness; and, as it gives at the same time wide separation of the lines,
it best fulfils the condition (1).
    On the other hand, for viewing the solar prominences, loss of light- is
of little or no consequence, the important point being to have a strong
contrast between the monochromatic image of the slit (filled with the
light of the prominence) and the dispersed image due to the light of the
sky.    Thus the breadth of the slit does not enter into the question, and
great purity in the spectrum is the chief desideratum.                    A train of " half-
                       "
prisms diminishing         is evidently by far the best arrangement ; but for

 30                              Mr. W. H. M. Christie                         on the                       [Mar. 1,
convenience in delineating the prominences, a cylindrical eyepiece or a
train of half-prisms magnifying (between the eye-lens and the eye) must
be used.
   Such a combination is also suitable for spectrum-analysis, where a
bright-line spectrum has to be distinguished from a continuous spectrum
forming the background.     Thus with this arrangement the sodium lines
in the flame of an ordinary paraffin candle are seen with great brilliancy.
   In general, however, a combination of wide separation, purity, and
brightness is required ; and here we must take the values for b2 and bt
given above in terms of              6,.
      (1) and (2) give the        same    purity — —          1~^

      If   we take the same number of half-prisms in the three cases, 2p=n;

  We may consider one other point, viz. the effect of error in the
surfaces and of unequal density in the glass, though the question                                               is   a
very obscure one. An error in the surface being equivalent to            slight                             a
deviation in the incident ray, its effect will vary as the magnif ying-power                                         ;
and thus with the train of half-prisms magnifying, the errors of the half-
prisms are magnified in proportion to their distance from the end of the

train in the same ratio as the dispersions ; and if there is no tendency to
a repetition of similar errors throughout the train, these must be com

  x probable error from    a whole prism.      Thus, considering that a higher
magnifying-power      must  be applied   where   few prisms are used, the case
of a long train of prisms would be equivalent to the arithmetical mean of
a large number of fallible surfaces ; but, independently of the fact that
after a very moderate number the gain in accuracy of definition is very
slight, practical experience seems to show that, owing probably to syste
matic errors in the surfaces or the glass, an increase in the number of
prisms is accompanied by a corresponding loss of definition, and that con
sequently the law of errors does not apply.         Hitherto a long train of
prisms   has been  considered  necessary,   partly because   it has been the only
means   of obtaining purity, t. «. dispersion as distinct from mere separation,
and partly because the use of high magnifying-powers involved the
weakening of the light by increase in the apparent breadth of the spec
trum.     As regards the effect of air-bubbles and other defects in the glass
in stopping out light, it falls under the head of absorption, and consti
tutes a very serious objection to the long train of prisms.
    Probably, from want of proper data, the effect of absorption in spectro
scopes would appear to have been generally overlooked ; and in many cases
where compound prisms are employed the brightness of the spectrum is
far inferior to what would have been obtained with much smaller prisms.
Even with a train of simple prisms the loss by absorption is very great,
and to this is superadded the loss by reflexion at the numerous surfaces,
so that the disadvantages of a long train are sufficiently obvious.              To
obtain some information on this point,      I have made several series of mea
sures of the brightness of the light transmitted through various thick
nesses   of different kinds of glass, using a polarizing photometer and a
chromatometer (on the principle of Prof. Clerk-Maxwell's colour-box) ;
and though the observations      I have made are not so extensive as      I could
wish for the elucidation of this interesting physical question, they are
amply sufficient for the immediate object in view, showing conclusively
the wasteful loss of light in the ordinary construction of the spectroscope.
There would seem to be great differences in the absorptive power of
different specimens of glass, depending on the manufacture rather             than
on the density, though all the specimens of very dense flint which         I have

absorbs the red and green.       Notwithstanding its yellow colour, very
dense flint (having a specific gravity of 5-0), when well made, actually
transmits considerably more light than the specimens of crown            have                                          I

the surfaces             :   —

   From these results it would appear that a thickness of 4 inches of - flint
or 3 inches of crown would absorb half of the incident light, the glass
being in each case well made.

and this absorption, as it approaches its limiting value 1, increases very
slowly with the thickness of glass when that exceeds 6 or 8 inches. The
height of the prisms may, however, be increased with advantage up to
the limit determined by the condition that the height of the emergent
pencil (after passing through the eyepiece) shall not exceed the diameter
of the pupil of the eye.            Thus with a magnifying-power of 10 on the
viewing-telescope it is useless to make the prisms more than 2 inches in
height.
   The coefficient   —Ch        shows the variation of the brightness  6       with the
                     2/ tan a
absorptive power of the glass and the angle of the prism.
   The above formula has been obtained on the supposition that the whole
of the prism is utilized right up to the refracting edge, which is assumed
to have no sensible thickness.          In practice, however, this is rarely the
case,   and  the most   valuable    part of the prism is lost, from the difficulty
of working a surface true up to the edge. In a long train of prisms this is
a matter of some importance, where light is of consequence ; and there is
in such   a train the further objection, that the pencil falling on the viewing-
telescope is in fact rendered excentrical, and its effective breadth dimi
nished, by the greater absorption in passing through the thick parts of
the prisms.

or, when the brightness                 is   a   maximum,          the breadth of the prisms must
be such that the whole absorption                       is   -,   the absorption in passing through
the crown being supposed equal to that in the flint. This will be ap
proximately true in the case of the direct-vision prism, for which there
fore the thickness of glass traversed (flint and crown combined) should
not exceed 5-8 inches,      we take /= -173, as found by experiment for a

very good specimen    of flint.  With less pure glass, such as   frequently                         is
used, this limiting thickness may be much smaller      in one piece of very      ;
dense flint which      examined
                           I         would be only 1-5 inch

sorption of the crown being here considerably less than that of the flint,
the formula just given would no longer apply.   Further, for the blue end
of the spectrum    would be much larger, being, in fact, about "78 for the
                     /
yellow flint, whilst           c   is   about -34 for the crown, so that the total thick
ness  for photographic work should certainly not exceed     inches, the                         3
limit being fixed by the absorption of the crown.
   These numerical results, however, are given more as illustrating the
principles on which spectroscopes should be constructed than as general
rules applicable in all cases for there such great diversity in glass that,

thickness might prove to be admissible for the photographic rays. Fur
ther, the observations on which the values of the coefficients of absorption
are based are liable to  small uncertainty on account of the difficulty of
                                   a
allowing for want of perfect polish in the two surfaces of the plate. They
may be taken, however, as useful approximations to the truth.

   1877.]            Magnifying -power of the Half-prism.                     35
      From what precedes it will be seen that loss of light is so inseparably
  associated with dispersion, whether by making it necessary to use a nar
  rower pencil or in other ways which are not so easily reduced to law, that
  there is theoretically but little to choose between different arrangements
  of prisms, and in particular between a long train of prisms and a short
  train of half-prisms ; but practically the advantage seems to be altogether
  with the short train, which is less complicated and more convenient. The
  difficulties of the adjustment of a long train of prisms are so great that
  in practice the efficiency secured appears to fall very far short of the
  theoretical limit, and thus so-called powerful spectroscopes are a constant
   source of trouble and disappointment to those who use them.           Even if
   once properly adjusted it is practically impossible to keep them so, and
   the consequence is that the sodium lines, for example, are seen hardly any
   better with eighteen or twenty prisms than with four or five.
      The general conclusions arrived at with regard to the best combination
  of prisms may be summed up as follows : —
      1. The direct-vision prism (as ordinarily used) possesses great advantages
  over other forms, simple or compound, especially in its correction of the
  irrationality of dispersion.
      2. This irrationality can, however, be corrected iu any form of " half-
          "
   prism by keeping the collimator and telescope relatively fixed, whilst
> the prism only is turned to bring successive parts of the spectrum into
  the field of view, and thus an angle approaching closely to the critical
  angle may be advantageously used.
      3. A train composed of three or at most four " half-prisms         (direct-
                        "
  vision) magnifying      is the best arrangement for giving wide separation
  of the liues in the solar spectrum, whilst one or, in some cases, two half-
  prisms similarly placed offer special advantages in the case of star-spectra.
  A well-worked slit will be required for examination of the finer lines in
  the sun's spectrum, and it would be well to use a concave or " Barlow
                                                                                "
  lens in the collimator so as to increase its effective focal length.
      4. A train of two or three " half-prisms (direct-vision) diminishing,"
  in combination with an eyepiece train of " half-prisms magnifying," is
  peculiarly adapted for the delineation of the solar prominences, and gene
  rally for the examination of bright-line spectra with a continuous back
  ground.
      Mr. Hilger, who has entered with the greatest zeal into the practical
  application of these principles, and to whose skill the success of the idea
  is largely due, has made a direct-vision spectroscope for the Eoyal Obser
  vatory on the following plan (see fig. 1), which has been approved by
  the Astronomer Eoyal, and which embodies the above conclusions.            The
  train consists of three half-prisms direct-vision for the red rays, each
  having an angle of 57° 0' for the flint (sp. gr. 5-0) and 110° for the
  crown, and giving a dispersion of 20° with a magnifying-power of 3-8. The
  course of the rays is sufficiently indicated iu the diagram, from which it
                                                                   d2

will   be seen   how the breadth of the pencil
                                          decreases, the rays being thrown
to one side, as     it
                  were, by the refraction of the prisms.   The prisms turn
about centres a, b, e, so placed that the rays for different parts of the
spectrum, after emerging from one prism, always fall on the same part of
the face of the next prism, each being turned through the same angle.
There is no difficulty in calculating the positions of these points in any
particular case from the condition that       =        S<f>
                                                  as the prism   turned, and          is
that the lateral displacement of the middle ray in one prism must be equal
and opposite to the lateral motion of the perpendicular face of the next
prism. For the sake of convenience in mounting (the centres being in the
glass itself) the second and third prisms have been made larger than    abso                   is
lutely necessary and besides this large portion
                     ;                      a       of the crown might be cut
off as far as optical requirements are concerned. The prisms are each
turned through the same angle               by
                                        the lever  ef, having its fulcrum at

/ and moved        by    the micrometer-screw         m.
      This lever carries the three adjustable screws p,                     q,   r,   so placed as to
give the same angular motion to each prism, which     kept in contact with
                                                                       is
the corresponding screw           by

                                       a             side.  Thus simple                     a
motion of the lever          by
                       means of the micrometer-screw brings different
parts of the spectrum into the field  and this automatic motion will not

                                  by
which are carried in short adapter tubes to admit of easy removal.        The
slit and eyepiece can readily be interchanged        great purity in the spec

trum    isdesired   ;and, as just intimated, either one, two, or three half-
prisms can be used, giving       dispersion or purity (as the case may be) of
                                   a
four, fifteen, or sixty ordinary prisms of 60°.    The concave lens has the                /
effect of increasing the focal length of the collimator, and consequently of
reducing the apparent breadth of the spectrum-lines for         given width of   a
slit.   At the same time the spectrum           made narrower and brighter
                                                        is                                                ;
if, however, the spectroscope be applied to       large telescope, there
                                                              a             in                      is
fact no gain in light, a portion only of the pencil from the object-glass
being used, whilst the width and height of the slit may be increased in
the same proportion so as to keep the purity and breadth of spectrum
constant.    Notwithstanding this there        a practical advantage in the
                                                       is
diminished  effect of dust or irregularities on the slit.   It remains to
mention one important point in the direct-vision spectroscopes. Since the
collimator and telescope are in     straight line, an image of the slit
                                            a                                                            is
formed in the centre of the field            by     rays which pass through the object-
glasses above and below the prisms              ;    and this serves as bright reference
                                                                             a
line, which has the great advantage of being affected in the same way as
the spectrum-lines          by
                       any shift of the collimator or viewing-telescope.
Either a positive or negative eyepiece may be used with this ghost, and
its brightness or colour may be varied by diaphragms or coloured glasses.
Thus    a convenient bright-line micrometer   formed, supplying
                                                              is    want                     a
which has long been felt          by   spectroscopists.

38                      Mr. W. H. M. Christie      on the             [Mar. 1,
   It  may be remarked that this bright line gives a ready means of adjust
ing the collimator and telescope to focus, as, when this has been done, it
should be seen distinctly at the same time as the spectrum-lines.
   The   success  of this spectroscope has far exceeded all my anticipations.
Though the first prism is only 0-75 inch in cross section, and the total
length 11 inches, the power is far greater than that of any spectroscope
with which    I am acquainted, and this is accompanied by remarkable bright
ness in the spectrum.        I have compared it carefully with the large spec
troscope of the Eoyal Observatory, which has a train of ten compound
prisms, and find that even with two prisms in the small direct-vision
spectroscope the sodium lines are fully as widely separated as, and far
better defined than, in the large spectroscope with its full power, whilst
their brightness in the direct- vision spectroscope is incomparably greater.
With the full train of three prisms this separation is quadrupled nearly,
and the sodium lines are seen fully 3° apart with a power of 9 on the
viewing-telescope.       The compactness of the half-prism spectroscope, the
simplicity of its construction, and the ease with which it is manipulated
appear to leave little or nothing to be desired.
   I  have, however, tried a still more portable form of spectroscope, which
for many purposes seems fully equal to the larger form. It is on the plan
of the miniature spectroscopes, in which the eye takes the place" of the
viewing-telescope ; and its general construction will be readily seen from
fig. 2, which represents its actual size.
   The prisms turn about centres a, b, being moved by the lever d e f,
on which a, micrometer-screw m acts as in the larger spectroscope ; but to
allow of more motion in the first half-prism the positions of the centres
a, b have been altered, which can be done when there are       only two prisms
in the train, the condition between the lateral displacements still holding.
 The other arrangements are as before, the prism b being mounted in a
small tube so as to be readily withdrawn if large dispersion is not re
quired ; but in place of the viewing-telescope and eyepiece, there is simply
an eyeglass, g, adapted to the sight of the observer for distant objects, so
that the rays pass through the prisms in a state of parallelism.             The
bright  line  formed   by  the image  of the top and bottom  of the  slit is here
seen above and below the spectrum, and measurements are made with
great convenience.
   As the whole of the magnifying-power has to be supplied by the prisms,
 I have increased the angle of the flint to 58° 30', which approaches very
closely to the critical angle ; whilst in order to preserve the direct-vision
form, the angle of the crown is 120°, giving a magnifying-power of 9 and
a dispersion or purity (as the case may be) of 50°, or ten ordinary prisms
of 60° for each half -prism.      The train of two half-prisms has thus a mag
nifying-power of about 80, and a dispersion or purity of nearly 500°,
or 100 ordinary prisms of 60°.
    Small though this spectroscope is (the total length being only four

 1877.]             Magnifying-power      of the Half-prism.                  39
inches), its power is extraordinary.     "With the first half-prism alone the D
lines are distinctly separated, whilst with the two half-prisms their angular
distance is (by actual measurement) |° ; and tbis separation, be it re
membered, is obtained solely by the prisms, without any magnifying-power
from an eyepiece.        This separation is about equal to that in the large
Greenwich spectroscope with its ten compound prisms of 1*6 inch sec
tion and the ordinary eyepiece, whilst the definition is fully as sharp and
the brightness far superior.      In fact where it is not necessary to magnify
the breadth of the spectrum, the miniature spectroscope would appear
to be quite equal to the ordinary form, as there is no use in increasing
the height of the prisms beyond what is required to fill the pupil of the
eye with light.      Thus in the miniature spectroscope the prisms need be
only 0-2 inch high ; whilst if a magnifying-power of 10 is to be used (in
the direction of the breadth of the spectrum) their height should be 2
inches to give the same brightness. Except in the case of stars and other
objects of very limited apparent size, breadth may be given to the spec
trum just as well by increasing the height of the slit as by increasing the
height of the prisms. Of course the breadth of the first half -prism should
be as   large as may be, the magnifying-power in this direction being in all
 cases high enough to reduce the breadth of the pencil to a small fraction
 of the diameter of the pupil of the eye.
    The results obtained when the train of prisms is reversed so as to give
 great purity are even more remarkable.         With either of the half-prism
 trains in this position, without slit, collimator, or telescope, the sodium
 lines are seen with great brilliancy (though not divided) in the flame even
 of an ordinary paraffin or composite candle without any salt on the wick,
 and the Fraunhofer lines are seen sharply defined when the train of
 prisms pure and simple is pointed to the sun or moon. When the two
 trains are combined as in (5), page 29, still without any slit or lenses, the
 sodium-lines in an ordinary flame are widely separated, forming two
 images of the flame ; and the d and b lines in the sun are also well divided.
 From the low altitude of the sun and the prevalence of haze,         I have not
 had a fair opportunity of trying whether the prominences could be seen
 in this way without any slit or lenses ; but from the ease with which the
 C line is seen,  I  think it probable that the prominences would be visible
 as a ring of light on the background of the spectrum formed by the suc
 cessive coloured images of the sun's disk, dazzling though it is.       Even if
 this plan should fail with these short trains of prisms, there would be no
 difficulty in adding one or two more prisms to each ; for        I imagine that
 the limit to the power is far from having been reached in the spectroscopes
 I have described.      I have deferred making this new plan of spectroscope
 known until     I  could try it in a tolerably complete form, although the
 first experiments     I  made with direct-vision and other half-prisms in
 October last convinced me of its practical value. The results which have
 been obtained so far will,    I hope, show that there is no difficulty in ap

plying the method         so as to obtain     in a compact form and at a small
cost a dispersive power exceeding that of any spectroscope on the old
plan, and free from the defects inherent in a complicated instrument.
                     I
    In conclusion, may allude to an application of the remarkable pro
perty of the half-prism which may perhaps prove of practical use. From
what precedes it will be clear that the half-prism, as far as its magni
fying-power is concerned, is equivalent to a combination of an object-
glass and cylindrical eyepiece, the peculiarity being that it magnifies the
angle between two pencils of parallel rays without affecting the paral
lelism of the rays in each pencil.           The half-prisms which have so far
been considered are constructed so as to give great dispersion, and the
sun is seen through them as if through a telescope with an object-glass
 formed of a convex flint lens and a concave crown.              But it is obvious
 that an achromatic prism may be formed on the same principle as the
achromatic object-glass, giving cylindrical magnifying-power without dis
 persion.    If two such prisms be crossed at right angles, one behind the
other, the magnifying-power will be the same in both directions, and the
 combination will act as an achromatic telescope with the advantage of
 great compactness, since the eye can be applied close to the second prism.
     Whether, however, this advantage would compensate for the greater
 quantity of glass required and for the loss of light is a matter for prac
 tical consideration    ;  and I therefore   defer the discussion of the achromatic
 half-prism till    I  have satisfied myself that it has some practical utility,
 even though it may never replace the refracting telescope for general use.

     This paper contains an account of an experimental inquiry into the
  production of induced currents in liquids by magneto-electric induction.
   Faraday examined one such case of induction, in which a conducting

liquid was used     as a secondary    circuit. He coiled round the armature of
an electromagnet an india-rubber tube filled with dilute sulphuric acid,
and found, on making and breaking the primary circuit, the induced cur
rents generated in it, as in the case of metallic conductors ; but he could
not obtain any effect when brine, sulphuric acid, or other solutions were
rotated in basins over a magnet, or enclosed in tubes and passed between
the poles. He failed also to detect any magneto-electric current in water
flowing across the earth's lines of magnetic force (viz. in the river
 Thames).
     Since the reason for these negative results is not at once obvious,            it
 seemed desirable to repeat and extend them to other cases, so that,                if
possible,    the analogy     of electrolytic   with solid     conductors   might, in
 respect to magneto-electric induction, be .completed.             In   addition, the
 subject   involves  the  interesting   question   of the  magneto-electric    pheno
 mena accompanying the flow of ocean-currents              and other large masses
 of water.
     Three cases of induction in liquids flowing in        a magnetic field or tra
 versed by lines of magnetic force have been examined.
     1. Production of induced current in a liquid stream flowing uniformly
 in a constant magnetic field. — When a stream of conducting fluid flows
 vertically down between the poles of a magnet a transverse current is
 produced in a direction at right angles to the lines of force and line of
 flow. This was obtained in the following way : — A glass tube, about 200
 centims. long and 2 centims. wide, had platinum plates 15 millims. wide
 placed along its inside and at opposite sides, with their lengths parallel to
 the axis of the tube.       Platinum wires welded to these plates were sealed
 through the glass. The plates were curved to lie closely against the sides
 of the tube.     This tube was placed vertically between the poles of a large
  electromagnet, the line joining the platinum plates being at right angles
  to the line of the poles.
     To the upper end of the tube was attached another, leading to a reser
  voir of dilute sulphuric acid placed high above the floor ; to the lower
  end a tube leading to a receptacle on the floor.             The platinum plates
  were   then  connected   with   a distant   galvanometer.      When the magnet
  was not excited, no flowing of the liquid had any effect on the galvano
  meter; but when it was excited, at the moment the flow began the
  galvanometer showed a deflection of 10° to 15°.            Since the only part of
  the galvanometer     circuit  in motion  is  the liquid,  this deflection was due
  to the magneto-electric current generated in it by its movement. It was
  noticed that the plates were polarized by the currents so created.             As  a
  consequence of this, the deflection of the needle soon fell to zero           ; and
  on the liquid flow being stopped, a polarization current in the opposite
  direction was obtained. This proved that in experiments on induction in
  liquids, in order to obtain any constant current, non-polarizable electrodes
  must be used.

     2. Production     of induced current in   a mass   of liquid rotating   over a mag
netic pole. —In this case radial currents          should be produced.       They were
obtained as     follows :— Flat porous cells were placed round the circum
ference of a large basin, and in the centre a cylindrical one. These were
filled with a solution of cupric sulphate, and contained copper plates. The
basin was filled with dilute sulphuric acid. The centre copper plate was
connected with one pole of the galvanometer, and the circumferential
ones   with the other. The whole was placed over the pole of the electro
magnet.      On exciting the magnet and rotating the dilute acid, a con
stant current was obtained, flowing from centre to circumference or the
reverse according to the direction of rotation. With platinum electrodes
the effect cannot be obtained, but with non-polarizable electrodes it is
easily produced.      Mercury was likewise tried with still better results.
    3. Production of induced current in a liquid at rest in a variable mag
netic field. — If a flexible tube- filled with conducting liquid is wound round
an electromagnet, and into the ends electrodes placed so as to include a
galvanometer in the circuit, then induced currents are obtained when
ever the strength of the magnet varies.            This is the case examined by
Faraday.       His experiment was repeated by MM. Logeman and Van
Breda (Phil. Mag. [IV.] vol. viii. p. 465), who noticed that the electrodes
were left polarized after the induced current had passed. These experi
ments were repeated with more powerful apparatus, using a soft iron
wire core within the inducing helix instead of solid iron, and employing
a condenser in the primary circuit.            Very strong induced currents were
obtained, and correspondingly great polarization of the electrodes placed
in the ends of the coil of acid. It was hoped that the currents might
produce visible inductive electrolysis, but even this improved arrange
ment did not yield that result.          Other saline solutions were tried with
similar results.
   Lastly, the phenomenon observed by Arago, of the retardation in the
vibrations of a magnetic needle oscillated near the surface of liquids, is
examined.      Evidence is brought forward to show that this is not, as in
the case of solid plates, due to induced currents created in the liquid —
                                       is,
                                        caeteris paribus, not proportional   to the

it takes place equally when        light brass needle, oscillated by torsion,
                                   a                                                  is
substituted for the magnet, provided the needle             light and the period of
                                                           is
oscillation   not  very   small.     Thus      a magnetic  needle  which required
4 min. 20 sec. to suffer       decrement of 25° in the semi-arc of vibration
                               a
when in air, required over dilute sulphuric acid          3min. 30 sec., over ether
2 min. 25 sec. A brass needle of the same dimensions exhibited similar
effects.
     In   conclusion the magneto-electric induction taking place in moving
masses     of water on the earth's surface under the influence of terrestrial
magnetism      is   briefly discussed.

    Before the introduction of the absolute system of electro-magnetic
measure, there was no means of estimating the electromotive force so
brought into play by the flow of a river or ocean stream, aud the magni
tude of the effect was perhaps overestimated.
    A Table is given, showing the electromotive force in volts produced in
two or three cases.

    This electromotive force without doubt generates a current transverse
to the direction of the flow ; but since the surrounding still water or the
river bed     or channel is not a non-conductor, any attempt practically to
detect   it by plates placed on either side of the stream is not likely to
succeed,    since the current through the galvanometer          is only a derived
portion of the current in the stream.
    A  comparison of a chart of ocean-currents with one of the isogonic
lines does not seem to show any distortion of the lines of equal variation
where they cut across.       If, now, electric currents of any great magni
 tude were generated in ocean-currents, such would undoubtedly be the
case.     Though Faraday's failure to detect any magneto-electric current
 iu the Thames may have been partly due to his employment of polarizable
electrodes, still there is evidence enough to show that these currents,
 though certainly existing and capable of being produced on a laboratory
 scale, cannot be regarded as coutributing in any sensible degree towards
 affecting the form    and distribution of the isogonic       lines.    Those who
 have looked to this as a possible partial cause of the   irregularity observed
 have been led, no doubt, by the dimensions      of the streams to exaggerate
 the magneto-electric    induction caused by their flow.

     The nomenclature and classification     of the varieties of dentine      have
 hitherto   been based   solely upon the appearances discoverable in dried
 teeth; in the present communication the author seeks to amend and
 place upon a more satisfactory basis the grouping of these several kinds
 of dentine, by bringing to bear upon their arrangement observations
 upon the nature of the contents of those large tubes which give to the
 tissues their name of " vascular

 tions upon the methods by which they are developed.

44                  Mr. C. S. Tomes      on Vascular Dentine.               [Mar. 8,
     Vaso-dentine is the term generally used to designate a variety of
dentine exceedingly common in the class of Fish, in which the substance
of the tooth is permeated by       a numberof anastomosing tubes, of con
siderable size, which have been called "medullary" canals, as they have been
supposed to contain pulp-tissue ; whilst osteo-dentine is used to desig
nate that variety of vaso-dentine in which the matrix is arranged in con
centric layers round the canals, like the laminae of an Haversian system
in bone, and in which     spaces   like the   lacunae   of   bone occur.
     The author would not propose to introduce any new terms, but to
render more precise and definite the meaning attached to the terms
vaso-dentine and osteo-dentine, premising that the application of the
two words will be greatly altered by so doing.
   The author defines vaso-dentine as a modification of dentine which
is permeated by a system of canals far larger than ordinary dentinal
tubes, which anastomose freely with one another, and contain capillary
blood-vessels and nothing else.     That is to say, each several canal con
tains a capillary of the same calibre as itself, and no cellular or other
pulp-tissue, for which, in fact, there is no room ; the canals were formed
by the enclosure of capillaries of the pulp in a calcified matrix.      True
dentinal tubes may coexist   with  the  large capillary canals ; but if they
do, they radiate from the central pulp-chamber and not from the canals :
in the most typical vaso-dentine, such as that of the hake, the matrix is
solid and there are no true dentinal tubes. Vaso-dentine is developed
from a sharply defined
                       " membrana eboris," or layer of odontoblast cells.
   Osteo-dentine, on the other hand, is also permeated by a system of
large channels, but these do not (except as an accident) contain capillary
blood-vessels, nor were they developed around capillaries.    True " den
           "
tinal tubes can perhaps hardly be said to exist ; but the tubes of small
calibre which do exist radiate, not from a common pulp-chamber, but
from the several canals.
   Its greatest distinction from vaso-dentine lies in the manner of its
development.      It is not (ifwe except    thin outer layer of hard dentine
                                              a
with which  it is often clothed) developed from specialized layer of odonto
                                                        a
blast cells;  but calcifying trabecule shoot rapidly from the interior of
the first-formed dentine cap through the whole substance of the formative
pulp, and the canal-system ultimately formed         due to the partial coa
                                                            is
lescence of these ossifying trabecular leaving interspaces between them.
The canals have therefore nothing whatever to do with the blood-vessels
of the pulp, and therefore do not correspond very closely with those of
vaso-dentine.      Osteo-dentine     thus not derived from the calcification
                                    is
of   a" membrana eboris," or special layer of odontoblast cells, but     ossi by
fication (of cells like osteoblasts) shooting through its whole mass.
   Thus the tooth-pulp can be bodily withdrawn from          tooth consisting
                                                                   a
of vaso-dentine by tearing across the capillaries only, and the interior
of the dentine cap will be left smooth but the pulp can

dentine,   because it is permeated through and through by a network of
calcifying trabecule.
   It is possible by careful observation to distinguish in sections of dried
teeth true vaso-dentine from osteo-dentine ; the majority of teeth consist

dentine, but are always described as vaso-dentine).
  The teeth of the hake are selected as an illustration of vaso-dentine                                               ;
they have large pulps, richly vascular, and red blood circulates abundantly
through the capillary channels of the dentine, so that the tooth, when
the fish    is      alive,   is     brilliantly red.

by dentinal tubes.
  The transition between    typical vaso-dentine, such as that of the
Gadidse, and hard unvascular dentine, such as that of most mammalian
teeth,     is   gradual.
   Thus most of the PleuronectidaB have teeth which at their basal halves
consist of typical vaso-dentine without dentinal tubes, just like that of
the Gadid» but above the middle, dentinal tubes radiating out from the

dentine    is sudden, and the tooth  is easily broken off at this point.
When the greater part of the length of the root has been formed the
manner of calcification again changes, this time not so abruptly, till near
to the end of the root the dentinal     pulp becomes converted into osteo
dentin*, which is quite indistinguishable from and blends insensibly with
the surrounding coarse bone by which the tooth is fastened into the
socket; there is, in fact, no reason for calling it any thing else than
coarse bone, except the fact that it is the product of calcification of a
dentinal       pulp.    In      this    case       pulp forms first hard
                                               a single    dentinal
dentine, secondly vaso-dentine, and at last osteo-dentine.
  Another variety of complex dentine is brought about by foldings and
subdivisions of the formative pulp                 :   both vaso-dentineand osteo-dentine
are formed by the calcification                of simple pulps ;   but in many instances
the odontoblast-bearing                surface of the pulp is itself complicated in form,
and a dentine arranged as                    it were round many pulp-chambers is the
result.
  For this no better name than plici-dentine (also    a term already in use)
suggests itself : it is to be seen in its simpler form at the base of the
teeth of Lepidosteus, in greater complexity at the base of the teeth of
 Varanus, and in exceeding complexity in the teeth of Labyrinthodonts.
  The author would distinguish, therefore : —
  (i) Hard unvascular dentine, the characters of which are sufficiently
       known.
  (ii) Vaso-dentine, which is developed from odontoblasts after the
       manner of dentine, but contains an anastomosing network of
         canals modelled around and containing capillaries.
  (iii) Plici-dentine, developed from odontoblasts, but from a complicated
         pulp, so that it is more or less divided up into distinct systems
         of dentinal tubes.
  (iv)    Osteo-dentine, developed from osteoblasts, like bone, and quite
          unlike dentine ; permeated by a system of large canals, which do
        not contain, or have any special relation to, blood-vessels.
   The author lays no stress on the characters formerly given as distinc
tive of osteo-dentine     e.   laminated arrangement of the matrix and the
                                (i.     a
presence  of lacunae), because   (i) lamination of the matrix not unknown       is
in vaso-dentine,         (ii)    lacunse       are very frequently absent from bone in
fishes, and very frequently                 from osteo-dentine, so that these characters,
as those who have tried to apply them have found, are not useful in
practice.
  The attachment of the teeth of the hake                  is   so peculiar as to merit   a   word

others of the family steps towards this highly specialized arrangement,
the benefit of which to a voracious predatory fish, such as the hake, is
obvious     *.
    The common cod has teeth which admit of a small amount of motion
only ; but a comparison of them with those of the hake shows clearly that
a further modification in the same direction would lead to an attachment
similar to that of the latter fish.
    The haddock, which in this respect is a fair representative of the
family, has teeth which admit of no motion at all.
III.     " Note     on the Early Stages of Development               of the Nerves
        in the Chick."        By A. Milnes Marshall, B.A., B.Sc, of
        St. John's College,          Cambridge.        Communicated           by  Dr.

     In  the investigations here described embryos of ages from thirty-six
hours to four days were employed.                These were, for the most part,
 hardened by immersion in picric acid, prepared after Kleinenberg's
method, for three to five hours, and then in alcohol of gradually increasing
 strength.       It is to the use of picric acid as a hardening agent that the
 results obtained are believed to be in large measure due. All the more
 important results have, however, been confirmed by specimens hardened
 in chromic acid in the usual manner, though such specimens have
 almost invariably proved inferior in distinctness to those prepared with
 picric acid. Good results have also been obtained from duck-embryos
 hardened in picric acid.
      Owing to the less compact character of the mesoblast of the head and
 to the absence of protovertebroe, the development of the cranial nerves is
 easier to study than that of the spinal, and will therefore be considered
 first.
      Transverse    sections through the hind brain of a forty-three hours'
  chick show that the cells along the median dorsal line are
                                                                      more spherical
  in shape and slightly smaller than       those  composing   the rest  of the brain ;
  also that these spherical cells grow upwards, so as to form a conspicuous
  longitudinal ridge running along the upper surface of the hind brain
  immediately beneath the external epiblast.
      This ridge is traceable along the whole length of the hind brain, but is
  much more prominent posteriorly than it is in front, where it gradually
  disappears.      At intervals the ridge becomes more prominent, and grows

  out laterally into paired processes.         These processes are the rudiments of
 the cranial nerves ; the cells composing them are, like those of the ridge
 itself, small and spherical, and differ markedly from both the elongated
 cells of the external epiblast, and the large, loosely arranged, branching
 and irregularly shaped mesoblast cells.
     At forty-three hours the first pair of these processes arises from the
 anterior part of the hind brain ; it subsequently develops into the fifth
 nerve.
     Immediately in front of the auditory involution (which at this period
 is a wide and very shallow pit) a large outgrowth arises on either side,
 from which the facial and auditory nerves are derived.
    A large outgrowth from the median ridge commences on either side a
 short distance behind the auditory pit, and is of considerable longitudinal
 extent, reaching as far back as the middle of the first protovertebra.
 From this outgrowth are developed the glossopharyngeal nerve and the
 several branches of the vagus.
    The outgrowth of spherical cells from the summit of the neural
 canal, forming the longitudinal ridge above alluded to, is not con
 fined to the hind brain, but is continued backwards without any break
 some distance down the spinal cord.              In the spinal cord, as in the brain,
this ridge gives off at intervals paired lateral processes, which extend
 outwards just beneath the superficial epiblast.              These processes corre
 spond   in number     to   the  protovertebree,     and  are  the rudiments of the
 posterior roots of the spinal nerves.             Each process has a longitudinal
extension equal to about half a protovertebra, opposite the posterior
 part of which it is situated.         In the case of the first few spinal nerves
 the processes are somewhat larger, and extend back so as to overlap the
 anterior parts of the succeeding protovertebrse.
    This description, it is believed, differs from any previously published
account of the development of the nerves in the chick, but agrees re
                                            * account of the development of the
markably closely with Balfour's
nerves, both cranial and spinal, of Elasmobranchs, and is in accordance
with Hensen'st observations on the development of the posterior roots
of the spinal nerves in the rabbit.
    Opposite the centre of each protovertebra the external epiblast grows
downwards as a small conical process on either side of the spinal cord
and in close contact with it. These processes were mistaken by Hist
for the commencements of the spinal nerves, but are clearly seen to have
no connexion whatever with the nerve-rudiments.                   His is the only pre
vious observer who assigns         an   epiblastic, instead  of  a mesoblastic, origin
to the nerves in the chick ; he, however, derives them directly from the

external epiblast, while, according to the description just given, they
really arise from the involuted epiblast of the neural canal.
   From their mode of origin the cranial and the anterior spinal nerves
•will be seen to be all connected together at first by a longitudinal
commissure of spherical cells, while the two nerves of each pair, whether
cranial or spinal, are also connected together across the top of the
neural canal.
   The attachment of the nerve, whether cranial or spinal, is at first to
the extreme summit of the neural canal.         Shortly after their appearance
the attachments shift slightly outwards, and, in the case of the spinal
nerve, become much more slender.            This shifting is believed to be
apparent rather than real, and to be caused, as first suggested by Bal
four, by rapid growth of the cells at the summit of the canal, which
has the effect of separating the roots of the two sides from one another
and forcing them apart.
   Though the proximal part of the nerve-root becomes thus more slender
in the spinal nerves, the distal part enlarges considerably, and grows down
as an oval mass     (the spinal ganglion) between the spinal cord and the
protovertebrse.     At  this period the most prominent part is situated
opposite the interval between two protovertebra;.
   During the third day     a great change occurs  in the point of attachment,
which is now considerably lower down, in the position occupied by the
root in the adult.    The nerve is now attached, not by its apex, but by a
small process growing out from its side, and projects considerably above
the point of attachment.       Owing to the surrounding mesoblast this stage
is very difficult to investigate ; but the appearances strongly suggest that
the original attachment of the nerve to the summit of the cord is lost,
and a new one acquired lower down, and that the projection of the nerve
above the point of attachment, which becomes inconspicuous very shortly
afterwards, is a remnant of the original attachment.
    The anterior roots of the spinal nerves arise later than the posterior,
and have not been observed earlier than the latter part of the third day.
They appear as small outgrowths from the lower part of the sides of the
 spinal cord, and from the first occupy the position held by them in the
adult.   This position is indicated before the actual appearance of the
roots by a slight convergence of the cells at the outer part of the cord.
The anterior roots are very slender, and consist of much elongated cells,
contrasting strongly with the spherical or oval cells of the posterior
roots.
   Early on the fourth day      each  anterior root consists of a number of
such processes placed one behind the other, and lying opposite the anterior
half of a protovertebra.      The total length of attachment of an anterior
root on the fourth day is equal to about half a protovertebra.
   The anterior roots grow outwards, and early in the fourth day join
with the posterior roots to constitute the spinal nerves.

    In  the cranial nerves no anterior roots hare been observed ; but as
the observations have not been carried beyond the fourth day, and certain
of the cranial nerves have not been observed at all, no conclusion as to
their non-existence is to be drawn from this fact, which can only be
 considered a doubtful confirmation of Balfour's failure to discover ante
 rior cranial roots in Elasmobranchs *.
    The facial and auditory nerves have been seen to arise as a single out
 growth just in front of the ear ; this speedily divides into an anterior
 part, which runs downwards in front of the auditory vesicle and becomes
 the facial nerve, and a posterior part, which is closely applied to the
 anterior wall of the auditory vesicle and becomes the auditory nerve.
    The fifth nerve arises as a single outgrowth on either side, the posi
                                        The so-called " hind brain
                                                                      "
 tion of which is very constant.                                         consists
 at forty-three   hours    of an apparently      variable number   of dilatations
 separated by slight constrictions, and gradually decreasing in size from
 before backwards. These dilatations are well known, but appear to possess
 more constancy than is usually ascribed to them ; the most anterior of
them is but little smaller than the mid brain.           From it the fifth nerve
arises in all the specimens examined.
    The third, fourth, and sixth nerves have not been observed ; but a
slight outgrowth from the summit of the mid brain, noticed in two
specimens only, may prove to be the commencement of the third or
fourth.
    The olfactory nerves arise towards the end of the third day as solid
outgrowths from the anterior end of the fore brain, close to the median
dorsal line, and exactly correspond in mode of development and in ap
pearance with the other cranial nerves and with the posterior roots of
the spinal nerves.      They arise at a time when a section through the
anterior part of the fore brain transverse to its longitudinal ¦axis, and
passing through the olfactory pits and nerves, is almost perfectly circu
lar in outline, and must therefore be described as arising from the fore
brain itself, and not from the cerebral hemispheres, with which they have
no connexion     at first, and which are not nearly such prominent objects
at the end of the third day as they are often described to be. There is no
trace of an " olfactory vesicle " in the early stages.
    This mode of development of the olfactory nerve in the chick would
seem to be of considerable morphological importance, since, if confirmed,
any arguments concerning the composition of the skull, based on the
distribution of the cranial nerves, would have in future to take the
olfactory nerves into consideration.

the weight of the sea-water must be considered, and, by chance, it hap
pens that the weight of the sea-water somewhat more than counter
balances the weight of the surface-rock excavated ; so that the depression
of the ocean-surfaces of the earth beneath the zero plane have had little

    This equation expresses that a semilune of continent 5° in width,
elevated from the pole to the equator, being 345 miles in width at the
equator and zero at the pole, will push the earth's axis away from it
though a distance of 14-11 miles.
    If we imagine a continent occupying 90° of longitude of a semilune,
and extending from the equator to the pole, we find, if I denote the hour-
 angle from the meridian bisecting the continent, —

   Having shown in the preceding note that the motion of the earth's
axis caused by the geological wrinkling of the earth's surface depends
(in consequence of the weight of the sea-water) only on the continents,
it remains for  me to calculate   the numerical amount of change of axis
produced by each of the existing continents.
                      I
   For this purpose select the following meridians       for the coordinates
Y and X of the motion :—

Beckoning the longitudes eastward, round the whole circumference of the
earth, the equation (10) generalized becomes

as the axis moved.     We thus find

   The power of Europe and Asia in moving the pole is partly due to
the extension of this continent along the parallel of 45°, which is the
most effective latitude.       The actual effect produced by Europe and Asia
was not   much   less  than  that    of our imaginary continent (Note I.), occu
pying one eighth part of the surface of the globe.
   The foregoing results are positive, and the motions of the pole indi
cated must have       actually occurred when the existing continents were
formed.     But simultaneously with these elevations depressions must
have gone on elsewhere, continents disappearing beneath the sea and
sinking to the    zero plane, while        other continents       were rising.   It is to

be noticed that although the excavation of the sea-bottom to its present
depth below the zero plane, corrected for the weight of the ocean, pro
duces no motion in the pole, yet that the depression of a continent down
to the zero plane produces a motion of pole equal and opposite to that
produced by its elevation. I have calculated the hypothetical effects of
the depression of imaginary continents occupying the sites of the present
Pacific Ocean, with the following results : —

   The present more complete discussion fully confirms the result before
obtained    by

Tide at this station, and also shows satisfactory agreement in the other

the sun's hour-angle, and finally into simple functions of sand «. These

expansions found by means of Fourier's Theorem, and the final Lunar

   Although the short period of observation at Port Kennedy (23 days)
renders this method of discussion not much more valuable than the usual
method of H.W. and L. "W. observations,      have developed   at length

        Leucoline into Aniline." By Prof. James Dewar. Com
        municated by Prof. A. W. Williamson, Foreign Secretary of
        the Royal Society.         Received February 19, 1877.
     In  a previous research*     on the pyridine series of bases the formation
 and    properties    of  dicarbopyridinic      acid were described.            This acid
 derivative is related to pyridine in the same manner as phthalic acid to
 benzol.     It was then pointed out that the members of the pyridine and
 chinoline series bear to one another a similar relation to that of benzol
 and naphthaline,      the following analogies being given         : —
              rC,H,         fC.H4          fC„H4        CaHa           C,H3N

              Benzol.    Naphthaline.   Anthracene.    Pyridine.      Chinoline.
    An extension of the work was promised in support of these theoretical
relations.
    Our knowledge of the chinoline series has made little progress since
the masterly and exhaustive investigation of Greville Williams t, proving
the isomerism of the tar and cinchona bases.                  The relations of these
bodies are still very obscure, owing to the great stability of the bases
preventing the formation of derivatives of a simpler type.                         Indeed
some of the most interesting products obtained from these bases, such as

the blue colouring-matter cyanine, have a more complicated structure, all
attempts to reach gradationally simpler substances of known constitution
having been unsatisfactory.          Gerhardt remarked that " En general les
reactions de la quinoleine sont fort peu nettes"*. It is the object of this
communication to render the relations of this substance a little more
definite.
   In   the paper above referred to it was shown that pyridine might be
obtained     by the distillation of dicarbopyridinic       acid with soda-lime ;
and as the acid had been made from the oxidation of picoline this may
be regarded as a means        of passing from the six- to the five-carbon base.
It seemed, therefore, important to ascertain if the members of the
chinoline series yielded on oxidation any similar acid, and if a simpler
base could be obtained by subjecting it to a like treatment.
   In order to carry out this investigation, a quantity of the crude high
boiling-point bases occurring in coal-tar was procured, and after repeated
fractionation on the large scale was treated in the following manner, to
ensure its freedom from pyrrols, phenols, and high boiling-point hydro
 carbons.      The bases were dissolved in strong nitric acid, separated
 by means of soda, distilled, and again treated with nitric acid.               The
 addition of small quantities of arsenious acid to the solution was con
tinued for some hours.         The bases now liberated from the solution of
the nitrate were fractionally distilled, and the specimens boiling between
220° C. and 240° C. were regarded as tolerably pure leucoline.               It has
been satisfactorily proved by Greville Williams that no amount of frac
tional distillation will yield chemically pure members of this series ; so
that this product must be regarded as a mixture of leucoline and irido-
lino, the names given to the bases in coal-tar isomeric with the chino
line   and    lepidine obtained from cinchona.          In various experiments
specimens were used which had been more carefully fractionated, the
boiling-point not varying more than 2° C. ; but the products obtained were
in all cases similar.
   The mode       in which the oxidation was conducted was similar in all
respects to that described in my former paper ; but the high boiling-point
of the base and the rapidity of the action rendered the use of the con
denser unnecessary.        The general method of working was as follows : —
 129 grams of leucoline were dissolved in an equivalent of sulphuric acid
and the solution diluted to 600 cubic centimetres.                This was then
divided into three equal parts, to each of which was added a hot solution
of 100 grams of permanganate of potash in about a litre of water, with
constant stirring so as to avoid too vigorous an action.         In a few minutes
the whole of the permanganate is reduced, and the solution, which ought
to be neutral, having been made slightly alkaline, is filtered from the
oxide of manganese and evaporated to a small bulk, when a large pro
portion of the sulphate of potash crystallizes on cooling.             The mother-
liquor   was  next   carefully acidulated   with dilute sulphuric acid, when a

resinous mixture of acids separates.               The crude acids may also be ob
tained as potash salts by evaporating to dryness the product of the
reaction and extraction with alcohol.                The aqueous solution of these
potash salts, on the addition of acetate of lead, yields a white insoluble
lead salt from which the acids may also be separated.
    The crude mixture of acids thus obtained, boiled with water for a con
siderable time and filtered from an oily matter, yields, after treatment with
a  little animal charcoal, crystals of a well-defined acid.
    Leueolinie     Acid,     CjH^NO,. — The crystalline         substance     obtained  as
above described        is mainly composed of this acid, which may be obtained
in colourless plates or needles by a few crystallizations.              The acid melts at
162°C, is slowly volatilized when heated to 110° C. in            a current   of hydrogen,
and communicates a characteristic aromatic odour to the vapour from a hot
aqueous      solution. The acid may be most conveniently crystallized from an
aqueous solution, being slightly soluble in cold water.                 Although soluble
in alcohol and ether the acid is generally rendered slightly coloured, from
an apparent oxidation, when crystallized from these menstrua.
    The salts of this acid are for the most part soluble, the more notable
exceptions being the lead, mercurous, and ferric salts.                    The silver salt
crystallizes in fine needle-shaped crystals.

the quantity taken too small for an accurate determination.
    Equivalent of the Acid. — A quantity of the acid, weighing 0-445 gram,
titrated with pure caustic soda solution, every l-73 cubic centimetre of
which contained 23 milligrams of sodium, required 4-28 cubic centi
metres of this solution to neutralize the quantity of acid taken.         Hence
the equivalent of the acid is 179.
    Professor Liveing has kindly determined the following erystallographic
constants : —

 1877.]           Transformation of Leucoline into Aniline.                   69
    The acid may be regarded as formed by one or other of the following
reactions : —
                   (1) C,H7N+Oa + H,0=C,H,N03
                   (2) CI0H9N+O.            =C,H,NOs+COa;
but (1) probably represents the chief source of the acid.        Whether per
fectly pure leucoline free from traces of iridoline would give the acid
must, however, in the mean time remain an open question, as large
quantities of material are required to procure the pure base.        The yield
of acid only amounts to three per cent, of the bases used.
                           Decompositions  of the Acid.
   Action  of heat. — The acid heated rapidly above its melting-point becomes
dark brown, evolves water, and gives an oily sublimate which ultimately
solidifies, leaving a mass of porous carbon.         The acid sublimate, which
probably    contains   the  anhydride,  boiled    with  water regenerates the
acid.
   Action of soda-lime. — The acid heated with soda-lime to a low red heat
leaves a deposit of carbon and yields an alkaline oily distillate.     This oil
is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, and gives the characteristic reac
tions of pyrrol.       The solution evaporated leaves the hydrochlorates
of the bases as a crystalline mass, which, after several solutions and
evaporations with dilute hydrochloric acid, is freed from pyrrol. The
hydrochlorates of the basic substances produced were now heated with
potash, when the bases distilled as a colourless oil. This oil has all the
physical and chemical characters of pure aniline.
    In order to demonstrate the transformation of leucoline into aniline
 the crude product of the oxidation may be used instead of the isolated
acid.    A cubic centimetre of leucoline dissolved as sulphate, treated with
 a solution of 3 grams of permanganate of potash, filtered, evaporated to
 dryness, and the residue mixed with some soda-lime, yields on distillation
 sufficient aniline to give all its characteristic reactions.   If potash-lime
 be used instead of soda-lime, the product of the distillation is found to
 be almost free from pyrrol.
    In order to ascertain if any base other than aniline was present,
3 grams of the acid was heated with potash-lime and the distillate col
 lected in dilute hydrochloric acid. This was fractionally precipitated by
 chloride of platinum, when 0*1248 gram of the first fraction gave
 0-0425 gram of platinum, equal to 34*05 per cent., aniline requiring
32*99 per cent.      The second fraction, 0*2101 gram, gave 0*0688 gram of
 platinum, equal to 32*74 per cent.
    The only substance associated with aniline seems to be ammonia, as
 appears from the following experiment, undertaken to ascertain whether
 any nitrile bases occurred in the distillate. The distillate from other
 3 grams of acid was collected in nitric acid, and fragments of nitrite of
 potash added, until all the aniline was decomposed. The solution after
 being boiled was treated with caustic soda and distilled.        The distillate

70        On the Transformation             of Leucoline into Aniline.        [Mar. 15,
was slightly alkaline, and gave a platinum salt, of which 0-216 gram
yielded 0*0954 of platinum, equal to 44*16 per cent, of platinum, the
double chloride of platinum and ammonium requiring 44-23 per cent.
The mother-liquor yielded nothing apparently but the ammonium salt.
The acid on heating with potash-lime mainly undergoes the following
reaction  : —
                        C9H9NO>=C6H7N+ COa+H20 + Ca.
   When the crude mixture of potash salts resulting from the oxidation
is taken, instead of the pure acid, and distilled with soda-lime, there
appears to be associated with the aniline and pyrrols a small quantity of
a nitrile base having a lower boiling-point than leucoline.                 If the pure
potash salt is heated alone it fuses, aniline distils along with the vapour
of water, and a mixture of carbonate of potash and carbon is left. Thus
                 2C,H8KNO, =2C6H7N + H,0 + KaCO, + COa + Ct.
   If the potash salt is fused with excess of potash, ammonia is evolved
and salicylic acid is found in solution.             Probably anthranylic acid is the
first product, and this is subsequently changed into ammonia and sali
cylic acid, viz. —
                (1) C9H8NOa+3HaO              =    C7HTN01+2C0I+H1.
                     Leucolinic                   Anthranylic.
                (2)  C^NO^O
                    Anthranylic.
                                              =    C7H8Oa+NHa.
                                                   Salicylic.
    A  similar series of reactions take place when indigo is carefully treated
with fused potash. The formation of salicylic acid explains the origin
of the ammonia found associated with the aniline when the acid is heated
with potash-lime.
    A solution of the acid in glycerine, heated to the boiling-point of the
latter, gives a distillate of glycerine, aniline, and a substance in small
quantity having the characters of indol.                 No free carbon is separated in
this reaction.        That indol or an isomeric body is likely to occur amongst
 the products of decomposition appears from the following likely decom
 position   : —
                        C,H,NOs         =     CflH7N+Ha0 + C0a.
                      Leucolinic Acid.         Indol ?
This reaction is rendered probable from the relations of indol and ani
line, indol being readily obtained from the reduction of isatine, and
isatine yielding aniline, carbonate of potash, and hydrogen on fusion
with potash. The relations of chinoline, leucoline, and indol will be fully
 investigated in the second part of this paper, after            I  have had an oppor
 tunity of examining the isomeric cinchona bases. In the mean time it
 may be remarked that pyrrol and pyridine have a similar relation to
indol and chinoline, thus —

1877.]                 On the Density       of Solid Mercury.                          71
    In my paper before referred to it was suggested that, " considering
the stability and mode of formation            of these bases, it is not at all im
probable that they may be produced by the simultaneous action of
acetylene and its derivatives on hydrocyanic acid ; thus as three mole
cules of acetylene condense and form benzol, so may two molecules of
acetylene and one of hydrocyanic acid condense and produce pyridine."
     A  synthetical experiment of the kind suggested has been executed by
Mr.    Bamsay*, who finds that by transmitting a mixture of acetylene and
hydrocyanic acid through a red-hot tube bases were unquestionably pro
duced.      Pyrrol, which may be so readily identified by means of its
 characteristic reaction with fir wood moistened with hydrochloric acid,
 may be formed synthetically by substituting ammonia for the hydrocyanic
acid in the above experiment.              The acetylene employed, however, con
 tained a small quantity of bromide of vinyl, and it is possible the reaction
 may have taken place between that substance and ammonia.                          Only a
 small quantity of pyrrol is formed in this reaction, the principal sub
 stance formed being cyanide of ammonium ; and the success of the ex
 periment seems to depend on the maintenance of a carefully regulated
 temperature and a certain extent of porous            surface.      These and similar
 reactions are under investigation.
     The theoretical bearings of this investigation have not been touched
 upon in the present paper, as an extensive research will be necessary
 before structural relations can be predicted with any certainty.
     I am  greatly indebted to Mr. "W. F. Sell, B.A., and Mr. A. Scott, B.Sc,

     I  have  lately taken advantage of a heavy fall of very cold and finely
 pulverulent snow, well adapted to the preparation of freezing-mixtures,
 to redetermine, with accuracy          I  believe, the density of mercury in the
  solid state and at a definite temperature.
      Such redetermination was not superfluous, as appeared from a colla
  tion of the statements to be found in various standard works. In the
  tables of specific gravities compiled by Prof. F.W. Clarke, and published by
  the Smithsonian Institution t, there are four authorities quoted, with the
  numbers given by these, as follows : —

    The last of these numbers, on reference to the original papert, turns

 but   I have    not been able to find any reference to a paper by him bearing
 on this or any analogous point, and it seems probable that we have here
 only a reproduction of Schulze's result.            In different handbooks of chem
 istry and physics numbers between 14 and 15 are given as approxima
 tions, but with no other authority than some of the above.                  Some of the
 best and most recent works             simply state that mercury undergoes consi
 derable contraction        in freezing.       Hence our knowledge on this subject
 appears hitherto to have rested on the experiments of Schulze and Biddle,
 both of which date back to the early years of the present century.
 Schulze's paper was published in 1 Gehlen's Journal,' vol. iv. p. 434, and
 therefore about 1807 or 1808, and Biddle's§ belongs to the year 1805.
 I  have had access to neither ; but the character of the instrumental means
 (balances, thermometers, <&c.) generally available at the time the experi
 ments were made, and the then imperfect knowledge of the constants
 needed for corrections to be applied, make it unlikely that very exact
 results could have been obtained.              Biddle alone seems to have noted the
 temperature of the frozen mercury, and Brande|| expresses doubt that
 this was determined with much accuracy. The temperature — 60° C., if
 correctly quoted, is in itself somewhat improbable.
     The method adopted in the experiments lately               made   in this laboratory
 was the following : —
     (1)  A  specific-gravity flask was prepared from a large cylindrical pi

smaller size, the upper and open end of the shortened tube of which was
fitted with a small carefully ground glass stopper.         The neck between
the larger and smaller cylinders was drawn down to a small bore (about
2 millims.), and at this narrowed part a fine line marked round it with a
diamond.       The shape of the vessel is shown in the annexed sketch, on a
linear scale of one half the real size. The principal cylinder held about
58 cubic centimetres,      and the small reservoir    above   25 cub. centime.
The whole vessel weighed about 46 grammes.
     It   enabled the experiments to be carried out with more than half a
 kilogramme of frozen mercury.
      (2) This vessel having   been accurately weighed when empty and      dry,
 its capacity up to the mark was ascertained by filling it to this point
 with pure water at exactly 4° C, keeping it immersed for some time in a
 large mass of water at this temperature before making the final adjust
 ment to the mark, wiping the outside dry, allowing the whole to acquire
 the temperature of the balance-case, and carefully weighing.        The result
 of this direct calibration, deducting the weight of the vessel, was 59-7323
  grammes or cubic centimetres at 4°.
      (3) It was checked by emptying and drying the vessel, filling it to the
  mark with pure mercury at 0° C., the temperature being secured by keep
  ing the whole surrounded by melting ice long enough to obtain perfect
  steadiness of position of the mercury, and weighing after the tempera
  ture of the balance-case had been regained.            The mercury weighed
  811-9997 grammes.
       (4) The vessel was now surrounded by steam, and the mercury again
  brought to the mark, the temperature actually attained being 99°•5 C. (cor
  rected for pressure).     Allowed to cool down to the temperature of the
   balance-case, and again weighed, the mercury was found =799-7032
   grammes.      From the last two weighings the coefficient of cubical expan
   sion for 1° C. of the glass used was, by the usual formula (taking absolute
   expansion of mercury from 0° to 100 = -018153, as determined by Reg-
   nault), found =-000027346.
       (5) If now the density of mercury at 0° as referred to water at 4° be
   taken at 13-596 (Regnault), the weighing obtained in (3) gives the capa

    (6) The freezing-mixtures used were prepared by cooling commercial
hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. =1140) in the snow out of doors, the tem
perature of which, as well as of the air, was on the first day about
—9° C., but on subsequent days rose to about — 5°, mixing equal weights
of this cooled acid and of snow, using separate portions of this first mixture
to cool more ncid and snow, and finally bringing together these last.
    It soon appeared that little advantage was gained by trying to cool the
snow, on account of its very low conducting-power in such a loose porous
condition ; and in the later experiments the temperature of the acid alone
was lowered before the final mixture with snow.                 The glass vessels con
taining    the  mixtures   were   large enough    to  maintain    the cold required for
a long time, and steadiness of temperature was secured by surrounding
them on all sides with a layer of cotton wadding, kept in place by stiff
brown paper, and by conducting all the operations out of doors in the
unusually cold atmosphere prevailing at the time.
    (7) In determining the temperature of the freezing-mixtures                 an alcohol
thermometer was used, graduated to single degrees, and admitting of half
a degree being read ; but the scale being found by no means accurate, its
absolute readings were altogether discarded.              By comparison with a good
mercurial thermometer at three or four points between — 10° and + 40°
C., and calculation from Is. Pierre's coefficients, the real length of a de
gree on the part of the stem corresponding to —40° was determined ; and
the temperature of fusion of the mercury being accurately noted and as
sumed = — 38°-85 C., as determined by Balfour Stewart*, the addition
or subtraction       of four or five degrees,       as above    obtained, gave all the
other temperatures observed.
    (8) The above weighings and all others to be mentioned were made
with an excellent balance by Becker, carefully adjusted and tested at the
outset.      With a load of a kilogramme in each pan a difference of weight
of -jJj milligramme can be detected, and £ milligramme may be fully re
lied upon.      All weighings were reduced by calculation to the correspond
ing results in vacuo, the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere
being noted on each occasion ; and the results quoted are those thus cor
 rected.
     (9) The specific-gravity flask was now filled with alcohol (at one time
absolute, but which, by long keeping in the laboratory and occasional
 opening of the bottle, had absorbed some moisture, and was really about
 95 or 96 per cent.), and three weighings were obtained after the liquid
 had been carefully       adjusted to the mark at temperatures               close to the
 freezing-point     of mercury   t.

    t The alcohol, as afterwards mercury, was brought to near the required tempera
 ture before introduction into the final freezing-mixture, and a separate small portion in
 a tube was similarly cooled, to be used in filling up to the mark if necessary.        The
 stopper was carefully inserted  as  soon as the adjustment  of  the  liquid was secured, so
 as to  avoid any loss by evaporation.

  the last freezing-mixture, the mercury frozen, and the alcohol brought
  exactly to the mark, taking care that it became and remained quite sta
  tionary, while during the freezing of the mercury the change of volume
  was very rapid and easily observable.                    The temperature having been
  noted when the final adjustment was made, the little flask was set aside,

         Hospital.      Communicated          hy J. S. Btjruon Sanderson,
        M.D., F.R.S., Jodrell Professor of Human Physiology in
         University College, London. Received February 24, 1877.
     The observations described in the following paper had for their object
 the determination      of the form of the reflex or automatic action of the
 sphincter ani of man when voluntary power over it is lost.                This reflex
 action is believed, from the researches of Masius*, to depend on an
 " ano-spinal centre," situated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal
 cord, controlled in health by higher (encephalic) centres.               It appears,
 however, to be very uniform in its character in various conditions, the
 most conspicuous common character of which is the entire loss of
 voluntary power.
      The larger number of observations         were made     on a man who, by a
 violent fall on the sacrum, had apparently injured the posterior roots of
 all the sacral nerves and both roots of the lowest sacral nerves.              A de
 pression existed over the lower part of the sacrum.             Sensibility to touch
 and pain was lost in all parts supplied by branches from the sacral
 plexus, the limitation being exact. There was no muscular paralysis or
 loss of nutrition except in the levator ani, the sphincter ani, and the
 sphincter vesica, all of which were paralyzed to the will.            The anus and
 the mucous membrane of the rectum were quite insensitive.                  There was
  no evidence of any injury to the spinal cord ; with this, indeed, the
  symptoms were incompatible.              It would thus appear that the only
 lesion was a division of the direct communication between the sphincter

and the cord.      Other observations were made on two patients with para
plegia,  due probably to disease of the dorsal region of the spinal cord, in
whom there was reason to believe that the lumbar enlargement of the
cord was free from material      damage.     In   each  case  there was not the
slightest voluntary power to retain the contents of the rectum.            It was
found that in each the condition of the sphincter was essentially the same,
and that it was in a state of high reflex activity.           The most uniform
results were obtained in the case of injury to the sacral nerves.         Finally
these results were compared with those obtained by the same method
when voluntary power was intact.
   The instrument employed was       a small   cylinder of thin india-rubber,
supported at each end on a wooden plug, the anterior extremity of which
was conical, to facilitate its introduction.     The chamber within commu
nicated by means of a flexible tube with the cavity of a tympanum pro
vided with a writing lever, by which the variations in the pressure were
recorded on a revolving drum (Marey's cardiograph).              A small metal
tube passed    through the middle of the cylinder, by which air could be
injected  into  the rectum without disturbing the instrument.          A smaller
instrument, the rubber cylinder of which was only one inch in length,
was used to ascertain the effect produced by different          portions   of the
lower end of the bowel.
   The first fact ascertained   was that  in  each   case, although   the incon
tinence of faeces was complete, the sphincter was habitually in a state of
continuous, slightly varying contraction.       That this tonic state was not
due to the presence of the instrument within the anus is shown from
the fact that   it existed before the introduction      of the instrument,    and
that any irritation of the anus, as by movement of the instrument, pro
duced a well-defined effect of a different character.       The same tonic con
traction is shown in every tracing obtained.        After a disturbance caused
by the introduction of the instrument was over, the pressure continued
nearly the same throughout, being marked only by a few very slight and
irregular variations.
    This continuous contraction was, however, inhibited by any irritation
applied to the mucous membrane of the rectum.             Such an irritation was
readily effected by the injection of a small quantity of air into the rectum.
The result of such an injection is shown in the tracing (fig. 1). A rapid
fall in pressure occurred (a), due to the relaxation of the sphincter, which
was in some cases so complete that the instrument fell out.        After a brief
period of complete relaxation, contraction occurred, at first slight, and
then slowly increasing, indicated by the rise of the lever (5), until the ori
ginal pressure was attained.      In most cases the rise was to a higher point
than the original pressure, and a subsequent slight fall occurred until the
initial pressure was reached.
    When the irritation was produced by a solid body, a slight brief in
crease in the contraction preceded the relaxation of the sphincter.          This

1877.]                 Action of the Sphincter Ani.                           79
was seen, for instance, when the wooden head          of the instrument     was
pressed down upon the sphincter.        The most ready way in which the
effect was produced was by making the patient cough.           This initial con
traction was also very marked on the irritation produced by the intro
duction of the instrument, the invariable effect being the succession of
changes of pressure which are shown in the tracing (fig. 2). The vertical
rise (a) is the effect of the pressure of the sphincter to which the instru
ment is suddenly exposed on its introduction ; the top of this line repre
sents the amount of pressure exerted by the sphincter before the
introduction of the instrument.       This is followed by a slight rise (6),
succeeded by a considerable and rather quick fall (c), which fall is again
succeeded by a rise (d) to a point a little higher than that from which
the lever fell, as in the effect of the injection of air.
    In  the slow rise after this inhibition there was often an indication of
 a tendency to rhythmical action.        In some tracings, especially those
 which show the effect of a cough, this is very distinct (fig. 3).          The
 slight fall (6) immediately after the cough is the result of the movement of
 the instrument lessening the extent to which it is compressed by the

sphincter.    The lower end of this line represents, therefore, the degree
of the previous contraction of the sphincter, and corresponds to the top
of the line (a) in fig. 1. The slight initial rise (c) precedes a considerable
fall (d), and is succeeded by a slow rise, in which there are secondary
waves of rhythmical variation (e e e). No such variation could be traced
in the continuous contraction which followed.
   Goltz* observed that in dogs, after division of the dorsal cord, a
rhythmical action was caused by the presence within the sphincter of any
foreign body.     In man it does not appear that the presence of an unirri-
tating foreign body within the anus, provided it is kept still, constitutes
stimulation   or excites any reflex action.         No rhythmical variations were,
as a rule, observed in the tonic contraction.           In one case of disease of the
dorsal spinal cord, however, the mere presence of the instrument caused
sometimes a lengthened inhibition, at the end of which some rhyth
mical contraction occurred.         But it was found that, in every case, the
continuous    injection of a jet of air into the rectum developed, very
uniformly, a rhythmical action. The rapid fall which occurred imme
diately after the commencement of the injection was succeeded by a
rather quick rise, followed by another fall, and then a corresponding rise,
and so on in successive alternations.          Thus a continuous series of nearly
uniform curves was obtained (figs. 4, 5, 6). The height reached by the
lever in these variations was in some instances the same as that qf its
continuous contraction, but in other cases it was less high.               The cause
of the rhythmical variation appeared to be, in part at least, thealternating
accumulation of the air within and its escape from the rectum during the
contraction and relaxation of the sphincter, the accumulation causing the
inhibition of the sphincter, which permitted the escape of air. A differ
ence noticeable in the form of these curves will be considered in speaking
of their duration.
   In some instances the rhythmical action was long in being developed,
the first effect of the continuous injection being a complete inhibition of
considerable length, succeeded by the intermitting contractions.
   Goltz observed that     a powerful sensory impression on the hind legs of
a dog inhibited   the rhythmical contractions of the sphincter.           In the case
of injury to the sacral nerves no such inhibition could be obtained by
strong faradic stimulation of the skin of the lower part of the abdomen,
on which sensation was intact.
   The effects of a voluntary effort, a sigh, and a cough were observed to
ascertain if there was any consentaneous contraction of the sphincter ;
but none could be observed.
   Careful measurements were made of the duration of the several events
in the reflex action above described.
   On every form of stimulation it was found that a period elapsed after
the commencement of the stimulation              before there was any change in

the degree of contraction.          After an injection of air, as nearly instan
taneous    as   could   be,   the  latent  period amounted on one occasion to
 1*3 second.     After a cough it varied from "8 to 1*2 second, the average
 of five measurements being just 1 second. The latent period after the
 introduction of the instrument, before the initial rise, varied from 1 to
 1-5 second.
    The initial rise, when      it occurred, was very uniform in its duration.
 After   the   cough   it  varied   from 1-1 to 1*5 second ; four out of six
 measurements were exactly 1-5 second. After the introduction of the
 instrument, the initial rise, in four measurements, lasted 1*3, 1*5, l-5,
and 2 seconds respectively, the mean of the whole being very nearly 1*5
 second. In the cases of disease of the cord the initial rise after the in
 troduction    of the instrument was rather longer, lasting 2 seconds.
    The duration of the subsequent fall varied considerably.              After the
 introduction of the instrument it varied from 3 to 4-5 seconds, three out
 of five observations being exactly 4 seconds.             After a cough the fall
 occupied from 3*5 to 5-5 seconds. The mean of all the measurements of
 the fall caused by the mechanical stimulation of the instrument (on cough
 and introduction) was 4*2 seconds.            It was found that the more con
 siderable the fall the longer was its duration.          Thus a slight fall caused
 by traction on the instrument (not included in the above average) lasted
just 3 seconds.      The initial rise did not exhibit this relation ; in the last
 case it lasted 1*5 second, while the period of latent stimulation was
exactly 1 second. In the case of disease of the cord the duration of
the fall was 5 or 6 seconds.
    The subsequent rise always occupied a much longer period than the
preceding fall, varying in duration from 10 to 17 seconds.             Only in one
instance was it less than 10 seconds, and in that the rise was imperfect
and was succeeded by a second fall. The mean of thirteen measurements
of the rise after all forms of stimulation, in the case of injury to the
nerves, was 13-5 seconds. In the case of disease of the cord it was some
what longer, varying from 17 to 30 seconds.
    The rhythmical variations which in some cases occurred during the rise
(fig. 3) were from 4 to 4*5 seconds in duration, and, in the case of injury
to the sacral nerves, were very uniform. As there was no corresponding
variation in the stimulation, they must be regarded as the expression
of a spontaneous rhythm in the action of the sphincter.
    The length of the rhythmical contractions which resulted from a con
tinuous injection of air varied considerably, and, as already mentioned,
the form of the curves obtained also varied.           Some (in each case) were
of considerable length, lasting from        12  to  17 seconds.   In these the fall
was much steeper than the rise (figs. 4 and 6).            These curves resembled
in this the curve which        was   obtained   on  any sudden stimulation, and
appeared    to  be merely   a  series  of such   curves, resulting from the inter
mitting inhibition consequent on the alternate accumulation and escape
    VOL. XXVI.                                                          G

  82                     Dr. W. R. Gowers on the Automatic                       [Mar. 15,
  of air.       But on some occasions curves were obtained of a different
  form and shorter duration (fig. 5).                    The descent corresponded in
  inclination with the ascent.           The  duration     of each period in the rhythm
  was nearly 9 seconds.           It is to be noted that this is just double the
  length of the spontaneous rhythmical Variations in the case of the rise
  after the mechanical stimulation by a cough &c. These more regular curves
  would appear, then, from their curve and duration, to be the more direct
  effect of the tendency on the part of the sphincter to rhythmical                   action
  under the influence of the continuous stimulation*.
       The longest complete inhibition under               a continuous     injection of air
  lasted 30 seconds. It is evident that this might easily have been mis
  taken for permanent relaxation.
       A comparison of these results with the action of the sphincter ani
   under normal conditions corroborated the conclusion which Masius and
   Goltz drew from their observation upon dogs, that the reflex action and
   tendency to rhythmical variations is modified and controlled by the higher
   encephalic centre.         No variation in the uniform contraction of the
   sphincter resulted from either the introduction of the instrument or from
   its movement by        a cough.     Inhibition of contraction could, however, be
   readily produced by an injection of air into the rectum.                  No initial rise
   was observed under any circumstances              :   the  inhibition continued during
   the whole period of a short injection of air, and on the cessation of the
   injection the pressure quickly rose to its original height. The duration
   of the several parts of the action differed little from that observed in the
   other cases.       A latent period of 1•5 second was succeeded by a fall of
   5 seconds' duration, a period of complete inhibition of 6 seconds, and a
   subsequent rise which occupied 11 seconds.
        As far as could be ascertained, the internal sphincter was alone con-
'
   cerned in this reflex action.          The external sphincter appeared to be in
   each case relaxed.
        In the case of injury to the sacral nerves the direct communication
   between the sphincter and the cord must have been interrupted ; the
   reflex action,    if from the cord, can only           have    taken place through the
   sympathetic nerves.          It is a point for future investigation, suggested by
   certain points of resemblance between the reflex action of the sphincter
   and that of the uterus, the intestine, and the heart, whether its action is
       * The  immediate   cause  of the intermitting   inhibition, no doubt, was in each case
   the intermitting rectal stimulation ; but the greater    uniformity of ascent and descent,
   the resemblance in form of these causes to those which were undoubtedly spontaneous,
   suggests that the tendency to rhythmical relaxation determined the time and form of
   its occurrence in this case (fig. 5), whereas the longer curves, with steeper fall,
   were determined more directly by tho reflex inhibitory impressions. It is to be noted
   that the latter often exhibited small secondary waves (as in fig. 6, a a), resembling the
   spontaneous waves (fig. 3, e e) in their uniform curve ; while the regular waves (as in
   fig. 4) never exhibited these smaller waves of ultimate rhythm, as they might be called.

entirely dependent on the ano-spinal centre in the cord, and also by what
mechanism the encephalic centre exerts its influence.
   I would,however, draw especial attention to the points of resemblance
between this   reflex action of the internal sphincter and that of the
middle coat of the intestine in peristaltic action, which suggest the proba
 bility that the action of the sphincter, apart from the will, is under the con
 trol of a similiar mechanism, and is indeed only, so to speak, a concentrated
and more specialized instance of the action of the transverse fibres of the
intestine.    The action of the intestine, as well as that of the sphincter,
is under central control, being inhibited by the vagus, intensified by the
 splanchnics. The deliberate character of the reflex action of the sphincter
resembles closely the deliberate character of the intestinal reflex.
    Increased intestinal contraction, like that of the sphincter, is excited
most readily by irritation of the mucous membrane.             Moreover Goltz
believed that in dogs the muscular coat of the rectum participated in
the rhythmical contraction which he observed in the sphincter ; and my
own observations have shown that the reflex action         I have described is
not confined to the thickened extremity of the bowel, but can be obtained
in a modified form as high as two inches from the lower extremity.
   The power of reflex action which is possessed by the whole internal
sphincter must be possessed by each bundle of muscular fibres of which
it is composed. As the sphincter may be regarded as an aggregation of
bundles of fibres, such as are contained in the transverse muscular coat of
the intestine, so the latter may be regarded as a serial arrangement of the
bundles of which the internal sphincter is composed. An action of each
bundle    of fibres   so arranged,     such as we have     to occur in the
                                                         seen
sphincter as a    whole, must result in peristalsis, in the movement of a
contained and stimulating   body along the intestine.  If each bundle of
fibres passes through the same series of successive contractions and re
laxations as the sphincter ani, then the curve traced by the action of the
latter will represent not merely the condition of one bundle of fibres in
successive intervals of time, but also the condition of successive bundles
at the same time, and two such curves in apposition will represent a
diagrammatic longitudinal section of the intestinal wall. The effect,
therefore, of the presence in the intestine of a mass of faces or other
contents would be to cause, first, in the moderately contracted intestinal
wall in front of      it,
                     an increased contraction, the effect of which would
be to prevent the diffusion   of the contents along the intestine (which
would   materially             with their movement); secondly, complete
                       interfere
relaxation of the next portion of the intestinal wall into which the contents
of the intestine could pass and thirdly,
                                   ;            astrong contraction behind,
sustained, and moving on the stimulating body, as the initial contraction
gave place to relaxation.      The process would no doubt be materially
modified   bythe contraction of the longitudinal fibres of the bowel, which
would prevent the undue distension of the relaxed portion, and thus assist
                                                                a

of the instrument in the anus, after the effect of its introduction had
passed off, was the source of no stimulation, just as contents may be at
rest within the bowel, and if they are not moved, and do not irritate the
mucous membrane, may excite no peristaltic action.

 V. "Description               of the Process of Verifying Thermometers at
         the Kew Observatory." By Francis Galton, F.R.S. Re
         ceived March 1, 1877.
    It   may be of interest to describe the method recently adopted at the
 Kew Observatory of verifying thermometers by comparison at different
 temperatures with a standard instrument, since a large proportion of the
 various thermometrical              determinations made by English physicists are
 dependent        for    their   accuracy    upon that of the verifications at Kew.
 Many thousands of thermometers have already been verified by the
 apparatus about to be described.
    Up to the year 1875 the apparatus for this                        purpose     at the     Kew
 Observatory was of the rudest character.
     It   was simply a glass jar           9j inches wide and        18    inches deep,     filled

1877.]               Thermometers         at the Kew Observatory.                             85
with hot water and standing on                a turntable,   in which a brass frame was
placed.
   The thermometers were attached to this framework, and the observer
having well agitated the water with a plunger, read the instruments in
succession through the glass as he turned the jar round before him,
reading each thermometer as it passed. He first turned it round from
right to left, and thenback again from left to right.  Each thermometer
was thus read twice, and the mean of the pair of readings was taken.
It is obvious that if the rate of cooling of the water be uniform, and if
the thermometers are observed at precisely equal intervals, the mean of
every pair of observations would be strictly referable to the temperature
of the water at the same moment of time, namely, to that which is half
way between the beginning and end of the entire set.      It is needless to
point out that these conditions can never be strictly fulfilled, although,
notwithstanding the imperfection of the process and the coarseness of the
apparatus, the observers acquired much certainty and skill in its mani
pulation.   Still the time occupied was unnecessarily great, and the chance-
of error, owing to variations in the rate of cooling of the water, was
larger than it need be. Partly owing to this latter reason, and partly to-
the fact that the number of thermometers sent to be tested has con
siderably increased (being now not less than 3000 annually),     thought        I
it advisable to design and propose to my colleagues of the Kew Committee
the construction of an instrument of a much more substantial and ade
quate character ; and to this the Committee assented.                I
                                                        was subsequently
indebted for many suggestions     to Mr. De La  Eue,  and also to Mr. E..
Munro, of 24 Clerkenwell Green, London, by whom it was finally made..
It  has now been at work for two years, and its performance is quite
satisfactory ; experience has in the mean time suggested a few emendations-,
and simplifications,     and   I    will therefore describe the instrument                as at
present in use.
  The apparatus (see figs. 1 & 2) consists essentially of four parts                  :   —
     (1) A water- vessel.
     (2) An agitator, worked by a handle on the outside..
     (3) An external heating arrangement.
     (4) A frame on which to hang the thermometers,                          turned       by a
          handle on the outside.
                              (1) The Water-vessel.
  This is a    cylinder of stout copper, 2 ft. 2 in. high and           ft. in diameter.
                                                                         1
In its base there is    a central aperture through                which the concentric
vertical axes are passed, which respectively carry the agitator and the
thermometer frame ; the top of* the cylinder is entirely open ; a vertical
slit, 1 ft. 10 in. long and    in. wide,
                                   4>J     cut in the side of the cylinder

and the slit   is   glazed with    a     stout sheet of plate-glass, the joints being
made water- and steam-tight              by means of india-rubber packing.

     The cylinder is placed inside                   a wooden box,   taller than itself, and        1    ft.
5 in. square at its base, the space between it and the sides of the box
being filled with sawdust, whilst the exterior of the box is completely
covered with kamptulicon, in order to retain the heat of the water in
the enclosed vessel as much as possible.   An aperture somewhat larger
than that in the cylinder is cut in the side of the box in front of                               it,   and
is   also glazed with plate-glass.
     A lid, containing    inches of sawdust, covered with

tulicon, can              tightly
                       be shut    down on the top of the cylinder and box, the
escape        of the vapour given off during heating being provided for                                  by
means of a steam-pipe.
   Pipes lead from the top and bottom of the water-vessel to an exterior
pipe ending in a funnel above and     cock below, so that water may be

     The whole         is   firmly fixed to      a    stout wooden stand about        2   ft. high.

     cluster of Bunsen burners being placed beneath the coil serves to
heat    and to make the water circulate inside the cylinder, thus warming
         it

   Experiment shows that, with the small coil used, 10 gallons of cold
water can be boiled in about six hours from the time of lighting the gas                                 ;

   is shown by dotted lines in the drawing.        A cock at the lower end of
   the coil permits of the stoppage of the circulation of the water through
   the pipe.
                             (4) The Thermometer Frame.
       The thermometers to be compared are hung side by side round the
   circumference of two brass rings, 10| in. in diameter, that are attached
   to the side rods of a cylindrical frame.      The thermometers are held in
   their places against the ring by spring clips, one of which is shown full
   size in fig. 4, and one of the rings is shown in fig. 3 ; the latter slide up and
   down the brass rods that form the sides of the cylindrical framework,
   and are clamped at such a distance apart as may best suit the ther
   mometer under examination.
      Forty thermometers can be suspended at a time. The bottom of the
  frame is provided with six rollers — three placed radially, for the purpose
   of guiding it up and down the interior of the water-vessel ; and three
  tangentially and projecting below the base, in order to support the
   frame whilst putting on or taking off the thermometers.            This operation
  is performed when the frame is standing on the closed lid of the box, a
  circular brass ring being screwed to the lid to prevent the frame running
  off when being turned round by the operator.
      The top of the frame consists of spokes radiating from a hollow
  socket that drops over the end of an upright steel rod, which, passing
  through the axis of the agitator, projects above it (see fig. 2). A plug is
  then screwed into the top of this rod and clamps the frame, which is
  supported by it ; the frame, with the thermometers, can then be rotated
  in the water by turning this rod. This turning is effected from the out
  side through a wheel fixed to its projecting lower extremity, into
 which an endless screw, driven by a crank in front of the apparatus,
 is geared.        The observer, facing the glazed slit, can bring the ther
  mometers hung round the frame before him one by one as quickly as
 he likes.
      For the convenience of moving the thermometer frame into and out of
 the water-vessel, a cord is carried over the apparatus round pulleys, as
 seen in fig. 1, so that the attendant can hook its end to the ring at the
 top of the frame, and twist or lower it with the greatest facility.
     The general character of the process of comparison is to turn down
the gas and to close circulation in the pipe by turning the stopcock ; the
water is then agitated, and is afterwards left at rest until the set is
finished.     The thermometer frame is turned once round forwards and
once backwards in each process of comparison, each instrument being
read off twice, the mean of the two being the result aimed at.
     Mr. Whipple, the Superintendent of the Observatory, has made at my
request a large number of experiments on the variations of temperature
uuder different      conditions,  and on other matters relating to the working

of the apparatus.      It  will be sufficient  if I give a few   summary tables of
the results.
   The mean variation of temperature during a double process of com
paring each of twenty sets of thermometers, each set averaging nineteen
instruments, and each instrument being read four times, was as follows : —
    Temperature at which the  1

   The extreme variation of 0°-30 occurred in one case, and that of 0°-25
in three cases.
   It takes about four minutes to read a complete set of ordinary
thermometers.
   The rate of heating by gas, and of cooling after the gas has been
wholly turned off, is of course much affected by the temperature of the
air of the room ; it may be roughly taken as follows : — .
    When the water in the vessel is about ...    45°      100°      150°  200°
    Bise of temperature in 5 minutes when  1
                                               2°-80     2°-26     l°-95  l°-45

   The rate of cooling is much reduced when the process consists in first
raising the water to the highest required temperature, and then cooling
it by successive additions of cold water. The heat of the stuffing that
surrounds     the vessel being thus much higher than the water it contains,
 keeps  it at an equable temperature.
   The temperature of the water in the vessel, after agitating it and
allowing it to settle, differs somewhat at different levels ; this is due to
the impossibility of securing perfect intermixture and to the variations of
the temperature of the stuffing in respect to that of the water.                The
greatest differences observed between a thermometer whose bulb was
immersed 2 inches below the level of the water and one that was im
mersed 19 inches was 0°-68.

I. " On       Stratified Discharges. — IV. Stratified and Unstratified
        Forms of the Jar-Discharge."             By William Spottiswoode,
        M.A., Treas.R.S. Received March 7, 1877.
    It is well known that if a Leyden jar be discharged through a vacuum-
tube, the discharge generally takes the form of an unbroken column of
light, extending from the point of the positive terminal to the hilt of the
negative, i. e. to the extreme negative end of the tube, and that it shows
no trace of either negative glow or intervening dark space.                On the
other hand     I have found, by experiments with a large Leyden battery,
that if a tube have one terminal connected with the negatively charged
coating of the battery and the other held beyond striking-distance from
the positively charged coating, the discharge in the tube will show a
separation of the positive from the negative part by a dark intervening
space.     Under suitable circumstances of exhaustion it will also show
striae,  in the same manner as when the discharge is effected directly with
a Holtz machine, having the conductors either closed or open beyond
striking-distance     (see Roy. Soc. Proceedings, vol. xxiii. p. 460).      Again,
I    have found, with the same battery, that if the tube be connected
otherwise as before, and held at a distance less than at first, but a little
greater than striking-distance, a stratified discharge much more brilliant
 and more like that produced by a coil will be exhibited.             It should be
remarked that the latter form of discharge appears to the unassisted eye,
in the cases which      I have examined, as an unbroken column of light, but
with    a negative glow and dark space.        A  revolving   mirror, however, re
solves the column        into a regular    array of striae, having a rapid proper
 motion towards the positive terminal.
   •
     The transition from the first to the second of these forms, and from
the second to the jar-discharge proper when the tube was brought within
 striking-distance, was, if not absolutely abrupt, at all events so rapid
 that this form of experiment gave no prospect of following one form
 into the other. With a view to examining the transition as closely as
 possible a Holtz machine was employed, and the jars having been taken
 off, a pair of mica plates partially covered with tinfoil was used in their
 stead.     By sliding one plate over the other, so that more or less of

1877.]       Mr. W. Spottiswoode          on  Stratified Discharges.            91
the covered parts were brought face to face, a jar was formed the
size of which could be varied at pleasure.           An air-spark of adjustable
length was also introduced into the circuit between the machine and the
tube.
   This arrangement     was subsequently replaced by the following, which
in  some respects proved more convenient          :— A battery of one or more
jars was used in the place of the mica plates.            The outside of this bat
tery  and  one terminal   of  the   tube  were   connected with the earth ; and
the inside and the other terminal were alternately connected with the
positive   conductor  of the machine, so that the battery was alternately
charged and discharged through the tube. The amount of charge was
regulated partly by the distance through which the conductors of the
machine were separated, and partly by the number of revolutions of the
machine during which the charging took place. It was consequently in
dependent of the absolute time of contact.           It will be observed that this
arrangement did not give the same opportunity of a continuous variation
of jar surface as the first ; but, on the other hand, the changes of phase
in the phenomenon due to increments of charge were capable of indefinite
diminution by shortening the distance between the conductors of the
machine and by increasing the number of the jars.
   The first object proposed was to ascertain whether               a jar could be
charged with     so small   a  quantity    of  electricity  as of itself to give a
stratified discharge in a  tube ; in other words, whether the resistance of
the tube itself, if resistance   it  be, could   by a suitable charge of jar be
made to insure a stratified discharge.        For this purpose a jar was charged
with small sparks from the machine, and discharged after receiving
charges of 1, 2, 3, &c. sparks in succession.              The experiment proved
successful with a coal-gas tube at a pressure of about 4 millims. : charges
of three sparks gave bright flake-like stratifications ; higher charges gave
a discharge with a positive column, a negative glow, and a dark space,
although the stria) were not always discernible.             But when the charge
exceeded 5 or 6 sparks, the positive column advanced so far as to obli
terate the dark space, and ultimately made its way to the hilt of the
terminal.
   Similar experiments were made with both forms                  of instrumental
arrangement, and with tubes containing different gases            and at different
pressures.
   A number of tubes tried with various amounts of battery-charge, but
with the same surface, showed that, as the charge was increased, the head
of the positive column advanced towards the negative terminal, the dark
space became narrower, and the glow contracted in dimensions; and
when the head of the column drew very near to the negative terminal,
the glow, instead of covering the whole surface of the terminal, formed a
small drop at the point.          On still further increasing the charge, the
drop withdrew to the hilt of the terminal ; and finally, when it had com

92          Mr. W. Spottiswoode        on Stratified Discharges.       [Mar. 22,
pletely retreated into the hilt, the continuous or true jar-discharge took
place.
   With a view to testing experimentally how far the effects here de
scribed were due to quantity and how far to tension, the size of the jar
was altered, all other circumstances remaining the same.             It was then
found not only, as before, that small charges gave stratified and large
mist ratified discharges, but also that the maximum charge compatible
with stratification was greater with a large than with a small jar.
   As   a  further experiment in this direction, a series of jars were arranged
in   cascade  ; and it was found that the greater the number of jars so
arranged, the smaller the charge necessary to insure a true jar-discharge.
A charge insufficient to destroy stratification with one jar was sufficient
to destroy them when more than one was used in cascade.             These results
point to tension rather than to quantity as the determining cause of the
character of the discharge.
   In fact, having taken a number of jars of the same size, and having
ascertained the maximum charge with which one jar could be charged
without obliterating stratification, say, "the critical charge,"         I found
that the critical charge for 2, 3, .     . . jars arranged   for  quantity was 2,
3, . . . times that for a single jar ; and, on the other hand, that the
critical charge for 2, 3 . . . jars arranged in series was 1 : 2, 1 : 3, . . .
of that for a single jar. The illumination, however, was always greater
with the larger charges, i. e. with the greater quantity of electricity dis
charged.
   The experiments      above described were made      first with tubes in which
the pressure was moderately high.          They were afterwards repeated with
lower pressures,    and  results of the same   character as before were obtained.
But, owing to the smaller amount of the critical charges, to the greater ex
tension of the negative glow, and to the consequently increased delicacy
of the phenomena, the       same numerical precision was not attained.        But
there seems no reason to doubt that the discrepancies might be indefinitely
diminished by instrumental refinements.
   The duration of the stratified discharges observed throughout these
experiments was exceedingly short, indistinguishable, in fact, from that of
the true jar-discharge.       When viewed in a revolving mirror, either with
or without a slit, they showed no sign whatever of prolonged duration ;
and we may thence conclude that, so far as our present instrumental
arrangements extend, there is no inferior limit to the duration of dis
charge necessary for the production of stri®.
    In connexion with this part of the subject another form of experiment
 was arranged.       Beside   the jars hitherto described another was used,
 having its inner surface connected with one terminal of the tube, and its
 outer with the other.      When this disposition was made, the additional
 jar  acted as a buffer, and produced a stratified discharge under circum
 stances which would without it have produced a true jar-discharge.

    A  comparison of the results here obtained with those detailed in Part
II.  of these researches shows that the phenomena produced by suitable
disposition of the Leyden battery coincide with those produced by the
induction-coil.     With the coil it was found that (1) for    a given electro
motive force the column      of  strite was shorter the larger the battery-
surface or strength of current       used ; (2) that the proper motion, when
directed, as usual, towards the positive terminal, was more rapid the
greater the electromotive force employed.         With the Leyden battery it
was found that (1) in order to maintain the same length of column with
an increased surface, the charge must be increased in a larger proportion
than the surface ; and (2) it was noticed that the strioe, which when the
tension was low were distinct and well separated, became more blurred
as the tension rose, until they sometimes were blended into an apparently
unbroken column of light. The presence, however, of the negative glow
still showed that the true jar-discharge had not yet been reached.

                                   (Abstract.)
    The common belief regarding friction, which is     based on the researches
of Coulomb and Morin, is that between surfaces in motion the friction
 is independent of the velocity, but that the force required to start the
 sliding is (in some cases at least) greater than the force required to over
 come friction during motion; in other words, the static coefficient is
 usually considered to be greater than the kinetic.         It occurred to the
 authors that there might possibly be continuity between the two kinds of
 friction, instead of an abrupt change at the instant in which motion
 begins. We should thus expect that when the relative motion of the sur
 faces is very slow there will be a gradual increase of friction as the velocity
 diminishes.     Whether any such increase takes place at very low speeds
 is left an open question by the experiments of Coulomb and Morin, whose
 methods did not enable definite measurements of the friction to be made
 when the velocity was exceedingly small.        The authors have succeeded
 in measuring the friction between surfaces moving with as low a velocity
 as one five-thousandth of a foot per second, and have found that in cer
 tain cases there is decided increase in the coefficient of friction as the
 velocity diminishes.
    The apparatus made use of consisted of a cast-iron disk 2 feet in
 diameter and weighing 86-2 lbs., supported on a steel axle whose ends
  were less than one tenth of an inch in diameter.      These ends were sup
  ported in bearings which consisted of rectangular      notches cut in pieces

of the material whose friction against steel was to be measured. The
disk was caused to revolve and then left to itself, when it came to rest
in consequence of the friction on the ends of the axle. The rate of
retardation was found as follows : — A strip of paper 2\ inches broad was
stretched round the periphery of the disk, and a pendulum was caused to
swing across this paper in a plane perpendicular to that of the disk. On
the pendulum was fastened a fine glass siphon, one end of which dipped
into a box containing ink, whilst the other stood at a short distance from
the paper strip, across which it was carried as the pendulum oscillated.
By keeping the ink-box strongly electrified ink was deposited on the paper
by the point of the siphon in a rapid succession of fine spots. By this
means, without the introduction of any new source of friction, a per
manent record w as made of the resultant motion of the pendulum and
the revolving disk. This frictionless method of recording was designed
by Sir William Thomson for telegraphic purposes, and is employed in his
siphon recorder.   From the curve drawn in this way it was easy to
determine the rate of retardation of the disk (and therefore the friction)
corresponding to various velocities of the rubbing surfaces.   The lowest
velocity for which the determinations were  definite was about 0'0002 foot
per second, and the highest velocity to which the experiments extended
was 0-01 foot per second. The surfaces examined were steel on steel, steel
on brass, steel on agate, steel on beech, and steel on greenheart —in each
case under the three conditions, dry, oiled, and wet with water. In the cases
steel on beech oiled or wet     with water, and steel on greenheart oiled or
wet  with  water,  the coefficient of friction increased as the velocity dimi
nished between the two limits given above, the increase amounting to
about twenty per cent, of the lower value. It appeared that at the
higher limit of velocity there was little further tendency to change in
the coefficient ; but it is impossible to say how much additional change
might take place between the lower limit of the velocity and rest. In
the case of steel on agate wet with water there was a similar but much
less marked increase of friction as the velocity decreased ; and in the
case of steel on steel oiled there was a slight and somewhat uncertain
change of the opposite character — that      is,
                                               decrease of friction as the
                                                   a
velocity decreased.  This  case, however, would  require further examina
tion. In all other cases the friction seemed to be perfectly constant and
independent of the velocity.    Out of all the sets of circumstances inves
tigated, the only ones in which there was a large difference between the
static and kinetic values of the coefficient of friction were those in which
a   decided increase   was   observed in the kinetic value as the speed
decreased.    This result renders    exceedingly probable that there
                                    it                               con

tinuity between the two kinds of friction.

1877.]           On Magnetic Observations at Kerguelen.                  95
III.    " Magnetic Observations     at   Kerguelen."     By the Kev. S.   J.
             Perry, S.J., F.R.S.     Received March 15, 1877.
    The Government expedition to Kerguelen Island for the observation
of the Transit of Venus on December 8th, 1874, presented a very favour
able opportunity for the accurate determination of the magnetic elements
of an important station in the South-Indian Ocean, and one which will
at most be visited only at distant intervals for the purpose of scientific
investigations.    When, therefore,    I heard of my appointment to that
station,   I at once brought the question of terrestrial magnetism under
the   notice of the Astronomer Royal, and he readily agreed to my pro
posal of taking a complete set of magnetic instruments to Kerguelen, and
of making any observations that would not interfere with the main object
of our expedition.
                                                                 I
    Being in charge of the whole Kerguelen party of observers, could not
expect to be able to devote much time personally to the magnetic work ;
but the Rev. W. Sidgreaves, whom long experience, both at the Stony-
hurst Observatory and during our magnetic survey of France in 1868
and 1869, had made perfectly conversant with all the details both of
 instruments and observations connected with terrestrial magnetism, had
 already been placed on the staff of astronomical observers for Kerguelen.
 The assistance of a very efficient observer being thus secured, the next
 step was to procure the necessary instruments.        Fortunately I  experi
 enced no difficulty in this matter, as the authorities at Kew immediately
 placed at my disposal a Jones unifilar and a Barrow dip-circle.       There
 was no question of the want of a good chronometer, as the astronomers
 were to be supplied with nine of these, besides the eight reserved exclu
 sively for longitude connexions, which remained always undisturbed in
  their quiet berth on shipboard.
     It was at first proposed by Sir Edward Sabine that we should take a
  series of magnetic observations at sea during our voyage from England
  to the Capo of Good Hope and thence to Kerguelen, and a special
  instrument was ready for the purpose ; but as it was finally arranged
  that we should perform the first part of our journey in the mail-steamer,
  it was thought advisable by the Hydrographer of the Admiralty to relin
  quish all idea of taking magnetic observations at sea.
     The land instruments were made use of on almost every available
  occasion, both at Kerguelen and during our journey ; but     I will confine
  myself in this paper to the Kerguelen results, reserving the other obser
  vations for a separate communication.
     The constants for the temperature-correction,      and for other data
  regarding the magnets employed, were kindly determined for me by
  Mr. Whipple at Kew.
      No correction for error of graduation of deflection-bar was found

No. 3 =2'-3. This was again tested at the Cape of Good Hope, and
found to be 2' 16"-7. The same magnet had for its induction- coefficient
0,0002204, and its dimensions of inertia were the following: — Length
0-31736 foot, diameter 0-032681 foot, and weight 979-127 grains.

    Our chief astronomical station at Kerguelen was Observatory Bay, a
little to the south of the north-west corner of Royal Sound, its approxi
mate latitude being 49° 25' ll"-9 S., and its longitude 4" 39m 34"-3 E.
of Greenwich.       At
                    this station a long series of observations of the dip,
horizontal   force, and declinationwere taken during our four months'
stay. The trips undertaken for the establishment of our two secondary
stations at Swain's Haulover and at Thumb Peak, and also for the longi
tude connexions, afforded opportunities of observing the magnetic elements
at the second and third British stations, as well as at that of the Americans
at Molloy Point. The existence of a magnetic observatory at the German
station rendered unnecessary any further observations at Betsy Cove. A
brick pier was erected on a solid foundation at Observatory Bay for the
magnetic instruments,            and most of the observations were made on this
spot.

  The station at Swain's Haulover was six or seven miles to the south
of Observatory Bay, and Thumb Peak about the same distance due east
of the Haulover. At Thumb Peak there was only time to observe with
a single needle the weather, too, was bad, and the spot chosen not very
                ;
favourable, being on the shingle near the water's edge. The readings on
January 30th were taken on the rocks near the landing cove. The last
observation at Observatory Bay was made near the top of the rock over
hanging the dwelling, and in    rather unsteady position

   The probable error of the mean value of the intensity is thus reduced
from +0-0126 to +0-0035; we may therefore consider 11-1431 as the
adopted value of the total force for January 1st, 1875.
                            The Magnetic Declination.
   The advantage of a fixed observatory enabled us to determine with
great exactness the direction of the astronomical meridian, and to connect
the position of the magnetic pier with the sites of the astronomical instru
ments.      On January 28th and on February 5th observations of the sun
were taken with an excellent transit theodolite made expressly for the
expedition by Messrs. Troughton and Sitnms.                 The results give the
following values for the azimuth of a well-defined point on the Prince of
 Wales's Foreland,     some ten miles distant   : —

 The resulting azimuth of the Foreland would therefore be 95° 18' 21"-38
 E. of the north point. The correctness of this angle, on which all the
 declinations depend, was tested by a series of measurements connecting
the azimuth of the Foreland      (F) with the azimuth mark (m) of the great
 theodolite,  a most accurate instrument,     especially designed by Sir G-. B.

tn from     P    and  H the following values of                the angle m were found — 7 18",
7' 26", 7' 20", 7' 37", 7' 28", 7' 14", giving as a mean 7' 25".                                        This,
applied    to    the  azimuth       of    m  from      H  (which      was   accurately       known      from
daily readings to be 55° 41' 12"), made the azimuth                                        of    m  from P
 =55° 33' 47".          The angle         m  P F was then        found by repeated measures to
be 39° 44' 22", which gave as a final                     result     the angle     FPN        =95° 18' 9".
As this is almost identical with the value obtained above from direct
solar observations, we can adopt the mean of the two, viz. 95° 18' 15",
as the azimuth of the Foreland ; and thus we have only to take the
bearing of the magnet with respect to this point in order to obtain the
results included in the subjoined Table.

1877.]              Magnetic Observations at Kerguelen.                    101
     The declination magnet used throughout these observations was inca
pable of rapid reversion ; and therefore the zero of the scale was tested
carefully by several reversions previous to our departure from the island,
and it was found to be 53*9.       A very favourable series of reversions at
Cape-Town Observatory had previously given 54-2 as the zero division.
     The above readings of the declination show an absolute maximum of
35° 57' 12" at 10 a.m. on February 11th, and a minimum of 35° 39' 33"
at 2.45 p.m. on February 6th ; the range, therefore, for the month, as far
as observed, is 17' 39", and the mean declination =35° 48' 22" -5.          The
daily means give a slightly larger W. declination, with a range of only
10' 12" for the whole series of observations.
     Nothing more of course than the very roughest idea can be formed of
the diurnal range from the few observations taken ; but there is some
evidence at least of an easterly movement of the needle between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m., followed by a westerly motion that continued till 7 p.m. The
greatest mean velocity of the magnet was about 3' 40" per hour at 2 p.m. ;
 but the velocity once reached 8' an hour, viz. at 10 a.m., during the dis
 turbance on February 11th. As there are many disturbing causes that
 probably aSect the earth's magnetism as a whole, it may not be irrelevant
 to remark that an examination of the Stonyhuret magnetograms on
 all the days occurring in the above Table of Declinations shows that
 February 11th was the only disturbed day in England, and that, with the
 exception of a slight tremulous motion of the needle on November 13th
  and 14th, on December 10th, and on February 8th, the observing days
  were remarkably quiet.
      Besides the series of observations      taken at Observatory Bay, other
  determinations of the declination       were made at Swain's Haulover, at
  Thumb Peak, and at Molloy Point        ; but as some doubt still remains to
  be cleared up respecting the errors      and   rates of the chronometers em
  ployed in the sun observations,    I will defer the publication of the results
  until this essential point is satisfactorily settled.
      Previous to these observations, taken in connexion with the Govern
  ment Transit-of- Venus Expedition, the only magnetic observations at
  Kerguelen on record, if we except any possible results obtained by Captain
  Cook in the last century, are those of Sir J. Boss in 1840 and of H.M.S.
   '            '
     Challenger    in 1874. The values contained in Sir Edward Sabine's
  " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnestism, No. XI." (Phil. Trans. 1868),
   furnish the data necessary for a comparison with our present work.
      Adopting 71° 56' 28" for the dip of the south end of the needle at
   Observatory Bay on January 1st, 1875, and comparing this value with
   the observation of Sir J. Boss in 1840, after correcting the dip of — 70°-0
   at Christmas Harbour by — 0o,4 for change of station to Boyal Sound,
   we find a secular variation of about — 2'*7.      But if we consult the Table
   of numerical coefficients deduced from all the collected observations, and
   take the value of the dip in 1840 for the station whose longitude is 70° E.

and latitude 50° S., which was approximately our position at Observatory-
Bay, we obtain a secular variation of — 2'-3. We may therefore fairly
conclude that — 2'-5 represents the annual change with considerable
accuracy.
   Passing from the dip to the total force we find 11-323 to be in British
units the mean of three determinations from observations made on shore
                         '

                 Erebus    and  '
                                  Terror.' If, now, we apply the correction
 + 0-1 for the change from Christmas Harbour to Royal Sound, the result
is still somewhat less than the mean of the observations taken near the
eastern extremity of Kerguelen during the epoch 1840-45.              Adopting
11-423 as the mean value for 1842-45, and 11-143 for 1875, we obtain a
secular diminution of 0-0086 in this element of terrestrial magnetism.
   The annual increase of the declination      will  be + 7'-0, if we take the
approximate value of 32-0 W. from the map of Sir E. Sabine as repre
senting the declination for the epoch 1842-45.
IV. "     On the Variations of the Daily Kange of the Magnetic
       Declination as recorded at the Kew Observatory."                     By
       Balfour Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Natural
       Philosophy at the Owens College, Manchester.                   Received
       February 28, 1877.
   1.  The daily range of the magnetic declination at any station may
perhaps be regarded as a convenient representative of the magnetic
activity of the place.       For while a thorough discussion of the diurnal
magnetic changes must embrace along with the declination the two com
ponents of the force, yet, as regards such daily ranges, the declination
gives results which are not only more prominent but also more easily
procurable and subject to fewer uncertainties than similar ones for the
other two elements.
   In   estimating the daily range of the magnetic declination, as recorded
at the Kew Observatory,       I have excluded the disturbed observations, con
ceiving that by so doing a better indication of the true magnetical activity
of the place would be obtained than by including them, inasmuch as they
follow a very different set of laws from that of the well-known diurnal
declination-range.       The disturbed observations have been separated by
the method of Sir E. Sabine, those being rejected as disturbed for which
the measurements on the photographic curve are 0-150 inch either above
or below     the mean value    for that month and hour, one inch denoting
22'-04 of angular change. The daily ranges are here given in inches, and
they denote the differences between the greatest and least values of each
day's hourly tabulations from the curve, disturbances being excluded.        I
am indebted to the kindness of the Kew Committee for giving me the
daily ranges herein discussed, extending from the beginning of 1858 to
the end of 1873, thus embracing in all sixteen years' observations.

   2. The following Table exhibits mean monthly results of the declina
tion-range corresponding to 43 points in the year. It will afterwards be
seen (art. 7) that the declination-range depends amongst other things on
the relative position of the sun and moon, and hence to eliminate this
inequality   I have   resorted to monthly means.

   3.  It will   be seen     from Table I. that while there is a maximum of
declination-range     in  June   about the time of the summer solstice, there are
also maxima in April and August, and that a behaviour of this kind is
indicated in each four years' observations. Comparing this result with that
embodying the annual variation of temperature-range at Kew (Proc. Roy.
Soc. 1877, vol. xxv. p. 578), it will be seen that the latter variation has only
one maximum in July. Perhaps there is a reference to the equinoxes as well
as to the solstices in the annual variation of the declination-range.           A
comparison of the two is exhibited in Figs. IX., X., p. 120 (Fig. IX. giving
declination- and Fig. X. temperature-ranges).
                            B. Variations of Long Period.
    4. It is well known that the range of the magnetic declination has a
long-period variation, apparently connected with the physical state of the
sun's surface.      In order to investigate the nature and closeness of this
connexion the following plan has been adopted : — Let us assume as the
most probable hypothesis that the cause which exalts or depresses the
mean annual declination-range            exalts or depresses also in a similar
manner the variations of this from one month to another.            This is what
would take place if we could imagine the effect to be produced by some
influence emanating from the sun, which acted more powerfully on some
years than on others, while the variations of this effect due to the sun's
position in the ecliptic were also altered in the same proportion.         On the
whole this is borne out by Table I.         Constructing, now, a Table for each
year, and for 48 points in each year, and reckoning the mean of the 16
years' ranges for each of these points (as exhibited in the last column of
Table I.) equal to 1000, we find in Table II. a series of values exhibiting
the proportion between the observed range for any point of any one year,

1877.]              Range  of Magnetic Declination.                   105
and the mean of the whole 16 years for the same point. For instance,
the monthly value corresponding to Feb. (0) 1866 is -3535, while the
normal value for the whole 16 years for this point is (by Table I.) '385,
and hence the proportional value of the range for Feb. (0) 1866 is
        •3535
1000 x — — = 918.       By these means it is believed that the results of
         •o8o
Table II. are freed from any recognized inequality, depending either on
the month of the vear or on the relative position of the sun and moon.

   5. The numbers of Table        II.  require to be further dealt with before
they can be made to furnish a curve, bringing out the long-period varia
tion of the declination-range.        Let us first take for this purpose, as well
as for other objects to be afterwards mentioned, a series of values derived
from the numbers of Table II., each representing the mean of 12 conse
cutive values of Table II. These may be termed three-monthly values.
Thus, for instance, we have as follows : —

    We   have   thus,   in the last column of Table        ILL,   a series   of three-
 monthly values corresponding to the beginning and middle points of each
month.      In the next place, by adding together a certain three of these
 values, we may obtain nine-monthly values. Thus the three-monthly
 value for March (0), as above, is 983, while that for June (0) is 885, and
 for Sept. (0) 986 ; the mean of these (being 951) is the nine-monthly value
 corresponding to June (0). Nine-monthly values have thus been obtained
 corresponding to the beginnings of each month ; and finally, by adding
 these together, two and two, a series of nine-monthly values have been
 obtained corresponding to the middle points of each month.                 These are
 given in Table IV., and a curve exhibiting them is likewise given in
 Fig.  II. attached   to this paper. Again, the numbers given by Messrs. De
 La   Rue, Stewart, and Loewy in their paper on " Solar Physics " (Phil.
 Trans. 1870,    page 111), exhibiting      the spotted area of the sun's visible
 hemisphere for the years for which we have Kew declination results,
 have been treated in a manner precisely similar to the above ; that is to
 say, nine-monthly values corresponding to the middle of each month
 have been obtained.        These values are given in Table V., and a curve
 exhibiting them is likewise given in Fig. I. (p. 105).

   7.   For the purpose of discovering this variation the whole period of
observation has been portioned out into lunations, beginning with new
moon. Each lunation is divided into eight parts, entitled (0), (1), (2),
(3), (4), (5), (6), (7)       ;  (0) denoting new, and (4) full moon.
   These various lunations thus divided, with the corresponding values of
the declination-range, are exhibited in Table VI., the values of which have
been obtained by a method of treatment precisely similar to that adopted
for the Kew temperature-ranges, and described in a previous paper                              i

a series which presents           the appearance of a double period with maxima
about new and     full  moon. A similar result has been obtained for Lisbon by
Senhor Capello, Director of the observatory there (' Annals of the Obser
vatory,' 1876), who finds that the declination-ranges, or rather the differ
ences of the declination         at 8 a.m. and at 2 p.m., obey a law similar to that
stated above.

cussion of temperate-ranges) that the sum of the four left-hand numbers

small correction.        For it is possible that the sum of the various new-

 observations for other phases, may be affected differently from the latter

     11.   From art.  6 we may conclude that the connexion between solar
 spotted areas    and   declination-ranges is an intimate one. Now Messrs.
 De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, in a paper already quoted (Phil. Trans.
 1870), have shown that the amount of spotted area of the sun's surface
exhibits a reference to the chief planetary configurations.                           It becomes,
therefore, a question of interest to ask whether declination-ranges                         exhibit
a reference of the same kind*.
    In   order to reply to this        I  have selected those configurations which
occur most frequently, and which might therefore be supposed to be suffi
ciently well indicated by sixteen years' observations.
    These are, (a) the period of conjunction of Venus and Mercury, (J3) the
solar period of Mercury, (y) the period of conjunction of Venus and
Jupiter.
    In   the next place, three-monthly values for every week have been con
structed after the manner indicated in Table                   III.     Now inasmuch as the
periods of the three configurations already alluded to are not very far
different from three months, we may imagine that these three-monthly
values are to a great extent free from any inequality depending on these
periods.      The differences between the monthly and the three-monthly
values will, however, exhibit any such inequality as may exist.                              These

differences, slightly equalized, are therefore made to form the ordinates
of a curve of which the time is the abscissa, and we may expect to derive
from such a curve materials for determining whether there be any
inequality in the declination-range due to such configurations.                     The

   In Figs. Y. and VI. the supposed inequalities due to this period are
compared together for spotted solar area and declination-range.              It will
be observed that the latter lags visibly behind the former in point of
time.
    14. Let us, in the last place, consider the period of the conjunction of
Jupiter and- Mercury. In this case, as in the previous one, the inequality
is so well marked that the observations may be split into two series            ; this
will be seen from the following Table : —

118                     Prof. B. Stewart on the Daily                 [Mar. 22,
   In Figs. VII.   and  VIII. the supposed  inequalities due to the above period
are compared together for solar spotted area and declination-range.            It
will be noticed that the latter lags visibly behind the former       in point of
time.
      F. Remarks     on the supposed relations between  Solar spotted areas,
                   Declination-ranges, and Temperature-ranges.
    15.  A  few remarks on this subject will not be considered unallowable
if the object be not so much to introduce a final theory as to suggest a
working hypothesis which, while not inconsistent with any well-esta
blished fact, may perhaps serve to direct future inquiry.
    In the first place, we may conclude, as the result of the comparison of
Figs. I. and II., that the connexion between spotted areas and declination-
ranges is of an intimate nature, the smaller inequalities of the one being
reproduced in the other with modifications.
    16.  In   the next place,   it seems almost certain that sun-spots    are not
the chief cause of magnetic action.         Mr. Broun, in a recent paper " On
the Decennial Period in the Range and Disturbance of the Diurnal Oscil
 lations of the Magnetic Needle and in Sun-spot area" (Trans. Roy.
Soc. Edinb. 1876), has made a remark similar to the above, founding it upon
the fact that sun-spots appear only when the magnetic action exceeds a
 given value.
    17. Nevertheless it is most probable that magnetic activity is some
how caused by the sun, depending perhaps on the physical state of his
 surface, while sun-spots give us only a rough mode of estimating this
 physical state, just as rainfall might in estimating the climate of a place.
For it will be seen that the effect of the sun upon magnetic range bears
all the appearances of being due to an influence emanating from our
luminary.       For just as the maxima of yearly and daily temperature lag
behind    the  corresponding maxima of solar heat influence, so do the maxima
 and minima of declination- range lag behind the corresponding maxima
 and minima in the solar curve, while the same lagging behind appears in
the curves, denoting the supposed influence of the planets on the state of
 the solar surface and (through it ?) on the magnetic range.
     18. Again, we may probably imagine that sun-spots give us a roughly
true indication of solar activity ; for if this were not so it would be
 difficult to account for the striking likeness between the sun-spot plane
 tary curves and the declination-range planetary curves.          That the sun-
 spots afford but a rough indication of the physical state of the sun will of
 course be gathered from the fact that the sun is influential both in meteo
 rology and magnetism when there are no spots ; and the same conclusion
appears to be supported by the fact that the planetary inequalities appear
to be more pronounced when derived from declination-ranges than when
derived from sun-spots.
    19. There seems, however, to be something            more than   this ;  there

 1877.3                    Range of Magnetic Declination.                                      119
 appears to be in the march of the declination-range                        from year to year
 (Tig. II.) traces of a force which prevents this range from being strictly
 comparable with that of sun-spots.                It will be seen that after the date of
peculiarity    a (Figs.   I. and II.) the   sun-spot curve marches rapidly up, while
the declination-range         curve does not so mount ; also, after the maximum 6,
the sun-spot curve falls more rapidly than the declination-curve.                         Similar
remarks will apply to other points ; in fine we have grounds for supposing
the declination-range to be acted upon by some other influence than one
so represented by sun-spots as to follow their increase and diminution.
    Mr.  J.  A. Broun, in a series of interesting investigations, has indicated
the probability that there is an influence of this nature ; and it may fairly
be said that the results of this paper are at least consistent with such an
hypothesis.
    20.  I  would next remark that the hypothesis asserting a connexion of
some kind between magnetical and meteorological phenomena appears to
be borne out by the results of this paper *.
    It will be noticed from Figs. XI., XII. (p. 120), that there is a striking
likeness between the winter lunar variation for the declination and
temperature ranges. There is also a likeness between the summer lunar
variation for these two elements, not so striking to the eye, but which
will nevertheless      be seen from the         following comparison           : —

    Both of these, the first imperfectly and the latter fully, exhibit maxima
at or near new and full moon.              Again, while on the whole there is a like
ness   between    the  curves     representing       the annual variation for these two
elements, yet there is also a dissimilarity, inasmuch as the declination-
curve (Fig. IX.) has apparently a strong reference to the equinoxes, which
is absent, or nearly so, in the temperature-curve. But it may be taken for
granted that if there be a connexion between magnetism and meteorology,
it certainly cannot be of such a nature that all the meteorological pecu^-
liarities of a place are reproduced in its magnetic phenomena, for all
observation is against a connexion of this description.                       Indeed any hypo
thesis  of  a connexion      between     these     two     must,   in  order   to be consistent
with facts, assume that the magnet averages things so as to be free, in a
great measure if not completely, from local peculiarities.
    * Mr. Baxendell, of Manchester, was the first to direct attention to this subject in
a paper
          " On a Diurnal Inequality in the Direction and Velocity of the Wind," appa
rently connected with the daily changes of magnetic declination.               See Memoirs of the
lit. and Phil. Society   of Manchester,   vol.   iv. ser.  3, p. 210.

120          On the Daily Range of Magnetic Declination.                 [Mar. 22,
   The results of this paper appear to       be consistent   with such an hypo
thesis when so modified.
   21.  It is needless here to enter   into the various reasons which induce us
to believe in the existence of a connexion between the meteorology of the
earth and the physical state of the sun's surface.     I may, however, refer to a
        "
paper On the Daily Range of Atmospheric Temperature at the Kew Ob
servatory" (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1877, vol. xxv. p. 580), in which it was shown
that at Kew the temperature-range is somewhat higher at times of maximum
than at times of minimum sun-spots.           If, however, we plot as a curve this
temperature-range,     it is neither like  Fig. I. nor Fig. II., or at least not so
like as to suggest any marked relation to the eye. (This curve is not given
in this paper.) But on examining its most prominent points,             I find that
not a few of these agree both in direction and in time with similar pecu
liarities in the magnetic curve. Thus there is a well-marked prominence
in the temperature-range curve corresponding to about the end of May
1861 ; now there is a prominence in the magnetic curve at about the same
date. Again, there is a depression in both curves corresponding to about
the end of May 1862. Again, there is a well-marked depression in the
temperature-curve corresponding to the end of April 1866, while in the

 declination-curve there is a well-marked depression perhaps a month later.
Finally, there is a depression in the temperature-curve corresponding to
the beginning of July 1867, and one in the declination-curve correspond
ing to the middle of August.              I have not    been able to notice any marked
coincidence between the temperature-range and the sun-spot curves.
   -Without attempting to decide the question, it appears that there is at
least some preliminary evidence in favour of an alliance between the
three phenomena, solar spotted area, terrestrial meteorology, and terres
trial magnetism, of such a nature that the variations of the former precede
those of the other two in point of time. It will be seen that this is a
question of much importance ; for if there be a connexion of this nature,
once its laws are known,          it may    become possible to foresee the character
of impending meteorological changes. These points, however, can only
be determined by further investigations.
   I  desire, before concluding, to thank Mr. Wm. Dodgson, who has given
me much assistance in the calculations and diagrams of this paper.

       Professor Norms, M.D., Queen's College, Birmingham.
       Communicated       by G. Gore,       F.R.S.    Received     August    15,
       1876.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In the course of certain researches in Physiological Physics, in which
the author of this paper has been for some time past engaged, it became
necessary, with a view to learn how far it bore upon the subject in hand,
to inquire into the nature of a peculiar fact which was observed by his
friend Mr. Gore, and' published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
January 28th, 1869, under the title of " A Momentary Molecular Change
in Iron Wire." In this communication it was shown that if a strained
iron wire were heated to redness by a voltaic current or other means,
on being allowed to cool, the contraction of cooling was at a certain
point, and for a limited period, arrested by an action of elongation.
   " With wires of iron 0-65 millim. thick
                                                 (No. 23) and 21-5 centims.
long, strained to the extent of ten ounces or more, and heated to full red
ness, the phenomenon was clearly developed.          For example, the needle
of the instrument went with regularity to 18•5 of index-plate ; the cur
rent wa9 then stopped ; the needle instantly retreated to 17'75, then as
quickly advanced to 19-75, and then went slowly and regularly back, but
not to zero. After shutting off the source of heat, the wire contracted
075 millim., and then expanded 2 millims. ; so that it returned 1-25 millim.

beyond the original point of heating, and then resumed its course towards
zero, which it failed to reach. The length of the kick, plus the amount
of stretch, occasioned during the occurrence by the strain was therefore
2 millims.    If the temperature of the wire was not sufficiently high, or
the strain upon the wire not enough, the needle went directly back with
out exhibiting the momentary forward movement.      The temperature and
strain required to be sufficient to actually stretch the wire somewhat at
the higher temperature.      A higher temperature with a less degree of
strain, or a greater degree of strain with a somewhat lower temperature,
did not develop the phenomenon.     The wire was found to be permanently
elongated on cooling."
    Mr. Gore further   observes   :   — " The molecular change evidently includes
a diminution of cohesion at a particular temperature during the process
of cooling ; and it is interesting to notice that at the same temperature
during the heating-process no such loss of cohesion (nor any increase of
cohesion) takes place ; a certain temperature and strain are therefore
not alone sufficient to produce it ; the condition of cooling must also be
included.  The phenomena which occur during cooling are not the exact
converse of those which take place during heating."
  The subject was subsequently taken up by Professor Barrett, of Dublin,
                                                             '
who, in a paper to the ' Philosophical Magazine in 1873 (vol. xlvi. p. 472),
showed, by the use of the mirror, that during the heating of the wire a
converse action to that which takes place during cooling occurs.         He
        "
says : — During the heating of the wire a slight and momentary retrogres
sion of the beam was noticed at the temperature corresponding to the
powerful jerk that occurred on cooling.
    " The temperature at which the momentary jerk occurs seems to be
lower in thick wires than in thin ones. The momentary retraction, as
closely as can be judged, takes place at the same temperature at which the
elongation takes place on cooling.            Releasing      the tension of the spring,
the forward motion on cooling           is,   as might    be expected, much lessened,
whilst the jerk back    scarcely affected.
                       is                    Increasing the tension of the
spring, the forward jerk    correspondingly increased, and the backward
                             is
jerk diminishes and can be made to disappear. Without the spring, an
iron wire can be seen by the naked eye to undergo          momentary con
                                                                     a
traction during heating, and    momentary and more palpable elongation

    "During the cooling of the wire it was found that just            as it reached
 a very   dull red heat,    a sudden accession    of temperature occurred,   so that
 it glowed once more with           a bright red heat.     It was found that the
 reheating     of the  wire  occurred  simultaneously   with the momentary elon
 gation."
    In  studying these phenomena it seemed, in the first place, desirable to
 construct apparatus of much greater delicacy and heating-power than that
 used by either of the previous observers, so that, if possible, the shorten
 ing during heating could be shown with the same facility as the elonga
tion during cooling. This has been achieved by means of the instrument
a sketch of which is given with the Charts.            The main idea has been to
construct an apparatus which would exhibit the phenomena readily with
out the use of mirrors or batteries, and that would admit of experiments
being performed either with or without strain.               This latter has been
accomplished by placing the wire vertically, so as to get rid of all droop
ing when heated.          With apparatus thus constructed, we found no diffi
culty in displaying the phenomena in the most perfect manner, the
heating-kick not unfrequently being three or four centimetres in length,
and the cooling-kick sometimes as much as 13 centimetres.
    It is necessary to state in limine that strain plays no part in the pro
duction of the phenomena of the kicks or jerks. Its only effect is to
cause a very small influence in the cooling (which might have been over
looked with certain kinds of apparatus) to be observed.               It is obvious
that when a wire has a tendency to expand, the presence of weight or
tension, by assisting to overcome the inertia of the apparatus, would
favour the exhibition of the act ; but it is equally clear that it would ope
rate in an opposite manner when the tendency was to contract, as in the
heating ; and therefore, although it would favour the cooling, it would be
prejudicial to the heating-kick.
    Strain, therefore, being unessential to the phenomenon, and, by the intro
duction of false quantities, prejudicial to the quantitative comparison of
the several effects, it has been carefully avoided in these experiments, suf
ficient weight alone being used to keep the thread tense upon the pulley,
and never in any case to elongate the particular wire under use, even
when maintained for some time at its highest temperature.
    It is  desirable that these facts should be borne in mind      ; for no sooner
do we enter upon this research with more delicate and reliable apparatus,
than we find that the kicks are but a small part of the phenomena we are
called upon to observe and explain. We ascertain at the very outset that
iron and     steel wire presents   itself to our examination under very different
conditions, which demand a rigid analysis. Thus, apart from its inherent
quality, it may come to us for experiment : —

 130            Prof. Norris on Molecular Changes in Iron            [Apr. 12,
    It is proposed to consider, in the first place, the phenomena presented
 by   the  ordinary steel wire of commerce, when first subjected to the
influence of heat. During the heating of such wires, we notice that a
first kick occurs at a point varying on the scale from 29° to 33°, and that
the wire subsequently proceeds to a high expansion, which may be repre
sented on the scale by the figures 66°, 52^°, 55°, 50£°, and so forth,
according to the quality and state of the wire.       In the act of cooling a
kick commences at points varying from 31 £° to 22°, and terminates at
 points varying from 33° to 28°, when the finger proceeds on towards zero,
but invariably falls short of reaching it by amounts varying from £° to 5]f
(centimetres).    [ Vide fig. 1.]                                               /
   In   the next experiment with these wires a much altered state of things
is found to obtain.      Thus the first kick is lowered a little in position,
increased in range ; the expansion of the wire is materially diminished,
being now represented by such figures as 58J°, 43^°, 45 j°, 50£°, &c. re
spectively.     In the cooling the second kick is separated more from the
first, being put back in the direction of zero.    It will also be seen that in

1877.]            and Steel during Heating and Cooling.                    131
cooling    the finger  passes  beyond  zero, indicating now that the wire is
permanently shortened,    whereas in the primary heating it was permanently
elongated.
   A comparison of these two series of experiments will show us that,
during the heating of these wires, there is going on at the same time a
whole series of phenomena, some of which, although different in nature,
are alike as to result, while others are different both as to nature and
result. "We have, in the first place, the ordinary expansion, which we
will designate the " dynamical expansion."        In  the primary heating an
amount of expansion will be seen to occur which has no equivalent in the
dynamical contraction of cooling.       The secondary heatings reveal to us
the existence of a contraction, which is also excited during the heating,
and the action of which is to limit the dynamical expansion previously
referred to.     That it masks a portion of the dynamical expansion is ren
dered obvious by the fact that, in cooling, the finger moves beyond zero,
showing that the wire has contracted more in cooling than it expanded in
heating.
    In addition   to this, we have also the phenomena of the kicks them
selves  ; and these may be described as consisting of a temporary contrac
tion and expansion.
    During the heating of   a wire, when in its commercial state, there is one
expansive and two contractive tendencies exerting their powers at one and
the same time ; aud conversely, in the act of cooling, there is one contrac
tive and two expansive influences at work, viz. : — ordinary cooling con
traction ; an expansion which is the opposite of the temporary contraction
of heating — the cooling-Jcick ; and an expansion which is the opposite in
nature, but not necessarily in amount, of the contraction of heating —
crystalline expansion.      In every case the interpretation of the general
result depends upon the accurate estimate of the extent to which these
interacting forces have modified each other's effects. Thus during the
heating we have a temporary and a permanent contraction, assisting each
other to oppose the dynamical expansion. In cooling, on the other hand,
 we have two expansions, one of which is temporary and the other perma
nent, opposing the dynamical contraction of cooling.
   It will be desirable to carefully define the nature of these respective
influences, and the terms which will be used to distinguish them in this
research.
   I.  Dynamical Expansion. —This term will be used to distinguish the
ordinary dilatation produced in bodies generally, by raising them from a
given temperature to a higher one, and which is exactly counterbalanced
by contraction when the original temperature is regained. It is proposed
to call this kind of contraction   " the dynamical contraction."
   II.   Contraction of Heating. — In the diagrams representing second
heatings [vide fig. 2] we get the first inkling of the existence of a con
tractive or shortening influence excited by heat simultaneously with the

132               On Molecular    Changes in    Iron and Steel.          [Apr. 12,
expansion.       In the diagrams of annealed and hardened wire [vide figs.
3, 4, 5]  this  influence  becomes more obvious still.         In these cases it is
seen to greatly mask the dynamical expansion.            This kind of contraction
may   be  also  displayed by protracted heating     of the   wire, when it exhibits
itself at the end of the expansion       as a slow, continuous       contraction of
considerable extent [yule fig. 5].
   III.    Temporary Contraction. — This term        is applied to the cooling
influence which is excited in the wire during heating, and which, at a
certain point, balances the expansion ; for heat being rendered latent at
the same rate as it is being absorbed, produces a stop (which indicates
that the expansion is arrested and balanced) or a kick (which implies an
absolute cooling of the wire from excess of latency).            The diminution of
the rate of expansion, or the actual shortening produced by this kind of
contraction, is of a temporary character, and must not be confounded with
the heat-contraction which it accompanies.
    These, then, are the phenomena of heating : —
         (1)   Dynamical expansion ;
         (2)   Permanent or heat contraction      ;
         (3)   Temporary    contraction (heating-kicks)    ;
         (4)   Stretching; and
         (5)   The influence of oxide.
    We   have     now to consider    what  influences    are present    during the
cooling  : —
      I. Dynamical Contraction. — The opposite of dynamical expansion.
     II. Permanent Expansion of cooling. — (Crystalline expansion.)
   TIT. Temporary Expansion. — The thermal expansion due to the reglow-
ing of the wire during cooling. This is the proximate cause of the stops
and kicks which occur in cooling.        It is evanescent as an opposing force,
and must not be confounded with the permanent or crystalline expansion
of cooling, of which it is simply the     effect.
   We have, then, in cooling : —

of iron and steel, and has further shown that numerical values may be

is divisible into high and low temperature contraction.   [Compare figs.
4&      5.]
   2.             The presence of a cooling expansion or crystallization, which
comes             in during the dynamical contraction and masks its true amount.
   3. These effects, due to crystallization and decrystallization, are the
causes of the so-called kicks, or temporary contractions and expansions,
which occur during the heating and cooling of the steel.
   4. That the low-temperature contraction and cooling expansion are due
to decrystallization and crystallization which occur during the acts of
heating and cooling, while the kicks themselves are simply the thermal
effects associated with these changes, and are proportionate to their
extent.
  5. That protracted annealing (that                                 is,
                                         extremely slow cooling) brings
about molecular separation of the carbon and iron and steel in such                    ;                          a
state contracts greatly when high temperatures are reached, producing
the contraction returns seen at the end of the heating, and which are due
to the condensation produced                           by
                                     the recombination of the carbon and
iron.    Steels in this state are less susceptible to cooling-expansion
(crystallization), and therefore to low-temperature contraction on sub
sequent heating.                [      Vide fig. 5.]

          accumulation of Foraminiferal Deposits." By Prof. P. Martin
          Duncan, F.R.S., Pres. Geol. Soc. Received March 15, 1877.
    A telegraph-cable was laid off the north-west of Spain in 1870, and                                           a
portion of     was recovered in 1876, in long. 9°

The depth from which the recovered portion      came was from  522 to 550
fathoms    the ground was conglomeratic, and there was
                   ;                                         deposit there                     a

phyllum Crista-Galli of different sizes and of many bush-shaped coralla
of Lophohelia prolifera, var. gracilis ; there were also small masses of
Solenosmilia variabilis (nobis), a new Amphihelia, and a specimen of
 Caryophyllia cylindroma (Reuss), which were not attached, but which
must have been fixed close by to stones.
   As the date of the sinking of the cable was known, and as six years had
elapsed, it was possible to estimate the rapidity of the growth of the coral
on    it,
       and also to come to some more or lesa satisfactory conclusions re
garding the rate of the deposit of the foraminiferal ooze in that situation.
Moreover     glance at the numerous specimens showed that they presented
              a
variations and abnormalities of structure well worthy of examination, and
which might relate to the inadvisability of retaining some of the specific
and generic determinations in the ancient and recent coral faunas.

               \           There are no indications of ooze having covered the
base, and the granulation            of the basal surface         is   perfect and free from
any evidence of erosion.
     The smallest specimen found on the                  cable has its calicular       edge   rather
on one side and oblique, and       ^      it   is      of an inch above the attached base.
It shows no trace of ooze the other specimens, intermediate in size,
                                     ;

bonate of lime, granular above and attached below to the outer coating of
the cable.
   Stunted bush-shaped masses of Lophohelia adhered       broad bases to      by
the cable, and extended along                 it    for many inches.      The corallites com
posing the masses were crowded together to the height of an inch from
the cable, and   few reached upwards about
                       a                        of an inch above the
                                                                  |
rest. Some had grown up obliquely, and others had their calices turned
downwards, so that their margins were not -jL of an inch from the cable.
They must          have always been above the ooze.
  Gemmation appears to have occurred four times in the tallest corallites,
commencing on the parent when    attained    certain size

  From these details   may be gleaned that the upward and general rate of

inappreciable on the cable during six years.                A few Foraminifera in
crevices in the bases of a few specimens are the only signs of its presence.
But that there was plenty of sticky ooze close by is evident ; for some
was brought up by the apparatus, and it had got into parts of the calices
of 6ome of the living corals. Moreover a mass of conglomerate which
was brought up, and which consisted of water-worn gneiss boulders ce
mented together, had some of the mud entangled in it ; and most of the
caliees of the dead corals which were brought up at the same time, but
which were not attached to the cable, contained a small quantity of fo-
raminiferal and siliceous matter.
    It is possible that the motion of the tentacles and of the cilia of the
corals prevented the accumulation of sediment in their neighbourhood ;
but the tall peduncles of some of the Desmophylla would place their
 calices far out of the way of matter collecting on the base.              Moreover
the part of the cable on which the coral grew may have been laid on
masses of stone above the level of the deposit.               But the facts that the
calices of the living Amphihelia brought up, and which was not growing
on the cable, contained no deposit, and that the dead Solenosmilia and a
short Caryophyllia, neighbours to the form just noticed, had very small
amounts in their calices, which had long been dead, and had been worn
by Achlya penetrans and some Spongida, are of themselves sufficient to
 disprove a rapid rate of accumulation.            The presence of some most fra
 gile outgrowths     from   the Lophohelian      corals which supported and partly
 enclosed the stems of some Hydroida contraindicate                the existence of
 a current sufficient to move sticky ooze.
    It may be considered, then, that the deposit of minute sedimentary
 matter and of pelagic Foraminifera is excessively slow in its rate of accu
 mulation at 550 fathoms on this part of the Atlantic floor, and that it is
 very much slower than the contemporaneous coral growth.
    An examination of some of the deep-sea corals of the true                 Globi-
 gerina-ooze area will afford a corresponding observation ; and we may
 assume that in the White and Bed Chalks of England the Madreporaria
 grew vastly more quickly than the deposit accumulated which subsequently
 environed and overwhelmed them.                One of Lonsdale's discoveries was
 that of an Amphihelian-looking mass from the Chalk of Gravesend*; its
 bulk was considerable, and yet many of the calices were close to the base,
 and they were those of young buds. Again, in the Bed Chalk the corals
 are often widely open and short and were probably very slow growers.
 All these considerations tend to the impression that the chalk of old,
 whatever may have been its original nature, accumulated extremely slowly.
    The variability of the specimens of Desmophyllum Crista-Oalli which
 were found on the cable is very great ; and in some instances it is suffi
 cient to permit of a specific distinction being made according to the strict
 classificatory rules.      Doubtless had the specimens been separated, and

had they been assumed to have come from different localities, new species
would have been made of them.
   Several specimens are very costulate, and there are crests to all the
larger cost®; in some there are wart-like growths in those situations, and
in these forms the calice is sometimes widely open, or very compressed,
or normally slightly so at its orifice.
  In at least one fourth of the specimens the shape of the corallum, in
stead of being subturbinate and compressed above the round pedicel, is
tall and cylindrical ; and there are no costal ridges of any importance.
Moreover the size of the calicos and septa varies in this series.
   Some specimens, otherwise normal, have very broad basal expansions
out of all proportion with t he height. But the most interesting variation
is noticed in those specimens which have widely open calices and exsert
septa   ;   for, added to these specific structures, are costal crests, ridges, pro
cesses, and      root-like projections coming from the body, peduncle, and base.
These projections are either free at their end or are attached to some sup
port; sometimes the growths are in relation to the costal line, and in others
they cannot be maintained to be so, and they are either smooth, granular, or
like shagreen.   There is no epitheca on the coral, and the root-like projec
tions are therefore growths of the ectoderm. Some act as supports ; but
most have been produced by the irritation of an Annelid, which, after boring
out of the cable came in contact with the coral, which endeavoured more
or less successfully to cover it up.
   Those processes which are beyond the reach of Annelids and which act
as   supports singularly resemble those root-like growths which are of
generic or specific importance in many groups of Madreporaria.
   Flabellum, Bhizotroehm, Ehizophyllum, Omphyma, &c. are genera which
possess such root-forming species. But the root-like processes of Flabellum
have a higher physiological interest than those      of Destnophyllum ; for some
finally separate the base      of the coral from its attachment by their down
ward growth-pressure; nevertheless the development of root-processes by
the cable covering Desmophylla  suggestive and important, although some
                                     is.
are morbid growths.
   The cylindroid specimens would most probably be considered speci
fically distinct from the others were they found away from them or in
strata.   They are very suggestive; for in palaeontology the shape of the
corallum, the contour of the calice, and the relative size of the septa are
often considered to establish species; and such genera as Trochocyathus, Tro-
chosmilia, and MotUlivaltia amongst Mesozoic corals, and CyathophyUia
and Zaphrentis amongst the Eugosa, teem with specific names which are
not established on better grounds than that of the cylindroid Desmo-
phyllum.
   The Lophohelias on the cable present great bud variation; and the
young and old corallites are of many different shapes, from the turbinate
to the tubular.   But the most important structural peculiarities are of two

kinds : —first, the annelid growth has determined outgrowth of the coral
which has covered in the worm-tube ; and second, the establishment of
some Hydrozoa on the ectoderm of the coral has sometimes produced the
formation of tubes of coral-structure        which environ the stalk of the
offender and form a useful support to it.
    Finally it may be remarked that all the Madreporaria which were
brought up with the cable from off this area have an unusual orna
mentation.
    I have to thank    Sir James Anderson for the specimens and for the
details of the recovery of the cable.
 III.   " On Attraction and Repulsion of Bubbles by Heat." By
    Walter Noel Hartley, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., King's College,
    London.        Communicated        by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.
    Received February 26, 1877.
    In my first paper " On the presence of Liquid Carbon Dioxide in Mine
 ral Cavities
               "
                 (' Journal of the Chemical Society,' February 1876),           I
 mentioned having noticed a remarkable repulsion of the bubbles in fluid-
 cavities when they were approached by a heated body.        I at first regarded
 these movements as similar to those observed by Mr. Sang and Dr.
 Hunter (Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1872-73, p. 126)
 in cavities of Iceland spar; but with reference to the position           of the
 source of heat,  I  have since found that they occurred in quite the     reverse
 direction.    The motion noticed by Mr. Sang was a repulsion              of the
 liquid ; that which    I  recorded was a repulsion of the gas by the      heated
 body.
           I
    Here may as well say that this refers to the real and not the appa
 rent direction of the motion as seen under the microscope.
    Professors Tait and Swan have shown (Proc. Roy. Soc. of Edinburgh,
 1873-74, p. 247) that the attraction of the bubble by a heated body is a
 natural effect if the liquid be of great volatility, in contact only with its
 own vapour, as would be the case if the cavity were filled with carbonic
 acid. Distillation of the liquid would take place when one side of the
 bubble was heated ever so slightly above the temperature of the other,
 and condensation would occur on the cooler side. This would occasion a
 movement of the bubble from the cold to the warm side of the cavity ;
 but it is not the original bubble being simply propelled.      Professor Tait
 assumes that the liquid in Mr. Sang's specimens is carbonic acid, and
 applies this explanation.        This might well be the case, because the
 attracting pieces of metal used were but a very few degrees warmer than
 the specimens acted on ; but from other circumstances, some of which           I
propose giving in detail,     I am of opinion that these were water-bubbles.
    The attraction   of   a gas-bubble in a cavity containing liquid carbonic

  138             Mr. W. N. Hartley         on  Attraction and         [Apr. 12,
 acid will always take place when the proportion of liquid to gas is so
 small that evaporation is readily effected.        If the liquid at 15° C. occu
 pies one half of the space of the cavity, this will occur only under special
conditions, because the liquid in such proportions expands by increase of
 temperature.      Thus in the case of a cavity in a topaz, shown in fig. 1,
 a number of experiments have invariably failed to cause any transference
of the bubble from place to place.         The approach of a warm substance
causes immediate expansion of the liquid and decrease in size of the bubble.
    The gas-bubble in a cavity of rock-crystal, shown in fig. 2, behaves
quite differently ; the proportion of liquid to gas is such that heat causes
evaporation instead of expansion ; and accordingly the liquid is repelled
 apparently, and the gas-bubble attracted by a heated body. With the
cavity in tourmaline (fig. 3), when the heat is applied in a particular
 manner, the same movement takes place ; ordinarily the liquid ex
pands.    To cause distillation and not expansion, the source of heat must
be small and the rise     of temperature slight, in order (hat only one end
of the cavity may     be heated.   I have always failed to get this effect with
 the topaz cavity, probably because the thickness of the section causes
the heat to be diffused over the liquid.        The tourmaline section is thin
and the cavity long and narrow, and is therefore an easy one to experi
ment with    ; so likewise is the cavity shown in fig. 5, E ; it contains car
bonic acid only, and the bubble is easily attracted when the source of
heat is properly applied.      In the course of some thousands of observa
tions, made within the last two years,        I have noticed other movements
than such as may be compared with the experiments of Professors Tait
and Swan on tubes of liquid sulphurous acid.             The circumstances in
fluencing these movements, and the various conditions under which they
take place, render it necessary that     I  should disregard the order in which
I  observed and originally recorded them ; for       I  have on more than one
occasion  been   bewildered by noticing what appeared to be diametrically
opposite facts in experimenting on the same specimen, and even on the
contents of the same cavity.           I   therefore consider it expedient to
classify my experiments, in order to make the account of them intel
ligible.

    With regard to the attraction of bubbles by heat, have noticed this
take place in some water-cavities when the bubbles were free to move
and no carbonic acid was present.            In order that no mistake might
possibly occur as to the relative positions of the source of heat and
the moving bubble, a hot platinum wire was used and always
brought into the field of the microscope.          Some thousands of cavities
have been noticed occurring in sections of rock-crystal and in the
quartz of various kinds of granite.          The rise in temperature required
to cause this movement was measured at first by blowing warm air

degrees Centigrade were found to be amply sufficient.

 140                 Mr. W. N. Hartley          on  Attraction and          [Apr. 12,
 sections were cut, there was a multitude of cavities, many of considerable
 size. They all contained one liquid, water, and what appeared to be a
 gas-bubble, which was attracted by heat.                A slice of the crystal was
 mounted between pieces of stout sheet platinum, and so placed on the
 stage of the microscope that it could be easily taken off and replaced at
 once in exactly the same position, so that the cavity under observation
 would be within the focus of the object-glass.           By immersing the specimen
 in hot mercury, and instantly after removal examining it with the micro
 scope,   I ascertained   that at 150° C. the liquid had just expanded so as to
entirely fill the    space.   It is evident, then, that little or no gas is present.
    It  was next necessary to ascertain the lowest temperature of a body
by which the bubble could be attracted.             This was accomplished in a most
 satisfactory manner by selecting a cavity which was plainly visible with
a 2-inch objective.        A long test-tube, having a diameter of § of an inch,
 was filled with water, immersed in which was a fine thermometer.                  The
tube was heated, and experiments were repeatedly made while                     it was
cooling to find out when it ceased to attract the bubble.
    A   number of trials showed that at 76° C. attraction was powerful, at
71°C. it was somewhat feeble, but below this temperature there was no
action    sufficient   to overcome gravitation.         Further experiments were
made in a straight tube-like cavity, which from its size and its regularity
of  shape was exceptionally good       for the purpose.    It measured       x       of
an inch, and the bubble was               of an inch in diameter.      It moved about
on change of position as freely as the bubble in a spirit-level.             Proceed
ing as before, the temperature           of  the crystal being     16° C. and that of
the tube 21° C, the bubble could be attracted in a horizontal direction
only   ; but when the tube was warmed             to 60° C. its power of attraction
was sufficient to overcome the buoyancy of the bubble, and draw it down
wards to the extremity of the cavity.
    A piece of rock-crystal was examined which contained both water and
carbonic-acid cavities in juxtaposition.            These water-bubbles were very
easily attracted, as will be seen by the following experiments. A cavity was
chosen with a bubble moving as easily as the bubble in a spirit-level ; its
size was    -^hs  x tJtt   °£ Ka inch, and the diameter        of the bubble -j-jta of
an inch.

temperature causes the repelled liquid to be evaporated and scattered in

 bubble would be attracted in the same way as carbonic-acid bubbles.
    The attraction of bubbles in cavities which contain water may be due
 to two causes —    :  At low temperatures, as, for instance, at 21° C, to
                              1.                                                         a
 repulsion  of the liquid from the glass 2. At high temperatures, such as

 60° and 70° C, to evaporation and condensation on opposite sides of the
 bubble.
   The movements      of bubbles in Iceland spar noticed by Mr. Sang
 may  thus be explained, for in that substance water-cavities are of con
 stant occurrence.   There    no necessity to assume what seems, from my

be that the bubble consists of     gas so highly compressed that

must     be a gas      with a density of "745 compared with liquid water at
unity   ;  hence,     in all probability, at a tension of 400 atmospheres this
gaseous mixture would be denser than water.              I  have elsewhere pointed
out that carbonic-acid gas which was reduced to                 of its volume by a
pressure of 223 atmospheres, at 63° C. must have been as dense, if not
denser, than water (Journal of the Chem. Soc. vol. ii. 1876, p. 250).
    Some of those gas-bubbles which           I have already mentioned as being
                                 I
readily attracted by heat, found were made to sink by wanning to about
150° C.       It   is always necessary to rotate or at least reverse the objects
when under examination ; and this precaution was always strictly regarded
to obviate errors of observations.          The importance of this is shown by
the following experiment.           A bubble in a specimen of rock-crystal was
seen to descend to the lower point of the cavity when it was uniformly
heated from above only ; it was found to be attracted by a hot spatula
applied to one end of the cavity. It was thought possible that the cavity
might have an oblique inclination, and be attracted from the upper end
of the cavity, because this motion might bring it nearer the surface
where the source of heat was placed.             This was evidently the case, for
on turning the slide upside down no motion was caused by uniform heating.
    The following experiments were made on some good-sized cavities in
rock-crystal. On presenting a heated wire to one side there was instant
attraction, and then the bubbles remained at the bottom of the cavities,
after which they settled slowly into their original positions.                  A hot
spatula was passed over the specimen ; the bubbles went to the bottom
aud there remained, in spite of the attraction of the hot spatula to the
 other end ; they then, after cooling slightly, ascended, but descended
 again on removal of the spatula, as if jerked back by a spring.              After a
 time they finally ascended slowly.          This is a curious effect : it seems that
the    heat,   if   strong,  causes  the bubbles to sink, and that the heat of
 the spatula cannot attract them up until they have cooled somewhat ;
 that after attraction has drawn them to the upper ends of the cavities,
 and the source of heat has been removed, they sink once more, and finally
 take up their original positions after further cooling.
       Attraction and repulsion caused by heat in different cavities of       the
                                      same specimens.
     Bubbles attracted by heat and those which are repelled have generally
  been found      in separate and entirely different specimens ; and it would
 appear most improbable that they should exist in the same piece of stone
  side by side.

   Another cavity of irregular shape, and at least four times the size of
the largest of these, behaved exactly in the same manner.      As in the
other experiments, the objects were frequently turned about in different
directions to prevent mistakes.
   A series of experiments were made on these cavities to ascertain the
precise difference,  any, between them.

   The bubble in A was found to have disappeared at 105° C, and

experiments      were made with the view of ascertaining the temperature
producing    repulsion and attraction respectively in the different cavities
of this specimen.
   Eepulsion to the extreme end of the cavity, entirely in opposition to
the effect of gravitation, was produced by a temperature of 5° C. above
that of the specimen. Attraction in opposition to gravitation in cavity
D   became active by a rise   of   5° C.   ;   in B   14° C. were insufficient   to do
more than give a lateral motion to the bubble.             On cavity C     12° C. acted
energetically.
   A series of experiments were made            on bubbles which contained liquid
carbonic acid as well as gas.
  By heatiug the specimen above the critical point of the carbonic acid
we know something of the conditions under which subsequent experi
ments may be made.    We know that the liquid is water containing a
gas-bubble under a pressure of not less than 109 atmospheres.       The
following are facts which, like those preceding, were recorded at the
moment of observation.   Fig. 4 represents a cavity in rock-crystal with
carbonic acid in the liquid and gaseous states floating upon water. The
bubble is so easily movable that it shifts about like the bubble in a
spirit-level. The stage of the microscope holds the section in a vertical
position, and when one end of the cavity is raised             \
                                                    a degree Centigrade
in temperature, the bubble is driven to the opposite extremity ; if the
specimen be turned over, this will happen in spite of the buoyancy of
the   bubble.  The bubble takes up its original position on cooling.
When     the specimen is uniformly heated above the critical point of
carbonic acid, repulsion by heat still takes place.                I
                                                    have repeated this
experiment during the last twelve months an immense number of times,
both with fine jets of warm air and with platinum wires, always with
the same   result.  Another exactly similar cavity being under examina
tion, heat was applied by means of a hot wire spatula. When the edge
of the spatula was seen to approach, there was an instant repulsion
of the bubble from the upper to the lower end, and the liquid carbonic
acid was vaporized.    After removal of the source of heat, the bubble
did not rise     e. apparently
                  (i.          sink) to its original position until after
the liquid had condensed again;      then slowly moved back. This ex

periment was repeated again and again with other bubbles in the same
specimen, aud notes were made each time to secure    truthful record.  a

latter cavity was repelled by heat (no experiment was made to ascertain
whether    itsank on warming), but that in the water-cavity was attracted.
In order that there might be no possible mistake about this, the two
cavities were brought into the field of view at the same time, and the
                                                                           l2

heated spatula approached them both from the same side ; they then
instantly darted in opposite directions.     The movements were unaffected
by raising the temperature   above  the  critical point of carbonic acid. It
is certainly very perplexing to find two cavities in the same section
closely adjacent to each other, and nearly of the same size, the bubbles
in which are moved in opposite directions by the same source of heat
applied from the same side.
Bubbles containing gas at high tension, under different conditions of tempera
        ture, are first repelled and then attracted by a heated body.
   My work was discontinued                for   a    period    of some months   ;   but on
being able to look over my specimens once more,         verified all       I
my former observations, and became surprised by the following dis
covery.  A bubble which was repelled by a gentle heat was attracted
after   it had    been   heated more strongly, and .then on cooling it was
again   repelled.   It      appeared to contain some liquid carbonic acid
floating on water with the gas.        Searching for such other specimens,
the cavity, fig. 6, A, was met with ; it contained a largo proportion of
liquid carbonic acid, with a little in the gaseous state floating on water,
and the bubble is so movable as to act like a spirit-level.   On cautiously
applying a warm   spatula the bubble was  repelled  ; on  heating it a little
more, the liquid carbonic acid became gas, and the bubble was again
repelled. The spatula was then made almost red-hot and applied ; the
bubble was then strongly attracted ; after cooling somewhat it was again
repelled.  It was noticed that after the critical point of the carbonic
acid had been reached, the bubble sank through the water.  It has been
shown by the various experiments already related that at only moderate
temperatures both repulsion and attraction can occur.
   Temperature, then, does not directly cause these opposite effects ; it
can only be some alteration in the conditions of experiment caused by rise
of temperature.  Increase of tension or pressure within the cavity is appa
rently the only condition which has varied-; and probability that this is the
cause of this contradictory attraction is afforded by the following experi
ment.    The specimen was placed in a water-oven (the temperature it
 would there   acquire would be about 94° C. to 06° C.) ; the platinum
 spatula was heated in a beaker of oil to 130° C.   The warm specimen
 insidated by india-rubber was placed on  the microscope-stage, and the
 warm spatula presented to           it,
                               when instant attraction was seen.    The
 Bame proceeding was repeated many times, always with the same                       result.
 As the spatula cooled      it    ceased to affect the bubble at all       ;   of course at
 the same time the specimen was also cooliug.    The spatula at the tem
 perature of 130° C. was applied to the cooled specimen, which was, how
 ever, still at  temperature above 30° C.
                   a                          the effect was repulsion as

in the water-oven, and not that communicated to it by the spatula, caused
attraction.
  To ascertain at what temperature                    attraction       became repulsion, and
vice versa, the specimen was placed upon a Strieker's                     hot stage, and the

  Here let         me explain        that attraction            or repulsion, when expressed             as
being feeble, should really be understood as causing   slow motion.   It             a
was noticed that bubbles without gaseous contents, which were attracted,

   moved with a uniform motion, and were kept at the further ends of the
   cavities until an equilibrium    in temperature had been established, so
   that sometimes the liquid had the deceptive appearance of sinking under
   the rise of temperature.     When gas-bubbles were repelled by heat, their
   speed appeared to be accelerated after they once commenced to move.
      It may   be considered   an argument against the motions being due to
  any pyroelectric conditions of the minerals, that they have been noticed
  in crystals of fluor-spar, and that, no matter in which direction sections
  of rock-crystal are cut, the movements are all equally well obtained.
      Eegarding the repulsion of gas-bubbles t wo facts are striking, namely
  the very slight rise of temperature (less than |° C.) on one side of the
  bubble capable of causing the movement, and the great tension existing
  within the bubble.
                       Note.— Received April 13, 1877.
      I am  much indebted to Prof. Stokes for having furnished an elucidation
 of    the cause of these movements, which is perfectly consistent with all
 the facts which 1 have noticed. In consequence of this       I have discarded
 my own explanations, which were originally embodied in the foregoing
 paper, but which were never perfectly satisfactory to me.
     In notes dated April 7th and 12th Prof. Stokes says : — " It seems to
 me, as far as    I can judge without having seen the specimens, that the
 greater part, if not the whole, of the motions you describe are referable
 to a cause different from that suggested by Prof. Tait, and that they
 depend on capillarity.     We know that the surface-tension of a liquid is
 diminished as the temperature is raised.     The explanation, according to
 this view, would be very similar to Professor James Thomson's beautiful
 explanation of the tears of wine (Eeports of the British Association,
  1855, Eeport 2, p. 16), only here difference of temperature takes the
 place of difference of strength, and the surface of the liquid surrounding
 a bubble shrinks at the cooler side."    The shrinkage of the liquid on the
 cooler side of the bubble of course propels it towards the source of heat.
 This explanation seems quite in accordance with all phenomena of attrac
 tion of bubbles, whether in carbonic acid or in water, with the movement
of water in capillary tubes, and the vibratory movements of minute
bubbles described in the next paper.
     " In the case of a cavity containing water with a bubble of compressed
carbonic acid, the water, of course, containing gas in solution, the repul
sion by heat may be accounted for by a slight evaporation of the dissolved
gas at the surface     weakening the solution, and thereby increasing the
surface-tension ; and it is quite conceivable that at different temperatures
one or other of these opposite effects may prevail."
     Conversely, one can understand how different conditions of gaseous
tension in bubbles, and the extent to which the surrounding water is
charged with gas, may render the effect of heat either repulsion or
attraction.— W. N.     H.

         1877.
     Those who have given great attention to the study of fluid-cavities in
minerals have occasionally met with vibrating particles which are appa
 rently bubbles.
     I  first became acquainted with these at the close of last year, 1875,
 when Mr. P. J. Butler was kind enough to show me a ruby containing
 a cavity partially filled with liquid carbonic acid, the bubble in which,
 when of small size, was in constant motion.           I  was much struck with
 this, and immediately connected it with the motions caused by heat which
 have just been described, but which at that time had not been so fully
 studied.
     During this last summer        I have had the opportunity of examining a
 specimen of felstone from Snowdon, for the loan of which and for a
                                I
 section of the same stone am much indebted to Mr. J. C. Young, F.G-.S.
  This contained portions of quartz with many cavities.           The majority of
  these were water-cavities,     but others appeared to be    empty ; and iu ono
  of them Mr. Young had noticed            a moving particle,   supposed to be a
  bubble, which made its appearance only in a cold atmosphere.             By drop
  ping    a little ether on the  object, the evaporation  cooled  it sufficiently  to
  condense a liquid in the cavity, and the moving particle was easily seen
  with    a maguifying-power      of  400 diameters.      By immersion       in iced
  water, the temperature of which was 30-5 C., the cavity has the appear
  ance of being two thirds filled with a liquid, the gas-bubble of course
  occupying the remaining space and having a sort of trembling motion.
  The bubble decreased in size, and the motion became more and more
  rapid as the size became smaller, until it rushed up and down and across
   the space in which it was confined.          The cavity and the bubble are
   represented in fig. 7 (p. 139) by A, and the course of the bubble during
   rapid motion by C. The thought immediately occurred that this was not
   a gas-bubble, but a liquid in the spheroidal condition — in all proba
   bility carbon dioxide in      a perfectly  dry condition, and perhaps mixed
   with some incondensable gas, so that its critical point was lowered.             A
   considerable number of experiments was necessary in order to arrive
   at a judgment as to whether the moving particle was liquid or gaseous ;
   for if it were the former the particle would diminish by rise of tempera
   ture through evaporation, if the latter through contraction of the bubble
   consequent on expansion of the surrounding liquid.          Variations in tem
   perature caused the following changes : —

    At —14° C. the moving particle appeared to occupy nearly half the
 cavity ; its motion was very slight ; had it not been previously seen in
 rapid motion, it would have been impossible to say with certainty that it
 moved at all.      At —15° C. it was as nearly as possible motionless. It
was now necessary to watch the effect of gravitation upon the particle ;
 for if it be gaseous it will have a tendency towards the upper part of the
 cavity when the liquid condenses, while if it be liquid it will more fre
 quently be observed towards the lower end. In eight out of ten experi
 ments in which the liquid was condensed from the gaseous state, the
 particle took up a position at the top of the cavity.     The microscope was
placed at an angle of 45°, and the stage was rotated partially before each
 experiment in order to avoid examining the specimen in one position
 only.    As, therefore, the spherule is not the fluid with greatest density, it
 is most probably a gas- bubble, and the contents of the cavity are in such
 a state of compression that the liquid expands so as to entirely fill the
 cavity at 18° C. The liquid is doubtless carbon dioxide.          Several other
 cavities of the same kind were noted.
    This shows that in examining rock-sections it is necessary to cool as
 well as warm the specimens.
    The following test gave indisputable evidenco that the moving particle
 was the bubble.      While in rapid motion the bubble was strongly attrac
 ted to the side of the cavity when a body of a slightly higher tempera
 ture was made to approach it. That the liquid which exhibits such mo
 tion need not be a condensed gas is shown by the following facts. A piece
of quartz from the summit of Snowdon abouuded in water-cavities of dif
ferent sizes. Some of these contained a bubble in constant vibratory motion
at 18° C. The size of the cavities was about -gdrns X tttuu u °f an inch, and
 the size of the bubbles ^17^^ of an inch in diameter (see fig. 7, A and B).
The movements were chiefly vibrations up and down, and gentle alterations
in position from right to left.      A platinum spatula was made red-hot
and brought near to the object-glass ; the motion instantly ceased, and
the bubble was seen clinging to the side nearest the heated spatula.         On
changing the position of the spatula the bubble did not immediately move ;
it seemed to require some time for a rise of temperature to overbalance
that which the stone had previously acquired.         From right to left and
from top to bottom the bubble was attracted and made to come to rest.

  When the heating was not         excessive  the bubbles did not become motion
  less, but their vibrations     had a tendency to one side of the cavity,    as  in
  fig. 7,  D and E.
      The larger bubbles in other cavities were likewise attracted. The
  vibrating bubbles were generally seen at or near the top of the cavities.
  Cooled with ether-spray the bubbles ceased vibrating.           The microscope-
 stage    was  inclined  at an angle  of 45° throughout  the experiments.   About
 fifty different cavities, none of them exceeding the dimensions already
 given, all behaved in the same way. There were several moving bubbles
 in cavities a little larger than those already noted; for instance one
 measured TTjV,j x suW °f an mcn- The m°ti°n never extended across
 the cavity, but was confined to a sort of shuffling up and down, which
 shifted the bubble from one side to the other (see fig. 7, D and E). On
 presenting a warm wire to the cavity the bubble was instantly attracted,
 and it remained clinging for some time to the side of the cavity.
     Eor an explanation of the cause of vibration        I must refer to the fact
that    I  have proved, that gas-bubbles in water as well as in carbonic acid
may be attracted by a source of heat giving an extremely slight rise of
temperature.         It is impossible to imagine a body which is not gaining
or losing, or, at the same time, both gaining and losing heat ; it is there
fore impossible to imagine it entirely throughout at a uniform tempera
ture.      It is evident, then, that an easily movable particle which can be
set in motion by exceedingly slight rises of temperature will make the
transference of heat from one point to another plainly visible.      I have shown
that the minute bubbles in fluid-cavities are such particles ; and        I believe
 that the vibratory motions which          I have described afford  an   ocular de
 monstration      of the continual   passage  of heat through solid substances.

     It  is  fortunate    that  smell and taste are generally extremely sen
sitive indicators       of putrefaction in articles of food.      This does not,
however, apply to drinking-water, which may be largely polluted by
putrescent organic impurities without causing any suspicion to our

1877.]              Organic Matter in Potable Water.                      153
senses.    And yet the question of the wholesomeness of water hinges
mainly upon the presence or absence of such putrescent matters, as they
themselves are the cause of derangements of the human system. Most
serious, however, are the consequences when those low forms of organic
life, which in all probability form the specific poison of cholera, typhoid
fever, and other diseases, gain admission to drinking-water polluted by
putrescent matter.
    A number of observations point to the conclusion that these organisms,
or their germs, are not infectious as long as surrounded by fresh organic
matter ; but as soon as fermentation sets in, they show their poisonous
virulence.    Thus it has been observed that the discharges of cholera and
typhoid patients are not infectious      as long as they are fresh, but by
putrescence their poisonous    character  is developed.
    Chemical analysis is incapable of discriminating      between living or
dead, fresh or putrescent organic   matters.    The  microscope reveals their
nature more fully ; but it is nevertheless frequently a matter of great
difficulty to decide as to the existence or non-existence of Bacteria of
putrefaction,  or their germs, in water. It thus appeared to me that this
information might, in some cases at least, be gained with greater cer
tainty by an indirect method.
    If we want  to determine whether a gas be carbonic anhydride, we pass
it through potash bulbs, and see whether these increase in weight. Simi
larly the presence or absence of putrefactive agencies in water may be
 determined by their action upon organic matter.        The test I selected is
 fresh meat, as the slightest  putrescent changes in it can most readily be
 detected by its smell.
    The experiments, which were originally made with a view of deter
 mining the improvement of water by certain filtering media, were, with
 the exception of experiment VIII. , carried out in the following manner :
                                                                            —

                                                A
  some fresh meat.    The  vessel is then filled to about two thirds with the

154                 Mr. Gustav Biscliof       on Putrescent         [Apr. 19,
materials to be experimented upon, and lastly with water.          Into open
ing c a tin tube is fixed, which is first bent upwards and then downwards
in the shape of an inverted U, to prevent any Baeteria or their germs
from passing through this outlet-tube into the bottom of the vessel. The
air-pipe d, down to c, is filled with firmly compressed cotton-wool, and a
glass tube, sealed at its bottom, is passed down through the material experi
mented upon, to allow of the temperature being measured in close
proximity to the meat.       The vessels thus prepared are immersed in a
boiler filled with cold water, which is gradually heated and kept boiling
for several hours. The object of this is to destroy any germs adhering
to the meat.     The temperature at the bottom of the sealed glass tube
was, during the boiling, in each of the following experiments 933-95° C.
    After cooling, the Chelsea Company's water was constantly passed
through the vessels in the direction indicated by arrows, at as nearly as
possible a uniform speed.
    It is thus evident that any Bacteria of putrefaction, or their germs, in
the water would, after a time, render the meat putrid, or, if it remains
fresh, they must have been absent, or at least inactive, when the water
reached the meat.
    I now   proceed to describe the experiments.
    Experiment I. — One of the vessels was filled with spongy (metallic)
iron, and treated as before described ; after a fortnight the meat was
perfectly fresh.
    Experiment II. — A vessel filled with animal charcoal ; after a fortnignt
the meat showed strong evidence of incipient putrefaction.          As experi
ments    I. and II. were conducted side by side, this result proves that tho
preservation of the meat in experiment I. was not due to any external
cause, such as tho low temperature then prevailing.
    Experiment   III. — Water   continuously passed through a vessel filled
with spongy iron for four weeks      ; even then the meat was perfectly fresh
and hard.
    Experiment IV. was a repetition of II., the filtration of water through
animal charcoal being continued for four weeks.        The meat was soft and
quite putrid. In the course of this experiment the exit-tube was several
times choked by mucous matter.
    Experiment V.— In experiments I. and         III. with spongy iron, this
material    was employed without separating any of the fine dust.           In
order to ascertain   whether   Bacteria  were  merely mechanically retained, a
vessel was charged with spongy iron, from which all the finer particles
had been separated by a sieve with thirty holes on the linear inch.       The
filtering medium in this case was therefore of a porous nature.          After
four weeks' filtration the meat was perfectly fresh.
    Experiment VI. — In the previous experiments with spongy iron the
meat was in contact with water, from which the iron in solution had not
been separated. With a view of ascertaining whether the iron in solution

was tho preserving agent, a stoneware vessel was charged underneath the
spongy iron with pyrolusite and sand, so as to abstract the iron from the
water before it came in contact with the meat. After four weeks' filtra
tion the latter was found perfectly fresh.
   Experiment VII. — By a separate experiment                       I
                                                      ascertained that the
oxygen is completely abstracted from water during its passage through
spongy iron. In order to determine whether the absence of oxygen be
the cause of the preservation of the meat, and whether the Bacteria or
their germs be killed or can bo revived when supplied with oxygen, an
evaporating-basin was inverted over the meat. This must have retained
a quantity of air in*its cavity, the air being gradually dissolved by the
water in close proximity to the meat. After four weeks' filtration the
meat was perfectly fresh ;          I
                              succeeded in collecting a small bubble of the
gas, still in the cavity of the evaporating-basin.     This was quite free
from oxygen.
    It   is therefore         whether oxygen was supplied to the water
                         doubtful
sufficiently long to justify any conclusions from this experiment. How
ever, the result of experiment VIII. rendered a repetition unnecessary.
  Experiment VIII. — Fresh meat was placed at the bottom of a glass
vessel and left standing, covered with about four inches of spongy iron
and water.       Tho vessel       in this instance was             not    boiled.   After three
weeks the meat was very bad, demonstrating that the action of the
Bacteria of putrefaction adhering to the meat was not prevented by
the spongy iron above; and              if,
                                during tho previous experiments with
spongy iron, agencies capable of causing putrefaction had at any time
come in contact with the meat (in other words,        the Bacteria had    if
not been killed in their passage through spongy iron), the meat must,
as in this last experiment, have shown marks of their action.      It
therefore  appears that Bacteria are permanently rendered harmless
when passing in water through spongy iron. This conclusion      further               is
corroborated        by
                the observation that even effluent sewage-water, after
passing through the spongy material, has remained perfectly bright for
now five years when exposed to light in     half-filled stoppered bottle.

 I   believe that the actiou of spongy iron on organic matter largely
consists in    reduction of ferric hydrate by organic impurities in water.

 We know that            even    such    organic matter as               straw   or branches   is
 capable    of reducing         ferric to ferrous hydrate.            We know that even
 such     indestructible organic        matter        as      linen and cotton fibres          is
 gradually destroyed        by
                         rust-stains. This action     slow when experi   is

   Before the announcement of Mr. Huggins's discovery of the presence
of bright lines in the spectra of nebulae, was generally, not univer
                                                                it                 if

                            a
vable on account of their great distances from us. This view had become
impressed on the minds of many of our greatest observing astronomers
in the progress of their work, and        one therefore which should not

lightly   be abandoned.
   It appears to me that Mr. Huggins's observations, instead of being
inconsistent with the view formerly held by astronomers, are rather con
firmatory of the correctness of that view.
                                                             by
  The sun        is     known to be surrounded               a       gaseous envelope of very con
siderable extent. Similar envelopes must surround the stars generally.
Conceive a close stellar cluster. Each star,  isolated, would be sur   if
rounded        by
           its own gaseous envelope. These gaseous envelopes might,
in the    case ofcluster, form over the whole, or
                        a                             part of the cluster,  a                   a
continuous mass of gas.     So long as such a cluster was within    certain                a
distance from us, the light from the stellar masses would predominate over
that of the gaseous envelopes. The spectrum would therefore be an
ordinary stellar spectrum.   Suppose such    cluster to be removed further
                                                                a

the proportion of the inverse square of the distance but such would not     ;

 be  the case with the light from the enveloping surface formed by the
 gaseous envelopes.      The light from this envelope received on a slit in the
 focus of an object-glass would be sensibly constant, because the contri
 buting area would be increased in the same proportion that the light
 received from each part is diminished.        The result would be that at some
 definite distance, and all greater distances, the preponderating             light
 received  from such    a cluster would be derived from the gaseous envelopes
 and not from the isolated stellar masses.          The spectrum of the cluster
 would therefore      become   a linear   one, like that   from the gaseous sur
 roundings of our own sun.        The  linear spectrum might, of course, under
 certain circumstances, be seen mixed up with a feeble continuous spec
 trum from the light of the stars themselves.
    It should be noticed that, in this view of the subject, the linear spec
trum can only appear when the resolvability of the cluster is at least
injuriously affected by the light of the           gaseous   envelopes becoming
 sensibly proportional to that from the stellar          masses, and that in the
great majority of such cases it would only be in the light from the irre
solvable portions of the cluster that bright lines could be seen in the
spectrum.
    The changes in form which would be presented to us by such a nebula
might be expected to be small. These changes would depend chiefly
upon changes in the distribution of the stellar masses constituting the
cluster.    It  has always appeared to me difficult      to realize the conditions
under     which   isolated irregular masses of gas, presenting to us sharp
angular points, could exist uncontrolled by any central gravitational mass
without showing larger changes in form than appear to have been the
case with many of the nebulae.        In my view of the nature of nebula? this
difficulty no longer exists.

III. " On some        Figures exhibiting the Motion of Vibrating Bodies,
       and on a New Method for determining the Speed of Machines."
       By Herbert M'Leod, F.C.S., Professor of Experimental
       Science, and George Sydenham Clarke, Lieut. R.E., In
       structor in Geometrical        Drawing in the Royal Indian En
       gineering College, Cooper's Hill.            Communicated hy Prof.

   If  the image of a point of light or of a black dot on a white ground be
observed in a vibrating mirror, the motion of which may be produced by
a tuning-fork or reed, the point, in virtue of the retention of the image
on the retina, will appear as a straight line.        If, however, the luminous
point be moving in a direction at right angles to the plane in which the

 158         Prof. H. M'Leod and Lieut. G. S. Clarke            on  [Apr. 19,
fork vibrates, and parallel to the plane of the mirror, the combination of
 the two rectilinear motions will produce a sinuous line or wave-form.
    The dimensions of this wave will depend on the amplitude of the
vibrations of the fork and on the velocity of movement of the point of
light in relation to the period of the fork : when the rate of translation
of the point is great the wave-length will be great ; with a low velocity
the wave-length will be small.        The greater the amplitude of the vibra
tions of the fork, the greater will be the amplitude of the wave.
    When a series of equidistant points attached to a rotating disk or
cylinder is employed, the properties of the wave differ very much accord
ing to the velocity of the moving disk. If the points are placed in a
circle on a disk or cylinder rotating with such a velocity that the time
occupied by a point in passing over a distance equal to that between two
consecutive points is exactly equal to the period of one complete vibration
of the fork, a continuous stationary figure is perceived ; but if the point
passes over a distance     slightly greater than the intervals, the figure will
show a slow progression in the direction of the moving circle ; and when
the space described by the point is slightly less than the distance between
the points, the motion of the figure will be in the opposite direction.     If
the velocity of the circle is one half of that necessary to produce the sta
tionary wave another stationary figure results, but with half the wave
length of the previous one, the luminous point passing over a distance
equal to the interval between two points during two vibrations of the
fork  ;  the brightness of the wave is also less. Generally, if the time oc
cupied by the point in moving through a distance equal to that between
two consecutive points is an exact multiple of the period of the fork,
stationary waves will be formed ; waves thus produced have been observed
with velocities \, l, \, I, and £ of that necessary to generate the wave-form
first described.
    When the velocity of the moving points is so much increased that the
eye is unable to    follow the movement of the figure, a complex form is pro
duced by the overlapping of several waves ; and at some velocities these
figures may appear stationary, but their complexity usually makes it
difficult to establish their exact form.    Another simple and easily recog-    .
nized figure, however, is observed when the velocity of the moving points
is once and a half as great as that necessary to produce the stationary
single wave. This figure is caused by the overlapping of threo waves
so placed that the crest of one is over the crossing of the other two.
This figure, like the previous one, shows a direct or inverse motion when
the velocity of the points is not exactly that which would produce the
stationary figure.      When the velocity of the points is such that the dis
tance traversed by one point during a complete vibration of the fork is
equal to double the interval between two consecutive points, a figure is
formed by the overlapping of two waves with their crests and hollows
opposed and crossing at the line that would bp described by the points if

the mirror were not vibrating.        When this figure is produced the number
of points passing in a given time is twice the number of vibrations of
the mirror ; this is the most useful form for observation, as it is very
easily recognized.      By still further increasing the rapidity of passage of
the points   a triple figure is again produced when the rate of rotation is
exactly double that which forms the similar figure mentioned previously ;
or, calling the velocity producing the single figure 1, the triple is observed
with a velocity of 1^ and also 3. When the rate is 4, a figure composed
of four overlapping waves is formed.
    It is thus seen that, like the single wave, the triple figure may be pro
duced by more than one velocity — in fact it has been observed with four
                                   f f
distinct velocities, namely, 3, , , and $, taking the velocity producing
the single figure as 1.       Similarly the double figure has been obtained
with a velocity of 2,       and £ ; and the quadruple with the velocities 4
and ^. It is obvious that these are not the only rates capable of form
ing these figures.       Theoretically each may be obtained by an infinite
number of velocities ; and the relation between the number of vibra
tions and the passage of the points may be expressed in the following
terms    : —
    A single wave is formed when a whole number of vibrations takes
place in the time of the passing of a point over one interval.
    A double figure is formed when a whole number of vibrations takes
place in the time of the passing of a point over two intervals, provided
that this whole number is not divisible by two.
    A triple figure is formed when a whole number of vibrations takes
place in the time of passing of a point over three intervals, provided
that the whole number is not divisible by three.
    Lastly, a quadruple figure is formed when a whole number of vibra
 tions takes place in the time of passing of a point over four intervals,
provided that the whole number is not divisible by two or by four.
    Besides the mirror other means may be employed to view these figures :
for instance, they may be observed through a lens attached to one of
 the prongs of the fork, or a real image of the figures may be produced
by the lens and observed with or without a fixed lens.            Instead of a
tuning-fork a reed may be used to carry the mirror or lens.
    From the foregoing it will be seen that the formation of these figures
may be employed for determining the speed of revolution of the disk or
cylinder, if the period of the fork or reed, and also the number of points
on the rotating body, are known.
    For some velocities, indicated by whole numbers per minute, the circle
on the disk or cylinder must be divided into equal intervals ; thus in the
case of a fork vibrating 60 times a second, or 3600 times a minute, it
is necessary that 7200 points should pass in a minute in order to form
the double figure.      If the disk is rotating 100 times a minute, it is clear
that the circle must contain 72 equal intervals; for a velocity of 96

 revolutions   per minute 75 equal intervals ; but for the intermediate
 numbers of rotations fractional numbers of intervals are necessary ; for
 97 revolutions    74-226 intervals are required.    Great difficulties would
 be found   in dividing the circles in this manner ; and the employment of
whole numbers of intervals would be equally inadmissible, 74 intervals,
 for example, corresponding to 97-2973 revolutions.       This difficulty may
 be obviated by ruling on paper convergent lines, and then wrapping the
 paper round a cylinder, so that one of the lines is parallel to the axis.
 In this way circles traced round the cylinder are divided into any required
 parts ; and between those circles, where numbers of equal intervals are
found, there will be every conceivable division between these numbers.
   This method of division- possesses also the great advantage that equal
distances along the cylinder correspond to equal differences of numbers
of rotations : taking the above example, the circles on the cylinder where
72 and 75 equal intervals are found will correspond to 100 and 96 rota
tions respectively ; on dividing the distance between the two rings into
four equal parts, numbers of spaces corresponding to the whole numbers
of rotations, 99, 98, and 97, will be found on the three intermediate
circles.   The lines may now be converted into dots by erasing the portions
not required, or a screen with narrow slits placed in front of the cylinder
will effect the same object.
   Another arrangement may be employed by which fractions of rotations
may be measured.       If the lines are viewed through a narrow slit in a
piece  of  black  paper or thin metal attached to a tuning-fork or reed,
vibrating in a plane parallel to the axis of the cylinder, the figures will be
perceived oh looking through the slit. If the fork be now hioved parallel
to the axis of the cylinder until the figure appears stationary, the numbers
of rotations may bo read off from a graduated scale.
   When the figure is formed on circles, the circumferences of which are
not an exact multiple of the intervals, so that one division is smaller than
the rest, the figure is observed to make a sudden movement or jump at
the time of the passage of the small division. There seems to be no way
of preventing this ; but it is not found to have any practical objection ;
for when the crossings of the double curve remain stationary during the
remainder of the revolution, the proper position on the cylinder has been
obtained. After the jump the figure remains stationary, but in a slightly
altered position.
   In the employment      of the tuning-fork means had to be devised for
readily setting it in vibration : the use of the violin bow is obviously in
convenient ; and this was soon replaced by a fork with the distance be
tween the prongs less at the top than at the bottom, and which was
started in the usual way by drawing a rod between the prongs.             This
mode has ultimately    been replaced by the use of a short piece of soft iron,
carried on an axis fixed between the prongs ; when forced between the
prongs the iron bar opens them to a sufficient extent, and on turning the

  axis rapidly through   90° the bar is placed parallel to the fork, which is
  left vibrating.   This contrivance may be found useful for lecture pur
  poses when large forks are used to show Lissajous' figures.         It may be
  mentioned in passing that two forks without mirrors or lenses may
  readily be brought into unison or into some simple relation by attaching
  to one prong of each a thin piece of black paper with a fine slit. One
  fork is placed vertically and the other horizontally, a fixed lens being
  mounted between them so as to form an image of one slit on the other.
  Light is then passed through one slit ; and on looking through the other
 a square dot of light is seen, which produces'^the Lissajous' figures when
  the forks are in motion.    "With a large fork the influence of the additional
  weight of the paper and attaching gum is imperceptible.
     When a slit on a fork or reed is used together with the rotating cylinder,
 it is necessary to avoid parallax by throwing on the slit an image of the
 lines by means of a lens, and the observation is much facilitated by the
 employment      of a second lens to view the slit.        The reed is placed
 within a box capable of travelling on a fixed bed parallel to the cylinder,
 and the slit is soldered to the reed within the box ; the latter is pierced
 by two holes closed with lenses. Some difficulty was at first experienced
 with the harmonium reed, which was placed in a box small enough to be
 readily movable along the slide, and to which the air had to bo led by a
 flexible tube. The reed requiring a large quantity of air at low pressure
 to cause it to vibrate properly, it was not possible, without the use of
 large bellows and wide eonducting-tubes, to produce the desired effect ;
it also appears essential that the air in contact with the reed should Le
 contained in a chest of considerable dimensions, to permit of sufficient
 compression of the air when the tongue nearly closes the orifice.        After
 numerous failures, a method, which we believe to be novel in this applica
tion, was found quite efficacious, namely, the employment of the principle
of the injeetor or jet-pump.      To the box is fixed a wide brass tube, with
a considerable orifice  in  the side ; at the end of the tube away from the
box is fitted by a cork a glass tube, terminating in a narrow jet 1| millim.
in diameter ; when air is forced through the jet at a pressure about equal
to that of a column of water 20 or 25 ceutims. in height the reed
vibrates perfectly, the mean pressure of the air in the box being equal to
that of a column of water about 1| millim. high.
    Instead of, or together with, the graduated scale along which the box
containing the reed or tuning-fork slides, a scale may be placed on a thin
rule close to the cylinder, the numbers on which are visible simultaneously
with the figures produced by the vibrating slit. This may be of some
advantage when it is necessary to observe rapid changes of velocity.         By
drawing circles round the cylinder corresponding to the divisions of the
scale, any possible error from slight shifting of the scale is obviated.  With
this arrangement it is not even necessary that the reed or tuning-fork
should be near the rotating cylinder ; for if the slit is placed at the focus
                                                                  m2

of the object-glass of    a telescope the observations can be made from a
considerable distance ; this may be useful when a shaft in an inaccessible
situation is the subject of experiment.
    It seemed advisable to determine tbe effect of alterations of temperature
on the period of the fork, which might be so great as to render some cor
rection   necessary.    For this purpose two equal forks provided with
mirrors,   and making about 60 vibrations a second, were enclosed in
wooden boxes containing thermometers, which were placed between the
prongs.    One of the forks was fixed in a vertical position and the other
horizontally, the box containing the latter having its lower side replaced
by two pieces of sheet zinc, separated by a layer of air about half an inch
in thickness.     By the flame of a small gas-burner the temperature of the
air in the box could    be raised to about 60° C.       At the side of each box
was a hole opposite to the mirror, and closed by a plate of glass. The
Lissajous' figure obtained by the reflection of a point of light in the two
mirrors was observed in a small telescope ; and the time required for the
passage of the figure through a whole cycle was determined when the
thermometers indicated different temperatures.           There was some doubt
whether the thermometers gave a true indication of the temperatures of
the forks  ;  but in the series of experiments giving the most concordant
results the heat was applied near one end of the box, and at the greatest
possible distance from the thermometer, in order to set up convection
currents to equalize the temperature of the air and fork as completely as
possible.    It would be no doubt preferable to introduce into each box a
small fan to keep the air in continuous motion ; in all cases the tem
perature was changed very slowly, and a considerable time allowed to
elapse between two observations.        In the last series of nine observations
the differences between the temperatures of the two forks varied from
 9° to 27° C, and from the observed results the increase of the period of
the heated fork for 1° C. was calculated.       The mean loss per minute for
 1° C. amounted to    -4013  vibration in 3600 ; the minimum number being
 •3921, and the maximum -4043.         That is to say, a fork giving 3600 vibra
 tions a minute at the ordinary temperature, would give 3599-6 when the
temperature is raised 1° — a loss of about -011 per cent.           So that if a
 determination of velocity were made at a temperature 20° above that at
 which the fork is giving exactly 3600 vibrations per minute, a correction
 of "22 per cent, would have to be deducted from the number obtained.
     There is some difficulty in determining the exact number of vibrations
 of a large fork ; the difficulty, however, disappears when a graduated
 cylinder or disk is driven with a constant velocity, and the number of
 vibrations per second calculated from the form of the figure produced by
 the fork.    This method has been employed with the forks at present in
 use, and by proper arrangements it can be applied to the determination
 of the numbers of vibrations produced by musical forks ; but up to the
 present we have failed in producing by means of clock-work a rotation

which is sufficiently constant, our most successful results having been
obtained with a six-horse power Corliss engine, with a heavy fly-wheel, in
the workshop of the College.
    Some experiments which promise well have been made with rotating
disks on the principle of the thaumatrope.        By using a rotating disk
with slits, and viewing through them another disk on which appropriate
figures or symbols are marked, the velocity of one can be determined if
that of the other is known.    This principle may possibly be applied with
advantage to determine the relative velocity of two machines, such as the
twin screws of ships.
    Without pretending that the method described in this paper for deter
mining the velocity of rotation will be useful on an extensive scale, we
hope that it may be applicable in some cases of investigation where
accurate observations can be rapidly made without any complex apparatus
or difficult manipulation.   It has the advantage that it can be applied
directly to  a machine  without the intervention   of any gearing, the mere
attaching of a piece of paper to a shaft being all that is necessary.      It
cannot, by giving the machine more work to do, produce any effect on
its rate ; and by the impossibility of slip, it must give accurate results if
the paper is properly mounted in the first instance and the observations
 are properly made.
    Being an optical method for investigating    rotation, we suggest cyclo-
scope as a name for the instrument.

    After reviewing what had   been   published by previous authors on the
origin of chert-beds, and showing that much remained to be done in this
department of petrology, the author proceeded to describe the geological

position of the principal cherty zone of the Carboniferous Limestone of
Ireland, showing that, while bands of chert occur at intervals through
out this formation, the highest beds immediately under " The Toredale
(Shales" are especially      rich in chert, and are frequently entirely   replaced
by this mineral.          In these beds coralline, crinoidal, and other marine
forms were frequently to be recognized by the naked eye.               Thin slices
for microscopic examination, taken from various localities, extending from
tSligo to Carlow, also showed that even the most dense and compact
masses of chert exhibit, under          favourable circumstances, forms belong
ing    to  those   marine    animals    (such as corals, crinoids, foraminifera,
and occasionally mollusks) which build their shells or skeletons of
 carbonate of lime rather than of silica.           The siliceous paste in which
 these forms are enclosed was found to be in a gelatinous state ; and the
 forms were only to be distinguished by difference in depth of shade from
 the paste, the shells or skeletons having disappeared.             The chemical
 analyses    of  these   specimens by     Mr. E.  T. Hardman,   F.C.S.,  tended to
 show that the chert-beds contain various proportions of carbonate of lime
 as  well as other minerals, so that a gradation from siliceous limestone
 into pure chert might be traced.
     From a review of the whole circumstances, it appeared that the origin
 of the chert-beds was to be attributed to the replacement of the original
 limestone or calcareous " ooze," due to organic agency, by silica, and that
 the rock is truly a pseudomorph, a view held by several observers.
     The manner in which this replacement had been brought about was
 then touched upon.          It was shown that there was reason for believing
 that at the close of the period during which the Carboniferous Limestone
 was formed over the area of Central Ireland, the sea-bed was elevated,
 so as to be covered       by the waters of a shallow sea, exposed to the sun's
 rays, and of a warmer temperature than when at a greater depth.                The
 waters appear to have been charged with a more than usual supply of
 silica   in solution, derived      (as Mr. Hardman suggests) from the sur
 rounding     lands,  formed,   for the most part, of highly siliceous materials.
 As silica is less soluble than carbonate of lime, chemical replacement
 would naturally take place, the carbonate of lime being dissolved out
 and its place taken by the silica.        The warm condition of the sea-water,
 its exposure to sunlight, the porous character of the coralline, crinoidal,
 and other forms, and the soft and "oozy" condition of the foraminiferal
 mud would       give easy access to the sea-waters, and a process of silicifi-
  cation would take place analogous to that described by Dr. Martin
  Duncan, F.R.S., as having occurred in the West Indies.
     The paper was accompanied by chemical analyses and photographic
  figures of some of the thin slices, slightly magnified.

    While analyzing the beryl " A " from Ireland, frequently mentioned
in the first part of this investigation*, so many unexpected phenomena
presented themselves that it was found necessary to study carefully all
the processes which have been published for the separation of glucina
from alumina.          On consulting the numerous papers on the subject,
it became apparent that a wide difference of opinion existed among
chemists as to the best method of working. Among the eleven or twelve
methods which have been proposed for the purpose, there are threo
which have been especially employed in the most important researches.
I  place these below, and under each heading will be found the names of
some of the chemists who have used the process, the first in each case
being that of the inventor.

    The following    pages are devoted to a study    of the first of these, namely,
the carbonate-of-ammonium         process.
    The first chemist to take advantage of the solubility of glucina in
carbonate of ammonium, as a means of separating it from alumina, was
Vauquelin, who, in his earliest memoir on the beryl, in which he an
nounces the discovery of glucina t, mentions the fact of its solubility in
a solution of carbonate of ammonium ; but at that time he separated the
two earths by converting the alumina into alum and removing the latter
by    crystallization.    The small proportion of alumina remaining was
separated by     taking advantage of its solubility in a solution of hydrate
of potassium even when          heated,  whereas, under      these circumstances,
glucina is precipitated — Vauquelin thus distinctly being the first to           use
the process now called Gmelin's. In Vauquelin's second memoir, pub
lished in the same volume of the ' Annales de Chimie,' he employed car
bonate of ammonium for the purpose of separating the two earths.                The
various chemists who followed this process for many years after Vau
quelin's time appear to have used it in its simplest form, the directions

given by Hose* (whose name is generally, but incorrectly, given to the
method) being merely to use a sufficiently large quantity of the carbo
nate. He admits that a little alumina is dissolved at the same time.
Wohlert directs the solution of the two earths to                be dropped    very
gradually with constant stirring into an         excess of a warm      concentrated
solution of carbonate of ammonium, which precipitates the alumina
and dissolves the glucina.
    That one extraction with carbonate of ammonium is quite insufficient
 will be seen from the following experiments and considerations.
    The mixed earths (glucina and alumina) from 2-3217 grammes of the
beryl A were precipitated by ammonium hydrate and ammonium sulphide,
and allowed to stand all night in a large excess of carbonate of ammo
nium ; the resulting glucina weighed 0•1806 gramme, or only 7-78 per
 cent, on the beryl, whereas three more extractions raised the percentage
 of glucina to W5o%.
    Again, a mixture was taken of 0-2640 gramme of glucina and 0-8520
 of alumina, the percentage being : —
                             Alumina                 76-34
                             Glucina                 23-66
                                                    100-00
 The mixture was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, neutralized with car
 bonate     of ammonium, and digested for twenty-four hours with
 95 cub. centims. of a saturated solution of carbonate of ammonium
 (sp. gr. 1-080 at 15° C.), or 8-5 cub. centims. for each decigramme of the
 mixed earths.      On acidifying the filtered solution with hydrochloric acid,
 and precipitating with ammonium hydrate and ammonium sulphide, only
 12-75 per cent, of glucina was obtained instead of 23-66.
     But it might be said that the deficiency in the glucina in the experi
 ment quoted arose from the use of an insufficient quantity of carbonate-
 of-ammonium       solution.      To settle this point definitely     the following
 experiments were made         :—
     Experiment I. — 0-1960 gramme of glucina and 0-1812 gramme of
 alumina were dissolved in hydrochloric acid, neutralized by ammonia, and
 treated with 100 cub. centims. of carbonate-of-ammonium solution. This
 is at the rate of about 27 cub. centims. for each decigramme of the mixed
 earths.     A temperature of 65° C. was kept up for five and a half hours,
 the exit-tube    of the flask being closed with a mercurial valve. It was
 found that a pressure of three inches of mercury was sufficient to prevent
 the escape of vapour at the temperature stated.                 The solution was

    It  was now determined to make one more experiment with double the
quantity of carbonate of ammonium used in the last experiment.
    Experiment     II.  — 0-1945 gramme of glucina and 0-1862 gramme of
alumina were dissolved and treated in the cold for twenty hours with
200 cub. centims. of the carbonate-of-ammonium solution.                      This was at
the rate of 52 cub. centims. for each decigramme of the mixed earths.

                                  100-00
 or 6-78 per cent. in      excess.
    It  is not surprising, therefore, after seeing the results of one extrac
tion under such varied conditions, that Damour *, who tried the carbonate-
of-ammonium process in its original form, in his important investigation
of chrysoberyl, rejected it in favour of Gmelin's process, on the ground
that it failed to extract more than 12 out of the 19-75 per cent, of
glucina contained in that mineral.                 Damour, however, obtained more
than     1 per  cent.   less   glucina   in    proportion than was obtained in the
 first experiment quoted above.                  The two results are, nevertheless,
 remarkably     close,    and    confirm     the  assertion that one treatment with
 carbonate of ammonium conducted in the manner described is quite
 inadequate to extract all the glucina from a mixture of the two earths.
     Joy t, in opposition to Damour, condemns Gmelin's process as giving
 in his hands too low a percentage of glucina in spite of every precaution.
 Weeren+, who followed Berzelius's method, condemns the carbonate-of-
 ammonium process on exactly the opposite ground to Damour, namely,
 because although alumina per se is, he says, insoluble in carbonate of
 ammonium, it is soluble in the presence of glucina, and thus gives too
 high a number for the latter.            I   admit that alumina, under certain cir-

on that the     fact  does  not prevent      fairly  accurate   rosults    being obtained
if certain precautions be observed.             This tendency of the earths, when
mixed, to modify each other's reactions is seen also in their behaviour
with carbonate of barium.            I have, however, never found the carbonate-
of-ammonium process           to   give too high a number for the glucina, for
reasons which are fully discussed further on.
   Hofmeister *, who has made more important and elaborate observa
tions on the carbonate-of-annnonium               process than any other chemist,
condemns      Gmelin's     process   on  the   ground that in the treatment with
potassium hydrate alumina accompanies the glucinat.                     He also endorses
the statement       of  W  eeren   and   others,   that alumina      is soluble in carbo
nate of ammonium in presence of glucina, but shows that this circum
stance is not fatal to the prooess         if  a systematic      fractional   treatment is
employed.
    Hofmeister admits that his method is not                 easy to describe ; and,    in
fact,  it is  so operose that       the reader must       be referred      to the original
memoir for the details.           There can be no doubt that              when carefully
followed it affords reliable results.          I   shall endeavour to show further
on that the carbonate-of-ammonium                   process is capable of yielding
accurate numbers when employed in a simpler manner.
    From what has been said, it will readily bo seen that the two processes
I  have alluded to are condemned by different experimenters on diame
trically opposite grounds ; and it seems to me that, as is usually the case
under such circumstances, the whole question resolves itself into one of
manipulation.        This being assumed, it became necessary (in order to
ascertain the causes of the conflicting statements of the numerous
chemists who have subjected emeralds and beryls to analysis) to make a
rigorous examination of the behaviour of gluciua with solution of car
bonate of ammonium.             This has entailed much work, as have taken  I
most    of  the  statements    of  the chemists who have worked on the subject
and examined them carefully and repeatedly by experiment.
    The following are the principal questions or problems which                     I have
endeavoured to solve : —
    1.  Is glucina permanently soluble in            a solution    of cajbonate of     am
          monium     ?
    2. Does glucina       confor its solubility on alumina            ? or does alumina
           confer its insolubility on glucina ?
    3. With what amount of accuracy can a mixture                         of glucina and
           alumina be separated by means of carbonate of ammonium ?
    4. How do solutions of glucina and alumina behave with carbonate of
          barium ?

1.   Is Glucina permanently       soluble  in  a solution of Carbonate of Ammonium         1
    This question is of paramount importance, because                    if   glucina once
dissolved in carbonate of ammonium is liable to assume an insoluble con
dition and separate from the solution, it introduces a complication into
the process, the effect of which it is difficult to estimate.                     The only
chemist, as far as        I  am aware, who asserts that glucina separates out
under the circumstances named is              Joy*,   who states that       "  If the solu
tion be kept longer than ten days a precipitate of carbonate of glucina
will begin to form, and at the expiration of sixteen days 15 per cent.
less of the original amount will go (sic) into solution,"                   This assertion
                                                              I
of Joy's caused mo some perplexity at first, as had during many years
repeatedly dissolved glucina in solution of carbonate of ammonium, but
I had never      observed a deposit to take place unless             I  had reason to sus-
pect the presence of alumina.          I  therefore resolved to submit pure glucina
and mixtures of that earth with alumina to repeated quantitative ex
periments, with the view of deciding the question.
     Experiment I. — 0-6943 gramme of glucina, which had already been
partially purified by solution in carbonate of ammonium, was dissolved
in hydrochloric acid ; ammonium hydrate was then dropped in until the
solution was very nearly neutral, and 138 cub. centims. of solution of
carbonate of ammonium were addedt. At first nearly every thing was
 dissolved, but a precipitate soon commenced to form.                       This is quite
 characteristic of the presence of alumina.             The solution was filtered next
 day, and the precipitate was collected, washed, dried, and burnt with all
the usual precautions.          The weight of the alumina was 0-0058 gramme,
 or 0-84 per cent. on the glucina taken. The solution was put aside in a
 well-stoppered bottle, as        I intended to filter it in sixteen days ; but as
 much more than that time passed without a precipitate forming, it was
 put carefully away for three years. At the end of this time the bottle,
on being shaken, showed a barely perceptible trace of deposit ; neverthe
 less  it was filtered off with every precaution and was found to weigh
 0-0038 gramme, or 0-55 per cent. ; and this was probably partly alumina
 and partly silicate, arising from a slight decomposition which had taken
 place of the glass of the bottle.
     Experiment II. — 0-2140 gramme of the glucina which had remained
 three years in solution was next experimented on. The, earth was dis
 solved and treated as before with 50 cub. centims. of carbonate-pf-anuno-
 nium solution.        In  ten minutes after being well agitated all but a few
 imponderable flocks were dissolved.              In fifty minutes they were scarcely
 visible.     Two days after, they had totally disappeared. In 16 days, the
 period    at  which Joy says 15 per cent. less of the glucina will remain in
 solution, the liquid was filtered         and yielded 0'0023 gramme of precipi-
     * Lac. at. p. 89.
     t The solution of carbonate of ammonium used in these experiments            was always
  of the same strength, i. e. a cold saturated solution, sp. gr. 1-080.

 tate, or T07 per cent., a quantity which            might partly arise from in
 sufficient washing, partly from a variation         from the mean weight in the
 filter ash, and also from       a trace of alumina.
     Experiment III. — 0-1603 gramme of glucina, known to contain             a little
 alumina, was dissolved         in hydrochloric acid, neutralized as usual, and
 treated with 50 cub. centims. of solution of carbonate of ammonium. The
 residue of alumina weighed 0-0071.             In two days 0-0067 gramme more
 was obtained.         On filtering 16 days afterwards only 0-0017 gramme,
 or 1-06 per cent., was obtained. In one year after that time the solu
 tion    was again filtered, the deposit weighed 0-0012 gramme, or
 0-75 per cent., being only one third of the weight of the ash of one
 filter paper.
     Experiment IV. — 0-3846 gramme of pure glucina was treated in the
 usual manner with 80 cub. centims. of carbonate-of-ammonium solution.
 The whole dissolved perfectly in a few minutes.             The solution was kept
 for three weeks and then filtered. The precipitate weighed 0-0003 gramme,
 or 0-08 per cent., after deducting the filter ash. If it were necessary
 these examples could be multiplied ; but they seem amply sufficient to
 enable an answer to be given to the question at the head of this section.
 We may therefore affirm unhesitatingly that one decigramme of pure
glucina is permanently soluble in 25 cub. centims. of a saturated solution of
 carbonate    of ammonium.
     It was necessary, in order to make these experiments complete, to
 ascertain whether great variations in temperature influenced the solubility
 of glucina in solution of carbonate of ammonium.                That glucina was
 permanently soluble at about         15° C. there remained no doubt ; but there
 might still be a tendency in glucina to assume an insoluble form at higher
temperatures.        To determine this question it was essential to use a tem
perature many degrees higher than that ever reached by the atmosphere.
For this purpose 4 decigrammes of pure glucina were dissolved in the
 usual way in 100 cub. centims. of solution of carbonate of ammonium.
 15 cub. centims. of this solution were transferred          to a glass tube, which
was then sealed and heated to 100° for two days.              The solution remained
perfectly clear.
      2. Does Glucina confer its solubility on Alumina ? or does        Alumina
                          confer its insolubility on Glucina ?
    It  is very   easy  to come     to an erroneous     conclusion   on this point,
because    if a mixture    of the two earths in solution      of carbonate of am
monium be filtered at once a certain amount of alumina will, in that case,
pass through the filter ; but it settles out in a short time, and, if glucina
be present,     it will be accompanied by some of that earth.
    The following experiment was made to affix a quantitative value to

     0-5000 gramme of pure alumina was dissolved in hydrochloric acid
and precipitated (after neutralization with carbonate of ammonium) with
100 cub. centims. of solution of the carbonate.            The whole was thrown
on a filter at once.      The contents of the filter were washed, dried, and
ignited.     The alumina which had precipitated at once weighed 0-4702
gramme.        The filtrate, on standing twenty-four hours, had yielded a
deposit weighing 0-0281 gramme.            These numbers, reduced to percentages,
are as follows : —

It    was considered    that the question whether glucina confers its solu
bility on alumina would        be best answered by treating with carbonate of
ammonium a mixture containing a great excess of glucina.
     Experiment I. — A mixture was therefore made of 0-2500 gramme of
 glucina and 0-0250 gramme of alumina.                It was dissolved in hydro
 chloric acid, and the excess of acid was removed by evaporation ; 50 cub.
 centims. of carbonate-of-ammonium           solution were then added. The pre
 cipitate at first formed entirely redissolved in a few minutes, but the
 alumina commenced to deposit in about fifteen minutes afterwards.                The
 mixture     was allowed    to stand      for twenty-four hours and         was  then
 filtered.    The precipitate of alumina containing glucina weighed 0-0323
 gramme.        The glucina recovered from the solution weighed 0-2407
 gramme    ;  or, per cent. : —

     The glucina, although in such great excess, had therefore, under the
 circumstances indicated, not conferred its solubility on the alumina ; but,
 on the contrary,       the   alumina     had  conferred    its insolubility on    the
 glucina.
     Experiment II. — The alumina obtained in the manner described was
 redissolved, reprecipitated, and again treated with 25 cub. centims. of
 carbonate-of-ammonium           solution for twenty-four hours.         The glucina
 had now increased to 0-2432, and the alumina                 diminished   to 0-0298.
 The composition of the mixture,            as  found after two extractions, was
 therefore as follows : —

After two extractions      the alumina    therefore still retained nearly 2 per
cent, of glucina.
   Experiment    III. — Although these results seemed conclusive as far as
they went,   I resolved to repeat the experiment with a mixture containing
a still greater excess of glucina, because it appeared especially important
in an inquiry of this kind to know the behaviour towards a solution of
carbonate of ammonium of glucina containing a comparatively small
proportion of alumina.          For this purpose a mixture was taken of
1 gramme of glucina and 3 centigrammes of alumina ; it was dissolved as
usual, precipitated in the form of carbonates of the earths, and treated with
100 cub. centiins. of solution of carbonate of ammonium.            The earths dis
solved entirely at first; but, small as the quantity of alumina was, the solu
tion began t o get turbid in about ten minutes.     The mixture was left in the
cold for twenty hours.       The residue of alumina containing glucina was
then filtered off, treated in the usual manner, and weighed.            The glncina
recovered from the solution weighed 0-9840 gramme.

Alumina, therefore, even when mixed with glucina to the small extent
of 3 per cent., renders some of the latter insoluble ; this, then, is a
distinct answer to the question at the head of the section.
 3. With what amsuttt of accuracy can a mixture of Qlv.cwa and Alumina
             be separated by means of Carbonate of Ammonium ?
   The fact that alumina confers its insolubility on glucina is the cause
of the difficulties that have been found in tie separation of the two
earths.    "We have seen    that, under   the conditions    indicated, one treat
ment with carbonate of ammonium is insufficient to dissolve the glucina
out from such a mixture.         I  wish, however, to guard myself from ap
pearing to express the opinion that it would be impossible, by a modifi
cation of the process, to effect the separation at one operation, as, in
fact, I am engaged at the present moment in an attempt to solve that
problem.
   In order to ascertain the number of times that it would be necessarr
to treat the insoluble residue with carbonate of ammonium, iu order to
extract all the glucina, the following experiments were made.

the process was tried.      The mixture was dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
the excess of acid was neutralized with ammonia, and 200 cub. centims.
of a warm solution of ammonium carbonate were added. The solution
was stirred briskly for five minutes, and then filtered off rapidly.         The
precipitate was only washed moderately so as not to dilute the filtrate
too much. The filtrate was allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, the
deposit was filtered off, added to the first residue, dissolved with it in

became necessary to examine the behaviour                        of the two earths with that re
agent, especially since, as happens so frequently in the literature relating to
glucina, there      difference of opinion among chemists upon the subject.

       *states that solutions of glucina are not precipitated in the cold                       ;

              t
cold digestion.   This   at variance with the observations of AwdejewJ,
                               is
who states that only partial precipitation takes place in the cold, but that

is only partially precipitated in the cold by carbonate of barium, a soluble
basic nitrate remaining in solution, but that the precipitation is com
pleted on boiling.     To study this subject quantitatively     I made the fol
lowing experiments.
      Experiment  I. — Precipitation of Alumina in    the cold by Carbonate
                                    of Barium .
    0-8034 gramme of pure alumina was dissolved in hydrochloric acid.
The solution was nearly neutralized with carbonate of sodium, and an
excess of carbonate of barium, made into a cream with water, was added.
After standing twelve hours the precipitate was collected, washed and
dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The solution was then boiled and preci
pitated with an excess of sulphuric acid. The sulphate of barium was
filtered off with the usual precautions, and the filtrate was precipitated
by ammonia.      The precipitate was thoroughly washed, dried, and ignited ;
it weighed 0-8005 gramme, or 99-64 per cent. on the original alumina.
Alumina is therefore completely precipitated in the cold by carbonate of
barium.
      Experiment  II. —Precipitation    of Glucina in the cold by Carbonate
                                   of Barium.
    0-5175 gramme of pure glucina were dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
and treated precisely as the alumina had been in the last experiment.
The precipitate weighed 0-1070 gramme, or 20-68 per cent, on the original
glucina.    This result, therefore, confirms the observation of Awdejew,
that glucina is only imperfectly precipitated by carbonate of barium in
the cold, and, under the circumstances indicated, behaves like the nitrate
in Ordway's experiments.
    Experiment  III. — Precipitation   of a mixture of Glucina and Alumina
                      in the cold by  Carbonate of Barium.
    0-2096 gramme of pure alumina and 0-2055 of pure glucina were dis
solved in hydrochloric acid and treated precisely like the alumina in Ex
periment I. The precipitate of the mixed earths weighed 0-3874 gramme,
or 93-33 per cent, on the original weight. Alumina, therefore, in this
case, as  in the experiments with carbonate of ammonium, communicates
much of its insolubility to the glucina.
    Assuming only the portion precipitated by carbonate of barium to be
accounted for in the analysis of a beryl containing 28-89 per cent, of the
mixed earths, only 26-96 would be obtained, the loss being 6-67 per cent.,
which, as we have seen, would fall chiefly upon the glucina, if the opera
tion were conducted in the cold. This loss is, however, variable, and
appears to depend, to some extent, upon the relative proportions of the
two earths.

      on the Otheoscope."    By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c. Re
      ceived April 23, 1877.
  I communicated    to the Royal Society in November last an account of
some radiometers which                 I
                              had made with the object of putting to
                      the " molecular  pressure

                                                  theory of the repulsion
experimental proof
resulting from radiation.   Continuing these researches, have constructed   I
other instruments,            in which       a movable fly is caused            to rotate by the
molecular pressure generated on fixed parts of the apparatus.
  In the radiometer, the surface which produces the molecular               distur
bance is mounted             on a    fly, and is driven backwards by the excess of
pressure between it and the sides of the containing vessel.    Regarding
the radiometer as a heat-engine, it is seen to be imperfect in many re
spects.  The black or driving surface, corresponding to the heater of the
engine, being also part of the moving fly, is restricted as to weight,
material, and area of surface.                   It
                                    must be of the lightest possible con
struction, or friction will greatly interfere with its movement ; it must
not expose much surface, or it will be too heavy ; and it must be a very
bad conductor of heat, so as to retain the excess of pressure on one side.
Again, the part corresponding to the cooler of the engine (the side of
the glass bulb) admits of but little modification. It must almost neces
sarily be of glass, by no means the best material for the purpose ; it is
obliged to be of one particular shape ; and it cannot be brought very near
the driving surface.
   A perfect instrument would be one in which the heater was stationary ;
it might then           be of the most suitable material, of sufficient area          of surface,
and of the most efficient shape, irrespective of weight. The cooler should
be the part which moves ; it should be as close as possible to the heater,
and of the best size, shape, and weight for utilizing the force impinging
on it.   By having the driving surface of large size, and making it of a
good   conductor of heat, such as silver, gold, or copper, a very faint amount
of incident radiation suffices to produce motion.     The black surface acts as
if a molecular* wind were blowing from                         it,
                                                    principally in    direction      a
normal to the surface.             This wind blows away whatever easily movable
body happens to be           in front of     it,
                                          irrespective of colour, shape, or material              ;
and in its capability of deflection from one surface to another, its arrest
by solid bodies, and its tangential action,  behaves in most respects like
                                                            it

 ment as the one here sketched out is capable of an almost endless variety
  of forms ; and as it is essentially different in its construction and mode
 of action to the radiometer,         I   propose to identify it by a distinctive
 name, and call it the Otheoscope (wdew,           I propel).
     The glass bulb is an essential portion of the machinery of the radio
 meter, without which the fly would not move ; but in the otheoscope the
 glass vessel simply acts as a preserver of the requsite amount of rarefac
 tion. Carry a radiometer to a point in space where the atmospheric pressure
 is equal to, say, one millimetre of mercury, and remove the glass bulb ;
the fly will not move, however strong the incident radiation.              But place
 the otheoscope in the same conditions, and it will move as well without
 the case as with it.
     In                                                  I
        the preliminary note already referred to*, described a piece of appa
ratus by which       I was able to measure the thickness of the layer of mole
 cular pressure generated when radiation impinged on a blackened surface
at any degree of exhaustion.          At the ordinary density of the atmosphere
 the existence of this molecular disturbance was detected several millimetres
 off, and its intensity increased largely as the generatiug surface and mov
able plate were brought closer together.            It would be possible, therefore,
to construct an otheoscope in which no rarefaction or containing vessel
was necessary, but in which motion would take place in air at the normal
density    t.   Such a heat-engine       would probably work very well in sun
light.
    Aided by the mechanical dexterity of my assistant, Mr. C.           H. Giming-
ham,    I  have   constructed    several varieties of otheoscope. These will be
exhibited at the Soiree of the Royal Society on Wednesday next, as
illustrations of the very beautiful manner in which, at this stage of my
investigations,     theory and experiment proceed hand in hand, alternately
assisting each other, and enlarging          our knowledge of these laws of mole
cular    movement      which constitute      a key to the relations    of force and
matter.
    The following is a list of the otheoscopes        I have already made, together
with some new experimental radiometers, which will be exhibited for the
first time on Wednesday : —
    1. Otheoscope. —A four-armed        fly, carrying four vanes of thin clear mica,
is mounted like a radiometer in an exhausted glass bulb.                At one side
of the bulb a plate of mica blacked one side is fastened in a vertical plane,
in such a position that each clear vane in rotating shall pass the plate,
leaving a space between of about a millimetre.              If a candle is brought
near, and by means of a shade the light is allowed to fall only on the
clear vanes, no motion is produced ; but if the light shines on the black

plate, the fly instantly rotates as if a wind were issuing from this surface,
and keeps on moving as long as the light is near.
   2. Otheoscope. — A four-armed     fly carries roasted mica vanes, and is
mounted in an exhausted glass bulb like a radiometer.           Fixed to the
side of the bulb are three plates of clear mica, equidistant from each
other in a vertical plane, but oblique to the axis. A candle brought near
the fixed plates generates molecular pressure, which, falling obliquely on
the fly, causes it to rotate.
   3. Otheoscope. — A large horizontal disk revolving by the molecular
disturbance on the surface of inclined metallic vanes, which are blacked
on both sides in order to absorb the maximum amount of radiation.
     4.   Otheoscope. — Inclined    aluminium         by the molecular
                                                    vanes   driven
disturbance from the fixed black mica disk below, blowing (so to speak)
through them.
   5. Otheoscope. — A large horizontal coloured disk of roasted mica, driven
by inclined aluminium vanes placed underneath it.
   6. Otheoscope. — A bright aluminium disk cut in segments, and each
segment turned at an angle, driven by a similar one below of lampblacked
silver.
   7. Rudiometer. — A vertical radiometer, made with eight disks of mica
blacked on one side, and the whole suspended on a horizontal axis which
works in two glass cups. The motion of the radiometer is assisted on
each side by     driving   vanes   of aluminium blacked on one side.
     8. Radiometer. — A vertical turbine radiometer, the oval vanes      of roasted
mica blacked on one side.
  9. Radiometer. — A spiral radiometer of roasted mica blacked on the
upper side.
   10. Radiometer of large size, showing great sensitiveness.
   11. Radiometer. — A two-disk radiometer, the fly carrying roasted
mica disks blacked on one side ; in front of each black surface is fixed a
large disk of thin clear mica. The molecular disturbance set up on the
black surface, and streaming from            it,

   12. Radiometer. — A two-disk radiometer, the fly carrying roasted
mica disks blacked on one side, similar to No. 11, but with large clear

reflected backwards        by   the second

   13. Radiometer. — A two-disk, cup-shaped, aluminium radiometer,
                                                                          facing
opposite ways; both sides bright.        Exposed to        standard candle 3-5
                                                                 a

3-37 seconds.   A screen placed in front, so as to let the light shine only
on  the convex surface, produces repulsion of the
                                                      latter, causing con
tinuous rotation at the rate of one revolution in
                                                  7-5 seconds.    When the

convex side is screened off, so as to let the light shine only on the con
cave, continuous rotation is produced at the rate of one revolution in
6-95 seconds, the concave side being apparently attracted.       These experi
ments show that the repulsive action of radiation on the convex side is
about equal to the attractive action of radiation on the concave side, and
that the double speed with which the fly moves when no screen is inter
posed is the sum of the attractive and repulsive actions.
    14. Radiometer. — A two-disk, cup-shaped, aluminium radiometer, lamp-
blacked on the concave surfaces.     In this instrument the usual action of
light is reversed, rotation taking place, the bright convex side being
repelled, and the black concave attracted.      When the light shines only
on the bright convex side, no movement is produced ; but when it shines
on the black concave side, this is attracted, producing rotation.
    15. Radiometer. —A cup-shaped      radiometer  similar to the above,    but
having the convex surfaces black and the concave bright.        Light shining
on this instrument causes it to rotate rapidly, the convex black being
repelled.    No movement is produced on letting the light shine on the
bright concave surface, but good rotation is produced when only the
black convex surface is illuminated.
    16. Radiometer. — A multiple-disk, cup-shaped, turbine radiometer,
bright on both sides, working by the action of warm water below and the
cooling effect of the air above.
    17. Radiometer. —A four-armed, metallic radiometer with deep cups,
bright on both    sides.
    18. Radiometer.   — A four-armed radiometer, the     vanes   consisting   of
mica cups, bright on both sides.
    19. Radiometer. — A four-armed    radiometer having     clear mica vanes,
the direction of motion being determined by the angle formed by the
mica vanes with the inner surface of the glass bulb.
 IV. " On     the Inferences to be drawn from the Appearance of
       Bright Lines in the Spectra of Irresolvable Nebulae."                 By
       William Huggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S. Received April
       26, 1877.
    In a paper recently read before the Royal Society, Mr. Stone attempts
 to show that the fact that the spectra of some of the irresolvable nebulas
 consist mainly of bright lines does not warrant the inference that these
 bodies are of a constitution different from our sun and the generality of
 the fixed stars, and consist mainly of glowing gas, so far, at least, as the
 light-giving portion of them is concerned.
    Waiving for the present the objections which may bo urged against
 Mr. Stone's reasoning, let us consider the question in the light of the
 results afforded by actual observation.

180              On Bright Lines in the Spectra of Nebula.                 [Apr. 26,
   There are not found in the spectra of different nebulas the differences
of relative brightness of the bright lines and of the continuous spectrum
which would be expected on Mr. Stone's hypothesis.
   The star-clusters which are just within the resolving-power                 of the
largest telescopes do not give, even faintly, a spectrum of bright lines.
   The same bright lines appear to be common to all the nebulae which
give a bright-line spectrum.           On Mr. Stone's view, differences in the
constitution of the enclosing atmospheres of different star-groups would
be probable.
   On this point        I  may be permitted, perhaps, to add the following
sentences from my paper " On the Spectra of some of the Nebulae"* : —
   " It is indeed possible that suns endowed with these peculiar conditions
of luminosity (giving bright-line spectra) may exist, and that these bodies
are clusters     of such suns.        There are, however, some considerations,
especially   in the   case  of planetary nebulae, which are scarcely in accord
ance with the opinion that they are clusters of suns.            Sir John Herschel
remarks of one of this class, in reference to the absence of central con
densation : — ' Such an appearance would not be presented by a globular
space uniformly filled with stars or luminous matter, which structure
would necessarily give rise to an apparent increase of brightness towards
the centre, in proportion to the thickness traversed by the visual ray.
We might therefore be inclined to conclude its real constitution to be
either that of a hollow spherical shell, or of a flat disk presented to us
(by a highly improbable coincidence) in a plane precisely perpendicular
to the visual   ray't.
   " This  absence     of condensation admits of explanation without recourse
to the supposition of a shell or flat disk, if we consider them to be masses
of glowing gas.        For supposing, as we probably must do, that the whole
mass of the gas is luminous, yet it would follow, by the law which results
from the investigations of Kirchhoff, that the light emitted by the por
tions of gas beyond the surface visible to us would be in great measure,
if not wholly, absorbed by the portion of gas through which it would
have to pass ; and for this reason there would be presented to us a
luminous surface only"+.
   It appears, therefore, that the results of observation do not accord well
with  Mr. Stone's theory.
   But the theory itself appears open to grave objections.              It is obvious
(and  was   strongly    insisted upon     by Prof.  Stokes in remarks    made when
the paper was read) that in a star-cluster in which the stars are sur
rounded by self-luminous atmospheres, the proportion between the sum
total of the light from the stars and the light from the atmospheres will be
independent of the distance of the cluster from us. Unless, then, we sup-

pose that the   light received from our own sun is but a fraction of the
total light received from a supposed atmosphere of enormous extent sur
rounding him (a supposition which needs only to be stated to be rejected),
instead of constituting the main portion of the total light, it follows that
the total light received from a distant cluster formed of stars at all
resembling our own sun must mainly come from the stars themselves.
If,   then,   it   be true, as        it undoubtedly        is,   and as   Mr. Stone   has urged,
that at a sufficient distance the light from any individual star    insigni            is
ficant, while that from the cluster as a whole (both stars and atmospheres)
is not, this can only be               by
                             the distance being so great that the small but
finite solid angle subtended                  by

of the stars       ;   and   if   this be admitted,       Mr. Stone's reasoning falls to the
ground.

                                     Part I.
    These investigations were made in order to learn how the temperature
of the body comports itself in health ; since to every one it must be
obvious that without such knowledge it is impossible to determine with
any approach to certainty what variations in the temperature are to be
accepted as indications of disease.
    It is necessary to state here some particulars of the manner these
investigations were conducted, and of the precautions taken to avoid
error.
    The subjects of our observations were confined to bed during the
times when the investigations, continued on some occasions for seve
ral days, were made. They were well covered with bed-clothes, and,
indeed, as far as possible throughout the time they remained in bed, were
kept under the same conditions, so that any alterations in their tem
perature could not be ascribed to any exposure, or to any variation in
the temperature of the room, or to other accidental and preventable
causes.
    The thermometer was generally placed in the axilla, though on some
occasions the temperature of the mouth under the tongue and of the
 rectum was noted at the same time. These observations are sufficiently
 numerous to enable us to say that, due care being taken and sufficient
 time allowed, the temperature of the axilla is always identical with that
 of the mouth and with that of the rectum, four to six inches above its
termination.
    A  non-registering thermometer was retained in the axilla and read in
situ until the- completion of each series of these observations ; and the
 temperature was noted hourly, or nearly so, from 9 a.m. to a late hour
 in the evening, usually to 12 p.m. On some days hourly observations
 were made during both night and day. The time of taking food and
 the kind and quantity were always accurately recorded.
    It is well to mention that some of the persons who were the subjects
 of this investigation were convalescents from various diseases, but had
 fairly recovered, and might be considered to be in tolerably good health.
    That the subsequent remarks may be more clearly understood, we first
 give a short account of the general course the temperature followed in
 one of the boys whose case is recorded in this paper ; and to render the
 account more intelligible, we attach a chart of his temperature variations,
 taken hourly for two entire days.
           * Read February 11, 1869.  See Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xvii. p. 287.


  188          Prof. S. Ringer and Mr. A. P. Stuart on the
    This chart indicates that the temperature does not remain at about the
 same degree throughout the day and night, but shows that a considerable
 diurnal variation occurs. The temperature reaches its highest point at
 about 9 a.m., and continues much the same during the chief part of the
 day ; while in the evening it uniformly and greatly falls and remains at
 its lowest depression during several hours of the night ; but subse
 quently, in the early morning hours, it again uniformly and quickly rises.
 This diurnal rise and fall constitutes the only great variations.
    We now pass on to speak first of the observations, continued hourly
 without any intermission throughout the day and night, made on two
 lads, named respectively Alfred Mountain and Alfred Rundell.                          By
 adopting this plan we shall learn what conclusions we may safely draw
 from those less complete observations which were discontinued at
 12 P.M.
    Alfred Mountain was twelve years of age, of a robust build, well
 nourished and hearty.           He had a patch of tinea decalvans, with which
 exception  he  was   in  perfect health.
    The other lad, Alfred Rundell, thirteen years old, was of a rather
 delicate constitution, but he had a good appetite and was in his accus
tomed health.
    To render our statement the more clear, and to enable our readers to
judge for themselves of the correctness of the conclusions arrived at, we
have thrown all the results of the observations into the form of Tables,
but the details are recorded at the end of this section t.
    In the first column of the following Table is given the name of the
boy ; in the second the time the observation lasted ; in the third the
maximum temperature of the day ; in the fourth the amount of diurnal
variation ; in the fifth the hour when the evening fall began ; and in the
sixth column the hour of the commencement of the morning rise.

    This Table shows the results of observations made hourly during both
night and day, for eight days. On the four days denoted by an asterisk

  It   thus appears that the diurnal variation                       in the temperature of boys

    In  this Table we have not restricted ourselves to the observations con
 tinued during both day and night, but have used other observations in
 which the temperature was noted only till a late hour in the evening, as
 these, it is obvious, may be fairly used for our present purpose.
    This Table proves, still more strongly than           a foregoing one, that if our
 observations     are continued       till 8 p.m. our   observations will include the
 maximum daily temperature of the day in boys of the age of these lads.
    It shows also that in persons of their age the evening fall usually
 begins between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. ; but it likewise shows that exceptions
 occur, for the evening fall may begin either before or after the time
 stated. The fall, however, happens more frequently before than after.
                      The   Hour  when the      Morning Rise   begins.
    This varies greatly.       Thus on
                4 days this began at                                  3 a.m.
                1  day    »      »                                    4     „

    From this we may conclude that in lads of about 12 years old the
morning rise usually begins between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m.
    The chief part of the rise was completed by 9 a.m. After this hour the
temperature usually remained at much the same height, until the evening
fall began.     Thus on
      4 days the temperature remained much the same
                                                 from 9 a.m. to 5   p.m.   =8 hours.

    On one day the temperature remained much the same from 8 a.m. to
1 p.m., then     fell very slowly till 8 p.m. ; afterwards the fall was much
more rapid.
    Hence it would appear that in boys of the age of 12 the temperature
continues at about its maximum for 7 to 8 hours.
            The Time at which the         Maximum     Depression   was reached
varied greatly in these lads.           Thus on
               1 day it was reached at                               7 p.m.

                   Temperature of the Human Body in Health.                  191
      On six of these eight days the lowest temperature of the day was
  reached by 12 p.m. ; on two days this was not attained until 1 a.m. ; but
  the fall in the temperature after 12 p.m. on these two occasions was but
  slight, in each case amounting to only 0°-4 Fahr.
      It thus appears that if in other persons of about the age of these lads
  our observations be continued till 12 p.m., we shall obtain the whole, or
 nearly the whole, of the daily variation of the body temperature.
      The temperature does not begin to rise immediately after its minimum
  has been    reached, but remains at about its lowest point during several
 hours before the morning rise begins ; thus on
                 2 days it remained at about its minimum    2 hours.

      We thus see that in these observations the maximum depression is
 usually of shorter duration than the maximum elevation.
     Thus we have learned that observations continued from 9 a.m. to
 12 p.m. give us not merely the highest temperature of the day, but like
 wise the hour when the temperature begins to fall — the chief, and in
 many cases the whole, of the evening fall. With this information we are
 enabled to use some other though less complete observations, in which
 the temperature was not observed during the night after 12 p.m.            We
 shall thus be able to confirm or to correct by a larger number of observa
 tions the foregoing conclusions.
             On the  Temperature of Healthy Persons of different Ages.
     In  this section we give the results of observations of persons of various
 ages    in whom the temperature was taken only till 12 p.m. On two
men, however, of about forty years of age, the observations were con
tinued throughout the night and day ; and we are therefore able to com
pare the temperature of the whole twenty-four hours of persons of
different ages.
     The observations were made on the following persons : —
    James Redfern, a child five years old, convalescent from rickets.       His
appetite was good. The ends of the bones were still enlarged, and there
was some flattening and depression of the axillary regions of the chest.
    Thomas Thompson and Alfred Rundell, aged respectively 11 and 13,
were both in excellent health.
    Frank Legg, 23 years old, convalescent from a very slight attack of
rheumatic fever.        He was free from pain, and his appetite was good.
    Cornelius   Farmelow, 40 years of    age, and  Alfred Purse, 55 years old,
were both in good health.

    From this Table it appears that the daily variations in old people is
considerably less than that of young people ; in fact the variations in
persons over 40 is only half that of persons under 25 years.
    On the other hand, the daily maximum temperature is much the same
both under 25 and over 40.
    But the difference is not merely in the amount of depression, but in
the manner of its occurrence.            In young people we get in the evening
a very rapid     fall, and   the  minimum      temperature of the day is quickly
reached ; often, indeed, in three or fours hours.               In persons over 40,
whose temperature was taken through the day and night, so rapid a fall
rarely occurs ; but the temperature usually declines very slowly, and as
soon as the minimum is reached it again begins to rise, so that not only
is the amount of the evening fall less in these older persons, but the
period of the depression is also shorter, generally very much shorter.
    It may here be noted that on some days, even when the temperature
was observed for twenty-four hours, no diurnal variation occurred in
persons over 40 years of age.              But the temperature of these older
differs   in yet another        respect from that of younger persons ; thus
apparently the diurnal fall does not observe any pai^ticular time, but
occurs sometimes in the middle of the night, and at other times in the
morning at about 9 a.m.

    Concerning   the  influence of Food on    the   Temperature of Healthy People.
    In  a previous section a considerable diurnal          variation in the tempera
 ture, often amounting        to two  degrees,    has been  shown to occur.
    It is important to ascertain whether this variation is produced by food
 or is  due  to other causes.        Our present section is devoted to the solu
 tion of these questions.
    We shall at first turn our attention to the observations made on the
 lads Rundell and Mountain.            As these were continued night and day,
 without any interruption, and as we have accurate accounts of the quan
 tity and the nature of their food, it is obvious we shall obtain much more
 trustworthy conclusions from these than from less elaborate and exact
 observations.
     These two lads were about twelve years of age.                  The observations

                Temperature of the Human Body in Health.                  l £J
 from which we now draw our conclusion's will be found in full at the
 end of the sections treating of the temperature of health, and on the
 influence of baths on the heat of the body.
    -We hope to show the high probability that the diurnal variation of the
 temperature is altogether independent of food ; and, while attempting to
 establish this, we shall speak first of the influence of breakfast, secondly
 of the tea, and lastly of the dinner.
    Concerning the behaviour of the temperature before and after break
 fast, it may be stated that these boys took breakfast at 6 a.m., dinner
 at 12, and tea at 5 p.m. — no food being allowed at other times, with one
 exception, which at the proper place will be noted and referred to.
    Is the daily rise of the body temperature due to food ? During the
 early morning hours, before breakfast, the temperature rose considerably ;
 indeed rather more than half the diurnal rise took place before 6 a.m.,
the breakfast time of these lads, showing that some of this rise is not
due to food.      This part of the rise, it must     be apparent,   could not
 be produced     by food, unless, indeed, it be attributed  to the tea of the
previous    evening, a supposition impossible to maintain, as ten hours
elapsed   between   the tea and the beginning of the morning rise. The
chief influence of a meal on the body is expended during the third to
the fifth hour, and then gradually declines and usually ceases altogether
in ten hours, a fact shown by the variations in the urea of the urine
after a meal. During the three first hours the quantity of urea gradually
increases, then for an hour or more the maximum quantity is maintained,
after which it gradually grows less, till the standard of inanition is
reached.
    Now in all our observations during the early hours of the evening,
when the influence of the evening meal was greatest, the temperature
fell considerably, and the rise of temperature did not begin till the effects
of food must have entirely ceased.
    We are thus driven to admit that half the daily rise is due to other
causes than food.
    The annexed Table gives a summary of the observations elsewhere
recorded in detail, and includes the whole of the morning rise, which was
always accomplished by 9 a.m.
    The first column gives the name of the lad ; tho second the hours
before breakfast during which the temperature rose ; the third the rise
before breakfast ; the fourth the hourly rise ; the fifth the hours of
observation after breakfast ; the sixth the rise during this time ; the
seventh the hourly rise after breakfast ; and the last column gives the
food taken during the investigation.

     the Table showing that the average hourly rise of all the observations
     before breakfast was 0o-328 Fahr., while the hourly average rise after
     this meal was 0O-2G4 Fahr. It thus appears that, apart from food, the
     causes which influence the diurnal variation are adequate to explain the
     rise which happened after breakfast.
        2nd. The rise after breakfast    due to food should be in proportion to

     the quantity taken; but no such relation occurred.       The rise, as the
     Table shows, was somewhat greater after                                         a       cupful of very weak tepid
     tea than after fairly hearty meal.

      may be considered to have practically gone without breakfast      yet on                                      ;
      these days the rise took place as usual, showing that the greater part                                                     of
         the after breakfast rise, and in all likelihood the rise on other days, must
         be independent of food.
           Still restricting our attention to the observations on Mountain and
         Rundell, we pass on to consider how far the evening fall in the tempera
         ture   affected by the evening meal.
                is
            These boys took tea at     p.m., always   very hearty meal, often the
                                                      5                             a
         largest of the day, and generally consisting of two, often of three
         eggs, bread and butter, with tea or cocoa. They had no supper, and were
         allowed to fall asleep at their pleasure, and were not awakened when the
         temperature was read off. Due care was taken that they were well
         covered with bed-clothes.
           In sixteen            observations the temperature after tea fell immediately and

                Temperature        of the Human Body in Health.                         197
continuously, until it reached the lowest point of the night. In many
cases the evening fall had begun before the tea ; in one ease only did it
rise after the meal, and on this occasion to the extent only of 0°-2 Fahr.,
and for a very short time.
   On these occasions, as the fall occurred immediately after, and not
withstanding a hearty meal, and moreover as the boys were in all respects
placed in the same conditions throughout the day, it is obvious that we
must admit that there are certain circumstances irrespective of food
which determine the diurnal variation of the temperature.                       Is all this
fall due to these unknown circumstances ? Or must we admit that a
portion of the previous rise is due to the food, and as its heat-producing
effects wear off, and as the inanition period is reached, a fall takes place
equal in amount to the previous rise determined by the food ?
   We will now give reasons which lead us to conclude that the total of
the fall is due to circumstances wholly apart from the food.
   The question to decide is, how much of the evening fall is to be
accounted for by those circumstances (irrespective of food) that determine
the diurnal variation, and how much, if any, is due to the withdrawal of
the influence of food on the body.              It must be evident that the fall
which occurred while the influence of the food was at its highest must be
wholly attributed to other circumstances.               AVe need hardly dwell on this
point ; for  if the   fall is due to the     diminished        or exhausted influence of
the food, such a decline could not occur when the meal was exerting its
greatest effects ; therefore that part only of the fall which took place
when the effects of the meal had begun to diminish or had ceased can be
attributed to the withdrawal of the influence of food.                    But in all cases
the principal part of the evening fall occurred while the influence of the
tea must have been at its height, and in many instances the whole of this
fall had taken place at this time — the chief part of this evening fall
having on all occasions occurred before 11 p.m., and was, indeed, very
often by this time at the lowest point.              Thus in those cases only where
the fall continued after 11 p.m., a very small portion, if any, of this fall
could be due to the declining influence of food.
   In this Table we give, in the first column the date, in the second the
amount of fall after 10 or 11 p.m., and in the third the hour of the night
when observations were discontinued.

    These two Tables may, we think, be fairly thrown together, for we can
 not understand how baths given in the morning should interfere with the
 evening temperature.            Thus we have 19 series of observations ; and in 7
of  these no    fall occurred after the chief influence of the meal had ceased.
   In  5 cases a     fall of 0°-2 occurred ; but we think a variation so slight
may be disregarded, as it might, and probably was often, caused by
some accidental circumstance, as the movement of the body in bed or
some   similar   cause     —an    assumption strengthened by the fact that this
slight decline was often noted only once, and at the time of the next ob
servation the temperature had recovered itself.
   These observations, therefore, may be thrown together, giving the
result that in 12 of the 19 observations' the food appears to have had no
influence on the evening fall. Of the remaining 7 observations, after
the supposed influence of the food had passed away, —
                              In    3 there was a fall of 0°-4

          It  appears, then, that the fact of the fall being in the majority of
     cases independent of the food, is presumptive evidence that the fall
     which occurred on some occasions after 11 must                       be due to other       causes
     than the withdrawal of the influence of food.
                          The Influence of Dinner on            the  Temperature.
          Observations       made      on     the    temperature      before   and     after    dinner
     furnish * further illustration of the non-influence of food on the tem
     perature of the body. If food can raise the temperature, we should
     certainly expect this to occur after dinner, especially in Mountain's case,
     if we bear in mind that his breakfast was so small, that its effects on the
     body must have ceased altogether before 12, his dinner hour ; and hence
     the influence which food can be supposed to exert on the temperature
     would in his case be manifest after dinner.
          The appended Tables give the results of the observations made on
     Mountain and Rundell. We have not restricted ourselves to those days
     when the temperature was continuously taken through both night and
      day, this limitation being evidently unnecessary, but we have used all
      the observations made on these lads. In every case their breakfast was
      taken at 6 a.m., and their dinner at 12, or shortly after this.

    This Table shows the results of eleven observations ; and we gather
that the rise between 9 a.m. and 12 (noon) was always very small ; and on
 some days none took place, as the hourly rise during these 3 hours on
                       4 occasions was                    nil

    In   two instances there was an       hourly fall, once of     0°-2 and once
 of  0°-6.
    We now add a Table indicating          the alterations in the temperature
 during three hours after dinner.

                                                                                 ~
    So slight a rise of 0°-2 is so easily produced by accidental causes, that,
as we have before said, it may be almost disregarded.           On this supposi
tion, then, it appears that on six of the ten days the rise was nil or
practically unappreciable, and on other days the rise was very small.
    It may be fairly said that we shall elicit surer information as to the
influence of the dinner, if we observe how the temperature comported
itself between three and five o'clock, when the food influence on the body
may be supposed to be at the maximum.             The following Table exhibits
the temperature during these hours, in the case of Mountain : —
              On 2 days the temperature remained unaltered.
               „ 2     „   it fell                             0-2

               „ Iday          „                               0-8
    The temperature rose on two      days only, and on each instance 0°-4.
    Here we close our investigations on the influence of food on the lads
Mountain and Rundell. We cannot absolutely say that food does not
in any case raise the body temperature ; yet it is clear that its influence
in this respect, if any, on persons in health and well nourished is very
slight indeed.
    We may further add that these observations        are opposed to the state
ment made by Dr. John Davy, to the effect that         a fall in the temperature
occurs immediately after food.
   We give a few further tabular        observations on the after-dinner tem
perature made on Redfern, Gibbs, Thompson, Farmelow,              and Garnes.

  Thus in seven of these twelve observations               no appreciable rise took
place.
  In five the temperature rose, the average rise being 0o,4.  Breakfast
was taken at 6 a.m., and no further food allowed afterwards until 12. It
may be objected, in respect of these observations, that the influence of the
breakfast had not passed away by dinner time, and that the temperature
elevated by this meal was maintained by the dinner.        As the influence
of the breakfast may not have passed off by dinner time these observa
tions are not so trustworthy in the settlement of this question of the
influence of food on the temperature as those made on Mountain.        We
give  them, however, for what they are worth, believing they serve in some
degree to corroborate our previous conclusions.
  It     is,
        however, right to refer to some observations                  in which   a   very
considerable rise occurred after late breafast.

and dilated heart      ; and the third, 21 years old, was the victim of some
obscure disease.       His spleen was very much enlarged, and he occasionally
passed large quantities     of blood with his urine.       These patients abstained

    It thus appears that after breakfast the temperature of these men
rose considerably, the average being 0°-8, sufficient, it may be said, to show
that the food is capable of causing an elevation in the temperature of the
body, especially as in many of the days no rise took place before
breakfast, the temperature having been taken at this time for several
hours.
    We are constrained to admit that perhaps this rise in the axilla was   due
to the food      ;  although opposed to this admission, we might urge the fact
that on three days, when the temperature of Jones and Tarves was taken
during the morning hours, while they were kept fasting, an average rise
of 0o-7 occurred, being almost identical with that which took place on
other days when they partook of food.
    Assuming that this rise in the axilla was really due to food, How was
the rise caused ? "Was it due to a general elevation of the body tempera
ture, owing to increased consumption of the food ? or was it due to other
causes ?      It could hardly be. due to increased oxidation of food, for we
should expect the elevation to be most marked at the time during which
the food was most rapidly absorbed and carried to the tissues.          But in
these men the rise in the temperature occurred much sooner than this,
being completed on an average in an hour and twenty-eight minutes,
and in several cases in fifty minutes, in some even in thirty, although
there was a considerable rise on these days ; yet at the time the influence
 of food would be expected to be most marked the temperature either
remained unchanged or in some instances it even fell.
     Further, it may be remarked that were the rise after breakfast due to
 combustion of the food, we should expect that a similar rise would occur
 after the dinner, which was a heartier meal than the breakfast ; but the
 rise after dinner was much less than that after breakfast.

   It may, however, be fairly objected to this argument, that the influence
of the breakfast on the body had not ceased before that of the dinner
begun, and that the dinner prevented the possible fall after the break
fast  if dinner had not been taken.
   Thus, to summarize very generally              the conclusions we have arrived
at : — There   is a diurnal cycle in the temperature of the body, much more
evident in young than in middle-aged or old people ; in elderly people,
indeed, the daily variation is often very slight, and sometimes altogether
absent; further, this diurnal variation is due to other causes than food,
which if operative in any degree in producing elevation of the tempera
ture, is so,  if at all, to  a very small extent.

        On the Influence    of Cold Baths     on the Temperature    of the Body.
   We undertook these experiments from a wish to learn the influence
of the cold bath on the temperature of the surface and internal parts of
the body, and to ascertain if it were possible, in any degree, to cool the
whole body ; and if so, to what extent the temperature could be lowered,
and how long this depression would continue.
   Our observations were made in the winter months. The temperature
of the person fixed upon for experiment was first carefully ascertained
either in the axilla, the rectum, or under the tongue.              He was then im
mersed in a bath of a temperature            of 60°  Fahr. for  a time   varying from
1 to 35 minutes in the several series of experiments.                  The body was
covered by the water up to the chin.             Immediately on the return to bed
the temperature was again ascertained, and every few minutes afterwards.
In some instances we took the temperature under the tongue during the
immersion ; but these notes we fear are not quite correct, although we
spared no pains, for the patient's teeth chattered so much as to prevent
the steady closure of the lips.

       This Table exemplifies,            as was to be expected, that the cold baths
   considerably         cooled    the surface    of the body, and that the longer the
   immersion the greater was the depression of the temperature of the skin.
   Thus this Table shows that on some occasions the temperature of the
   axilla fell to 87° Fahr. ; but a depression so great occurred only when the
   bath was continued for a considerable time, for a period, indeed, varying
   from 15 to 35 minutes ; and even this amount of depression was of short
   duration.         To illustrate this effect we give three extracts from the pre
   ceding Table.           A bath of 60° Fahr. for one minute reduced the tempe
   rature of a child five years old to 95° Fahr., but in 13 to 25 minutes the
   temperature of the axilla had nearly recovered itself.                    With a bath of
   the same temperature continued five minutes we reduced the temperature
   to 92° ; but in 48 to 75 minutes after leaving the bath the axillary tem
   perature had nearly recovered. Nay, even after a bath of 35 minutes
   the temperature            only fell to 89°, and recovered itself in 135 minutes.
   The greater part of the lost heat was very quickly restored, and then the
   axilla more slowly regained the rest of the lost temperature.
     Influence of Cold Baths on tlie Temperature of internal parts of the Body.
       Cold- baths reduce the temperature of internal parts of the body, but

                  Temperature of the Human Body in Health.                         205
tbe reduction       is considerably less than that of the surface.           Thus we
lowered the temperature under the tongue or in the rectum from 0°-6
to 2°-8 Fahr., the amount of depression being, of course, proportional to
the duration of the bath.
    The duration of the depression varied greatly in different persons.
Thus on some occasions the lost heat was restored in an hour ; in others
not for several hours, three, four, or more ; but very soon after leaving
the bath the greater part of the lost heat was restored, the remaining
slight depression passing off much more slowly.                    Our observations
elicited the rather curious fact that the time the body takes to recover
its temperature holds no relation to the amount of depression ; thus in
some instances, when with great depression, the recovery was speedy,
while on other occasions, with but slightly depressed temperature, the
recovery was slowly effected.
    We noticed, too, that many times the internal parts did not be
come cooled under the actual operation of the bath, but the tempera
ture of the internal parts fell gradually for some time after the bath.
 The explanation we would offer of this curious fact is, that during the
bath much heat is withdrawn from the surface, and the cold contracting
the blood-vessels lessens greatly the quantity of blood passing through
 the skin.      Heat is thus not abstracted from deep parts by cooling of the
 blood, but simply by conduction.          On quitting the bath, the blood-vessels
 of the skin become widely dilated, and the blood then passing quickly
through the cold skin becomes cooled, and reduces the temperature of
deep parts.

    We first give the hour when the evening fall begun on the bath days             : —
                 Eedfern                                   12 to 4 p.m.

    On comparing this Table with the one given in the section treating of
the temperature in health, it will be found that the time when the tem
perature begun to fall is much the same whether a bath be given or not.
    Tor the sake of comparison we put side by side the hour the evening
fall begun on bath and non-bath days.

     Influence of Hot-water and Vapour Baths on the Temperature of the Body.
         We next turn our attention to the influence of hot-water and vapour
     baths on the temperature of the body ; and we shall first attempt to
     ascertain the influence of hot baths on the temperature of the body, both
     at the time of immersion and during the rest of the day. We have, as
     usual, extracted and tabulated the chief data from the charts appended
     to the end of this section.               The temperature was obtained by placing
     the thermometer under the tongue while the person was hi the bath.
     The method of taking the temperature is always noted in the charts.

                 Temperature     of the Human Body in Health.                  207
    From this Table we learn that in all       cases the temperature   of the body
rose in the hot bath, this elevation,       as  might be expected, varying with
the temperature and duration of the bath.              It varied from 1° Fahr. to
4°-6 Fahr. ; or, to put it in another and more striking way, we raised the
body temperature to 103° and 104° Fahr., a severe fever height. Is it pos
sible to bring the temperature of the body to that of the bath ? As it is im
possible to remain in a very hot bath sufficiently long to enable us to deter
mine this question, we must examine those experiments in which the
temperature of the bath was not very high.               "We were compelled in a
short   time  to  discontinue the experiment     with  a very hot bath on account
of the great weakness induced by it. Yet as the temperature continued
to rise so long as the patient remained in the hot water, it is probable
that, if adequate time could have been allowed, the temperature of the
body would have become identical with that of the bath.
    The charts show that a bath of moderate temperature, as 101° to
102°, will raise the body temperature to that of the bath.                  Whilst
making several of these series of observations the bath temperature was
recorded simultaneously with the temperature of the body, and the
figures are given in the charts, as with Mountain on Jan. 3rd, 4th, and
5th, and with Mooney and Luff on Jan. 22nd.               Thus it is clear that the
temperature of the body may be raised to that of a bath at 101o,8.
   Influence of Hot-water Bath on       the Temperature of   the Body during   the

    The evening fall begun in Mountain, Thompson, and Eundell between
5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
    The average diurnal variation of all the observations
       in the above-named lads, all about the same age, was . . l°-9 Fahr.

    The minimum temperature of the day of these three lads was reached
between 9 and        11 p.m., the average time being 10.
    If these results are compared with those obtained from the observa
 tions made on the same lads on the bathless days, it will be seen that
 the two Bets of figures entirely agree ; that, in fact, hot-water baths,
 except at the time of immersion, exert no influence on the body
temperature.
    On  the Influence of Hot-vapour Baths on       the Temperature of   the Body.
    The temperature of the body is always raised by the hot-vapour bath,
the amount of elevation, as might be expected, being proportionate to the
 heat and duration of the bath, as shown in the following Table : —

   In  some   of the observations we        have   stated only the time occupied
in effecting the rise, as on these days the bath, before it was entered,
was first heated to the temperature at which it was maintained ; while
on the other days the bath was entered immediately the steam was
turned on, being thus occupied while the temperature                   of the room was
rising.
   These experiments enable us to learn the rapidity with which the body
may lose heat ; for as the body of- the person experimented upon was
heated considerably higher than could be maintained by physiological
processes, so this unnatural elevation is speedily lost by evaporation,
radiation, and conduction.         As the loss of heat sustained varied with
the temperature to which the body was raised, we shall speak first of the
cooling of the body from a high temperature, and next from a tempera
ture a little above that of health.            It was found that heat was much
more quickly lost under the first than under the latter conditions.
   We now give a Table to show the rapid loss of heat when the tempe
rature of the body has been raised considerably, for instance to 102° and
104° Fahr. :—

   A  degree of heat was thus lost in 4-7 minutes.             As an interval of five
minutes sometimes elapsed between the testings, we can hardly speak
with the exactness indicated by the figures.             It is better to say the body
may lose a degree of heat in less than five minutes.

rapid when the body is less heated, one degree being lost in 40 minutes : —

  Can the figures last given be accepted as about the usual rate at which
heat is lost by the body in health ?
  We shall now try to ascertain the source of this increase of body heat
under a warm-water or hot- vapour bath.
  Our experiments with vapour-baths afford the more complete solution ;
and the following remarks will be limited to them, though it is evident
that they will also hold good in the case of hot-water baths.
  This increase in the heat of the body may be due to
            1. Accumulation of heat in the body.
            2. Absorption of heat from the bath.
            3. Both of these circumstances.
     Some of the increased heat was undoubtedly due to an accumulation
of   heat in the body.
     It
     is evident that a person in a hot-vapour bath of the temperature of
the body, and when breathing the steam, could lose no heat by evapo
ration, or radiation, or conduction, the only means of withdrawing heat
from the body. If the production of heat is not diminished pari passu
with its loss from the body, then heat will accumulate, and the tempera
ture of the body will be raised.
   Two observations show this to be the case. Thus with Mooney on
Jan. 29th and Church on Jan. 22nd the temperature of each respectively
was raised to 100° and 100°-4, while the bath was never more than the
temperature of their bodies. We show this in a Table : —

   Here it  was impossible that the heat which   raised the temperature of
the   body could be obtained from      the bath, itself never hotter than
the bodies of the boys before undergoing the experiment.          If the for
mation of heat was lessened so as exactly to meet the diminished loss by
conduction and radiation, the heat of the body would have continued at
the same point ; but this was not the case, and thus it appears that the
formation of heat cannot be suddenly lessened to such an amount.
   Thus the increased heat of the body ensuing from a vapour-bath is
certainly in part due to accumulation of heat, which under other cir
cumstances is lost by evaporation and radiation.     Is all the heat imparted
to the body by the vapour-bath to be accounted for in this way ? Some
part must, in the nature of things, be absorbed from the bath, and is
evidenced in our experiments, the elevation being too rapid to be caused
solely by an accumulation of heat in the body.

                                                    I
      In my former paper on this subject* showed, among other things,
  that injury of a motor nerve is attended with a very marked and peculiar
   alteration in its relative excitability towards the stimuli which are
   respectively supplied by closing and opening a voltaic circuit.                In the
  present paper     I  propose to detail the results which have been obtained
   by continuing this line of research ; and, in order to render them more
  easily intelligible,  I  shall begin by briefly restating such of the previous
  results as form the basis of the present ones.
      It will be remembered, then, that my method of experimenting was as
  follows.    Having pithed a frog and laid it on a frog-board in such a
  position that one of the hind legs should hang over the edge of the board,
  I  divided the tendo Achillis, dissected out the gastrocnemius as far as its
  point of origin, and removed the tibia just below the knee. The exposed
  though uninjured gastrocnemius was then laid with its flat surface on
  non-polarizable electrodes, in such a way that while one electrode supported
  the extreme tarsal end of the muscle, the other supported its extreme
  femoral end. By means of a rheochord it was then ascertained what
  strength of voltaic stimulus the muscle required to give its earliest
  response, («) to the anodic t make, (b) to the kathodic make, (c) to the
  anodic break, and (d) to the kathodic break. It will be remembered that,
  under these circumstances, " the muscle is usually more sensitive to
 minimal stimulation supplied by closure of the constant current when the
 femoral end rests on the kathode [case (by], than when this end rests on
 the anode [case (a)].            Conversely, under similar circumstances, the
 gastrocnemius is more           sensitive to minimal stimulation supplied by
 opening of the constant current when the femoral end rests on the anode
 [case (c)], than when this end rests on the kathode [case (d)].             In view of
 the other facts of electrotonus         the present ones are of interest, because,
 as the sciatic nerve enters the gastrocnemius near the femoral end               of the
 latter and then spreads out its peripheral ramifications as it advances,
 in the experiments just mentioned one electrode is in almost immediate
contact with the nerve-trunk where it enters the muscle, while the other
electrode supports       the part of the muscle that contains only peripheral

    t Throughout this paper     I  shall designate the direction of the voltaic current
                                                        " anodic " and " kathodic " with
thsough the gastrocnemius     by employing the terms
reference to the femoral end of the muscle, i. e. where the nerve-trunk first enters the
latter. Thus, for instance, " anodic make means closure of the current in a direction

nervous elements.         It is therefore to be expected, upon the theory of
electrotonus, that the muscle under these conditions should prove itself
most sensitive to the closing excitation when the nerve-trunk rests on
the kathode, and most sensitive to the opening               excitation   when the
nerve-trunk rests on the anode
   " If the gastrocnemius of      a  frog be placed on non-polarizable    electrodes
in the position just described, and         if care has been taken not to injure
the attached sciatic nerve,     I find  that upon now dividing this nerve, either
near or just within the muscle, remarkable alterations ensue, not only, as
is already known, in the general sensitiveness of the muscle, but also, and
more particularly, in its relative sensitiveness to make and to break of
the current.       .  . .   For just as before cutting the normal sensitiveness
of the muscle is greatest to the closing excitation when its femoral end
(or uninjured nerve-trunk) rests on the kathode, and most sensitive to
the opening excitation when this end rests on the anode, so, after the
general sensitiveness has been exalted by cutting, the exaltation shows
itself in a far higher degree to the closing excitation when the femoral
end (or severed nerve-trunk) rests on the kathode, and to the opening
excitation when this end rests on the anode."
   Having thus described the qualitative effects of nerve-injury in relation
to electrotonus, my former paper went on to describe also the quantitative
effects ; but for my present purpose it is unnecessary to quote the latter.
For having observed that the particular effects of nerve-injury which               I
was investigating decreased with great rapidity after the first infliction of
the injury,     I   deemed it desirable to confirm the quantitative          results
already published by employing            a   more   rapid method   of  varying the
intensity of the voltaic current.        Accordingly, instead of using the rheo-
chord,   I introduced into the exciting circuit a rheostat consisting of a long
U-tube charged with dilute solution of zinc sulphate. Into each leg of
the U-tube there dipped a zinc rod of the same length as the tube. These
two rods formed part of the circuit, and as, by means of an appropriate
mechanical arrangement which need not be described, they could be slid
up and down the legs of the tube with great facility, the resistance
offered by the tube could thus be varied with great rapidity.
                                       I
   In some other respects, also, changed the method. Instead of non-
polarizable electrodes     I used platinum plates measuring 4 millims. across.
Also, in order to estimate the maximum effect produced by nerve-injury in
each of the four cases (a), (b), (c), and (d),     I only made one comparative ob
                               I                                 I
servation on every muscle employed. That is to say, if wished to ascer
tain the maximum degree in which the excitability of a nerve is increased by
section in any one of these four cases,         I began by observing, in the unin
jured  nerve,   the   maximum    number    of  Ohm's units of resistance which      I
could afford to throw into the U-tube, so as only just to procure a
response to the make or break stimulus as the case might be.                 Having
noted this,   I   raised the sliding rods to the top of the U-tnbe, so as te

   The results of    a number of experiments conducted on this improved
method confirm, in the main, those previously obtained.     As before, how
ever, I encountered immense individual variations in different muscles,
and therefore, as before,   I  here select mean cases for quotation.    It            is
only necessary   further  to explain  that in the appended Table the figures

   These proportions, as already observed, agree pretty closely with those

increased in the case of the anodic break.        The two cases, however, are
still very far from being numerically proportional, the degree of increase

more — the muscle, when placed on the electrodes at the end of that time,

 §    3.   Astrong voltaic current, or strong induction-shock, allowed to

break into an uninjured nerve-trunk, causes in the latter an increase of
excitability analogous to that which   caused                       by
                                                 mechanical injury. Thus,

strength of a single Grove's cell caused the excitability of the nerve
towards the breaking excitation, supplied through the same electrodes by
a small Daniell's cell, to rise from 5000 to 100,000 Ohms.       Similarly a
strong induction -shock supplied by a single Grove's cell with the secondary
coil at zero, and thrown in between the electrodes from a small Daniell's
cell, caused the excitability of the nerve towards a closing stimulus sup
plied by the latter to rise from 40,000 to 185,000 Ohms.       In conducting
these experiments,    I was not able to perceive that the direction of the
strong or injuring current made any difference in the nature of the
results.
   § 4. This concludes my observations so far as stimuli of minimal
intensity are concerned ; and, at the suggestion of Dr. Burdon-San-
derson,   I terminated this inquiry regarding the electrotonic condition
of injured nerves by substituting        for voltaic stimuli of minimal
intensity, voltaic stimuli of minimal duration.        The   method    which
I  employed in this part of the research was       as  follows : — The frog
(R. temporaria) having been prepared as already described in § 1,
the duration of the voltaic stimulus was graduated by means of a
heavy pendulum, which constituted one pole of the battery, and which,
while swinging, made contact at the lowest point in its arc with the other
pole. The latter consisted of a fixed platinum wire placed vertically,
and the contact was made with it by means of a pointed piece of
metal attached to the moving pole and placed horizontally.          Thus by
increasing   or diminishing the distance through which the pendulum,
or moving pole, was allowed to swing, a stimulus of any required
duration could be supplied to the muscle interposed in the, circuit.
As   a battery   I employed a single Daniell's cell ; and, lastly,   I inter
posed a rheochord, a commutator, and a key.      Such being the apparatus,
the course of any one experiment was very simple.         By means of the
swinging pendulum, the uncut muscle was supplied with a stimulus of
measured duration, which was then graduated down to the point at which
the break of the current succeeded the make with a rapidity just suffi
ciently great to prevent the muscle from responding to either stimulus,
(a) when the femoral end rested on the anode, and (V) when this end
rested on the kathode.       These two durations having been noted, the
nerve was cut through at the usual place, and the observations (a) and
(6) repeated as rapidly as possible.   It was invariably found that in both
cases a much shorter    duration of the voltaic stimulus was required to
produce minimal stimulation than had been required to do so before the
nerve was cut, the intensity of the voltaic current, of course, being kept
uniform throughout.
   An apparent objection to this method of experimenting is apt to sug
gest itself, viz. that the make and the break must follow one another
much too rapidly to admit of the observer being able to eliminate the
effects of the former from those of the latter stimulus.    But, as a matter

216                             Mr. G.        J.   Romanes on the                         [May 3,
of fact, the desired elimination is performed by the nervo-muscular                               tissue
itself.     For it usually happens that                 presents some per
                                                     a gastrocnemius
ceptible difference in the character of its contraction, according as the
latter is given in response to make or to break of the current. Therefore,
by first ascertaining, with an ordinary key, the optical appearance which
the responses to make and break respectively present, it is not difficult
afterwards to recognize which of these appearances is presented by the
response to rapidly succeeding make and break stimuli, and so to deter
mine which of these rapidly succeeding stimuli is the one to which the
                                      I
response is given. Now found in this way that, by making the duration
of contact sufficiently brief, the nerve, whether or not injured and in
whichever direction the current was allowed to pass, only responded to
the closing stimulus. Therefore, by choosing a strength of current which,
in   each   of the
                cases («) and (b) before nerve-injury, was just sufficiently
strong to elicit a response when the voltaic stimulus was of t duration in
the one case and          t'   duration in the other,           I was   sure that in each of the
two cases the response which                   I
                                  obtained was given to the closing, and not
to the opening, excitation. Having noted the values of t and t, divided                   I
the sciatic just where it enters the gastrocnemius, and then shortened the
duration of contact down to the point at which, in each of the two cases
(a) and (b), the muscle again only just responded to the stimulus.   Let
these durations be respectively represented by T and T. As before, ascer                      I
tained that the responses had exclusive reference to the closing excitation ;
so that, by recording the values of t,        T',               T,
                                                   was able to obtain for
                                                          t',        I
responses to stimuli of minimal duration representative numbers, such as
those in the former Table, which have reference to stimuli of minimal
intensity.      It
               only necessary further to state that, as different gastro
                     is
cnemius muscles exhibit considerable variations in the degree of their
natural irritability towards              voltaic stimuli of short duration, and as for
my purposes      it   was desirable to obtain
                                            physiological, as distinguished
                                                           a
from   physical, basis whereon to institute my comparisons, in the case of
       a
each muscle    began
               I         graduating the intensity of the current down to
                                 by
that point at which the duration of contact required to produce minimal
stimulation before nerve-injury was the same as    had been in my previous
                                                                     it
experiments.    Or, in other words, by appropriately varying the intensity
of the current to suit the degree of excitability manifested    each parti           by
cular muscle before injury,   was able, notwithstanding the differences in
                                          I
excitability presented            by
                         different muscles, to render    constant. When     t  a
this was done, however,                   T,   and   T   were all found more or less variable
in different muscles — as, of course, we should expect from the analogous
case   of responses to stimuli of minimal intensity.                       1    therefore tabulated
the results yielded by twenty gastrocnemius muscles, and then calculated
the average duration of contact which in each of the cases (a) and (J) be
fore cutting, and (a) and (b) after cutting, was required to cause minimal

 1877.]                     Excitability of Motor Nerves.                              217
 stimulation.     It   is the averages bo obtained which are rendered in the
following tabular statement of results : —
                                                Anodio make.      Kathodic make.

    Concerning these results it is only necessary to observe that there is a
 tolerably close parallel between them and those which were previously
 obtained by employing stimuli of minimal intensity. That is to say, in
 the case of the anodic make the increase of excitability due to injury is,
roughly estimated, in the proportion of about 3              : 5, and this whether such
increase is estimated by employing stimuli           of graduated intensity, or stimuli
of graduated duration          ;  and similarly in the case of kathodic make,
though the proportions           here yielded by the two methods are not quite so
equal as in the other case.             But this general parallelism between the
quantitative results yielded by the two methods in the case of both the
closing excitations serves but to render more conspicuous the difference
in the results yielded by the two methods in the case of the anodic opening
excitation ; for while in the first of the two methods, viz. that in which
stimuli of minimal intensity were employed, it was found that after injury
the excitability of a nerve towards the anodic-break stimulus is greater
than it is towards the anodic-make stimulus, such is not found to be the
case when,     as in the second of the two methods, these two stimuli are
made to follow one another in very rapid succession.                 I can only explain
this fact by supposing that, for the breaking excitation to be fully effec
tual, a certain interval of time is required for the nerve to become
polarized by the passage of the voltaic current ; and, therefore, that, in my
experiments with currents of minimal duration, a response to the anodic
make was always given when a shorter duration of the current was em
ployed than that which was required to produce a response to the anodic
break*.
    § 4. In  conclusion,      I may    state that the period of latent stimulation
does not appear to be perceptibly affected by             nerve-injury.
   * How much shorter      I was not able to ascertain, from the fact that the contraction
due to the make and that due to the break, when they both occur together, become so
blended that the eye is not able to analyze them with sufficient precision to decide at
what point the anodic-break contraction first asserts itself. Hence we must rest satis
fied with the general statement, that the minimal anodic-break stimulus is in some un
known degree of longer duration than the minimal anodic-make stimulus ; and this
even after the susceptibility of the nerve to the former stimulus is so enormously aug
mented by injury   as,  from the other method of experimentation, we know it to    be.

II. "On       the Temperature-correction        and Induction-coefficients
      of Magnets." By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc., Superintendent of
      Kew Observatory.          Communicated by Robert H. Scott,
      F.R.S.      Received   April  12, 1877.
   It has been the practice at the    Kew Observatory since 1856 to deter
mine, for the use of persons about to make observations upon terrestrial
magnetism, the various constants of the magnets and instruments with
which they intend to observe ; and a considerable number of these con
stants are now recorded in the books of the Observatory.
   Having been frequently applied to for information respecting the con
stants of magnets and the method of determining them,        I have extracted
from our registers the values of the two most important constants, viz.
that of the variation of the power of the magnet under changes of tem
perature, and that showing the effect of the inductive action of the earth
upon the magnets, as found by experiment.        The results are given  in the
following paper.
   The magnets experimented      upon may be classed    under six heads (ap
proximate dimensions) : —
   a. Solid cylinders, 3-6 inches long, 0-3 inch diameter.
   6. Hollow cylinders (collimators), 3-65 inches long, 0-28 inch internal
        diameter.
   e. Parallelopipeds   (bars), 5-4  inches long, 0-8 inch wide, 0-12 inch
        thick.
   d. Rhomboidal    plates (dip-needles), 5-7 inches long, O05 inch thick.
   e. Thin cylinders (enclosed in brass tubes, deflectors), 3'75 inches long,
        0-30 inch diameter.
   /. Various.
   All of  the magnets were made of the best steel, and rendered as hard
as possible before magnetization, which operation has been in every case
carried to saturation.
   The method employed in determining the temperature-coefficient is as
follows  : — The  magnet being firmly fixed in a water-tight wooden box,

    It is  apparent from the numbers that there is a considerable accumu
 lation of the positive radical (and hence it may be concluded of negative
 electricity) at the extremity of the strip in proximity to the positive elec
 trode, and that this gradually diminishes until, at a distance of 22 millims.
 from the end, it becomes too small for estimation.            The relatively small
number in the first line of experiment 2 shows the influence of the end
 surface.

    It is worthy of notice that the positive radical is detectable at a some
what greater distance from the point of the rhombus than from the end
of the rectangular strips.
    The area of the first 2 millims. of the rhombus equals 0-4 square
millim.     Calculating the copper on the first 2 millims. of the rectangular
strip for an equal area, the accumulation on these areas is shown to be
greater on the rhombus in the ratio of 20 to 1. This illustrates to a con
siderable extent the power of the more pointed conductor in storing up
the radical.

    For this a cylinder of pure copper, 1 decimetre long and 1 centimetre
in diameter, was placed lengthwise in the trough containing a 5-per-cent.
solution of copper sulphate, its position being similar to that of the silver
strip in the previous experiments.          The end of the cylinder, which was
so placed as to be eaten away in the experiment, was made up of sections

    In experiment 4, signs of corrosion were noticeable to 48 millims. from
the end of the cylinder, while the deposit of copper reached 46 millims.
from the other end. In experiment 6, corrosion was noticeable also to
48 millims. from the one end, and deposition to 46 millims. from the
other end.      From this it would appear that the electro-negative radical
spreads over a greater surface than does the positive radical, or that the
neutral line is not in the middle of the cylinder, but somewhat removed
towards the negative end, that is, where the deposition of the positive
radical takes place.       I hope to return to this.
   The numbers in the columns 1, la, and 2 may be taken as showing
approximately the distribution of the positive radical or negative elec
tricity on the respective silver strips, and the numbers in 5 and 6 that
of the negative radical or positive electricity on the copper cylinders,
which facts, graphically represented, give figures as in the diagram.

Brill has discussed the question of curves having three-point contact
with a doubly infinite pencil of curves, and in particular he has investi
gated some of the properties of the curve passing through all the points
of contact with the individual curves of the pencil. In the same journal
(vol. x. p. 221) Krey, of Kiel, has applied a method similar to that of
Brill with partial success to the question of curves having four-point
contact with a triply infinite pencil.       Some formulae, however, given in
my paper
               " On the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve " (Phil. Trans.
 1865, p. 657) have proved to be directly applicable to both questions.
An application of them to Brill's problem will be found in the ' Comptes
Rendus' for 1876 (2nd semestre, p. 627), and a solution of Krey's
                    '                                                      '
problem in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society for
 the same year (vol. viii. p. 29).
    The present subject was, in the first instance, suggested by the fore
 going papers ; and from one point of view it may be regarded as au
attempt to extend the question to the case of surfaces ; viz. to determine
a curve which shall pass through the points of contact of a given surface
U with certain surfaces belonging to a pencil V, and to investigate some
of its properties.
    From a slightly different point of view, however, it may be considered
 as an extension of two ideas, viz : —first, that of the jacobian surface, or
locus of the points whose polar planes with regard to four surfaces meet
 in a point ; and secondly, that of the jacobian curve, or locus of points
 whose polar planes with regard to three surfaces have a right line in
 common.      More particularly, commencing with the facts, first, that if
a  surface   of the form a<p + b\p+c\ touch a surface U, the point of contact
is a point on the jacobian, and, secondly, that if a surface of the form
a<p + b\p touch a surface U, the point of contact is a point on the jacobian
curve,   I  have endeavoured to extend them to higher degrees of contact.

  1877.]              On the Length  of the Voltaic Spark.                227
    The    properties   here considered are those which appertain to the
  points,  if any, through which all the surfaces pass, or, as they may
 be termed, the principal points of the system, and they consist mainly
 in the nature of the contact of the hyperjacobian surfaces with the sur
 face IT, and the multiplicity of the hyperjacobian    curve at the points in
 question.
    The present investigation extends to the cases of two-branch contact
 of the given surface with a one-fold and with a two-fold pencil, and of
 three-branch contact with a four-fold pencil.     In the latter case notice
 is also made of some properties appertaining to the points, if any, where
 all the surfaces touch one another, or, as they may be termed, the
 secondary points of the system. In particular it is shown that in the
 case of common, or two-branch, contact and a one-fold pencil the jaco-
 bian curve has a double point at the principal points ; while in the case
 of three-branch contact and a four-fold pencil the hyperjacobian curve
 has a triple point at the same points.
 II. "    On the Length of the Spark from       a  Voltaic Battery in dif

    We venture, in anticipation of    a more detailed account,   in course of
preparation, of our experiments with the chloride-of -silver battery which
 have engaged our attention for more than three years, to lay before the
 Society the results of some investigations we were induced to make in
 consequence of phenomena we have observed in the voltaic discharge in
different residual gases contained in vacuum tubes. We have found, as
we anticipated we should do, that the length of the spark at ordinary
atmospheric pressures in the following gases is the longest in the order
in which they are enumerated — hydrogen, nitrogen, air, oxygen, carbonic
acid — it being nearly twice as long in hydrogen as in air.        The spark
in air between a point (positive) and a plate (negative) with our battery
of 8040 cells is about 0*34 in., and in hydrogen 0-60. We may mention
that we are making up our battery to 10,440 cells. The length of the
spark does not appear to be dependent on the specific gravity of the
gas, but may have some relation to its viscosity.

   For reasons which will appear in the sequel, it will            be desirable  to
glance, in the first place, at the results already submitted to the Royal
Society.
   Portions of the autumn of 1875, and of the winter and spring of
1875-76, were devoted to the first section of these researches, and on the
13th of January, 1876, its main results were communicated orally to the
Royal Society. The completed memoir was handed in to the Society
on the 6th of April : it is published in vol. 166 of the ' Philosophical
Transactions.'
   Many of the ' closed chambers' employed in the inquiry were submitted
on the 13th of January to the inspection of the Fellows. There had
been over fifty of them in all, and several of them had been used more
than once. The air in these chambers had been permitted to free itself from
floating matter by self-subsidence, no artificial means of cleansing it being
employed.       Sterilized organic liquids and infusions of the most varied
kinds freely exposed to air thus spontaneously purified were found, when
tested by the microscope, to remain absolutely free from organisms of all
kinds, and equally free from the turbidity, scum, and mould which to the
naked eye are the infallible signs of the generation and multiplication of
such organisms.
   These experiments         embraced, among others, the following organic
liquids  : — urine in   its natural condition ; infusions of mutton, beef, pork,
hay, turnip, sole, haddock, codfish, salmon, turbot, mullet, herring, eel,
oyster, whiting, liver, kidney, hare, rabbit, barndoor fowl, pheasant, and
grouse.
   The number of separate vessels containing these liquids which were
exposed to spontaneously purified air amounted to several hundreds, and
the consensus of their testimony, in the sense just indicated, was com
plete.
   Five minutes' boiling was found in all         cases sufficient to sterilize the
infusions.
   When, after remaining sterile for months, the doors of the chambers
were opened so as to admit the uncleansed air of the laboratory, the contact
of such air, or, more correctly, of the matter mechanically floating in it,
infallibly produced organisms in abundance — sometimes exclusively

    Infusions of the substances above referred to were afterwards exposed
in succession to air which had been freed of its floating matter by filtra
tion through cotton wool, also to air from which the floating matter had
been removed by calcination, and finally to vacua obtained by exhausting
as far as possible with an air-pump large receivers which had been
previously filled with filtered air.
    Boiled for five minutes and exposed to air thus treated, or to vacua
thus produced, none of the infusions showed subsequently any alteration
of colour or transparency to the naked eye, or to the microscope any
manifestation of life.
               I
    Thus far have summed up the results obtained with self-purified air,
filtered air, calcined air, and air-pump vacua, the liquids in all cases
being exposed in open test-tubes.        Small retort-flasks were afterwards
resorted to.     Charged with  the  infusions,  they were boiled in heated oil
or brine, and sealed with exceeding care during ebullition.       At the Eoyal
Society    on January 13th,  1876,   one  hundred  and  thirty such flasks were
submitted to the Fellows, free alike from putrefaction and from life.
They embraced specimens of all the substances above mentioned and
some others.
    Briefly expressed, then, the evidence furnished by six months' assiduous
work during the autumn, winter, and spring of 1875-76, proved
conclusively that in the atmospheric conditions then existing in the
laboratory of the Boyal Institution, not one of the many hundred flasks
and tubes experimented on failed to be sterilized by five minutes' boiling,
and no countenance was given to the notion that any of these once
 sterilized infusions possessed the power of spontaneously generating life.
    The investigation embodied in the memoir now submitted to the
Society was opened in the summer of 1876 by a series of tentative ex
periments on turnip infusions, to which were added varying quantities of
bruised or pounded cheese.         Seven different kinds of cheese were
employed, fifty-seven test-tubes being charged with the mixture and
exposed to the self-purified air of closed chambers.
    The majority of these mixtures remained unchanged ; a minority
 became    charged with organisms, which are, in my opinion, completely
 accounted for by reference to the protective action of the cheese. In the
 memoir of which this is an abstract such protective action is illustrated
 by the fact that when ordinary mustard seeds were tied together in a calico
 bag, they resisted the boiling temperature for a considerable multiple of
 the time which sufficed to   kill them when no     bag enveloped them.     The
 bag  and  outside seeds protected   the interior ones.
    Not temperature alone, but the ability to diffuse its juices or salts,
 appears to be a condition of importance in the destruction of the integrity
 and life of a germ by boiling water.         Without diffusion a germ may
 withstand temperatures competent to destroy it where diffusion is free.

230               Prof.   J.  Tyndall on the Deportment of             [May 17,
I need not remark     on the imperviousness of cheese to water, and its con
sequent power to prevent diffusion.
    These summer experiments on turnip-cheese infusions were, however,
merely tentative, and     I  purpose completing them hereafter.
    In the autumn    I resumed     experiments on infusions of hay, which had
been purposely postponed.          With this substance no difficulty was encoun
tered in my first inquiry.         Boiled for five minutes, and exposed to air
purified spontaneously,      or freed  from its floating matter by calcination or
filtration, hay infusion, though employed in multiplied experiments at
various times, never showed the least competence to kindle into life.
After months of transparency,         I have, in a great number of cases, inocu
lated this infusion with the smallest          specks of animal and vegetable
liquids containing Bacteria, and observed, twenty-four hours afterwards,
its colour lightened and its mass rendered opaque by the multiplication
of these organisms.
    But in the autumn of 1876, the substance with which             I had experi
mented so easily and successfully a year previously appeared to have
changed its nature.       The infusions extracted from it bore, in some cases,
not only five minutes' but fifteen minutes' boiling with impunity.             On
changing    the  hay  a  different  result  was   often obtained.   Many   of  the
infusions extracted from samples of hay purchased in the autumn of 1876
behaved exactly like those extracted from the hay of 1875, being com
pletely sterilized by five minutes' boiling.
    The possible influence of age and dryness soon suggested itself, and          I
tested the surmise to the uttermost. Numerous and laborious experiments
were executed with hay derived from different localities; and by this means,
in the earlier days of the inquiry, it was revealed that the infusions which
manifested this previously unobserved resistance to sterilization were, one
and all, extracted from old hay, while the readily sterilized infusions were
extracted from new hay, the germs adhering to which had not been sub
 jected to long-continued desiccation.
    As the inquiry proceeded the distinction between old and new hay
became more and more blurred, while prolonged experiment with hay of
various kinds failed to rescue the question from uncertainty.            I  there
fore turned to substances of a succulent nature            — to fungi, cucumber,
melon, beetroot, and artichoke, for example, whose parasitic or epiphytic
germs were unlikely to have suffered desiccation.
    Boiled for periods varying from five to fifteen         minutes  and exposed
afterwards to moteless air, in numberless experiments these infusions
broke down, charging themselves throughout with organisms, and loading
 themselves, almost in all cases, with a soapy corrugated scum.
    I then fell back upon infusions whose deportment had been previously
 familiar to  me, and   in the sterilization of which    I had never experienced
 any difficulty.    Fish, flesh, and vegetables were resubjected to trial.

1877.]               Putrefactive  and Infective Organisms.                     231
Though      the precautions taken to avoid contamination were far more
stringent than those observed in my first inquiry, and though the in
terval of boiling was sometimes tripled in duration, these infusions, in
almost every instance, broke down.          Spontaneously   purified  air, filtered
air, and calcined air (calcined,    I may add, with far greater severity than
was found necessary a year previously) failed, in almost all cases, to
protect the infusions from putrefaction.
    I was sometimes cheered by a success which, at the time of its occur
rence, would seem to be the result of increased severity in the methods
of experiment.        But the success was subsequently so opposed by failure
that it finally stood out rather as an accident than as the normal            result
of the inquiry.
    I had the most     implicit confidence in the correctness of my earlier
experiments ;      indeed incorrectness     would   have  led  to   consequences
exactly opposite to those arrived at. Errors of manipulation would have
filled my tubes and flasks with organisms, instead of leaving them trans
parent and void of life. By the unsuccessful experiments above referred
to a clear issue was therefore raised     : — Either infusions of fish, flesh, and
vegetables had become endowed in 1876 with an inherent generative
energy which they did not possess in 1875, or some new contagium ex
ternal to the infusions, and of a far more obstinate character than that
of 1875, had      been brought to bear upon them at the later date.              The
scientific mind will not halt in its decision between these two alterna
tives.
    For my own part the gradual but irresistible interaction of thought and
experiment made it in the first instance probable, and at last certain, that
the atmosphere in which        I worked had become so virulently infective as
to render utterly impotent precautions against contamination and modes
of sterilization which had been found uniformly successful in a less con
taminated air.       I therefore removed from the laboratory, first to the top,
and afterwards to the basement of the Royal Institution, but found that
 even here, in a multitude of cases, failure was predominant, if not
uniform.       This hard discipline of defeat was needed to render me
acquainted with all the possibilities of infection involved in the con
 struction of my chambers and the treatment of my infusions.
    I  finally resolved to break away from the Eoyal Institution, and to
 seek at a distance from it a less infective atmosphere.       In Kew Gardens,
thanks to our President, the requisite         conditions were found.       I  chose
for exposure in the Jodrell laboratory        the special infusions which had
proved most intractable in the laboratory of the Eoyal Institution.              The
 result was that liquids which in Albemarle Street resisted two hundred
 minutes'    boiling,   becoming afterwards     crowded   with organisms, were
 utterly sterilized by five minutes' boiling at Kew.
  .  A  second clear issue is thus placed before the Eoyal Society       : —Either

232               Prof. J.  Tyndall on the Deportment of               [May 17,
the infusions had lost in     Kew Gardens an inherent generative energy
which they possessed in our laboratory, or the remarkable instances of
life development, after long-continued boiling, observed in the laboratory
are to be referred to the contagium of its vessels or of its air.
    With a view to making nearer home experiments similar to those
executed at Kew,     I had a   shed erected on the   roof of the Royal Institu
tion.    In this shed infusions were prepared and introduced into new
chambers of burnished tin, which had never been permitted to enter our
laboratory.     After their introduction the liquids were boiled for five
minutes in an oil-bath.
    The first experiment in this shed resulted in complete failure. Not
one of the infusions exposed to the moteless air of the shed escaped
 putrefaction.
    Either of two causes, or both of them combined, might, from my
point of view, have produced this result.         First, a flue from the labora
tory was in free communication with the atmosphere not far from the
shed ; secondly, and this was the real cause of the infection, my assistants
in preparing the infusions had freely passed between the laboratory to
the shed. They had thus incautiously carried the contagium by a mode of
transfer known to every physician.
    The infected shed was disinfected ; the infusions were again pre
 pared, and care was taken, by the use of proper clothes, to avoid the
 former causes of contamination.        The result was similar to that obtained
 at   Kew,  viz. organic liquids which in the laboratory withstood two
hundred minutes' boiling, were rendered permanently barren by five
 minutes' boiling in the shed.
                                                            I
    A third clear issue is thus placed before us, which should hardly think
 of formulating before the Koyal Society, were it not for the incredible
 confusion which apparently besets this subject in the public mind. A rod
 thirty feet in length would stretch from the infusions in the shed to the
 same infusions in the laboratory.       At one end of this rod the infusions
were sterilized by five minutes' boiling, at the other end they withstood
two hundred minutes' boiling.        As before, the choice rests between two
 inferences : — Either we infer that at one end of the rod animal and
                                                                           vege
table infusions possess a generative power which at the other end
                                                                            they
 do not possess, or we are driven to the
                                             conclusion that at the one end of
 the rod we have infected and at the other end
                                                      disinfected air.
    The second inference is that which will be
                                                       accepted by the scientific
mind.     To what, then, is the inferred difference at the two
                                                                     ends of the
 rod to be ascribed ? In one
                                   obvious particular the laboratory this year
 differed from that in which
                                  my first experiments were made.         On its
 floor were various bundles
                                   of old and desiccated hay, from which,
when stirred, clouds of
                             fine dust ascended into the atmosphere.        This
 dust proved to be both
                         fruitful and, in the highest degree, resistant. Prior

1877.]                Putrefactive and Infective Organisms.                  233
to the introduction of the hay which produced the dust, no difficulty as
regards sterilization had ever been experienced ; subsequent to its in
troduction     my difficulties and defeats began.
     I have twice glanced at periods of boiling amounting to two hundred
minutes ; for, after long and laborious trials of shorter periods     I advanced
to longer ones, subjecting turnip and cucumber infusions to the boiling
temperature for intervals varying from five minutes to three hundred and
sixty minutes.        Up to a certain point these liquids maintained their power
of developing life, but beyond this point complete sterility was the result.
In the preliminary experiments bearing upon this question the point of
sterilization lay between 180 and 240 minutes.             Boiled for the former
period the infusions continued fruitful ; boiled for the latter period they
remained permanently barren.
     In these and numerous other experiments a method was followed which
 had been substantially employed by Spallanzani and Needham, and more
recently by -Wyman and Roberts, the method having been greatly refined
 by the philosopher last named.           The flasks were partially filled with
 the infusions, the portions unoccupied by the liquids being taken up with
 ordinary unfiitered air.        Now as regards the death-point of contagia
 we know that in air it may be much higher than in water, the selfsame
 temperature being fatal in the latter and sensibly harmless in the former ;
 hence my doubt whether, in my recent experiments, the resistance of the
 contagium did not arise from the fact of its being surrounded, not by
 water but by air.
     I changed     the method, and made a long series of experiments with
 filtered air.      They were almost as unsuccessful as those made with
 ordinary     air.    From time to time     I  succeeded in producing complete
 sterility by five minutes' boiling ; but these successes were so checked by
 failures that, similar to other cases referred to, they appeared in the light
of accidents.        They were, however, by no means uninstructive, for they
 revealed the existence of breaks in the prevalence of the contagium, which,
 under the circumstances, might have been foreseen.
     A   rapid glance at the means employed to improve the method of
 experiment, and at the results of their employment, may be permitted
 here.     Bulbs, exhausted by an air-pump and afterwards heated almost
 to redness, were filled when cool with filtered air.               While being
 charged     with   the  infusions  the bulbs  were  warmed,  so as to produce a
 gentle outflow of air, and their necks were sealed while the outflow con
 tinued.      It was thus sought to avoid the contamination consequent on
 an indraught.
      The failures resulting from this mode of experiment greatly predo
  minated over the successes.
      Employing similar bulbs, their necks in the first instance were drawn
  out at the ends to tubes of capillary fineness.       The bulbs were then filled

 23i                Prof.   J.  Tyndall on the Deportment of                 [May 17,
 with one third of an atmosphere of filtered air, and, while connected with
 the air-pump, were heated almost to redness.                The capillary  tubes were
 then sealed with the lamp ; the sealed ends were afterwards broken off
 in the body of the liquid, two thirds of each bulb being thus filled with the
 infusion.      By great care it was found possible to reseal the capillary
 tubes without removing them from the liquid. The infusions were after
 wards boiled from five to fifteen minutes.
    Here also the fruitfulness of the boiled infusion was the rule, and
 its barrenness the exception.
    One source of discomfort           clung    persistently to my mind through
 out these experiments.          I  was by no means certain that the observed
 development     of   life  was    not   due to germs entangled in the film of
 liquid   adherent     to   the necks      and    higher    interior surfaces   of the
 bulbs.     This film might      have evaporated, and its germs, surrounded         by
 air and vapour, instead of by water, might on this account                  have been
 able to withstand       an ordeal to which         they would     have   succumbed  if
 submerged.
    A plan was therefore resorted to by which the infusions were driven
 by atmospheric pressure through lateral channels issuing from the centres
 of the bulbs.     As before,   each bulb was filled with one       third of an atmo
 sphere of filtered air, and afterwards heated           nearly to redness.      When
fully charged, the infusion rose higher than the central orifice, and no
portion of the internal surface was wetted save that against which the
liquid permanently rested. The lateral channel was then closed with a
lamp without an instant's contact being permitted to occur between any
part of the infusion and the external air.                    It was thus rendered
absolutely certain that the contagia exposed subsequently to the action
of heat were to be sought, neither in the superjacent air nor on the in
terior surfaces of the flasks, but in the body of the infusions them
selves.
    By this method      I tested in the     first place the substance which, at an
early stage of the inquiry, had excited my suspicion — without reference to
which the discrepancy between the behaviour of infusions examined in
the winter of 1875-76 and those examined in the winter of 1876-77 is
inexplicable, but by reference to which the explanation of the observed dis
crepancy is complete ;      I  mean, the old hay which cumbered our laboratory
floor.
    Four hours' continuous boiling failed to sterilize bulbs charged with
infusions of this hay.       In special cases, moreover, germs were found so
indurated and resistant        that five, six, and in one case even eight hours'
boiling   failed to  deprive them of life.
    All the difficulties encountered in this long and laborious inquiry
were traced      to the germs which exhibited the extraordinary powers
of   resistance here described.            They introduced a plague into our

atmosphere — the other infusions, those of fresh hay included, like a
smitten population, becoming the victims of a contagium foreign to
themselves *.
  It is a question of obvious interest to the scientific surgeon whether
those powerfully resistent germs are amenable to the ordinary processes
of disinfection.   It is
                      perfectly certain that they resist to an extraordinary
extent the action of heat. They have been proved competent to cause
infusions, both animal and vegetable, to putrefy. How would they behave
in the wards of an hospital ? There are, moreover, establishments devoted
to the preserving of meats and vegetables. Do they ever experience
inexplicable reverses ?    I
                          think it certain that the mere shaking of a bunch
of desiccated hay in the air of an establishment of this character might
render the ordinary process of boiling for a few minutes utterly nugatory,
thus possibly entailing serious loss. They have, as will subsequently
appear, one great safeguard in the complete purgation of their sealed
tins of air.
   Keeping these germs and the phases through which they pass to reach
the developed organism clearly in view,     I
                                          have been able to sterilize the
most obstinate infusions encountered in this inquiry, by heating them for
a small fraction of the time above referred to as insufficient to sterilize
them.   The fully developed Bacterium is demonstrably killed by a tem
perature of 140° F. Fixing the mind's eye upon the germ during its
passage from the hard and resistant to the plastic and sensitive state, it will
appear in the highest degree probable that the plastic stage will be reached
by different germs in different times.     Some are more indurated than
others, and require a longer immersion to soften and germinate.  For all
known germs there exists a period of incubation during which they pre
pare themselves for emergence as the finished organisms which have been
proved so sensative to heat. If during this period, and well within                it,
the infusion be boiled for even the fraction of          a   minute, the softened
germs which are then approaching their phase of final development will
be destroyed.   [Repeating the process of heating every ten or twelve
hours, before the least sensible change has occurred in the infusions,
each  successive heating will destroy the germs then softened, until,
after    sufficient number of heatings, the last living germ will dis
          a
appear.
   Guided by the principle here laid down, and applying the heat discon-
tinuously, infusions have been sterilized by an aggregate period of heating,
which, fifty times multiplied, would fail to sterilize them            if
                                                                     applied
continuously.    Four minutes  in the   one case can  accomplish what   four
hours fail to accomplish in the other.

   If   properly followed out, the method of sterilization here described is
infallible.    A temperature, moreover, far below the boiling-point suffices
for sterilization *.
   Another mode of sterilization,        equally certain and remarkable, was
forced upon me, so to speak, in the following way.                    In a multi
tude of cases a thick and folded layer of fatty scum, made up of
matted      Bacteria, gathered upon the surfaces of the infusions, the
liquid underneath becoming sometimes cloudy throughout, but frequently
maintaining a transparency equal to that of distilled water. The living
scum-layer, as Pasteur has shown in other cases, appeared to possess the
power of completely intercepting the atmospheric oxygen, appropriating
the gas and depriving the germs in the liquid underneath of an element
necessary to their development.
    Placing the infusions in flasks, with large air-spaces above the liquids,
corking the flasks, and exposing them for a few days to a tempera
ture of 80° or 90° F., at the end of this time the oxygen of the
 superjacent air seems completely consumed.             A lighted taper plunged
into the flask is immediately extinguished.          Above the scum, moreover,
 the interior surfaces of the bulbs used in my experiments were commonly
 moistened by the water of condensation. Into it the Bacteria sometimes
 rose, forming a kind of gauzy film to a height of an inch or more above
 the liquid. In fact, wherever air was to be found, the Bacteria followed it.
 It seemed a necessity of their existence. Hence the question, What will
 occur when the infusions are deprived of air ?
    I  was by no means entitled to rest satisfied with an inference as an
 answer to this question ; for Pasteur, in his masterly researches, has
abundantly demonstrated that the process of alcoholic fermentation
depends on the continuance of life without air — other organisms than
 Torula being also alleged to be competent to live without oxygen. Experi
ment alone could determine the effect of exhaustion upon the particular
organisms here under review.
    Air-pump vacua were first employed, and with a considerable measure
of success.      Life was demonstrably enfeebled in such vacua.
    Sprengel pumps were afterwards used to remove more effectually both
the air dissolved in the infusions and that diffused in the spaces above
them. The periods of exhaustion varied from one to eight hours, and
the results of the experiments may be thus summed up             : — Could  the air
   * On reading my paper, previous to its presentation to the Royal Society, Mr.
Huxley suggested a continuous exposure to a temperature not much above the death-
temperature of the adult Bacterium.   I had also noted the experiment for execution
myself.    It was made some weeks ago with perfect success. The most obstinate infu
sions, maintained for a few days at a temperature of 160° F., are sterilized. —

be completely removed from the      infusions, there is every reason to believe
that sterilization without boiling would in most, if not in all, cases be the
result.    But, passing from probabilities to certainties, it is a proved fact
that in numerous cases unboiled infusions deprived of air by five or six
hours' action of the Sprengel pump are reduced to permanent barrenness.
In a great number of cases, moreover, where the unboiled infusion would
have become cloudy, exposure to the boiling temperature for a single
minute sufficed completely to destroy the life already on the point of
being extinguished through defect of air.                                 I
                                                With a single exception, am
not sure that any infusion escaped sterilization by five minutes' boiling
after it had been deprived of air by the Sprengel pump. These five minutes
accomplished what five hours sometimes failed to accomplish in the pre
sence of air.
   The exception here referred to is old-hay infusion, which, though
sterilized in less than half the time needed to kill its germs where air is
present, maintained a power of developing a feeble but distinct life after
having been boiled for a large multiple of the time found sufficient to
render infusions of mutton, beef, pork, cucumber, turnip, beetroot, shad
dock, and artichoke permanently barren.
   These experiments gave me the clue to many others which might
have readily become subjects of permanent misinterpretation.            In the
midst of most virulently
           a                  infective  atmosphere, where, even after some
hours' boiling, there was no escape for infusions supplied with air, the
expulsion of the air by less than five minutes' boiling in properly shaped
retort-flasks, and the proper sealing of the flasks during ebullition,
ensured the sterility of the infusions.
   The meaning of     a former remark regarding the part played by boiling
in establishments    devoted to the preserving of meats and vegetables will
be now understood.
   The inertness of the germs in liquids deprived of air is not due to a
mere suspension of their powers. The germs are killed by being deprived
of oxygen. For when the air which has been removed by the Sprengel
pump is, after some time, carefully restored to the infusion, unaccom
panied by germs from without, there is no revival of life. By removing
the air we stifle the life which the returning air is incompetent to
restore.
   These experiments on the mortality arising from a defect of oxygen
are in a certain sense complementary to the beautiful results of M. Paul
Bert. Applying his method to my infusions,          I  find them sterilized in
oxygen possessing a pressure     of ten atmospheres or more.       Like higher
organisms, our Bacterial germs are poisoned by the excess and asphyxied
by the defect of oxygen.         A mechanical action may also come into
play.

        Frederick D. Brown, B.Sc. Communicated hy Henry E.
        Armstrong, Ph.D., F.R.S., Sec. C.S., Professor of Chemistry

    Observations of the physical         properties of chemical compounds have
been very numerous ; in many, however, the object aimed at has been
merely the definition of the substances in question, and the results lay
claim to no great accuracy.           In others, data have been required for the
solution of purely physical problems, and but little attention has been
paid to the chemical nature of the substances employed.                   In compara
tively few has equal importance been attached to both the physical and
chemical aspects of the question.
    If, then, we attempt to compare the physical properties of a series of
compounds presenting very similar chemical properties, we find that in
the case of one or two members of the series our knowledge is tolerably
   *  Bj  the excellent researches of Dallinger and Drysdale it has been proved that the
germs   of Monads, as compared with    the adult organisms, possess a power of resistance
to heat in the proportion of 11 to 6.

complete, but that with regard to the others little is known but their
approximate boiling-points and densities.
    Among the alcohols of the CbH(2„+i) . OH series, for example, there
are two (methyl and ethyl alcohols) with whose physical properties
we are well acquainted.       The expansion of these bodies has been deter
mined by Kopp, Pierre, Mendelejeff, and others ; the vapour- tensions,
latent  and specific heats by Begnault ; the latent heat by Andrews also ;
the refractive indices by Gladstone and Dale. Nearly all these researches,
and many more which might be enumerated, have been accompanied by
measurements of density and boiling-point.
   When we pass to the other members of the series we find, however,
that in the case of normal propyl alcohol, with the exception of numerous
determinations     of density and boiling-point,    experiments have been
limited, as far as  I am aware, to the measurement of the expansion by
Pierre and Puchot.      (The table of vapour-tensions given in the same
 paper is erroneous, as  I hope to prove in a future communication.)

                                                                        The
 same is to be said of all the other alcohols of this series, the rates of
expansion of some of which have been examined by Kopp, Iieben and
Eossi, "Wanklyn and Erlenmeyer, and others.
   In  order partially to supply this want    I  have undertaken a series of
 experiments, of which the following pages are the firstfruits.
    I. Density, Expansion,    and Vapour-tension  of Propyl and Isopropyl
                                    Iodides.
   The selection of these as my first experiments was prompted by the
following considerations : — If, as is possible, all the particular physical
characteristics of a given substance result from one main characteristic,
which    is, as it were, the fundamental definition of the substance (at
least from a physical point of view), then the various phenomena ob
 served must be dependent one on the other, and the measurement of
 the vapour-tension, for instance, or of the latent heat, of the given
 substance must involve implicitly all other measurements, such as
 those of the specific heat, rate of expansion, Ac. ; that this is not with
out foundation, is proved by the many partially successful attempts to
connect the various results obtained for certain bodies by mathematical
reasoning.
   A connexion    between the vapour-tension and rate of expansion of a
liquid organic body is rendered probable by the well-known researches
of Hermann Kopp and others.           From a large number of observations
conclusions were formed which may be thus summed up : — The atoms of
the various elements entering into the composition of substances of the
same chemical type always occupy the same space when the tension of
the vapour of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of
mercury 760    millims/in height.    Hence the molecules of isomeric sub

  240                    Mr. F. D. Brown          on the   Physical            [May 31,
  stances which differ only in the arrangement of their constituent atoms,
  and not in their number           or kind, must, when the tension equals 760
  millims., occupy the same space, or, in other words, the molecular volumes
  of isomers at their boiling-points are equal. If this relation exists be
  tween the molecular volumes of two isomers at those temperatures at
  which     their respective vapour-tensions are equal to 760 millims., it
  should equally hold good at all those corresponding temperatures at which
  the vapour-tensions are equal to any number n of millimetres, since the
  ordinary barometric pressure of 760 millims. is a special circumstance
  due to our residence on this planet and to the usual position of our
  laboratories at no great altitude.
     The study of the vapour-tensions, combined with that of the density
  and rate of expansion, enables us therefore to compare the molecular
 volumes at all those corresponding temperatures at which the vapour-
 tensions are equal ; should a uniform equality be apparent, it is evident
 that a connexion between vapour-tension and rate of expansion would be
 established.      For, let A and a be two isomeric liquids, D and d their
 respective densities, and H and h their vapour-tensions at any tempera
 ture    t,  we have D=/(<), d=f(t), H=0(<), h=y'(t);                       if we have
 observed that whenever \l=h ~D=d*, it of course follows that for any
 two values *, and <, such that ^iti)=<p'(t2) we shall have also /(t,)
  =/'«,)•
     Since the expressions <p(i) and/(t) present no peculiarities in the case
 of isomeric substances, it would be reasonable to suppose that in the case
 of other liquids there is also a relation between ^,(<) and/(<)-
    A   detailed description of the apparatus employed, together with all
 the precautions taken to ensure accuracy, must be reserved for the future ;
 a brief statement on this head is, however, indispensable.
     Thennometers.   —The     two thermometers        by which all measurements of
 temperature were taken are each about 20 inches long, and are divided
 on the glass into tenths of a degree ; the scale of the one (A) ranges
from -7° to 53°, that of the other (B) from 46° to 102°.                  These instru
ments were most carefully compared with a Kew standard                        which has
long been in the possession of the London Institution.
    The bath in which the comparisons were made was 22 inches in
height and 12 inches in breadth, and was filled with water which was
rapidly and constantly stirred ; the readings were marked on paper
divided carefully into squares, and the points united by a curved tine ;
the corresponding         readings of the air thermometer derived from
Regnault's Tables being also marked, the correction for any subse-

   Determination  of  Densities. — The   capillary ends of a TJ-tube of Dr.
Sprengel's pattern, the capacity of which is about 14 cub. centims., were
bent down as at A and B ; when the tube had been filled with the
liquid, and fastened to the thermometer in the position shown in fig. 1,
a small tube D, containing       a little of the liquid, was suspended so
that the end A plunged into it; the tube was then completely filled
by sucking with an india-rubber tube at B, and lowered into a large
beaker of water, the temperature of which was slightly above that of
the room ; after stirring frequently for about 15 minutes, the thread sup
porting the tube D was removed from the clamp E to a fixed ring E.
The temperature having been read, the clamp E was finally raised, carry
ing with it the density-tube completely full. On exposure to the cooler
air the liquid in the capillaries quickly recedes, and the tube may be
wiped dry and weighed.
   This slight modification of the ordinary method enabled me to deter
mine easily the density of a liquid at any temperature above that of the
atmosphere, however great might be the rate of expansion.            The tube
being completely full, the error which in general arises from the adherence
 of the liquid to empty portions of density-tubes &c. is avoided. The

   Rate  of Expansion.
                         — Dilatomoters,     similar to those used by Kopp,
Pierre, and others, were employed, the necessary data concerning them
being obtained in the usual way, slight modifications excepted.         The in
struments, when filled with the liquid to be examined, were compared
 withthe thermometers A and B, in the large bath mentioned above, in
which they were completely immersed ; readings were taken both when
the temperature of the water was rising and when it was falling. When
both dilatometers were filled with the same liquid, the volumes obtained
at any given temperature differed only in the fifth decimal place.
    Vapour-tension. — The apparatus shown in fig. 2 was used in the
case of the iodides.     The vapour of the liquid boiling in the bulb A
condenses in the tube    BB and runs back by the small tube      c ; any cooling
of the thermometer by the condensed vapour is thus avoided. R is a
reservoir of air with a tap T, with which an air-pump is connected, while
the tube E is connected with a pressure-gauge formed of two communi
cating columns of mercury.        The thermometer is placed in the tube d,
which is closed at the bottom and contains a little mercury.
                                    Fig. 2.
   A liquid which is not decomposed by heat below its boiling-point will
boil in this apparatus at any temperature and for any length of time,
without the thermometer varying one hundredth of a degree.                About
 100 cub. centims. of the liquid were put in the bulb.
   Normal Propyl Iodide. — This substance was prepared by treating pure
propyl alcohol with hydriodic-acid gas ; the saturated liquid was distilled
with steam, the distillate shaken several times w;ith a weak solution of
caustic soda, a little iodine added to destroy the phosphorus compounds,
again shaken with soda, then with water, and finally dried with phosphoric

   The densities of        I., II., and  III.  were as follows    : —

                       III.    1-74628 at 20-91     ;  1-78550 at 0.
   The densities at zero are calculated by means of the curve of expan
sion afterwards determined.
   For the mean density of zero we have D = 1-7863.
   The density is given by Chapman and Smith (Chem. Soc. Journ. xxii.
195) as 1-7343 at 16°; by Eossi (Ann. Chem. und Pharm. clix. 79) as
1-782 at 0° ; by Linnemann (Ann. Chem. und Pharm. clxi. 34) as 1-7610
at 16°; and by Pierre and Puchot (Ann. Chim. et Phys. (4) xxii. 286) as
1-7842 at 0°.
   To obtain the rate of expansion,           one  of the dilatometers was filled with
Fraction I. and another with III.              The final results were as follows :—

   The difference between the numbers at the higher temperatures is
doubtless partly due to the fact that Pierre measured the density at only
four temperatures, viz. 0°, 9°-l, 52°-6, and 75°-3, and then calculated
the above series of numbers by means of a formula of interpolation ; it
will be observed that a small error in the determination of the density at
75°-3 would be sufficient to cause the discrepancy referred to.
   The vapour-tension of the normal iodide was determined by boiling in

   I  attempted    to   measure the vapour-tensions of this substance in
an apparatus similar to that now used         for the analysis of gases, one of
the vertical   tubes, however, being heated in a large quantity of water,
which was made to circulate by means of a screw.                    This apparatus
(which will be described on another occasion) answers perfectly in the
case  of most substances, but both the iodides now under consideration
are decomposed by the mercury ; the normal iodide, however, being but
slowly acted upon in the cold,       I   was able to measure the vapour-tension
several times at about 7°. The mean result shows a tension of 15*4
millims. at 7°-5.
   The curves constructed by means of the above data diverge gradually
until at a tension of 7 60 millims., the corresponding temperatures differing
                                       t

t = the temperature in degrees Centigrade + 7°-5) expresses the observa

    The  above numbers show that the relation between vapour-tension                    and
expansion, which had been rendered probable by Kopp's researches, does
not exist, that the molecular volumes of the two isomers at correspond
ing temperatures are unequal, that of the normal iodide being greater
than that of the other by an almost constant quantity.                   This fact is in
accordance with the modern dynamical hypotheses on the constitution of
matter.      Isopropyl iodide is more unstable than the normal iodide ; its
instability may be due to the greater velocity of its molecules ; from this
greater velocity would follow a greater mean distance between the
molecules.
    I  may here mention that         I  have made a very complete series of ex
periments on the vapour-tension of normal propyl alcohol.                      The curve
representing       these   observations      intersects    that  which     expresses the
tensions of normal propyl iodide, so that whereas at 760 millims. the
iodide boils at 102°-5 and the alcohol at 97°-3, at 370 millims. they boil
at the same temperature, viz. 79°-5, and at 120 millims. the boiling-
point of the iodide is only 49°-5, whilst that of the alcohol is 56°.
   This fact, which probably arises from the much greater latent heat of
propyl alcohol, obviously renders useless all attempts to derive the
boiling-points from the constitution of chemical compounds, so long as
the boiling-points at the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere alone are
taken into account.

  experimented upon, and would be of no great value in the absence of
  some means of defining the intensity    of the corresponding sound.      It is
  bad policy, however, to despise quantitative estimates because they are
  rough ; and in the present case it is for many reasons desirable to have a
  general idea of the magnitudes of the quantities with which we have to
  deal. Now it is evident that a superior limit to the amplitude of waves
  giving an audible sound may be arrived at from a knowledge of the energy
  which must be expended in a given time in order to generate them, and
  of the extent of surface over which the waves so generated are spread at
  the time of hearing. An estimate founded on these data will necessarily
  be too high, both because sound-waves must suffer some dissipation in
  their progress, and also because a part, and in some cases a large part,
  of the energy expended never takes the form of sound-waves at all.
  •  The source of sound in my experiment was a whistle, mounted on a
  Wolfs bottle, in connexion with which was a siphon manometer for the
  purpose of measuring the pressure of wind. This apparatus was inflated
  from the lungs through an india-rubber tube, and with a little practice
  there was no difficulty in maintaining a sufficiently constant blast of the
  requisite duration.    The most suitable pressure was determined by pre
  liminary  trials, and was  measured by a column of water 9£ centimetres
  high.
.    The first point to be determined was the distance from the source to
  which the sound remained clearly audible.     The experiment was tried in
  the middle of a fine still winter's  day, and it was ascertained that the
  whistle was heard without effort at a distance of 820 metres. In order
  to guard against any effect of wind, the precaution was taken of repeating
  the observation with the direction   of propagation    reversed, but without
  any difference being observable.
     The only remaining datum necessary for the calculation is the quantity
 of air which passes through the whistle in a given time. This was deter
  mined by a laboratory experiment.      The india-rubber tube was put into
  connexion with the interior of a rather large bell-glass open at the bottom,
  and this was pressed gradually down into a large vessel of water in such
  a manner that the manometer indicated a steady pressure of 9,J centi
  metres.    The capacity of the bell-glass was 5200 cubic centimetres, and
  it was found that the supply of air was sufficient to last 26£    seconds  of
  time.   The consumption of air was therefore     196 cubic centimetres per
 second.

     In working   out the result it will be most convenient to use consistently
  the C.G.S. system.        On this system of measurement the pressure
 employed was 9^ x 981 dynes per square centimetre, arid therefore the
  work expended per second in generating the waves was 196 x9Jx 981
  ergs. Now the mechanical value of a series of progressive waves is the
  same as the kinetic energy of the whole mass "of air concerned, sup
  posed to be moving with the maximum velocity of vibration (v) ; so that,
  if S denotes the area of the wave-front considered, a be the velocity of
  sound, and p be the density of air, the mechanical value of the waves
  passing in a unit of time is expressed by £S . a . p . v2, in which the
 numerical value of a is about 34100, and that of p about -0013. In the
  present application S is the area of the surface of a hemisphere whose
 radius is 82000 centimetres     ;  and thus,    if the whole energy of the   escap
 ing air were converted into sound, and there were no dissipation on the
 way, the value of v at the distance of 82000 centimetres would be given
 bv the equation
                        v*=

 whence                 t1=•0014    centimetre per second.
 This result  does not require a knowledge          of the pitch of the sound. If
 the period be   r, the relation between the maximum excursion x and the
 maximum velocity v is

 about 2730.     Hence

 or the amplitude of the aerial particles was         less than a  ten-millionth of
a centimetre.
    I am inclined    to think that on a still night a sound of this pitch,
whose amplitude is only a hundred-millionth of a centimetre, would still
be audible.
III.    " On   the alleged Correspondence of the Rainfall at Madras
       with the Sun-spot Period, and on the True Criterion of Peri
       odicity in a series of Variable Quantities." By General
       Strachey, R.E., C.S.I., F.R.S.               Received May 3, 1877.
    A  paper has recently been printed by Dr. Hunter, the Director-General
of Statistics to the Government of India, having for its object to show
that the records of the rainfall at Madras, for a period extending over
sixty-four years, establish a cycle of rainfall at that place which has a
marked coincidence with a corresponding cycle of sun-spots — the rainfall
and sun-spots attaining a minimum in the eleventh, first, and second
years, and a maximum in the fifth year.

        250              General Strachey on the Correspondence               of       [May 31,
            Irrespective of its scientific interest, the conclusion thus adopted
        would, if sound, be of no little practical importance, as it would supply a
        means of indica'ting the probable recurrence of those seasons of excessive
        drought which produce such terrible results in India, and from one of
        which the Madras provinces are now suffering in an extreme degree.
            It is probably generally known that the conclusion which it has thus
        been stated is to be drawn        from the Madras observations had been con
        sidered to be established some years ago, in a more general manner, by
        Mr. Meldrum, the Director of the Meteorological Observatory at Mauri
        tius, a paper by whom on this subject was read before the Royal Society
        in 1873, and may be found in vol. xxi. of the ' Proceedings,' p. 297.
            As the numerical results of the method of treating the rainfall obser
        vation which Mr. Meldrum and Dr. Hunter have followed at first sight
        may appear to support the conclusions they have adopted, it has seemed to
        me desirable to examine the facts, with a view to arriving at an independent
        opinion as to the trustworthiness or otherwise of those conclusions.                       I
        shall first refer to the Madras observations and Dr. Hunter's results.
            The Madras register extends over sixty-four years, beginning with 1813.
        The mean rainfall for the whole period is 48-5 inches. The deviations
        from the mean vary from 301 ins. in defect to 39-9 ins. in excess.                     The
        arithmetical mean of these deviations (disregarding the signs) is 12-4 ins.
        The greatest difference between two consecutive years is 50*5 ins., and
        the average difference 15"8 ins.
            Dr. Hunter, in order to test the point which he proposes to investigate,
        divides the sixty-four years' observations into six cycles of eleven years,
        and calculates the arithmetical mean of the successive years of the whole
        series of cycles. The results are shown in the following Table, the
        figures in which represent the differences of the several years' observations
        from the mean of the whole : —

    1877.]                the     Rainfall with the Sun-spot Period.                               251
        In  the above calculation the first year of the cycle of eleven is 1813, so
    that the average period of maximum sun-spots will be about the third or
    fourth year of the cycle, and the period of minimum will be about the
    tenth or eleventh of the cycle.               This Table certainly seems to indicate a
    period    of    maximum         between    the  third and the seventh years, and of
    minimum between the eighth and the second years.
        But to estimate the true weight of these results we must look a little
    deeper.        Now the only signification of the arithmetical mean of a series
    of observed quantities is that it is a quantity above and below which there
    is an equal amount of deviation in the aggregate of individual observations.
    Further, conformity to a law of any sort in a series of observations in
    relation to quantity is obviously to be tested by the extent of deviation of
    the observed quantities from the resultsthat such law requires.                            Conse
    quently, in the present case, the question whether or not the mean values
     shown in Table I. can be accepted as showing a definite law of variation
    from year to year in the cycle must be determined by examining the differ
     ences between those means and the individual observations on which they
    are based.
         Treating the observations in this manner, the following results are
     obtained    : —

    gives a closer approximation to the actual observations than is got by
     taking the simple arithmetical mean as the most probable value for any
    year.
        In     order to obtain a practical test of the probable physical reality of
    the cycle of eleven years,            I have calculated a series of mean values corre
     sponding to those given          in   Table   I. for a series of cycles of five, six, seven,
     eight, nine, ten, twelve, and fourteen years.                  1 find that the mean differ
     ences between         these     means    and    the   observed    quantities, and therefore

         Now if in any series of quantities, such as the rainfall observations at
      Madras, there be a law of periodicity, each observed quantity may be sup
      posed to be compounded of a periodical and a non-periodical element.                          If
      we take the sum of a large number of cycles each of which coincides with
      the cycle of periodicity, the non-periodical elements will tend to occur
      in equal amount in excess and defect, and thus to be eliminated, and the
      means for the successive years of the cycle, or whatever the intervals be
      (which        I will term cyclical means), will tend to indicate the periodical
      elements for the successive intervals.                 At the    same time, the differences
      of  these cyclical means from             the several original quantities from which
      they were obtained will approximate to the several non-periodical elements.
       These differences        I  will call cyclical differences.
          In proportion        as the periodical elements are small or large             in relation

1877.]             the  Rainfall with the Sun-spot Period.                     253
to the corresponding non-periodical elements, so the cyclical differences
will be inversely less or more different from the differences between the
individual observations and the mean of the whole of them          ; and  if  there
be no periodicity,    the cyclical means   will tend to disappear, and the two
sets  of differences would, in a sufficiently long series, be identical.
   Hence it may be inferred that when the cyclical differences closely ap
proximate in magnitude to the mean difference of the original observa
tions from the arithmetical mean of all of them, the periodical elements in
those observations must be correspondingly small ; and this applies mani
festly to the whole of the cycles for which the differences are shown in
Table   III.
   Further to test the reality of the supposed periodicity shown in Table I.,
I have rearranged     the series of 64 years' observations, in a purely arbitrary
manner, in cycles of eleven years, by drawing the actual observations at
random one after another, and setting them down in succession till the
whole were exhausted.          From three arbitrary sets of six cycles thus
prepared the mean cyclical difference averaged 10-9, 11*2, and 11*6 —
results which again indicate that, by adopting the actual sequence of the
observed quantities of rain instead of taking them at random, we pro
duce no material       effect on the mean cyclical differences, nor any such
tendency    to a  diminution    in their numerical value as necessarily accom
panies a true periodical element.
   It is, moreover, important to bear in mind that the mere circumstance
of any series of cyclical means showing a single maximum and single
minimum gives no more real indication that such a result is a truly
periodical feature than would be supplied by the appearance of two or
more maxima and minima.            The law of periodicity, if it exist at all, can
only be inferred by the facts indicated by observation ; and it is obviously
to argue in a circle, first to assume a cycle on which to work, which
shall give a single maximum and minimum, and then to infer that there
is true periodicity because of the single maximum and minimum.                  The
test of the periodicity is in truth to be sought altogether outside of the
particular values of the successive cyclical means.
   It is, of course, manifest that a complication of periodical          elements
may so mask one another          as to prevent   positive results being obtained
by such an examination of the cyclical means and differences as             I  have
made in the case before us. But the whole scope of my present argu
ment is negative, and it necessarily leads,      I think, to the conclusion that
the   cyclical   variations   shown    in Table  II. from the mean values in
Table I. are so great as to show that any apparent regularity or ten
dency to a maximum in one part of the 11-year cycle, and a minimum
in another, has no real weight, and that there is no proof of greater
tendency to periodicity in the 11-year means than in the original isolated
observations.
   This might perhaps       be considered all that  need be said on this subject

       but an objection may possibly be made to the effect that the sun-spot
       period is not exactly a cycle of eleven years, and that a better result may
       be obtained by a comparison of the observations corresponding to the
       known periods of maximum and minimum sun-spots, without reference
       to any special length of cycle. The following Tables show the results
       thus arrived at, the figures representing differences from the mean rain
       fall for the whole sixty-four years.

          These results are also negative.              The maximum period cannot be said
       to be indicated at all.         The minimum shows a diminished mean cyclical
       deviation, but this is due to the years furthest from the supposed mini
       mum epoch ; and if the three central years alone are reckoned, the result
       is much the same as obtained from the 11-year cycles.
          I  have    sought for a further test of the character of the conclusions
       that  I have been      discussing in the rainfall observations at Bombay and
       Calcutta, which have been made for the greater part of the period over
       which those at Madras extend.                It is hardly    conceivable that there should
       be a coincidence with the sun-spot period, such as is supposed to have
       been found at Madras, based on any physical cause, which should not in
       some way be discernible in the rainfall at Bombay and Calcutta.                         Adopt
       ing the    same 11-year        cycle for the observations at these two places as
       was used in the case of Madras, the mean results for the three localities
       are exhibited in the following Table : —

      eleven years of the cycle differs very little from the mean variation of

             In  this case the mean deviation of the original observations from the
       arithmetical mean of the whole series (24-9 inches) is 4-1 inches.                         This
       result therefore         is quite analogous      to that obtained from          the    Indian
       observations.
             I have not attempted to make detailed calculations in other cases, but,
       so far as I can judge, the evidence of the alleged periodicity will be gene
       rally found to fail         w•hen   it is tested by comparison with the individual
       observations on which it has been made to rest.
             It will serve to illustrate the argument on which this paper is based
       if we consider what would be the consequence of applying it to a case in
       which a well-ascertained            periodicity exists, as that of the diurnal baro
       metric oscillation.           The    following Table gives an example, taken at
       random from an old Madras register, the intervals being made two-hourly,
        so as to reduce the number of calculations.                 The entries are the differ
       ences of the observed barometric heights from the mean of the whole in
       thousandths of an inch.

of all the differences last mentioned for the several series will tend to
equality with the sum of all the periodical elements of the several series.
This willbe true whether we regard the algebraic sign or not.       we so                 If
regard    the sum of the differences will evidently become equal to zero,
          it,
as also will the sum of the periodical elements. If we disregard the
                    -

   Hence, when there           is   a   true periodicity, the sum of these differences
taken without regard to sign tends to become an invariable quantity, and
the numerical magnitude of this quantity indicates the magnitude of the
periodical variation.

will hold good of all the series B, C, &c. At        the same time, as there is
no periodicity, and all the observations are presumably liable to errors or
irregularities of the same general character in a positive or negative di
rection, the quantities E„, E6, &c. will, in a sufficiently prolonged series,
tend to equality one with another and also with the mean deviation,
irrespective of sign, of all the observed quantities from the arithmetical
mean of the whole of them, which call E.
    Hence, when there is no periodicity, the sum S, as before defined, tends
to become n      x ~r=.

    We are thus led to the conclusion that the consideration of the succes
sive values of the quantity S as the number of cycles of periodicity
increases affords a true criterion of the presence or absence of a periodical
element.      If as (m) increases this quantity is gradually reduced in a ratio
                          E
approximating       to        we may infer that the periodicity is small or does
not exist.      On the other hand, if the value of S tends to become invari
able, and continues to be of considerable numerical magnitude after a
prolonged series of cycles, the existence of a true periodical element is
apparent.

order to test the process        I   have continued the calculation to twelve,
 eighteen, and twenty-four cycles, by combining with the real observations
the three series formed at hazard by a chance redistribution of the original
observations.     This of course gives no support to any conclusions as to
the existence of periodicity in the case of Madras ; but it shows how, in
the absence of periodicity, the theory is completely verified.
     The Bombay, Calcutta, and Greenwich observations, similarly treated,
exhibit similar results.
     In  strong contradistinction to the above results are those that follow
 on treating in a similar manner the barometric observations given in
 Tables VIII. and IX. ; while these same observations, when their true
 periodicity is destroyed, as in Tables X. and XI., show results quite
similar to those seen in Table XII.
     The following Table shows these results, both with the periodicity as
 it really exists and after it has been destroyed : —

       D. Niven, M.A., F.R.A.S.             Communicated by J. Clerk
       Maxwell, F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Physics in the
       University of Cambridge.         Received March 24, 1876*.
   In the present state of our knowledge of the resistance of the air to
shot, the problem of integrating the equations of motion of the shot and
of plotting-out a representation of the curve described by it is peculiar,
because, according to the best experiments we possess, the law of the
retardation    cannot   be  expressed   by a single exact formula    which   is
available   for the solution.     We are therefore compelled to give          a
solution adapted to Tables, the magnitudes of the retardation being set
down in those Tables for velocities which are common in practice.          The
formulae given by Hutton and by Didion, even if they were true, apply
only to spherical shot ; and though they are very simple formulae, the
solutions obtained by means of them are not satisfactory — first, by
reason of their complexity, and next on account of the rough approxima
tions which characterize the proofs.
                                                                   '
   Prof. Helie, who gives an account of Didion's method in his       Trait* de
Balistique,' says that it gives results which are not in accordance with
fact.   The fault may probably be laid in a great measure to the charge of
the formula ; for there can be no doubt that Mr. Bashforth's method of
experimenting with his chronograph and screens gives more trustworthy
and more extensive information      than the ballistic pendulum  experiments
of Hutton and Didion; and Hutton's formula, as well as Didion's,
agrees with Mr. Bashforth's Tables only for a limited range of velocities.
   Mr. Bishforth himself makes no attempt to condense his Tables into
concise formulae.     Accordingly, as we shall presently see, he adopts a
solution which is capable of being employed in conjunction with his
Tables. He divides the trajectory into small arcs, and finds for every arc
the time and the horizontal and vertical distances from one end of the
arc to the other.     The entire trajectory may then be plotted out, and the
whole time and range may be discovered, as well as the final inclination
of the direction of motion.      The amount of labour, however, in calcu
lating all the quantities for a single component arc, even with the aid of
copious tables, is so great that    I was led to examine whether any thing
could be done towards simplifying the solution and reducing the amount
of calculation.    It will appear in the sequel that rules of comparatively
easy application can be employed, and that the tables necessary for their
use are already existing or can be easily formed.
   Meanwhile, without entering into details, it will be convenient to give
 a brief account of the drift and scope of what is attempted in this paper.

                       of the Trajectories of Shot.                          269
The work is arranged under three heads, which are called the First, the
Second, and the Third Methods, intended to signify three distinct and
different solutions of the problem of finding the motion of shot.
   The First, which is the one adopted in Mr. Bashforth's treatise, is a
solution on the assumption that the retardation due to air-resistance is
ftv3, where ft is a constant. Now in the actual case ft is not constant ;
and therefore, in dealing with the equations of motion over any compo
nent part of the trajectory, a mean value of ft must be used.
   In contrast to the first method, the third adopts the mean value of
another quantity, viz. the inclination of the direction of motion.   The
same thing was done in General Didion's solution, in which it was neces
sary to employ the mean value of the cosine of the inclination. It will
be found that in selecting this mean we really implicate more quantities
than ft. But then there will be this advantage, that whereas there is no
way of determining the mean of ft by the first method, and the greatest
uncertainty prevails regarding it when comparatively large arcs are inte
grated over, according to^he work now presented the nature of the mean
is investigated.   In fact the determination of the mean angle may
be said to be the chief object and  point in these investigations, because it
will be seen that there is no difficulty in establishing any of the equations
which will be used, and, excepting the labour, no difficulty in forming
the Tables.
  What is described   as the Second      Method, although   a   distinct solution
w^hen  the retardation is formulated by ftv", is to be regarded as a mere
stepping-stone to the one which follows it. It is in the second method
that all the quantities are expressed in terms of the mean inclination and
the magnitude of that angle determined.     The quantity ft is taken con
stant ; and therefore, in the case when n=3, if we use the same mean
value of ft as in the first method, we ought to get a solution much the
same.    Beyond this, the second method possesses no further practical
value in the business now in hand, being entirely superseded in that
respect.   Its chief value and importance consist in the determination of
the mean angle, because it is shown that the same value of that mean may
be used in the third method.
   This point being settled, it will be found that, according to the latter
method, all the required quantities will depend on three integrals, two of
which (the space- and time-integrals) have already been tabulated by Mr.
Bashforth. The third, which may be called the velocity-integral, is now
also tabulated for ogival-headed shot, and will be found further on.
   § 2. It seems convenient at the outset to define the symbols which will
be employed throughout   the work    :   —
  v will denote the velocity of the shot at any point of the trajectory ;
  w, the horizontal component of v ;
     the inclination of the direction of motion to the horizontal line in the
   <p,
plane of the trajectory (the deflection from the plane being neglected)      ;

  t, the time   ;
  x, the horizontal distance from some fixed point                                   ;

   The integrations will be performed over a component arc of the trajec
tory, and the three last quantities are measured from the beginning of
the arc.   The values of t, x, and y over the whole arc will be denoted by
T, X, and Y. The values of u at the beginning and end of the arc will

     §    4. The law     of retardation            found             by     Mr. Bashforih, in his own

 d being the diameter of the cross section of the shot in inches, W its
 weight in pounds, and K    quantity which
                                      a         function of the velocity,      is   a
 and whose values are tabulated between certain values of the velocity for
 every ten feet. In integrating the equations of motion over any arc, the

272               Mr. W. D. Niven                   on the Calculation
quantity K, and therefore 2b, is taken constant, its mean value over the
arc as near as it can be guessed at being used.
   Taking this law, the above results, written in the order in which they
would be used by a calculator, are as follows                 :   —
                       y„£5(j^V,                                                            co

  The last three integrals Mr. Bashforth has given ample tables for,
corresponding to different values of y and between certain ranges of
angle.  If there is no table for the exact value of y which results from
equation (c), a method of interpolation must be employed.      The integral
P<p is in this case 3 tan <p+ tan3 and its values are tabulated as well as
                                             <j,,
those of its logarithm.
  It   will thus be seen that there are six distinct operations of some
length, the first being the most serious, because there     some difficulty is
in getting K right. Supposing, however, that point to be settled — and                     I
shall afterwards offer     few observations which will,

(b) and (c) are mere stepping-stones to the time- and distance-integrals.
I    shall now enter into an examination of the equations of motion, with
the object of proving other formulae, which, when we have once discovered
the velocity at the end of the arc, will give the time and distances with
two operations.

and its mean value must therefore be taken over a small arc.                               The tables
being     such   as  they    are, there     can   be   no  doubt     that,    if it were possible, the
most convenient independent variable would be the velocity itself.                                 On
the other hand, all attempts at humouring the equations of motion so as
to introduce the velocity as independent variable are of no avail.                             When
the trajectory        is very   flat, it   may be possible         to  get results     which  are  not
very objectionable ; but no general solution is hereby attainable.                                The
forms of the equations, however, suggest as a possibly good substitute
the horizontal component of the velocity. Accordingly, taking this quan
tity    as independent variable,            I now proceed to find the distance-integrals
 by a method of approximation.

fourth of the horizontal velocity is lost. Then
  It will  therefore be observed that the error committed is trifling.                                   As
<p will be small over the greater part of any trajectory,  this error                                 will

therefore be less than      in error.                         Moreover the error in                Y,   which
is really the more important of the two, is less than this, as          have                        I

are otherwise serviceable, their inherent errors do not seem to be a great
objection to their use.

   These formuhe might very easily be used                           if   the calculator were furnished
with tables of                                           where       N    ranges between the magni
tudes of the velocity occurring                     in   practice.
       Remarks on the Equation giving the                        Fall      of   Velocity in an Arc.
  §   11.   It   will    be observed that the two foregoing methods each open
 with the same equation (a). Now there           serious difficulty in the use
                                                                 is   a
 of that equation. Suppose, for example, we were to integrate over an arc
 of 1° we should have to use the mean value of K between its values
      :
 corresponding to the velocities at the beginning and end of the arc. But
 we do not know the latter of these velocities                the very thing  ;   it   is
 we have to find.     The first steps in our work must therefore be to
 guess  at it. The  practised calculator can, from his experience, make                                  a
very good estimate.    Having made his estimate, he determines K. He
uses this value of K in equation (a) and            he gets the velocity he
                                                             ;           if
guessed at, he concludes that he guessed rightly and that he has got the
velocity at the end of the arc. If the equation (a) does not agree with
him, he makes another guess      and so on, till he comes right. It seems
                                                ;
to me,  however, that this  method of going to work, leaving out of account

280                         Mr. W. D. Niven             on the Calculation
the loss of time, is open to objection in the point of accuracy. For, first,
there is no method of determining on what principle the mean value of
K   is to be found — what              manner         of mean it is.                 Again, let us suppose
for an instant that the Telocity at the end of the arc, guessed at, and the
value of K are in agreement ; that is to say, let the equation
                      /1000V           la     /1000V                  ,       <fK,D              „    N
hold for the values of v$ and K used by the calculator.                                          It   by no means
follows tha't he has hit on the right i1a and K. For if                                    he is dealing     with
                                              dK.
a   part of the tables in which                       happens to be nearly equal to
                                        _3Wg          sec3/3          (1000)'
it is obvious that there are ever                     so many pairs               of values of vp and K
which will stand the test of satisfying the above                                 equation. Now an exa
mination of Mr. Bashforth's tables for ogival-headed shot shows that the
value of         K    diminishes       as v increases from 1200 feet upwards, so                                 that
—r- is negative for a considerable range of values of v which are common
in practice.           It   is not     at all unlikely, therefore,                        that       the value    for
         just stated may often                  be very        nearly         true    ;    in which       case the
process of guessing becomes extremely dangerous.
    I
    shall in the next method give a plan for determining the velocity at
the end of the arc, which seems to me simpler and more satisfactory than
the one we have been now discussing.      Meanwhile, in connexion with
the present method, the following considerations are worthy of notice. -
    §    12.    Let   us consider the fundamental                     equation

    If          were uniform, it would                 be the             fall of horizontal velocity in
            ^
change of inclination equal to the unit of circular measure. As that
angle is inconveniently large for discussions connected with trajectories
of shot, let us take 1° for unit-angle, and let D be the number of degrees
in the angle whose circular measure is       We then have      <j,.

   The primarv use of these curves is that they enable us at                              a  glance to

282                   Mr. W. D. Niven                    on the Calculation
make a rough estimate of the loss of velocity over an arc of one degree ;
and we have seen that such an estimate must first be made if we are to
employ either of the foregoing methods.
  It is possible to make the preliminary guess more near the truth by
considering the approximate character of the curves.    For example, the
curve for ogival-headed shot is approximately a straight line, the tangent                            •
of whose inclination from 1700 down to 1250 is                            *5 ;   and from 1250 down
to 1000, -4   ;   below 1000       it is unsafe to assign a value.                    We can easily
prove for flat trajectories that the fall of velocity in one degree is either
between the values above assigned.

  Now instead of taking some mean value of the quantity K, as was
done in the two previous methods, let us make the supposition that the
quantity tp has its mean value — a supposition in this case by no means
extravagant, since for the greater part of the trajectory sec will vary                  f
very slowly.   We then have, if D is the number of degrees in a—                             ft,

Now the quantity
can be calculated for every 10 feet, by giving K its mean value over the
10 feet, beginning with 1700 for ogival-headed shot and with 2150 for
spherical.  Supposing this were done, and the results for all the compo
nents of 10 feet added together, the number opposite any velocity v would,
for example, in the ogival-head-shot tables, be the value of

   The quantities S. and T, have been tabulated by Mr. Bashforth for a
considerable range of values of v, the upper limit being either 1700
or 2150, according as the shot is ogival-headed or spherical.       The
tables for the ogival-headed shot have recently been revised and carried
to  one place further in decimals.       The quantities S, and T, may
therefore be  fortunately regarded   as completely determined ; and the
only question will be regarding the mean angle ^. Now it is a remarkable
circumstance that the value obtained for          <pin                if q is
                                                         not widely different
                                                             §   7,
from p, is very nearly the same for all values of n which are not far off from
3. But for b'mited portions of the trajectory the retardation may be con
sidered as varying according to some simple power of the velocity, though
that power is not the same from point to point, but still not far from 3.
We may therefore take the value of <p found in § 7 as applicable to the
method now in hand.      The adoption of this value of the mean angle,
since Y=Xtan^,, is really equivalent to supposing the shot to move
parallel to the chord ; and the above proof shows what the limits of inte
gration must be in order that the supposition may be made to approximate
to the actual case.  The most sensitive quantity in this method, especially
near the vertex of the trajectory, is Y ; and in finding it over an are cor
responding to a change of inclination as large as 5°, it is necessary to use
the correct value obtained in § 7. As regards the other three quantities
given by the integrals (a'), (b'), and (d'), it will not matter much                           if we
take          at least for flat trajectories.        If, however,               the trajectory is not
       n^^,
flat, and extreme accuracy is needful, it will be necessary to determine by
(a') the quantity q twice over
                               — first an approximate value of      in order             it,
to get the mean angle      <p,   next its value with the mean angle used in the
equation.
   The following Table gives the value of V, for ogival-headed shot as low
as 900 feet per second.    Below that value of the velocity Mr. Bashforth
does not give tables for the resistance, and the magnitudes of the resist
ance for the lower velocities of ogival-headed shot have yet to be found.

  in the following note, which he has kindly allowed me to subjoin : —

   I. "On     the Minute Structure and Relationships of the Lym
         phatics of the Mammalian Skin, and on the Ultimate Distri
         bution of Nerves to the Epidermis and Subepidermic Lym
         phatics." By George Hoggan, M.B., and Frances Elizabeth
         HoggaNj M.D.         Communicated       by  Dr. William          Farr,
         F.R.S.    Received May 11, 1877.
                                   (Abstract.)
      The authors state that, by means of certain modifications in known
  methods of histological research, a full description of which they offer,
  they have been enabled to show the minute structure and relationships of
  the lymphatics of the skin in mammals.
      For the purpose of anatomical description, they divide these lymphatics
  into three categories, named, from their position, the subhypodermic,
  the dermic, and the subepidermic.     Only the first and third can be de
  scribed as layers ; the second consists of horizontal and vertical sets of
  vessels, extending through the whole thickness of the dermis, and con
  necting the other two distinct layers together.
     All the lymphatics of the hypodermis, and most of those of the dermis,
  are valved efferent vessels, without any collecting channels that would
  entitle them to claim any absorbing function in these portions of the
  skin, through which they merely pass.
     The subepidermic lymphatics are narrow parallel collecting channels,
  destitute of valves, lying, as their name implies, immediately under the
 epidermic cells in young animals, although separated from them, as adult
 life is reached, by bundles of gelatinous tissue. These are the only
 radicles of the lymphatics of the skin.
     Upon the subepidermic lymphatics they find a rich plexus, formed by
 multipolar nerve-cells and non-medullated nerve-fibres, the distribution of
 which to the epidermis has been made evident by the same process. As
 no acknowledged contractile elements enter into the walls of these lym
 phatics, the function of the nerves found upon them cannot be affirmed
 by the authors.
     Neither sweat-glands, sebaceous glands, hair-muscles, fat-cells, nor nerve
 bundles possess any lymphatics, and the papilla) in the human skin are
 equally destitute of them. Functionally, the lymphatics of the skin are
 to be considered as forming two classes, the valved efferent vessels with
 independent walls, formed only of crenated endothelium cells, and the
valveless collecting channels of the subepidermis, lined by those crenated
cells.
     Upon the facts accumulated in this and their former paper the authors
are led entirely to reject the theory of vasa serosa or radicles of the
lymphatics, formed by chains of connective-tissue cells or the cavities in
which they lie. In the human skin especially these cells of the connec
tive tissue are numerous and in intimate relationship     with the superficial
                                                                x 2

blood-vessels, but prominently absent from the collecting lymphatic
channels lying alongside of these vessels, thus supporting the hypothesis
they formerly emitted, that these cells were merely links in a nutritive
chain, not radicles of the lymphatics, even when, as in tendon, the cornea,
&c., they are connected with the lymphatics.                            The paper is illustrated by
about a dozen and a half of camera-lucida                              drawings of microscopical
specimens in their possession.
II.      " Refractive Indices of Glass/' By J. Hopkinson, D.Sc,
          M.A. Communicated by Professor G. G. Stokes, Sec. R.S.
          Received May 25, 1877.
   Most of the following determinations were made two years ago.
They were not published at once, because the results showed more
variation than was expected. They are now made known for two reasons.
First, most of the glasses examined are articles of commerce, and can be
readily obtained by any person experimenting upon the physical properties
of glass ; these glasses only vary within narrow limits, and their variations
may be approximately allowed for by a knowledge of their density.
Second, most of the prisms having three angles from each of which
determinations were made, the probable error of the mean is very small,
and any error of the nature of a blunder is certainly detected.
  The form in which to present these results was a matter of much
consideration.    A curve giving the refractive indices directly is unsuit
able, for the errors of observation are less than the errors of curve-drawing
would be. The theory of dispersion is not in a position to furnish a
satisfactory rational formula.     The most frequently used empirical for
mula is     jj=a + b ~+c^ + .                  . . ,   where p is the wave-length    of the ray to
                     A" A
which fi refers.                  But to bring this within errors of observation it is
necessary to include                i, which       appears to be almost as important a term
                                    A
as   i.
     A
            There are two points of importance in the selection of an empi-
rical form  first, it must accurately represent the facts with the use of
                  :
the fewest arbitrary parameters ; second, it must be practically convenient
for the purposes for which the results are useful.
     In   the present ease the most convenient form is
                                        t,-l=a{l        + b.v(l+cx)},
where x is     numerical name for the definite ray of which fi is the refrac
                      a
tive index.    In the present paper line F, being intermediate between the
strongest   luminous  and chemical rays, is taken as zero.     Four glasses,
Hard Crown, Soft Crown, Light Flint, and Dense Flint, are selected on
account of the gooJ accord of the results, and the mean of their refractive
indices     ascertained for eacli ray this

 1877.]                    Refractive Indices of Glass.                           293
   It is interesting  to remark that the curve representing          fi in terms of
   has a point of inflexion       between C and D.       An examination of the
^
deviations   from calculation for several glasses shows that probably all
glasses exhibit a similar point of inflexion, the flints lower in the
spectrum or in the ultra red, and the crowns nearer to the middle of
the visible spectrum.       This fact may be of importance in the theory of
dispersion when a detailed theory becomes possible ; at least it is im
portant as showing how unsafe it would be to calculate fi for very long
waves or ultra-violet, waves from any formula of three terms.
   The following Tables of results need little or no further explanation ;
the first line gives the refractive indices finally obtained and regarded as
most probable, the second line gives the values of /i from the formula of
three terms
                           H-l=a{l + bx(l+cx)},
and the last gives the mean of the actual observations.

                                 (Abstract.)
   The instruments used in the experiments w ere — a guard-ring condenser
the distance between the plates of which could be varied and measured ;
a sliding   condenser which   could be adjusted so that its capacity was
equal to the former ; the quadrant electrometer used as an electroscope ;
a battery of 72 Daniell's elements.
   The method of experiment was to connect the middle of the battery
with the lower plate of the guarding condenser and with the           case of the
electrometer, to charge one condenser from one pole of the battery, the
other from the opposite pole, to insulate both, add their charges, and then
connect them to the quadrant of the electrometer.            The condensers are
equal when there is no deflection of the image. Two experiments are
needed in each case — 1st, the glass plate is introduced into the guard-ring
condenser, and the sliding condenser is made equal to it ; 2nd, the glass
plate is removed, and the guard-ring condenser is made equal to the sliding
condenser.     The two readings of the screw which measures the distance
of the plates of the former give the specific inductive capacity of the
glass.

   Two samples of the first of these     glasses were examined, taken         from
different  meltings,   and made   at different   times    ; they gave   the same
result.   It will be remarked that these determinations do not bear out
Prof. Maxwell's conclusion that the square of the refractive index for
long waves is equal to the product of the electrostatic capacity and the
magnetic permeability.     The quotient electrostatic capacity -f- density for
these glasses and also for solid paraffin lies between 2-0 and 2-3.

IV. " On      the Difference of Potential produced by the Contact of
       different Substances."    By E. B. Clifton, F.R.S., Professor
       of Experimental             Philosophy in the University of Oxford.
       Received      May 22, 1877.
    In order fullyto determine the origin of the difference of electric poten
tial which is exhibited at the terminals of a voltaic element, and on which
the electromotive   force of the element depends, it is necessary to inves
tigate the difference of potential produced at each contact of the different
substances contained in the element.
  This difference of potential was approximately determined by Volta in
certain cases of contact of two metals, and the investigation of the electric
condition of metals in contact has since been more fully studied by Kohl-
rausch and others.
    The difference of potential arising when a metal and a liquid are
brought in contact was pointed out by Volta, and has since been inves
tigated by Becquerel, Peclet, Pfaff, Buff, Kohlrausch, and others ; but the
results obtained have in most cases merely shown that a difference of
potential exists, and indicated the sign of this difference.
  The methods of observation adopted by Becquerel, Peclet, and Pfaff do
not indeed deal with the simple case of the contact of a given metal and
a given liquid, but introduce more than one active contact ; and the
method of Buff, which            Kohlrausch
                                          also employed, is objectionable
                                              has
from the fact that, in addition to a metal-liquid contact a metal-glass or
metal-lac contact has been introduced ; and this latter contact    believe,is,
                                                                           I
far from inoperative, producing, indeed,            a   very considerable difference of
potential.
   In endeavouring          to study this subject   I  have suppressed the solid
dielectric aud used     a    condenser having its opposed surfaces of metal and
liquid separated       by
                        a     plate of air, and have been careful to introduce only
a single operative metal-liquid contact.
   Although circumstances have prevented me from making much pro
gress with quantitative measurements — and, indeed, the experiments have

quantity of strong sulphuric acid (C) is introduced, which appears effectu
ally to dry the inside of the cup and a portion of the glass rod. In many-
cases, during the time required for an observation,       I failed to detect any
loss of charge, although six of these supports are used in the apparatus.
Even without sulphuric acid in the cup, this form of stand seems to in
sulate fairly well ; for, even in very damp weather, the loss from six such
stands rarely exceeded     one per cent, of the charge in a minute.
   The electrometer employed was Sir W. Thomsons quadrant electro
meter, in the simple form constructed by the late Mr. Becker, which
seems to me to be more sensitive than the more complex instrument,           and
to give equally    reliable results,  when    it is required    only to compare
differences of potential.       With this instrument and a condenser one
thousandth part    of the  difference of potential produced by the contact of
zinc and copper is very distinctly perceptible.
   The condenser was furnished with horizontal plates, which could be
separately levelled, and the upper plate could be moved normally to its sur
face, and adjusted with any required interval between the plates. In
observations of the difference of potential between a metal and a liquid,
the latter was contained in a glass vessel placed upon the lower plate,
and connected with this plate by a strip or wire of the same metal as
that covering the lower face of the upper plate.
   A form of key was used by which the condenser-plates can be con
nected by a metallic circuit, while the four quadrants of the electrometer
are maintained at the same potential, and the plates of the condenser can

1877.]                     Contact of different Substances.                               301
then be connected with the respective terminals of the electrometer, the
whole being well insulated.             By the same key the alternate pairs of qua
drants, in connexion with the respective plates of the condenser, can be
charged to a definite difference of potential by a voltaic cell, and can then,
while still in connexion with the condenser, be insulated without the least
risk of introducing an unknown potential by touching the metallic por
tions of the apparatus by the hand.
    With this apparatus the following experiments were performed.
    The upper condenser-plate of copper was connected by an insu
lated copper wire with one terminal of the electrometer, the other ter
minal being connected by an insulated copper wire with the lower con
denser-plate, which was again connected with a copper wire dipping in
distilled water, contained in a vessel standing on the lower plate.
    The two insulated wires connecting the condenser and electrometer
were now brought into metallic connexion by the key, thus putting all
four quadrants of the electrometer in connexion, and at the same time
uniting the copper condenser-plate with the wire dipping in the water.
 The copper plate and the water thus                  become    charged, the difference of
 potential being that due to the contact of copper and water.
    The upper (copper) plate is next brought near the surface of the water,
 which acts as the lower plate of the condenser, the interval between the
surfaces being from 0-l millim. to 0'2 millim.
    The metallic connexion between the connecting                       wires is now sup
pressed,     and    the  upper condenser-plate quickly           raised ; the needle of the
electrometer is at once deflected, and in the direction which indicates that
the upper plate is positive with respect to the lower.
    It appears,      then, that when copper and distilled water are in contact
they assume         a difference     of potential,     copper being positive to distilled
 water.
    Excepting Professor W. G. Hankel*, all previous observers, with
whose results         I am acquainted, agree in asserting that copper is negative
 to water    ;  but   I have repeated      the above experiment a great number of
 times under varied conditions, and always with the same result, so that
I  feel confident that copper is really positive to water.
    When the         vessel on the lower plate contained a saturated solution                of
 copper sulphate, and similar operations were performed to those above
 described, the result was that copper and a saturated solution of copper

    My   experiment*    gave no indication of the change of sign of the potential of copper
 with respect to that of water, which, according to Professor Hankel, takes place during
 the first few minutes of contact.       It is possible, however, that this change may have
 taken place, although the copper wire had not been immersed           more than   two or threo
 minutes when the difference of potential was obseired.
   At   the  tiire   my  experiments   were   performed   I had   not seen Professor Hankel'a

  sulphate assume in contact a difference of potential, copper being positive
  to the solution of copper sulphate.
      The difference of potential in this case appears to be about ^ of the
  difference of potential of copper and water in contact ; but          I do not yet
  feel in a position to make any very definite statements with respect to
  the relative magnitudes of the differences of potential of metals and
  liquids in contact.
      When the liquid employed was commercial sulphuric acid diluted with
  twenty times its volume of distilled water, the difference of potential
  observed was very small, so small, indeed, that copper and this dilute acid
  in contact may be regarded as practically at the same potential ; a very
  small difference of potential, however, exists in this case, and copper is
 negative to this dilute acid.
      Copper and a strong aqueous solution of caustic potash assume in con
 tact a small difference of potential, larger, however, than that observed
 in the last case, and copper is negative to the solution of caustic potash.
      There is a very marked difference of potential between copper and an
 aqueous solution      of potassium sulphide (liver of sulphur) in contact,
 copper being negative to this solution.
     Between copper and a strong aqueous solution             of potassium cyanide
 in contact there is a very considerable difference of potential, copper
 being negative to the solution.       The difference of potential in this case is
 comparable with the difference observed when zinc and copper are in
contact.
     Similar experiments were performed with the upper condenser-plate
of well-cleaned zinc, the liquid being connected with the lower plate by
a strip of zinc.       When the liquid is distilled water there is a marked
difference of potential, zinc being positive to water ; and the magnitude of
this difference of potential appears to be, very approximately at least, the
same as that observed in the case of copper and water.
     With zinc and dilute sulphuric         acid the difference of potential is
extremely     small ; but zinc  is slightly  negative to the dilute acid (1 volume
of sulphuric acid in 20 volumes of distilled water).
     In experimenting with zinc the greatest care is necessary in cleaning
the surface of the zinc condenser-plate, as zinc oxide is strongly negative
to zinc ; when the plate is very slightly tarnished, the sign of the differ
ence of potential      exhibited by the condenser, in the case of water, is
reversed,    the oxidized  zinc being negative to distilled water.
     When the upper condenser-platewasof            iron, and distilled water acted
as the lower plate, there was a small but distinct          difference of potential,
iron being negative to water.
     The experiments above described       seem to indicate that zinc and copper
are about equally positive to water, and that consequently zinc and copper
dipping in water are nearly at the same potential.
     This conclusion has been also arrived at by Sir W. Thomson as the

   1877.]               Contact of different Substances.                    303
  result of an experiment described by Professor F. Jenkin in his ' Text
  Book of Electricity and Magnetism ;' but this experiment seems to leave
  something to be desired on the score of sensitiveness, and      I was anxious
  to put the conclusion to a somewhat severer test.         With this object the
  following experiment was performed : —
      The condenser was furnished with carefully cleaned plates of zinc and
   copper, which were connected as before by insulated copper wires with
  the respective terminals of the electrometer.        Into a vessel containing
  distilled water two insulated plates of zinc and copper respectively (both
  carefully cleaned) were plunged and connected with the key above men
  tioned by copper wires.      By means of this key the zinc plate in water
  was connected with the zinc condenser-plate, and the copper plate in
  water with the copper condenser-plate, the two condenser-plates being
  separated by an interval certainly not more than 0-2 millim. The needle
  of the electrometer was at once deflected, and in a few minutes became
  stationary in a position showing a considerable deflection due to the
  difference of potential of the terminals of the zinc-water- copper ele
  ment, while the zinc and copper plates of the condenser are necessarily
  at the same potentials as the zinc and copper plates in the water.
     The key was now opened, so that the condenser-plates and electro
  meter, still in connexion as before, became insulated, and no change in
 the deflection of the electrometer-needle was perceptible.
     The condenser-plates were now quickly separated, but the electrometer-
 needle remained absolutely undisturbed.         It appears, then, that the zinc
 and copper plates in water are so nearly at the same potential, that the
 apparatus employed fails to show the difference between their potentials.
 Considering that if the zinc and copper condenser-plates are connected
 by a wire when at the same distance apart, and are then insulated and
 separated in the same way, the needle is so strongly deflected as to be
 turned completely round,       I feel justified in stating that clean zinc and
 copper plates when first plunged in distilled water, if not absolutely at
 the same potential, certainly do not differ in potential by the thousandth
 part of the difference of potential produced by the contact of zinc and
copper.
     The electromotive force, then, of a voltaic element composed of zinc and
copper plates dipping in distilled water, and connected by a copper wire,
is at first, for all practical purposes, due entirely to the difference of po
tential produced by the contact of zinc and copper, the water having no
perceptible effect.
    This was assumed by Volta, on less conclusive evidence, and forms the
basis of his reasoning with respect to the action of the pile devised by him.
    I  cannot, however, agree with Professor Jenkin that the water is also
at the same potential as the zinc and copper plates immersed in it. The
above-mentioned experiments seem to me to show that the water is
negative to both plates, but to the same extent.

    If  the potentials of the different substances in the voltaic element
just mentioned be represented by lines drawn perpendicular to an axis
along which the substances are distributed in the order in -which they occur
in the element, the zinc being furnished with a copper terminal, the dis
tribution of potential, when the circuit is not completed, is represented
by fig. 2.

    As    I  have not yet     obtained    sufficiently trustworthy     measures of
 the difference     of potential   between zinc or copper and          liquids, this
 figure    and  those  which  follow  do   not   represent quantitative relations;
 the zinc-water difference of potential C D may possibly be represented as
 too large, compared with the zinc-copper difference of potential A B. The
 figures are merely intended to represent the distribution of the potentials.
     Similar experiments were performed with zinc and copper plates dip
 ping in dilute sulphuric acid (1 volume of acid in 20 volumes of distilled
 water), and with the same result, viz. that the zinc and copper plates
 are, as far as can be observed, at the same potential ; and in this case, as
 the experiments previously described show, the liquid is very nearly at
 the same potential as the immersed metals.
     It is  possible that with more dilute sulphuric acid Professor Jenkin's
 statement will be found to be absolutely true, the zinc, copper, and
 dilute acid in which they are immersed being all at the same potential ;
 but with the dilute acid used the distribution of potential in this voltaic
 element is represented, in the same manner as before, by fig. 3.

     The series of metals and liquids which        I have examined   is small;  but,

so  far as it extends, the phenomenon of two metals being at the             same
potential when immersed        in a liquid is peculiar to zinc and copper, and
only takes place in the case of these metals when the liquid is either
water or dilute sulphuric acid, and when the metals have been recently
placed in it.
   For instance, when zinc and copper are immersed in a solution of
caustic potash, there is a small but distinct difference of potential be
tween the zinc and copper, copper being positive to zinc.            Again, iron
and copper in distilled water exhibit a marked difference of potential,
the copper plate being positive to the iron plate ; this is, of course, a
necessary consequence of the fact, previously stated, that copper is posi
tive to water, while iron is negative to water, and it is confirmed by the
experiments with a copper-water-iron element.
    Similar observations were made with zinc and iron in distilled water,
with the result that zinc in water is positive to iron in water.
    Connected with the experiment by which          I have attempted to show
that well-cleaned zinc and copper in water are at the same potential,
there are some points which seem worthy of mention.               When the con
denser-plate of zinc is thoroughly cleaned, but the zinc plate in the
water is not cleaned with the same care, the copper plate at first appears
to be slightly negative to the zinc plate ; but after a short time (the im
mersion of the plates being continued) this difference of potential dis
appears, and the two plates are, as before mentioned, exactly at the
same potential.      If the plates continue immersed a small difference
of potential again appears between them        ; but now the copper appears to
be positive to the zinc, and this difference of potential slowly increases
until it attains, after some hours, a considerable magnitude.
    A possible explanation of these changes seems to be that at first the
zinc oxide has not been entirely removed, and, being strongly negative to
the zinc, it causes the copper to appear negative to the zinc ; but as the
zinc becomes     acted upon by the water*, its surface becomes, partially
at least, coated with hydrogen, which is positive to zinc, and hence
the copper plate, assuming the same potential, or nearly so, as the
altered zinc surface, becomes       positive to the zinc plate.      As the time
of immersion is prolonged         the coating of hydrogen on the zinc be
comes more complete, and the apparent positive potential of the copper
with respect to the zinc increases, the zinc plate becoming less and less
operative in the water, and serving more and more as a mere support for
 the hydrogen.
    With amalgamated zinc the coating of hydrogen is formed much more
 evenly and rapidly ; and thus, in spite of the presence on the zinc plate of
 the mercury, which is considerably negative to copper, an amalgamated
 zinc plate and a copper plate in water, or in dilute sulphuric acid, exhibit,
 when first immersed, a larger difference of potential than zinc and copper

                                                                    Y. 2

under the same circumstances.          The result of my experiments up to the
present has, however, led me to conclude that the final difference of
potential between amalgamated zinc and copper in water, or dilute sul
phuric acid, is very nearly, if not exactly, the same as that exhibited by
zinc and copper under the same conditions, if the immersion of the plates
is sufficiently prolonged.
   This rise of the difference of potential between the plates of a voltaic
element while the circuit is open seems to me to be due to exactly the
same cause as the so-called polarization       of the plates when the circuit is
closed, but operating in the opposite direction.
   The natural result of this change in the difference of potential of the
immersed plates is, that, in a cell composed of zinc and copper plates im
mersed in water, the zinc being furnished with a copper terminal, the
difference of potential exhibited by the terminals should increase with
the length of time the plates have been immersed, the circuit of course
never having been completed.                                  I
                                      In order to verify this have endeavoured
to compare, by the electrometer, the difference of potential of the ter
minals of such a cell with the difference of potential of the terminals of
a Daniell's cell.     Several determinations gave nearly the same results ;
and the following numbers show the magnitude                of the change which
takes place :—
   D represents the difference of potential of      a Daniell's cell, in which the
amalgamated zinc plate is immersed in a liquid composed of 1 part by
weight of pure sulphuric acid and 4 parts by weight of distilled water.
According to Mr. Latimer Clark, D= 1-079 volt.
   The difference of potential of the copper terminals of a zinc-water-
copper cell is,
immediately after the immersion of the plates,
                             0-760 D, or 0-820 volt    ;
after the plates have been immersed 1-5 hour,
                             0-821 D, or 0-886 volt ;
after the plates have been immersed 3 hours,
                              0-838 D, or 0-905 volt.
   The experiments with the condenser           above  mentioned, by which the
corresponding change in the potentials            of the plates themselves was
observed, would      indicate   that the difference    of potential of zinc and
copper in contact (which     I  will represent, as usual, by Zn | Cu) is between
0-760   D  and   0-821   D,  and   nearer to the former.       This indication is
justified by the result of direct experiment, as described in a later part of
this paper.
   From the observations        previously described as to the difference of
potential   of copper   with  respect to water and with respect to a solution
of copper sulphate, it follows that when copper plates are immersed

respectively in water and in a saturated aqueous solution of copper
sulphate, the two liquids being separated by a porous partition, if no
difference of potential arise between the liquids in contact, the copper
plate in water will be positive to the copper plate in the copper-sulphate
solution.    The distribution of potential will be indicated by fig. 4.
                                      Fig.  4.

    Experiment, however, shows that the copper plate in water is dis
tinctly negative to the copper plate in the copper-sulphate solution.
 Hence it follows that there is a considerable difference of potential be
 tween these two liquids in contact, the copper-sulphate solution being
 positive to distilled water.
    The real distribution of potential in this case is therefore represented
 in fig. 5 ; as before, these figures are not drawn to scale, but only repre
 sent qualitatively the distribution of potential.

    Similar experiments indicate (though, in the        absence of perfectly reli
 able  measures,  perhaps  not   so conclusively)    that a saturated solution of
 copper sulphate is positive to dilute sulphuric acid and also to a solu
 tion of potassium cyanide when the first liquid is in contact with either
 of the two latter.
    Indeed   the experiments    I  have performed lead me to conclude that
 the 11 to 13 per cent., by which the difference of potential exhibited by
 the copper terminals of a Daniell's cell exceeds the difference of potential,

ahown by the copper terminals of a cell composed of amalgamated zinc
and copper in dilute sulphuric acid is mainly due to the contact of the
dilute sulphuric acid and the solution of copper sulphate in the Daniell's
cell.   The contact between the copper and the copper-sulphate solution
appears to add but little, and the contact of the zinc and dilute acid
next to nothing, to the difference of potential ; at all events in the
case where the acid solution is weak.
    In such a Daniell's cell the distribution of potential appears to be that
indicated in fig. 6.

    The very large difference of potential between copper and a solution
of potassium cyanide in contact, to which attention has been called at the
commencement of this paper, coupled with the fact that this difference
is of the opposite sign to that exhibited by copper and water, or copper
and a solution of copper sulphate in contact, shows that a voltaic cell of
considerable power may be constructed containing                 only one metal and
two liquids.    Such cells have long been known ; for instance, Becquerel's
cell, composed of platinum in nitric acid, and platinum in a solution of
caustic potash ; but the only cell of this kind which          I have seen described,
in which copper is the only metal present, is that devised by the late
Emperor Napoleon.
    A cell composed of copper in water and copper in a solution of potas
sium cyanide ( 1 part by weight of cyanide to 5 parts by weight of dis
tilled water) shows a difference of potential between its terminals equal
to 0-923 D, or 0-996 volt.
    This cell has, of course, a very large internal resistance ; but this re
sistance may be greatly diminished by substituting a saturated solution
of copper sulphate for the water ; and although this substitution causes a
loss of potential at the junction of the copper and liquid, yet it is much
more than compensated by the gain at the junction of the two liquids.
    Thus a cell composed cf copper in a saturated solution of copper sul
phate, and copper in a solution of potassium cyanide (1 part by weight of

minals a difference of potential equal to 1-102 D, or 1•189 volt.
   In order to test the constancy of this last-mentioned cell, it was con
structed    in the form usually adopted for Grove's battery : the inner
porous vessel contained 60 cub. centims. of the potassium-cyanide solu
tion, and in it was inserted a plate of copper ; the outer vessel contained
a solution    of copper sulphate maintained in a state of saturation by the
presence    of crystals of the salt, and the copper plate in this vessel was
bent round the flat porous vessel so as nearly to touch it on both sides.
The terminals were now connected by short wires with a tangent galva
nometer, and the current allowed to pass uninterruptedly, with the fol
lowing results : —

   It  appears, therefore, that though, for a voltaic element containing
only one metal, this cell has a considerable electromotive force, it is far
from constant in its action.
   In  endeavouring to compare the differences of potential arising in pairs
                         I
of metals in contact, have employed the method of Kohlrausch (Wiede
          '
mann's Galvanismus,' 1861, vol. i. p. 28), in which, by the aid of a con
denser having its plates of two metals, the difference of potential of these
metals, due to their contact, is compared with the difference of potential
exhibited by the terminals of a constant voltaic element.
   For the purpose of comparison        I used a Clark's standard cell (Phil.
Trans, vol. clxiv. p. 1), relying upon the reported constancy of the differ
ence of potential of its terminals ; and although   I  find that this difference
is very far from constant, yet the rate     of change is slow, and for experi
ments performed at intervals of only a few days it may be considered
constant within the limits of the experimental errors to which my present
apparatus seems liable.
   I  will denote by C the difference of potential of the terminals of this
cell at the time the following measures were made : —

                                       0-0745 C. (Mean.)
   With condenser-plates of zinc and copper carefully cleaned immediately
before commencing the series of measurements the following results were
obtained : —
                         Zn   |
                                  Cu=0-6180 C.
                                        0-6238 C.
                                        0-6172 C.
                                        0-6204 C.
                                        0-6198 C. (Mean.)
   In these experiments the circumstances were altered as much as pos
sible, the condenser-plates were adjusted at different intervals, and the
plates were in some cases separated slowly, and in others as rapidly as
possible ; yet the greatest amount of variation in the measures obtained
scarcely exceeds one per cent.
   These two measurements lead, by Volta's law, to
                              Zn     |
                                       Fe = 0-5453 C.
   Direct experiments     with condenser-plates       of zinc and iron   gave  the
following results : —
                          Zn  |
                                  Fe= 0-5228 C.
                                        0-5329 C.
                                        0-5198 C.
                                        0-5251 C. (Mean.)
   Unfortunately in   these experiments the plates were not cleaned imme
diately before the measurements were made, and the zinc plate was very
slightly oxidized, so that this series must give a value for Zn | Fe below
the true value. For this reason more confidence is to be placed in the
result deduced from the experiments with Zn and Cu and with Fe and Cu
than in that obtained by the last series.
   When mercury acted as the lower plate of the condenser and the
upper plate was of iron,   I obtained
                             Fe    | Hg= 0-23144 C.
   The above-mentioned results lead, then, to the following        : —

    This value shows that, on the occasion of the previous measures,
                          C = 1-273      D = 1-374 volt.

    The experiments from which the above-mentioned ratios of Zn | Cu
 to the difference of potential of the terminals of Clark's standard cell are
 deduced were performed on January 5 and January 8, 1877. A series
 of similar experiments had been previously made on December 15 and
 December 16, 1876, which led to the following results, C representing
 the difference of potential of the terminals of Clark's cell at that time : —
                          Zn  |
                                 Cu= 0-5863 C.

                                         0-5877  C. (Mean.)
    Hence, since Zn   |
                        Cu=0-7892 D = 0-8516 volt,
                          C' = 1-343     D= 1-449   volts.

   On March 13 and        15, 1877, Clark's cell was directly   compared with a
Daniell's cell, giving
                                   C"= 1-192 D.
                                       1-178 D.

   In    the course of my experiments     I have had occasion to compare the
difference of potential exhibited by the copper terminals of various voltaic
elements with       the difference of potential of the terminals of a standard
Daniell's cell, in which the amalgamated zinc plate is immersed in a liquid
composed of 1 part by w eight of pure sulphuric acid and 4 parts by
weight of distilled water.        Some of the results have been already men
tioned, and the whole are contained in the Table accompanying this
paper, arranged with the differences of potential        in ascending order of
magnitude.
   In all the cells referred to in this Table the terminals      have been care
fully insulated,     so that in no case has a current circulated in any of the
cells  ;  the difference of potential observed is therefore free, or nearly free,
from the influence of the phenomenon known as the polarization of the
metal plates.
   I   hope shortly, with somewhat improved apparatus, to undertake a
more extended series of measurements of the differences of potential due
to the contact of metals, and metals and liquids, and by using purer
metals to be able to present to the Society results of more value than
those contained in the present paper.

fluence.   It   had hitherto been          asserted that the blood of the right side
of the heart was in a notably            different condition as regards the amount
of sugar it contained from that of the arterial system, an error which                      I
discovered arose from the non-observance of certain precautions in the
mode of obtaining the blood for examination from the respective parts of
the vascular system.   Whilst the arterial blood had been collected during
life, it was customary to collect that from the right side of the heart,
without any special haste, after the destruction of the life of the animal.
During the period thus allowed to elapse between the moment of death
and the collection of the blood, an alteration occurs from the post mortem
production of sugar in the liver, which causes the blood to assume an
extent of saccharine impregnation which does not naturally belong to it
during life, and which had failed to be recognized in its true light.                       I
gave analyses which show that what was       formerly taken as representing
the natural     condition of the blood of the  right side of the heart fur
nished from     •50to -94 per cent., or, as it is more convenient to state
it,5-0 to 9-4 per 1000 of sugar, the blood from the carotid artery of the
same animals, collected during life, having contained what     described as
                                                                     I
a trace of sugar.    Other analyses, three in number, were given, repre
senting the true condition of the blood belonging to the right side of the
heart during life, and the results indicated from -47 to -73 per 1000 as
the amount of sugar.
    Bernard    has recently published        some communications        entitled    " Cri
tiques expérimentales sur      glycemie," in the Comptes Rendus de
                                    la
l'Academie des Sciences de Paris.   His statements are founded upon                     a
method of analysis which    not only strikingly devoid of precision as
                               is                                                       a
quantitative analytical process, but in itself of        a   nature calculated to give
rise to a fallacious result.
   The process adopted by Bernard           as follows —He makes use of

From the suboxide remaining dissolved, and the liquid being thus free

be perceived.     Observation, he says, has shown that the relation of
volume of liquid yielded to weight of         mixture of equal parts of blood

and sulphate of soda     £
                          is ;in other words, that 50 grms. of sulphate of
soda aud of blood give 80 c. c. of trial liquid.        The estimation having

316               Dr. F. W. Pavy on the Physiology of              [June 14,
indicated how much sugar each c. c. of this liquid contains, the data are
afforded for ascertaining the quantity of sugar in the volume corre
 sponding with the weight of blood analyzed, and thence the ratio per
 1000.
    There are two seriously faulty points about the method as a quan
 titative process of analysis.
    The first is the assumption that the volume of the trial liquid cor
responds in c. c. with £ of the weight in grms. of the mixture of sul
phate of soda and blood.       In reality, the actual relation between the
volume of liquid obtained and the weight of the mixture employed must
vary in each individual instance with the proportion of solid matter
existing in the particular specimen of blood, and the loss of liquid by
evaporation from the capsule during the process of coagulation by heat.
It   may be regarded as totally impossible to secure that the coagula
tion of the albuminous and colouring matters can be effected, in an
open capsule at the high temperature necessary, with identically the
same loss by evaporation in each individual instance ; and as the amount
of liquid derivable from the mixture is not large, a slight variation
must alter to a decided extent the result,     especially when it is worked
out into the proportion in 1000 parts.       With 20 grms. of blood as the
quantity submitted to analysis, any error existing in the result yielded
becomes multiplied 50 times when the representation        of ratio per 1000
is made.
    The other point is, that the process involves the influence of organic
matter in preventing the deposition of the suboxide of copper.          It is
not the usual principle of applying the test that is appealed to. In the
ordinary volumetric process of analysis with the copper solution, atten
tion is given to the separation of suboxide till the whole of the copper
has been removed from the liquid.         In Bernard's process a large addi
tion of potash is employed (20 to 25 c. c. of a concentrated solution to
1 c. c. of the copper test), the effect of which is to act upon some one or
other organic principle left in the liquid obtained from the blood, and
prevent a deposit of suboxide occurring.     The presence of the potash does
not by its own action interfere with the fall of suboxide ; for when the
process is carried out upon a simple solution of sugar, the suboxide falls
in the usual way, whilst in the case of the liquid obtained from the
blood, the removal of blue colour takes place without any signs of ap
pearance of precipitate.     Without the addition of the potash the usual
behaviour occurs.
    Actual observation shows that    the results yielded by Bernard's pro
cess are very wide of those given by a process to be presently described,
which is founded upon the precipitation of the suboxide and the subse
quent collection of the copper by means of galvanic action upon a
cylinder of platinum foil, as is now extensively done in the assaying of
copper ores. This application of the copper solution yields a gravimetric
instead of a volumetric process of analysis.     There is nothing in it of a

doubtful nature. The result being given by the balance, there is no un
certainty belonging to             it,
                           as may be the case to   slight extent where the  a
gradual fading  of  colour  has to be watched and     decision formed with       a
regard to the attainment of the precise point.    If the reduction of the
oxide of copper can be safely turned to account for effecting the quanti
tative determination  of sugar (and analysts are agreed that     can),                          it           it   is
by such process that the most trustworthy information      supplied.   The              is
closeness attainable in the results of counterpart analyses shows that                                            it
there    not only susceptible of being carried out with great precision, but
           is
affords strong evidence of its reliability.    Compared with this process,
the results yielded by that of Bernard present the greatest discordancy.
The figures given         by
                     Bernard's method are almost invariably too high, but
there   no uniformity in the difference presented.
           is                                        The variance, indeed,
shows no intelligible relation, and suggests that there    something fun                is
damentally wrong in taking decolorization, without precipitation of the
suboxide, as   means of estimating the amount of sugar.
                   a                                         Subjoined are
the results of the analyses of different specimens of blood in which Ber
nard's process has been compared with my own.         In every case where
my own process of analysis       put into practice submit two samples of

     The gravimetric process of analysis to which                          I       have referred         consists

318                 Dr. F. W. Pavy on the Physiology of                      [June 14,
of three    stages.   The blood is first mixed with the sulphate of            soda and
heated to separate the albuminous and colouring matters ; the liquid is
then separated and the coagulum well washed to remove all the sugar.
Boiling with an excess of the copper solution is next performed, and the
reduced oxide afterwards collected and dissolved by the agency of an
acid.    In   this  solution a cylinder of platinum          foil is immersed, for the
purpose of receiving the copper removed by means of galvanic action.
Weighing the platinum foil before and after the operation gives the
weight of the deposited copper ; and from this may be calculated the
amount of sugar which has effected the reduction of the cupric oxide.
Such is an outline of the process ; but a special description of the mani
pulation is required, as success is dependent upon certain details being
closely followed.       In the application of the process many difficulties at
different stages presented themselves ; but it is satisfactory to be able to
state that they have all been overcome, and there is reason to believe that
no source of fallacy now exists in any part of the operation.
   Forty grms. of sulphate of soda in small crystals are weighed out in a
beaker of about 200 c. c. capacity. About 20 c. c. of the blood intended for
analysis are then poured upon the crystals, and the beaker and its contents
again carefully weighed.          In this way the precise weight of the blood
taken is ascertained. The blood and crystals are well stirred together with
a glass rod, and about 30 c. c. of a hot concentrated solution of sulphate
of soda added.         The beaker is placed over a flame guarded by wire
gauze, and the contents heated till a thoroughly formed coagulum is seen
to be suspended in a clear colourless liquid, to attain which actual boil
ing for    a short time is required.          The liquid has now to be separated
from    the coagulum, and the latter washed, to remove all the sugar.
This is done by first pouring off the liquid through a piece of muslin
resting in a funnel into another beaker of rather larger capacity.                Some
of the hot concentrated solution of sulphate of soda is then poured on
the coagulum, well stirred up with it, and the whole thrown on the piece
of muslin.       By squeezing the liquid is expressed ; aud to secure that no
sUgar   is left behind   the coagulum is returned to the beaker, and the pro
cess of washing and squeezing repeated.
   The liquid thus obtained may be fairly regarded as containing all the
sugar that existed in the blood.           From the coarse kind of filtration and
the squeezing employed,       it is slightly turbid, and requires to be thoroughly
boiled to prepare it for filtration through ordinary filter-paper.               A per
fectly clear liquid freely    runs   through ;      and  to complete this part of the
operation,    the  beaker  in use   and   the  filter-paper   are washed with the con
centrated    solution  of  sulphate    of  soda before referred to.
   The next step is boiling with the potassio-tartrate of copper test solu
tion.    The liquid is again placed over a flame, aud brought to a state of
ebullition.     A sufficient quantity of the copper solution to leave some in

This suffices for all the sugar to    be oxidized, and accordingly     for all the
required action upon the copper solution to occur.             There is no risk
during this time of spontaneous change occurring in the copper solution ;
but observation has shown that should             boiling be continued for a
lengthened period (by which        I mean ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour) the copper solution undergoes alteration, and no longer possesses
the power of resisting spontaneous reduction.           As regards the amount
of copper solution, 10 c. c. of the test of ordinary strength are found to
be more than sufficient for 20 c. c. of the blood of animals in a natural
state.    "Where from any cause an extra quantity of sugar exists, more in
proportion of the test-solution is of course required.
    The precipitated suboxide of copper has now to be separated from the
excess of copper solution.        Experience shows that filtration through
filter-paper cannot be resorted to for the purpose.       In the first place, the
pores of the paper tend to become blocked up and filtration to be stopped ;
and in the next (and this is a fatal objection) the paper absorbs and so
tenaciously holds some of the copper solution that it cannot be effec
tually washed out.      A plug of asbestos, in a filter-funnel, may be used
instead ; but it is not always easy to procure the asbestos with fibres of
the medium state of fineness to answer well for speedy and, at the same
time, delicate filtration.   A  material, however, which has recently been
introduced, viz. glass-wool, exactly furnishes what is wanted.          Properly
packed in the neck of a funnel, it permits filtration to be effectively and
speedily performed ; the state of the filtrate readily shows if the plug
has not been sufficiently closely packed to keep the whole of the precipi
tate back.
    Should the crystallization of the sulphate of soda in this or the pre
ceding filtration interfere with the process of filtration, the funnel may
be lodged upon a beaker containing fluid kept in a state of ebullition.
Through the heat thus applied, the liquid is prevented from assuming
a crystalline  form.
    The suboxide having been collected and washing with distilled water
performed, it is returned to the beaker in which the reduction was effected,
to secure that whatever precipitate may have been adhering to the sides
of the vessel is retained.     The plug is simply pushed with a glass rod
from the funnel inverted over the beaker, and the funnel washed and its
surface cleaned from all adhering precipitate.        "We have now the sub

 the filter-plug and dissolved precipitate, are poured into a funnel con
 taining a loose plug, to obtain the liquid in a separate form.                   The
 requisite washing with distilled water having been performed, there only
 remains the final stage of the process to be conducted.
    The liquid to be now dealt with contains the copper in the form of
 nitrate, which experiment has shown to be the most suitable for yielding
 a pure metallic deposit by galvanic action.               For the purpose of col
 lecting the deposit, a cylinder of platinum foil soldered to a platinum
 wire, for hooking on to the negative pole of the battery, is employed.
 This is immersed in the liquid so as nearly to touch the bottom of the
 vessel, and inserted within it is a spiral coil of platinum wire, made to
form the positive pole of the battery.              In order to secure a good con
 tinuous connexion, the platinum spiral is closely bound to the copper
 eonducting-wire of the batter)', and the other pole is provided with a
 platinum hook, for the suspension of the cylinder.             This precaution has
 been found necessary from the ready manner in which copper exposed
 ends become oxidized and rendered imperfect conductors by the oxygen
 escaping from the liquid underneath.           It may be also mentioned that the
 platinum spiral, after several days' use, presents a brown surface, and
 requires to be occasionally cleaned by immersion in hydrochloric acid.
 In the case of an analysis of blood containing an ordinary amount of
 sugar, and therefore yielding a limited amount of copper to be deposited,
twenty-four hours have        been usually found to thoroughly suffice       for com
 plete removal to occur : but it is necessary that there should be no uncer
tainty upon this point ; and to provide against this the liquid must be
 tested before the operation is regarded as finished.           A small quantity is
 taken from the bottom of the vessel by means of a pipette, and a little
 ammonia added to it in a test-tube.              Should a decided blue colour be
produced     it should   be returned to the vessel      ;  should no blue colour be
perceptible the testing must be carried further. Acetic acid is added in
excess to the contents of the test-tube to supersaturate the ammonia,
and then a small quantity of a solution of yellow prussiate of potash
dropped in. In the absence of copper, nothing but the faint yellow
colour of the test is perceptible ; but with the presence of copper a
brownish hue is produced, and the galvanic action must be carried on
till, on testing, this is no longer brought out.              "When it is thus found
that the whole     of  the   copper   has   been   thrown    down,  the cylinder is
lifted quickly out of the liquid and instantly plunged, first into distilled
water and then into spirit. After drying in a water-oven, it is ready for
weighing, and it need hardly be said that a delicate balance is required
for the purpose. The weight of the cylinder before and after the opera
tion indicates the amount of copper deposited.
    The galvanic action requires to be steadily and continuously main
tained,   and a modification of Fuller's mercury-bichromate              battery has
been found     to be  highly  suitable  for  use.    The  arrangement that lias been

employed in my experiments consists of an outer cell charged with bi
chromate of potash dissolved to saturation in dilute sulphuric acid.  In
this two carbon plates are immersed.    The inner porous cell contains a
little mercury at the bottom, but is otherwise filled up with water. An
amalgamated zinc rod is inserted, and dips down into the layer of mer
cury.   This battery, it is found, gives a steady current, and, used every
day, will remain in good working order for at least a fortnight, all that
is necessary being to pour out the liquid in the porous cell when it has
become green from reduction of the diffused bichromate solution and
replace it with water.     Attention is of course necessary to secure that
the proper battery-power exists to effect the deposition of the copper ;
and when the current becomes weak the zinc rod must be cleaned and the
bichromate of potash solution replenished.
   The relation existing between sugar oxidized and cupric oxide of the
copper test solution reduced      is,
                                that one atom of the former reduces five
atoms of the latter.    This  the foundation upon which the action of the
                             is
test   based, and the calculation made in estimating
       is                                                   by

amount of sugar present.    Taking  63-4 as the atomic  weight of copper,
and 180 as that of glucose (C8Hu0„), 317 parts of copper will stand
equivalent to 180 parts of glucose.  Thus one part of copper corresponds
to -5678 of glucose and in calculating the amount of sugar in the blood
                   ;
analyzed, the weight of the copper deposited has only to be multiplied         by
•5678 to give its equivalent in glucose.   The quantity of sugar in the
amount of blood taken for analysis being thus determined, the data are
furnished   by
             which the proportion per 1000 parts may be ascertained.
I    have entered thus minutely into the description of the gravimetric
process of estimating sugar, as   feel that

reference to the physiological relations of sugar in the animal system.

VI.      "Correction of Statement in the ' Note on the Electromotive
         Properties of Muscle/ read December 14, 1876."                 In a Letter
         to Prof. Huxley, by Dr. Burdon Sandekson, F.R.S.                         Re
         ceived June 14, 1877.
    Deak Sir, — In a short Xote which           I   communicated to the Royal
                             I
Society in December last gave an account of certain observations relating
to the electromotive phenomena of the uninjured gastrocnemius muscle
of the frog.      In commenting on these results        I was led,  I need   not say
unintentionally, to make a serious misstatement of the doctrine taught
by Prof, du Bois-Reymond with reference to these phenomena.                     After
comparing      the  electromotive   properties   of  the  muscle-cylinder     derived
from the gastrocnemius with those of the typical muscle-cylinder, as set
forth in the " Law of the Muscle-current,"          I stated that the phenomena,
as they actually present themselves, had not been correctly described.              It
is this statement that     I desire to correct.
                                                      "
    Shortly after the publication of my " Note the magnificent collection
of scientific papers* in which Prof, du Bois-Reymond has -brought
together his electrophysiological researches appeared.            The work had not

long been in my possession before became much more strongly impressed
than     I had been before with the extent and completeness of the investi
gations to which he has devoted the last thirty-five years. My attention
was particularly directed to the paper, No. XVII. of the series, " Ueber
das Gesetz des Muskelstroines         mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung des M.
Gastrocnemius vom Frosch." In this very important research, with which,
although it was originally published in 1863,         I  was, I  regret to say, only
acquainted at second hand, Du Bois-Reymond not only recognized the
electromotive anomalies of the gastrocnemius, but explained them in the
most elaborate manner as dependent on its peculiarities of structure.
     I at once   became aware of the mistake      I had made,   and recognized the
 necessity of correcting it ;    but determined to defer doing so until         I was
 in a position io communicate further observations on the collateral ques
 tion with which     I was more particularly concerned.         As, however, Prof,
 du Bois-Reymonrl,      in a letter just received, has expressed his wish that
 the misrepresentation of his views, for which         I have so unwillingly made
 myself responsible,     should  be  corrected  as  soon  as possible,  I  write you
 this letter in the hopj that the Society may allow it to be printed in the
 '
   Proceedings.'     Toil will see that my communication relates, not to the
 facts recorded, but exclusively to the views expressed as to their supposed
                            " Law."

    In    anticipation of a detailed account of our researches in voltaic elec
tricity, which have engaged our attention for nearly three years, we ven
ture to publish, as of interest to the electrician, an account of the results
obtained with two spherical surfaces of 3 inches radius and 1•5 inch
diameter.         It will be soon that they differ materially from those which
occur from the employment of a point for one terminal and a flat disk for
 the other, with which           the striking-distance is in the ratio of the square

      It  is evident that, for small distances between the terminals, a higher
  difference of potential is necessary to cause the spark to jump than
  when they are at greater distance.             This agrees with (Sir William Thom

pole. At certain pressures there is only one stratum, then, as the pres
sure is diminished, two, three, and so on, each being added on from the

overestimated.  These anatomical relationships have had great attention
bestowed upon them by continental histologists, and more especially
those of the German school. Amongst the more important subjects in
which their acumen has served to enlighten us we may take, as an illus
tration, the demonstration of the intimate connexion existing between
the lymph-sacs and perivascular channels of the brain, and the success
ful injection of the former by Obersteiner*. Although several years
have elapsed since the publication of Obersteiner's views, the accuracy
of his statements       has not received
                                     that appreciation and acknowledg
ment by English observers which the importance of the subject impera
tively demands, nor does it appear that a critical examination of these
" pericellular        "
                         has been instituted with the object of finally
               spaces
setting the question at rest.
   In his work on this subject Obersteiner's views are expressed so
clearly, and the illustrations are So definite, that little doubt as to their
accuracy can,    I
                 think, remain on the mind of the unprejudiced reader.

by them, and, finally, to the error committed by others of referring them
to an entirely different source to that which Obersteiner claims for them.

             Existence of Pericellular Lymph-sacs in             the   Brain.
   My attention was first attracted to the significance of these
                                                               spaces by
(a) the prevalence,  in  certain morbid   conditions, of numerous   nuclei
arranged in definite directions around the nerve-cells, (6) the presence
of undoubted lymph-corpuscles     in clear spaces around the cell, and (c)
the appearance of pericellular spaces in healthy brain occasionally where
the cells appeared perfectly normal and certainly not atrophic.
   The arrangement of nuclei, above alluded to, is at times most striking,
and is especially well seen in the larger nerve-cells of the third layer and
the still larger cells found at a lower level in the ascending frontal and
ascending parietal convolutions of man, which have been termed giant
cells.  These cells are undoubtedly normal constituents of the cortical
layers, and to a great extent constant elements in theso regions.                                    I
have represented one of these great nerve-cells in Plate 2. fig. 4.  To

appreciate the significance of this arrangement of nuclei around these
cells it will be necessary shortly to consider the actual cell-elements
which enter into the formation of the non-nervous portion of the
neuroglia.   These elements are usually stated to consist of free nuclei
and distinct nucleated cells. The nuclei of the latter are said by Meynert,*
to have a diameter of 9—10/* ( = -009 to -010 millim.), a measurement
which coincides with my own.                 I
                                   find these last-mentioned cells possess
an extremely delicate protoplasm, so readily affected by reagents that it
is easily altered iu appearance or entirely masked from view.       Within
these cells two nuclei are frequently seen. These cells, in certain morbid
conditions,proliferate freely, and throw out delicate and anastomosing
branches in all directions, assuming the form of " Deiter's cells." They
are undoubtedly      connective elements, and by this morbid proliferation
they produce      a true  sclerosis of the cortex ; such a condition is deli
neated in Plate '2. fig. 5. This morbid growth of the nucleated cell in the
neuroglia is alluded to by Meynert as bearing a relationship to arrest in
the discharge of the perivascular lymph, as would occur in hyperaemia
and also in degeneration of the lymphatic glands of the head and neck.
I have myself frequently observed these changes in tuberculosis and
senile atrophy of the brain. It must be borne in mind that such a growth
must still further impede the current in the perivascular channels by the
intertwining of their numerous branches around the walls of the delicate
capillaries of the cortex.
  It is important that a distinction                      be drawn clearly between these cells
and the other nuclear elements referred                        to.   These, the so-called free
nuclei, are not in reality free nuclei ; for when examined carefully in the
fresh state they are found to have a slight delicate investment of proto
plasm, which becomes quite destroyed by subsequent methods of pre
paration.    These nucleus-like    bodies resemble, as regards size, form,
structure, and reaction   to staining and chemical reagents, those which
are found    universally scattered through     the brain, and which most
observers,    I
              believe, accept as representatives of the connective-tissue
series.    Now these elements appear to me to be disposed in three
definite   situations    :   — a, irregularly in the neuroglia framework                 ;   b,   re
gularly around          the    nerve-cells       ;   c,    following directly     the course      of
capillaries.
   In the two last positions they are connected with the lymph-walls
surrounding tho blood-vessels and nerve-cells, and am disposed to re    I
gard them as endothelial elements lining these channels.     The spindle-
cell of the deepest cortical layer in the frontal region appears to be
especially prone to the growth of these attendant satellites, which accu
mulate occasionally iu such numbers as to form superincumbent heaps,
almost concealing the nerve-cell from view.
   Frequently the capillary is so faintly stained that we can trace its

course alone by the line of nuclei running parallel to its wall, and within
which the elongated nucleus proper to the vascular coat becomes now
and again apparent.
    Identical as these nuclear bodies are in appearance their site pro
bably betokens far different functional endowments appertaining             to
each, the extravascular     being truly connective, whilst those lining the
lymphatic    channels   develop into lymph-corpuscles, and correspond, in
fact, to lymphatic endothelia.     These connective and endothelial elements
having a separate and wholly distinct destiny, also differ inter se in re
lative number and distribution, the connective elements being, in con
ditions of health, a constant element, the endothelial subject to diverse
physiological influences, by which their appearance and proportions may
be greatly modified.      The recognition of these connective and endothelial
elements, and the varying conditions imposed upon them by their distinct
functional endowments, is of essential importance when we are dealing
with the morbid brain.
     Further examination sufficed to prove that this arrangement of nuclei
 regularly around the nerve-cell in the human subject, in which epilepsy
 and other morbid affections were present before death, was a condition
 frequently    met with in the lower animals as apparently a perfectly
 normal state, and the brain of the healthy cat afforded peculiarly favour
 able opportunities   for studying their distribution and significance.
     Here it was most satisfactorily demonstrated to my mind that the
 pericellular nuclei were arranged along the boundary of a perfectly clear
 space.     This space completely enclosed the nerve-cell and gradually
 tapered off and disappeared towards the apex process of the pyramids.
 The remaining processes (lateral and basal) of the nerve-cell cross the
 intermediate space, passing through the boundary wall of the enclosing
 sac, the cell being in reality suspended by its branches within this peri
 cellular cavity.   The appearance of these spaces will be greatly modified
  by the method of preparation adopted, the thinness of the section, and
  various physiological and pathological conditions existing before death.
     On reference to the sketch (Plate 1. fig. 1) which represents the ascend
  ing frontal convolution in a young cat, the section being taken from the
  gyrus immediately in front of the crucial sulcus, we find four nerve-cells
  surrounded by these clear spaces which, in this case, are widely distended.
  One of these pericellular sacs also exhibits the arrangement of nuclear
  elements above alluded to. In most cases the outline of the cell is closely
  followed by the enclosing sac, and from this cause the form of the peri
  cellular sac is subject to great diversity of contour.
      Eecent examination of the cerebral cortex in sections cut on the freez
  ing microtome has assured me that the nerve-eells of the middle layers
  of the cortex are subject to no definite ride as regards I heir form.    The
  pyramidal form was too exclusively supposed by Meynert to be due to the
  action of hardening agents, and he certainly erred in assuming the

  330                      Mr. B. Lewis       on the Lymphatic               [June 21,
  spindle form to be the natural and most prevalent.                The fact seems to
  be that the forms are tco protean for any such exclusive statement to be
  scientifically accurate.       The fusiform cell is frequently seen in the third
  layer, the pyramidal is also frequent in fresh specimens, others are pyri-
 form,     ovate, globose, or even so indefinite           as   to warrant    the term
  amcebiform.
     It will thus be apparent that the lymph-space surrounding the cell
  must differ greatly in its contour.          In some cases the lymph-sac is not
 apparent, although its endothelial elements may indicate its existence ;
  this, in all cases,    I believe, is due to the mode of preparation, or to patho
 logical changes (probably, also, certain          physiological   conditions) not yet
 satisfactorily investigated.            Within these    spaces    wo can frequently
  detect the corpuscular elements of the lymphatic system, whilst a
 faintly granular plasma remains as the representative of the coagu
 lated lymph.         The boundary wall of these spaces varies much in appear
 ance, according to the character           assumed by the surrounding matrix of
 neuroglia.      The more finely granular the appearance of the neuroglia
 the less perfectly can the wall of the pericellular space be differentiated
 from its environment, the minutest fibrils of connective and nerve inter
 mingled in the finely granular basis approaching to the clearly defined
 margin of the space, and no distinct limiting membrano being observable.
 In all   probability these spaces are lined merely with a delicate eudothelial
 investment.        In cases where great shrinking of structure has occurred
 by   the  use  of   strong solutions of chromic acid and subsequent methods
 of preparation,       I  have observed much distortion occur, whereby the cell
 is laterally displaced, or even partially withdrawn from its enclosing sac.
 The next stage in my observations was arrived at by the discovery that
a minute blood-vessel invariably ran in close contact with all the large
 nerve-cells.      In   some cases the elongated      nuclei of the capillary might
not have been sufficiently           stained and the outline    of the vessel not dis
tinct, yet the line of perivascular            eudothelial   elements would     unmis
takably indicate its course, except where the vessel had been cut across,
 when the open lumen surrounded by its perivascular sheath, often with
 one or more nuclei attached, still indicated the close proximity of the
vessel to a nerve-cell.
    In   all cases   I  have never failed to recognize, on careful examination,
a small capillary either passing immediately across the nerve-cell or
running with a gentle curve along the confines of the pericellular space.
The invariable        occurrence of this arrangement naturally struck my at
tention      as a highly      significant fact, and more extensive observations
proved it to be the universal arrangement throughout the cortex cerebri.
In many instances a distinct connexion between perivascular and peri
cellular space could be clearly observed, although from obvious reasons
the majority of specimens exhibited this connexion only after the most
careful and strict scrutiny, or afforded, on the other hand, no definite
indications     of its existence.

     The fact, however, of a direct communication        existing    between these
  spaces  is established when seen       clearly and unmistakably in a single
  instance.    In  the accompanying sketch (Plate 1. fig. 1) such a connexion
  is well shown, and      I can fully vouch for the accuracy of the minutest
 details here portrayed.
     With regard to the mode of connexion it must be remembered that tho
 pericellular sacs are laterally disposed along the sides of the smaller
 capillaries, and in no case occupy a terminal position ; hence the nerve-
 cell is bathed in a constantly renewed current of lymph on all its sides.
 Does this distribution in any way indicate the mode of development of
 the nerve-cell   ?   With tho object of answering this query           I examined
 several brains of foetal and adult animals      ; and although    I  cannot speak
 conclusively on the point,     it will be apparent, by reference to figs. 2, 3,
 that the characters represented in such sections strongly confirmed the
 views adopted above, and indicate likewise a development of nerve-cells
 from within      the perivascular sheath projecting from its walls in egg-
 shaped ainpulloe.     The nerve-cells are seen in these specimens to follow
 definitely the course of the blood-vessels, and often surround the latter
 in crowds, and assume with the direction of the vessel a linear or arched
 course.    In the cortex of the new-born kitten the appearances indicated
 in fig. 2 were seen. The perivascular sheaths were unusually defined,
and could     be traced along the most minute capillaries.        The nerve-cells
were arranged in one or two series along the course of the capillary, and
are clearly separated by a space from the neuroglia in its vicinity.          The
cells and their limiting sacs are somewhat pyriform, and appear to arisa
by narrowed stalk-like processes. The pyriform appearance is still
better marked in a section from the ascending frontal convolution of a
young dog (fig. 3), which shows two large pyriform cells, distinctly nu
cleated and within their enclosing sheath. At this period it will be
observed that the nerve-cells have not thrown out their processes, and
the development can be traced raorely from a globular cell or nucleus to
a distinctly nucleated pyriform cell. Such appearances would seem to indi
cate that the nerve-cells of the cerebral cortex are lymphatic outgrowths         ;
but whether this be so, or whether amoeboid vagrants from the blood-
current be the source of these centres of nervous activity, must remain
for a time sub judice. One important fact it is well to bear in mind ;
the existence of these pericellular sacs enables us to infer a more direct
organic connexion between vessel and nerve-cell than we were capable of
assuming before.        Further research alone will enable us to establish the
existence of that mutual sympathy between nerve-cell and vascular con
tents in     healthy and diseased action which is dependent upon their
development from similar and identical elements.
    Important considerations must be draw-n if this view of the anatomical
relationship of nerve-ceils to a lymphatic system be generally accepted.
There are observers who have attributod these spaces, when seen in

senile atrophy, to mere shrinking of the cell from degenerative changes,
and the production thereby of an artificial fissure or chasm around the
cell.     The broader views now advanced will enable such observers                to
expect similar appearances from very diverse causes.
    The unusual distinctness with which these lymph-sacs sometimes pre
sent themselves may,        I am convinced, be occasioned by hardening agents,
such as chromic acid and its salts ; but         I   feel equally well assured that
similar     appearances may result from an unusually distended lymph-
system. We may therefore expect to find them well shown where obstruc
tive agencies interfere with the outflow of the lymph-stream towards the
pia mater.        The large size and defined contour of these lymph-sacs in
senile atrophy of the brain may undoubtedly be due to shrinking of the
enclosed degenerating protoplasm of the cell ; yet the important point
is to recognize these spaces as natural structures in an unnaturally dis
tended condition, for their large size appears to me due not only to
wasting and recession of the enclosed cell, but to a large accumulation
of lymph, the lymphatic channels, both pericellular and perivascular,
being in a distended condition throughout.
   Sections from the frontal lobe of a young and perfectly healthy cat ex
hibited these pericellular spaces with remarkable distinctness (vide Plate 1.
fig. 1 ).    In this instance the distension of the lymph-sac was probably
accompanied by a general plethora of the whole lymph-system of the
brain, as the appearance of the nerve-cell would scarcely warrant the
supposition of the appearance being entirely due to the shrinking of the
cell consequent upon chrome hardening. The morbid conditions interfering
with the perivascular lymph-current of the brain are numerous. Ilvper-
aemia acts in this way and greatly modifies the nutritive and depurative
changes proceeding in the pericellular sacs.              Deposits within the peri
vascular sheaths, aneurismal dilatations along the vessels, tubercular out
growths from their walls, proliferating connective elements, may all in
their turn affect very materially         the free exit of lymph from the peri
vascular channels, which is a sine qud no* for the maintenance of the
functional activity of nerve-cells.
  The proliferation of the connective elements of the neuroglia is represented
in Plate    2. figs. 5 and 6, the lat ter being a fresh-teased preparation, while
the former is from      a section obtained by means of the freezing microtome.
The truly protean       forms  assumed by these connective elements are well
seen in such specimens, the nucleated corpuscle becoming swollen, cloudy,
and often coarsely granular ; at other times it maintains through all its
changes of form the pellucid delicate appearance of its protoplasm.

(Sept. 1876), whereby the cells and cortical structure generally could be
well displayed.         The great fault attached to this process is that relation
 ships were wholly sacrificed for clearer definition of structure and differ
entiation of elements.           Having endeavoured, without success, to obtain
satisfactory results by the ordinary freezing methods with ice and salt,
I eventually       devised an instrument whereby freezing with ether spray
was introduced, and all the conditions requisite for cutting the finest
sections of fresh brain were obtained.             This instrument was made for me
by Mr. Baker of High Holborn, and is described by me in the ' Journal

greatest value in the investigation of nervous structures.

the slightest possible staining of the nerve-cells produced by a drop of
carmine, or a '25 per cent, solution of aniline black, just sufficing, in fact,
to give us the outline of the cells, nuclei, nucleoli, and their environment,
we are able to detect,        in most     cases,  indications   of spaces surrounding
the cell ; and especially is this the case in conditions which induce a shrink
ing of the cell-protoplasm, or, on the other hand, of the surrounding
neuroglia.
   The examination of these films of fresh cortex by chemical reagents,
their examination after staining by aniline and mounting in balsam, the
process of teasing above alluded to, as well as chrome hardening for sec
tions, have been the methods employed in this investigation.

         M.A., Professor of Physics in the Royal Naval College,
         Greenwich, and A. W. Rucker, M.A., Professor of Physics
         in the Yorkshire College of Science, Leeds. Communicated
         by R. B. Clifton, F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Phi
         losophy in the University of Oxford. Received June 13, 187/.
    Attempts have from time to time been made by various physicists to
obtain from the phenomena of capillarity, or from observations on liquid
films, an indication of the magnitude of the radius of molecular attrac
tion.       The authors of this note have, with the same object in view,
lately made a series of experiments to determine whether the law that
the resistance offered to the electric current by a uniformly thick homo-                     ¦
genous body varies inversely as the section is or is not apparently
obeyed by liquid films, as any apparent departure from that law might
bo taken to indicate a want of homogeneity, or that the thickness of the
film was comparable with the magnitude of the radius of molecular
 attraction.
    Their investigations on this point are not as yet sufficiently advanced for
 publication ; but in the course of their work they have made some obser
 vations on the forms of soap films, which they venture to lay before the
 Royal Society in a preliminary note.
    A liquid       film, inclined to the horizontal         so as to become        gradually
 thinner      by the slow descent          of the liquid, will, under favourable con
 ditions, appear black, as in the central portion of Newton's rings.                       By
 optical methods it is only possible to obtain a superior limit to the thick
 ness of the black portion of such a film ; but there is no doubt that at
 the lower boundary of the black the thickness of the film increases with
 extraordinary         rapidity.
     As    a general rule no trace        of the blue of the first order can be per
 ceived ;    but    when      the colour next below the black is the white of the first
 order, the line of separation between the two is very definite; and if the
 film be moved so as to change the angle of incidence of the light by

    which   it is viewed, the position of the boundary of the black remains
    fixed, though that of each of the other colours is altered with every
    motion.       More frequently, however, the presence of the colours of the
    first order, and some or all of those of the second order, can only be de
    tected by means of a microscope,^ and to the naked eye several tints
    appear to be wanting between the black and the colour which immediately
    succeeds     it.
       The constant recurrence of the phenomenon above mentioned, viz. the
    very rapid change in the thickness of the film in the immediate neigh
    bourhood of the black, suggests an intimate connexion between the
    thickness of the latter and the molecular constitution of the liquid. Any
   investigation as to whether such a connexion exists must, it appears, be
   commenced by seeking the answers to the following questions : —
       1. Do very rapid changes in thickness occur elsewhere in the films ?
       2. Is the black portion of the film uniform in thickness          ?
       3. If  so, is the thickness the same for all films formed with the same
   liquid?
       The authors      have,  with  a single  liquid and with the form of apparatus
   employed, obtained results which, although not sufficiently numerous to
   enable them to give general answers to these inquiries, display, as they
   believe, a hitherto unsuspected constancy in the phenomena exhibited by
   liquid films thinning under the influence of gravity, and seem to merit
   further study.
       The method employed was to measure simultaneously the electrical
.  resistance of the films, and the breadths of the bands of colour they
   displayed.
       The liquid used was       M. Plateau's " liquide glycerique,"     made    by dis
  solving     1    part by weight of oleate of soda in 40 parts of water, and
  adding 3 volumes of this liquid to 2'2 volumes of Price's glycerine.               To
  improve       the   conductivity,  3  parts by weight   of   potassium   nitrate were
   dissolved in every 100 parts of water along with the oleate of soda.
       The films which were submitted to investigation were cylindrical in
  shape, and were formed between two platinum rings of the same diameter
  placed one vertically over the other.           The mode of supporting these and
  making the electrical connexions was as follows : — A glass cylindrical
  vessel, about 16 centims.high and 9 centims. in diameter, was fitted with
  an ebonite cover divided into two unequal parts.              Each of these would, if
  placed    on    the  top of  the  vessel,  remain   in situ.    A brass tube, which
  could be elevated or depressed, and was retained in its position by friction,
  passed through the larger portion of the cover, and was, when in position,
  in the centre of the glass vessel.         A piece of india-rubber tubing provided
  with a pinchcock was attached to the upper end of this tube, and to
   the bottom of it was soldered a brass plate carrying the upper platinum
  cylinder.        This latter was formed of stout platinum foil, the edges of
   which were welded together in order to avoid the introduction of any

foreign metal which might give rise to local galvanic action when the
current passed through the film.      At the bottom of the glass vessel was
a small porcelain dish containing mercury, in which was placed a platinum
crucible, the lower part of which was amalgamated to ensure good con
 tact with the mercury.     The diameter of the mouth of the crucible was
 as nearly as possible the same    as that of the platinum cylinder above
 mentioned.      To obviate the possibility of the film thinning by eva
 poration from its surface, a little of the liquid used was placed in the
 bottom of the glass vessel, and the platinum crucible was also filled with
 the liquid to within about 1 millim. of its upper edge.     The cylindrical
 films were produced in the following manner.     A plane film was formed
 on the platinum cylinder, which, when the cover was replaced on the
 vessel, was blown out into a bubble through the india-rubber tubing. This
 bubble, when large enough, adhered to the edge of the platinum crucible,
 and both the quantity of air within it and the position of the crucible
 were then so regulated as to make it as accurately cylindrical as possible.
 The edge of the platinum cylinder was levelled by altering the position
 of the whole apparatus until all points on its edge were, as was
determined by the help of a cathetometer, in the same horizontal plane.
 With this arrangement it was easy to measure the resistance of the
 film.    A  binding-screw   on the smaller portion of the ebonite cover
 was connected by a platinum wire with the mercury on which the
 platinum crucible rested, while another binding-screw on the brass tube
formed the point of connexion with the upper electrode.      The resistance
 was measured by means of a Wheatstone's Bridge (of the Post-Office
 pattern), and as it continually changed, and nearly always slowly but
 steadily increased, the known resistance was made up to a certain
 amount,    and the moment when the unknown resistance reached that
amount noted.
    As the resistances to be measured were very large, a box of resistance-
coils was introduced into one arm of the bridge containing ten resistance-
coils of about 100,000 ohms each.       The actual resistance available for
purposes of measurement was thus rather greater than 1,000,000 ohms,
and by the multiplying power of the instrument resistances up to 100
times this amount could be measured.        The galvanometer used was a
reflecting instrument of 5000 ohms resistance. In the arm of the balance
which contained the film-resistance a commutator was placed, and every
time the key was depressed the direction of the current was changed. By
this means error due to polarization was reduced to a minimum.          The
battery consisted of three Grove's cells.
    The electrical observations were  made  in  a room   adjoining that in
which the film under experiment was placed, and at the same time a
second observer measured with a cathetometer the breadths of the bands
of colour exhibited by the film.     This operation was repeated at least
twice, and the time of each observation was noted, so that the rate of

descent of the line of separation between each pair of colours could be
determined and its position calculated at the moment when any particular
electrical observation was made.
     In this calculation the velocity of the motion of each colour was sup
posed to be uniform between successive observations.                    This supposition
was to a certain extent justified by the fact that when several measure
 ments were taken, the calculated velocities for consecutive intervals of
 time differed but little for the thinner parts of the films.                In the thicker
 parts a greater irregularity was observed, but the exact determination of
 the position of the boundary between two colours was also of less im
 portance.      In making these observations a screen was placed behind the
 film, and the telescope of the cathetometer was directed to a portion of
the film illuminated by means of a mirror so placed that the direction of
the incident light was perpendicular to the optic axis of the telescope.
The film was thus viewed by light incident at 45°, and the refractive
index of the liquid being known the thickness corresponding to any
 colour may be deduced by means of the table of Newton's rings given in
Watts's ' Dictionary of Chemistry.'
     The refractive index was found to be 1-395 for mean yellow rays.
 It was determined, not from the liquid used, which was made a week
 before the experiments began, but from another freshly made solution of
precisely the same composition.                This course was rendered necessary
by the fact that such solutions rapidly become turbid, owing to the forma
tion of a precipitate which cannot be sufficiently removed to enable the
liquid to be used for such a purpose.

lated), the ratios       of the numbers given in Column X. would not be
altered ; the only change would be in the scale on which the thickness is
represented.        The topmost and lowest points of the curves refer to the
parts of the lilms in contact with the upper and lower cylinders, and the
thicknesses at these and all intermediate points are represented by the
horizontal      distances between the points on the curves and the. vertical
lines drawn near them. For the reasons given above, lines representing
 the thicknesses of the cylinders are magnified 5000 times more than those
 representing their lengths.
     r'igs. I. to V. (p. 340) represent the successive forms assumed by a film
at the hours named on them. They serve to illustrate the phenomena gene
rally observed — namely, that after the formation of the black the colours of
 the portion of the film in contact with it change so as to indicate an in
 crease in thickness, and are, as it were, absorbed by those immediately
 below them, although in no case does any portion of the film become thicker
 than any other part situated at a lower level than itself.        At the same
 time, however, the lower part of the film continues to become thinner,
 so that at last the whole assumes one uniform tint, which changes
 but slowly, and sometimes in such a way as to show that the whole film
 is become thicker.       This phenomenon is probably caused by absorption of
 moisture from the air, though the thickening of the upper part of the film
 above referred to may be due, at all events in part, to the fact that the
 formation of the black part of the film must necessitate the comparatively
 rapid removal of the superfluous liquid from that portion in immediate
 contact with it.
     Tig. VI. represents a film in which the lower boundary of the black
 was, at the time of the observation, rising instead of descending.
     The last four figures represent films which were not sufficiently thin
 to exhibit the black ; the upper part of that shown in fig. X. was, at the
 time of the observation, becoming thicker.
     An inspection of these figures is sufficient to prove that, as a general
 rule, the films did not increase uniformly in thickness from top to bottom,
  but that regions of comparatively rapid and slow increase of thickness
  alternated. The inclination of the outside layer of the film to the vertical
  seems often suddenly to become       much greater at or about a thickness
 corresponding to 20 small divisions on the curve-paper or to the yellow
 of the second order, as seen through the telescope of the cathetometer,
 but none of the changes in thickness are so rapid as that which takes
 place at the lower edge of the black.       One of the films observed (not one
 of those drawn) displayed a ring of black 7'82 millims. in breadth, while
 the rest of the film appeared to be a uniform green of the third order.
  If we suppose the upper part of the film to be as thick as is possible
  consistently with its appearing black when seen by light at normal inci
  dence, the film must in this case have been increased to fourteen times

that thickness so suddenly that the colours between the black and                  :
of the third order were quite invisible.
    The forms of the coloured portions of the films having been thus deter
mined, the authors were now able to calculate their resistances.                     The
resistance of a ring of the cylinder of length I, radius r, and of uniform
thickness    r, might be taken to            be   =       , where p  is the specific re-
sistance of the liquid, which was determined to be 222 ohms at the
temperature at which the experiments were conducted.
    The radii, both of the platinum ring and crucible, were determined by
means    of the cathetometer. Both were found to be very nearly circular
and their mean diameters were 33-26 millitns. and 33-77 millims.
respectively.       The mean of these numbers, or 33-51 millims., was
taken to be the value of 2r.             Since the thickness of each little ring was
 not uniform, the value taken for r was the mean value of the thicknesses
 of its upper and lower       edges.       It can  easily be shown that the resistances
 so calculated would be a         little less than the true resistance, and     a correc
 tion factor   was   introduced,      the value of which is

 where r, and ra are the numbers above referred to as those the mean of
 which was taken to be the thickness of the film.                     The value of this
 factor, which depends only on the ratio of r, to ra, was calculated for several
 values of that ratio, and the numbers required were obtained by interpola
 tion.   The values of     1

 XI.   of Table I., and Column           XII.    contains the values of the correction
 factor.
     Hence,   introducing the corrections for the oblique incidence of the
 light and for the refractive index, the resistance of the cylinder was
 given by the expression

 The resistance so calculated was subtracted from the total observed
  resistance of the film, and the number thus obtained was assumed to
 give the resistance of the black portion.

    Column   VI.   is obtained by subtracting the numbers in V. from the
corresponding numbers in IV. and dividing by the corresponding numbers
in II., and thus gives in megohms the resistance of a ring of the black
portion of the film 1 millim. in breadth.
   The numbers in Column II. are bracketed when they were obtained by
means of the same two series of measurements with the cathetometer, and
are thus dependent on the same observations.             Numbers not bracketed
were obtained by totally independent optical and electrical measurements.
    It will be seen from this Table that five different films were studied
upon five different days ; and that, in all, 36 determinations of the resist
ance of the black portions of the films were made.
    The highest and the lowest values obtained from individual experiments
differ from one another by about 1 1 per cent, of the mean value ; but the
means of the results of each day's observations display a closer agreement.
Thus the    mean    of the values obtained from
            Cylinder    I.  is 1-782, deduced from 19 observations.

    The maximum discrepancy is about 5 per cent, of the mean             between
the greatest and least values.
    The figures, however, give interesting results when grouped in dif
 ferent ways.      Thus, taking the means of the values obtained when the
 lengths of the black part of the film lay between certain limits,        it was
found that when the black part was
              > 0 and <         2 millims., the mean value was 1-761,

    Again, grouping the results according to the thickness of the coloured
 portion of the film which appeared to be in immediate contact with the
 black, it was found that when the colour of that portion, as viewed through
 the telescope,   was the
            blue of the second order, the mean value was 1-826,

    The first of these numbers is considerably larger than the others, as it
 is almost entirely deduced from the high values obtained during the early
 experiments on the first cylinder.          These experiments are, however,
 deprived     of the significance they might otherwise have seemed to possess
 by the fact that the only other observations taken with the blue of the
 second order in contact with the black gave for the resistance of the
 latter the normal value 1-760, while, on the other hand, high values were
 on one or two exceptional occasions obtained when the part of the film
 next the black was sufficiently      thick to show the orange of the second
 order.
    It is not easy to decide whether the different values obtained at various
 times correspond to real differences in the thicknesses of the black por
 tions of the films or are due to errors of experiment.
    The resistances measured were, as has been seen, very high ; but ex
 periments made for the purpose proved that the galvanometer was always
 sensitive to at least 1 per cent, of the total resistance measured.       The
 most probable cause of error is the fact that the lower edge of the black
 does not always lie in a horizontal plane.       Thus on one occasion one end
 of the boundary between the black and the coloured part of the film was
 observed to sink no less than 0-5 millim. in a few seconds.     In one or two
 cases where this fact was noted, the number given for the length of the
 black is a mean of readings taken in different parts ; but it was difficult
 to determine whether the edge furthest from the observer was or was
not below that nearest to him. This source of error would, of course, be
 of greater importance as the breadth of the black portion of the film
 diminished ; but the magnitude of these deviations from horizontality
appeared to become greater as that breadth increased.
    Without, however, making any allowances for these causes of error, the
experiments certainly show, for the particular liquid and apparatus used, —
    i. That the variations in thickness     of the black portion of the films
          were but a small fraction of that thickness.
    ii. That the thickness is independent of the breadth of the black ring.
    iii. That it is also independent of the thickness of that portion of the
           film which appears to the naked eye to be in immediate contact with
          it.
    The last question on which the authors propose to touch is that of the
absolute thickness of the black portion of the films ; and though their ex
periments only enable them to calculate that thickness on the assumption
that Ohm's law holds good, the result may be interesting.
    The mean of all their experiments gives for the resistance of a ring of
the black film 1 millim. broad, 1,750,000 ohms ; whence, since the diameter
of the cylinder is 33-51 millims., it is easy to calculate that, if Ohm's law
holds, the thickness of the film must be 12 millionths of a millimetre, or
about one third of the thickness corresponding to the beginning of the
black for the liquid submitted to experiment.

IV. "The       Physiology of Sugar in relation to the Blood— No.           2."
       By F.    W. Pavy, M.D., F.R.S. Received June 21, 1877.
   In    my communication read at the last Meeting of the Society            I
described a gravimetric process of analysis adapted for the quantitative
determination of sugar in blood and such like organic products.           This
process, after a little practice, is easy of application, and with proper
care in manipulation admits of great accuracy being attained.       I purpose,
in this communication, giving results obtained by its means, showing —
    (1) The amount of sugar existing naturally in the blood ;
    (2) The comparative states of arterial and venous blood ;
    (3) The spontaneous change ensuing after the removal of blood from
the system.
    From the rapid and marked manner in which the amount of sugar in
the blood becomes influenced by altered states of the system, it is neces
sary that certain precautions should be strictly observed in order to obtain
a representation of the natural condition.      From what   I  have said upon
 former occasions it will be evident that if the blood is collected for
examination during life, the animal must be at the time in a perfectly
natural or tranquil state, and, if after death, the opportunity must not be
 given for the post mortem change occurring in the liver to exert its influ
 ence upon the contents of the circulatory system.
    Subjoined are given three series of results illustrative of the amount
 of sugar existing naturally in the blood of the dog, sheep, and bullock.
 In two of the series six and in the other seven observations are supplied,
 and  it is hardly necessary to remark that they represent observations taken
just   as they happened to present themselves.      In every observation two
 separate analyses of the sample of blood were made.      The results obtained
in each are stated, and the mean taken as representing the amount of
 sugar present.
    The blood from the dog (in Observations 1 to 6) was obtained by pithing
 the animal and instantly inserting a scalpel into the chest and freely
incising the heart and large     vessels. The chest was then quickly opened
 and the blood dipped out and treated for analysis before coagulation had
 occurred.     In Observation 7 the blood was obtained by division of the
 jugular vein instantaneously after the process of pithing.         So quickly
 does sugar in quantity find its way from the liver into the blood after
 pithing has been performed, that it is necessary the steps of the opera
 tion of collection should be carried out with the utmost speed.
    The blood from the sheep was obtained from animals slaughtered for
 consumption as food, the mode of killing being that commonly practised,
 viz. passing a knife through the neck and dividing the vessels.         | The
 results represent the condition of the first portion oi the blood that

escaped, and the time elapsing between the collection and the commence
ment of the analysis did not exceed a quarter of an hour.      As coagula
tion had taken place, the clot was snipped into fine pieces with a pair of
scissors, and a fair sample of the whole thus taken.
   In the case of the bullock the blood was obtained                      from the Jewish
method of slaughtering, which consists of drawing a sharp knife across
the neck and cutting through all the soft structure down to the vertebral
column.    Itis arterial blood that is thus yielded. Owing to the distance
of the slaughter-house from my laboratory one hour elapsed between the
time of collection and the commencement of the analysis.

is necessary to bestow attention upon this point, for unless the proper
precautions from   a physiological point of view are observed, we may be
led as much into error as by the faulty method of analysis.        This                                 is
strikingly exemplified by the following analyses  of the blood of bullocks
obtained by the ordinary process of slaughtering that  by the animal      ;          is,

structions to my  assistant  to get the  incision made  as soon as possible

bullocks (Observations Nos. 20 and 21) were procured for analysis, the
same time elapsing between the period of collection and the commence
ment of the analysis as in the instances belonging to the other method
of slaughtering.   On the following day samples from two more bullocks
(Observations  Nos. 22 and 23) were procured in       similar way.   The      a
results derived from the blood obtained the first day do not differ to a
material extent (strictly speaking, the sugar  little higher) from those

a notably larger impregnation with sugar      and this difference,

reason to believe, arose from a longer time having been allowed to elapse
between felling the animal and making the incision for the blood to
escape.

the animals have been kept, whilst under my notice, upon                                    a    purely animal

   The comparative state of arterial and venous blood possesses bearing                               a
of the deepest physiological importance, and Bernard has given results
derived from the application of his process which tend to show that an
extensive disappearance of sugar takes place whilst the blood   passing                               is
from the arterial to the venous system. In the 'Comptes Rendus'

There     great discordancy in the results of the different observations.

In one instance, where the least difference noticeable, the figures stand
                                                                      is
1-100 part per 1000 for the arterial blood and 1•080 for the venous.      In
the instance of greatest difference the figures are 1'510 per 1000 for the
arterial and '950 for the venous, and this relates to the carotid artery and
the jugular vein. The mean difference between arterial and venous blood,
drawn from all the observations,   -300 part per 1000 and
                                                is           this repre                 ;        if
sented the truth    would undoubtedly imply, as
                          it                          urged    Bernard,            is             by
that   sufficient destruction of sugar occurs to harmonize with his glyco
       a
genic theory.
  My own observations, however, supply strikingly antagonistic evidence                                        ;
and, looking at Bernard's results,      am forced to the conclusion that

 they show a want of proper precaution in collecting the blood, aa well as
 the effect of a fallacious method of analysis.         It is necessary that both
 the physiology and chemistry belonging to the course of procedure should
 be free from sources of error ; and if the blood be collected directly after
 the vessel has been cut down upon, it may be expected, as a result of the
 effects of the operation upon the animal, to present a deviation from the
 natural state, and more so especially after the exposure of the carotid artery,
 on account of its deep situation and close contiguity to the pneumogastric
 nerve.        I
           As have stated, it is between the blood of the carotid artery
 and jugular vein that the greatest disparity was noticed by Bernard, the
 difference in one case amounting to -560 part per 1000, w hich is actually
 a larger proportion    of sugar than what      I have   found exists naturally in
 the blood of the sheep and bullock.
    I will mention the course of procedure       I have myself    adopted to obtain
 a true representation     of arterial and venous blood in a natural state, and
give the results of the analysis of the samples. Experience has shown
that the effect of anesthetics is to occasion a preternatural amount of
sugar in the blood.       To strictly attain, therefore, the object in view it is
necessary that the collection of blood should not be made whilst the
animal is under their influence.
                                 I
    In my first experiment was under the necessity, on account of the
restrictions of the Vivisection Act, of collecting the blood instantly after
the destruction of life. Pithing was performed, and instantaneously
afterwards an incision was made across the jugular vein on the one hand
and the crural artery on the other.          These vessels were selected from
their convenient situation for the expeditious performance of the opera
tion in a manner to admit of the respective kinds of blood being obtained
in a pure or unmixed state. The following are the results of the analysis
of the counterpart samples of each.          It will be seen that the amount of
sugar in the blood corresponds with what           I have before represented aa
naturally present, thus showing that no time was given between the
period of pithing and collection for the influence of post mortem change
in the liver to be exerted.

the present session of the Eoyal Society for the performance of two ex

sensibility during the exposure of the carotid artery and jugular vein. The
animals were then allowed to remain for an hour and a half to recover

 from the unnatural state induced by the anaesthetic.               Without occasion
 ing any  disturbance      of tranquillity   the two  vessels  were    now drawn for
 ward by means of loose threads which had been placed around them, and
 openings made to allow of the escape of blood. The respective specimens
 of blood were thus collected at the same moment          ; and, before coagulation
 had time to occur, the process of analysis was commenced.               The following

    I must allow these results to speak for themselves. The circumstances
I have alluded to have prevented my obtaining a larger number for this
communication.        Taking the evidence as it stands, it is not clearly appa
rent that any decided difference exists in the amount of sugar contained
respectively in arterial and venous blood.          More observations, however,
shall be made, and the results communicated at a later period.                 Mean
while, it may be confidently looked upon as settled that Bernard's repre
sentation is shown to be erroneous.
   I  have now to refer to the spontaneous change ensuing in the blood
after removal from the system.           Bernard, in his recent writings (Comptes
Bendus, 19 Juin, 1876, p. 1406) has drawn attention to this subject, and
represents the rate of disappearance of sugar to be such as to give weight
to his results regarding the extent of destruction alleged to occur in the
systemic capillaries during life, contending, as he does, that the post
mortem phenomena observed, both as regards sugar-formation and sugar-
destruction, stand as representations of the natural actions of life. The
following is the record he has given of the results derived from an ana
lysis of a sample of blood at different periods on a warm summer's day : —

nature.   Subjoined are the particulars relating to five observations made

   The gradual destruction of sugar shown by the above observations to
occur after the removal of blood from the system is nothing more than
a confirmation of what has been known for many years to take place. A
communication presented by me to the Eoyal Society in 1855, and pub
                                       '
lished in ab&tract in vol. vii. of the Proceedings,' contains the following
remarks : — " Under the changes of the decomposition of blood, normal
animal glucose is very readily metamorphosed.       The rapidity of the me
tamorphosis depends on the activity of the decomposition of the animal
substances present, and when the destruction of the sugar is complete, the
blood has assumed an acid reaction.   This acid reaction of decomposing
blood is only observable in that which was previously pretty largely im
pregnated with sugar.  It appears to be owing to the formation of lactic
acid       The disappearance of sugar is more rapid where the fibrin and
corpuscles are present than when the serum is exposed alone ; and in
accordance with this the blood, in the one case, undergoes decomposition
much sooner than in the other."
  Thus   as   far back
                   as 22 years ago          I
                                   directed attention to the phenomenon
here referred to. The phenomenon constitutes a change, the occurrence
of which, from the known properties of sugar, might be looked for under
the circumstances.  Taken by itself it implies nothing physiologically,
but simply stands in subordinate relation to the physiological position
shown by other evidence to exist.

    The conclusion to which the evidence contained in this communication
leads is that if the gravimetric application of the copper test used in the
accustomed manner is to be accepted as affording trustworthy information
with reference to the quantitative determination of sugar, and confi     I
dently submit that it is, the results which Bernard has obtained by the

 V. " Note on Dr. Burdon Sanderson's latest Views of Ferments
       and Germs." By J. Tyndall, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.                      Re
       ceived June 21, 1877.
    While writing the paper which the Council of the Eoyal Society has
 recently done me the honour of accepting for the Philosophical Transac
 tions, the abstract of a lecture delivered by Dr. Burdon Sanderson to the
 Association of Medical Officers of Health was placed in my hands. The
 esteem in which the author's name is justly held will certainly give
 weight and currency to the views enunciated in this lecture.          Speaking
 of ferments Dr. Sanderson says :       — " In defining the nature of ferment
 action we are in a dilemma, out of which there is no escape except by
 compromise.      A ferment is not an organism, because it has no structure.
 It is not a chemical body, because when it acts upon other bodies it main
 tains its own molecular integrity. On the whole, it resembles an organism
 much more than it resembles a chemical body, for its characteristic beha
 viour is such   as, if it had a structure, would prove it to be living.      Ten
 years ago the opponents of spontaneous generation were called Pansper-
 mists, because it was supposed that in the so-called generatio equivoca, in
 every case in which Bacteria appeared to spring out of nothing, the result
 was referable to the influence of unseen but actually existing germs.        The
  researches of the last few years have carried us beyond this stage      .... the
  outer line of defence, represented by the aphoristic expression omne
  vivum ex ovo, has been for some time abandoned.         The ground which the
  orthodox biologist holds now, as against the heterodox, is not that every
 Bacterium must have been born of another Bacterium, but that every Bac
 terium must have been born of something which emanated from another
 Bacterium, that something not being assumed to be endowed with struc
 ture in the morphological or anatomical sense, but only in the molecular
  or chemical sense.      It is admitted by all, even by Professor Tyndall, that,
  so far as structure is concerned, the germinal or life-producing matter out
  of which Bacteria     originate  exhibits no characters which can    be  appre
  ciated by the microscope ; and other researches have proved that the
  germinal matter is capable of resisting destructive influences, particularly
  those of high temperature,       which are absolutely    fatal to the Bacteria
                                                                  2b 2

 themselves.              Germs          have given place to things           which are ultramicro-
 scopical — to molecular aggregates — of which all we can                           say is, what we
 have already said about the ferments, that they occupy the border-land
 between living and non-living things."
    As directed against " germs " the argument that the " germinal matter "
 is capable of resisting destructive influences which are fatal to the Bacteria
  themselves, will,                 I   think,   be found       on consideration    to lack validity.
 Nobody is better acquainted than Dr. Sanderson with the two forms under
 which the contagium of splenic fever appears. He knows that the one is
 fugitive and readily destroyed, the other persistent and destroyed with
 difficulty. Now the recent researches of Koch, which have been verified
 by Cohn, prove conclusively that the difference here referred to is based
 upon the fact that the fugitive contagium is the developed organism of
 Bacillus anthracis, while the persistent contagium is the spore of that
 organism.   Dallinger's excellent observations also establish a difference
 between the death-temperatures of monad germs and of adult monads ;
 while          I
          need not do more than refer to the forthcoming Part of the
 Philosophical Transactions for illustrations of the extraordinary dif
 ferences of the same nature which my recent researches have brought
 to light.
    Dr. Sanderson credits me with                         " admitting " that the germinal or life-
 producing matter out of which Bacteria originate exhibits no structural
 characters which can be appreciated by the microscope.   Not only do                                       I
 admit     but  it,

 experimentally demonstrating the existence of   world of particles      a                             far

       " Many of our physiological observers appear to form                        a very inadequate

heavier powder in the palm of the hand.         If, like the powder, such
floating dust, sown in an appropriate soil, produce a definite living crop,
with the same logical rigour as before we should conclude that the germs

applies, word for word, to tho development of Bacteria from those
suspended particles which the luminous beam reveals in the air, and in
the absence of which life is never generated in previously sterilized
infusions.

perceptible the phenomena anticipated,     I constructed, in the summer of
1876, a small artificial river, about eight inches wide and an inch or two
deep, having a bend turning about a half-round, or 180°, so that the
course of the river might be likened to the capital letter        The water

the various parts of the river, along the bed, and at the upper surface,
and at places anywhere within the body of the current, were made to
show themselves in several ways.      One way was by means of threads of
suitable length (about an inch or two long), some of which were anchored
at bottom, while others were attached at various depths in the river to
pins or slender wires standing upright like thin posts in the river.   These
threads, by the lines of direction which they assumed, showed very well
the directions of the flow at bottom and at various depths.          Another
way, and one which proved very satisfactory for showing the bottom cur
 rents, was by dropping into the river granules of various kinds, such as

very clearly numerous phenomena, not only of the flow of the water, but
also of the transmission of material-like detritus forward along the
bottom in straight parts, and very obliquely across the bottom in the
bend    ; and gave imitations on a small scale, easy for observation, of the
processes of accumulation of detritus along the inner banks of the bends
of rivers, and presented also interesting suggestions and considerations
as to some     of the details or secondary actions involved in the processes *.

                                        (Abstract.)
    When a solution containing silver and potassium nitrates, in equiva
lent proportions, is evaporated, the potassium nitrate separates out, un-
combined with silver nitrate.           If, however, the ratio of silver nitrate to
potassium      nitrate   be  increased     beyond a certain limit (which has been
determined), then a true double salt having the composition AgN03KNO,
crystallizes out.       The same salt can also be formed from a solution that
would not yield it under ordinary circumstances, by either adding nitric
acid or by increasing the temperature of the solution, both these altera
tions tending in the same direction, viz. to decrease the amount of silver
nitrate as compared to that of potassium nitrate which can exist in solu
tion.
    Further it is shown, with regard to these two salts, that if an intimate
 mixture of them be treated with an amount of water insufficient to dis
 solve the whole of either constituent, still the composition of the solu
 tion found will vary with the composition of the mixture used.                     This
 arises from the two salts uniting in solution to form the double salt, and
 ultimately the amount of double salt that can remain in solution depend
 ing on the excess of silver nitrate present, which, from its greater solu
 bility, can displace the double salt from solution.               The residue in this
 case, from    its crystalline form, can       be identified as double salts.
     With sodium nitrate       a corresponding       double salt does not form.       In
 this case,    on evaporating       the solution     it is the silver nitrate, not the

 Section  of the British Association at  the meeting held at Glasgow, in September  1876,
 and further in the temporary      collection prepared in the Helvingrove Museum at
 Glasgow, for that meeting of the Association. As they were arranged expressly for
 testing and illustrating the theoretical views contained in a paper previously submitted

 358                    On Double Salts of Nitrate           of Silver.           [June  21,
 sodium      nitrate,    which is the first to separate out, notwithstanding its
 being by far the more soluble salt of the two.                  The solution obtained by
treatment of the two salts with insufficient water does not vary in com
position, as is the case with the potassium salt, and this is known to be
 a strong confirmation of the statement of the non-existence of a double
 salt of silver and sodium.
    With ammonium nitrate               a double salt is formed      corresponding     to the
potassium salt.          In this case, owing to the similar degree of solubility of
 both constituents, it forms on the evaporation of a solution containing
the salts in the proportion of single equivalents.                   On treatment of the
salts with insufficient water for solution the same thing happens as with
 the potassium salts.
    With lithium nitrate no double salt could             be formed ; but on the evapo
 ration of a solution having the two salts in equivalent proportions, it is
the very soluble silver nitrate which is the first to separate out. Again,
 the composition of the solution obtained by treating different amounts of
 the dry salts with insufficient water to dissolve them gives in all cases a
 liquid of constant composition.
    With lead nitrate no double salt was formed. On evaporation, in this
 case, it is the least soluble, the lead nitrate, which is the first to separate
 out.
    When two salts are together in solution, in some cases the more
 soluble, in others the less soluble, will be the first to separate out on
 evaporation ; this action appears to depend on the affinity of the salt for
 water — its hygroscopic character, not its solubility.
    The distinctive character of the double salt is confirmed by its crystal
line form, which is similar in the two cases of the potassium- and the
 ammonium-silver           salt.
    The   system to which these crystals belong is the oblique               ;  the elements
 of the crystal being

mean direction of the first m3an line being about 35° on the normal of
10 0, and     8° 40' on that      of  T0  1.
   Crystals of potassium nitrate, containing less silver nitrate than the
double salt, gave angles according somewhat closely with those of ordi
nary nitre ; but the crystals did not give very good reflections.
   The results obtained by Rose with sodium nitrate containing silver
nitrate were confirmed so far as the crystals permitted of measurement.
   Crystals of strontium nitrate containing silver nitrate gave excellent
measurements, according with those of a cubo-octahedron.

   The series employed are considered as convergent, according to the
rule given by Cauchy.            On account of the great importance of the sub
ject of convergent series,         I have thought that mathematicians would be
interested    to see how the results of Cauchy are confirmed
                                                                                by a method

Thomson.       Let u0+u,tf + v.^ + . . . + unx"+                   ...  be any series, then
I  call        when n increases without limit the ultimate                      ratio  of the
series, and denote      it by     p.   Then    if x  is less than          the series will be
convergent.
   Now consider the function                   r which we have employed in
                                                                                         these
investigations.
   Since   — -— +           , , =1, the series comprising            -  -     can contain no
even powers, and therefore we may assume

 " On    the Hindoo Division of the Octave, with some Additions

        Bosanquet, Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford.                    Commu
        nicated by Prof. Henry J. S. Smith, F.R.S., Savilian Pro
        fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.                     Received
        January 5, 1877.        Read February         8f.
    My attention       has been recently drawn to some publications which
 appear   to  afford trustworthy   information concerning the musical intervals
   * Some time after the paper was read, the author's attention was called to M. Fetis'a
 work, a reference to which is embodied in the paper.

                        Hindoo Division of the Octave.                           373
in use among the Hindoos *. In particular it appears that the foundation
of their system is a division of the octave into 22 intervals, which are
called S'rutis.     I
                  propose to discuss this system in the light of the theory
formerly communicated to the Eoyal Society t ; and as it is one of what
I have called the higher systems, and the theory of such systems has not
been sufficiently developed,     Itake the opportunity of adding what is
necessary for the classification, discussion, and practical treatment of the
principal systems of this character.
   Some light may be thrown on the object of the paper by the following
quotation from the work of Fetis before referred to. After an exhaustive
treatment of the various accessible scales, tunes, &c., from the artistic
point of view, he sums up in the following words : —
   " D'ailleurs, pour etablir d'une maniere certaine l'etat veritable de la
musique indienne de nos jours, il faudrait qu'elle eut etc etudiee sur les
lieux par un musicien possedant une connaissance complete de l'art et de

   The point of the present paper, so far as it relates to Hindoo music, is
that until we have a general means of producing and controlling such
systems as are likely to be met with on instruments with fixed tones
    (<?.
   g. the harmonium), and of thus comparing such systems with actual
facts, we can have no certainty as to the results, at least in the present
state of musical education.
   Fetis employs the principle of the comparison of intervals with equal
temperament semitones, which        the basis of the writer's methods but
                                     is                                      ;
he uses    only for the purpose of speculating on the connexion between
               it
the Hindoo system of 22, and      division of the octave into 24, or of each
                                     a
semitone into two equal parts,     comparison by which nothing appears to
                                     a
be gained.  The  use of the method for instituting comparisons with perfect
consonances has escaped him.      And yet     appears (Fetis, vol. ii.

   Another form called Madhyaraa Grama is precisely similar to the above,

   There is  a  third principal form, the constitution   of which appears un
certain  ; but the two above given are suggestive, and are enough to make
clear to us the general nature of the arrangement.
   In fact, if we suppose for a moment that the fifths and thirds of this
scale  are perfect, which is not exactly true, we see that the first form,
Shadja Grama, is the form we should give to the scale in just intonation,
when we wish to retain the ordinary second of the key, and raise the
sixth of the key, so as to form a good fifth with the second («. g. in the
key of e we should raise    \ a to o, so as to get the good fifth, d-a).  The
other form, Madhyama       Grama, corresponds to the diatonic scale as ordi
narily given.
   Are the S'rutis all equal in value ? The native writers say nothing
about this, but the European ones for the most part suggest that they are
not.    For instance, an English reviewer recently wrote, " A S'ruti is a
quarter tone or a third of a tone according to its position in the scale."
This appears to be a misapprehension arising from the modern idea that
each interval of a tone in the scale is necessarily the same.          But the
language in which the different forms of the scale is described distinctly
indicates that a note rises or falls when it gains or loses a S'ruti ; con
sequently we may infer that the S'rutis are intended to be equal in a
general sort of way, probably without any very great precision.
   We shall now show that the fifths and thirds, produced by a division

                        Hindoo Division of the Octave.                               375
of the   octave into 22 equal intervals, do not deviate very widely from the
exact intervals, which are the foundation of the diatonic scale.
    For this purpose we shall only need to recall the values of the perfect
fifth and third in terms of equal temperament semitones of 12 to the
octave. A simple calculation will give us the values of the corresponding
intervals of the system.
    The perfect fifth is 7•01955 semitones,
                         or      nearly.
    The perfect third is 4— -13686 semitones,
                         or 4 —     nearly.
    To find the interval in semitones       made by     x units of the system of 22,
we have
                                12
                                            ^ *,
                                22* or 11
    Hence we obtain the following values         : —
                                    System   of 22.
                                   No. of          Interval in      Exact interval
                Intervals.         units.          semitones.        in semitones.

          Fifth                      13             7-0909              7-0195
    Hence the fifth of the system of 22 is sharp by about               -07,  or   g of a
comma very nearly.
    The major third is flat by -045, or        g of   a comma nearly.
                           (Comma of ^=-21506.)
    The system of 22 possesses, then, remarkable properties ; it has both
fifths and thirds considerably better than any other cyclical system having
so low a number of notes.        The only objection, as far as the concords go,
to its practical employment for our own purposes lies in the fifths ;
these lie just beyond the limit of what is tolerable in the case of instru
ments with continuous        tones.    (The mean tone system is regarded               as
the extreme limit     ; this has fifths   ^
                                            of a comma flat.)      For the purposes
of the Hindoos, where no stress is laid on the harmony, the system is
already so perfect that improvement could hardly be expected.
    It is thus wrong to suppose that the system of 22 would need much
tempering to bring its concords into tune.             These are probably quite as
accurate as rough and poorly toned instruments admit of.
    But although the consonance error of fifth and third is small,             it is far

musicians.      It will thus be possible to find out what is the extent of the
tempering, if any, which they employ.           The education of the European
ear is as yet so imperfect that no reliance can be placed on
                                                                      estimations of

fractions of intervals numerically by ear is completely

                         Hindoo Division of the Octave.                       377
    I shall   presently indicate the mode in which the principles of the gene
ralized keyboard permit us to construct an instrument that will deal prac
tically with this system of 22, and exhibit in a graphical manner the sin
gular laws of harmony to which its notes are subject.
                            Theory of the Higher Systems.
    Let us recall what is meant by the order of       a system.
    (The letters E.T. are used as an abbreviation for "equal temperament.")
    The E.T. fifth is 7 semitones ;
         the octave is 12 semitones.
         .-. 12  E.T. fifths=7 octaves=84 semitones.
    The perfect fifth, on the other hand, is (very nearly) 7^         ; so that 12
perfect fifths = 84^-
    And in other systems there is always a small difference between 12 fifths
 and 7 octaves.        Now the simplest way in which this can be treated is to
 make this small difference the unit of the system.            "When this is done
 the system is said to be of the first order.
     But sometimes this small difference is more than one unit: if it is
 divided into two units, we say that the system is of the second order ; if
 into three, of the third, and so on.
     The forms of arrangement into scales and laws connecting the harmony
 of fifths and thirds depend primarily upon the orders of systems.
     Eeferring back for the details of the investigation to my previous com
 munication already cited,        I  recall only that the systems of each order
 proceed by      differences  of  12, and that for the first three orders they are
 as follows    : —
             Order.
                1.           17             29         41           53

                3.           15             27         39
     The accompanying illustration (Diagram I.) will make clearer what is
 meant by saying that the system of 22 is a system of the second order.
 The numbers are the characteristic numbers of the system ; they are
 arranged in order of fifths, ». e. they proceed by differences of 13, 22
 being always cast out.         The departure of the sharp fifths from E. T. is
 represented by displacement in a vertical direction.
     Then the circle of 12 fifths has its terminal points 2 units apart.
     Similarly in systems of the rth order, the circle of 12 fifths has its
  terminal points r units apart.
     In the illustration we see how the notes may be introduced which form
  the intervals intermediate between the terminal points ; thus the note 1
  is introduced midway between 0 and 2.

                                 Formation of Thirds.
    Thirds may be formed either by the notes of the circle of fifths with
 which we start, or by the notes of another circle any number of unite
 above or more generally below the first.
    In  the system of 22 we have seen that the third is 7 units. Looking
 at the circle of fifths, the third by 4 fifths up is 8 units.        We may form
 the third to any note therefore by ascending through 4 fifths of the series
and then descending one unit ; i. e. the third is formed in the circle of
fifths one unit below that which contains the fundamental.
    This mode of formation has not been previously considered. It leads
to the following observation, which is important in the practical employ
ment of the systems : —
    Modulation through a third, in systems of this character, cannot be
generally treated as equivalent to modulation through any number of
fifths.
    We proceed to a further classification of the higher systems, based on
this property.
    By definition, the interval between the two ends of the circle of fifths
is r units.       Let r circles of fifths be placed in juxtaposition, so that cor
responding pairs of notes are all one unit apart, and consider the third
formed with the starting point of the uppermost series.
    Then we shall define a system as being of class x, when the third lies
in the xth series below the upper one.
   In the system of 22, the third (7) to        c (0) lies one series below that in
which    c  is, so that we may define the properties of the system of 22 by
saying that it is of order 2 and class 1.
   The simplest systems of higher orders are those which form their thirds

                       Hindoo Division of the Octave.                       379
either by 4 fifths up or 8 fifths down in the same series ; these may be
spoken of as of order r class 0, and order r class r respectively.         Both
have been considered in my paper already referred to.
   I proceed   to indicate shortly the general expressions by means of which
systems can be discussed.
   The departure of the third formed by 4 fifths up is
                                         n
   In  a system   of class x, the third is x units lower, and its departure is

    So that for a determination of the class of any system n of the rth
 order, we have the approximate condition
    The formulae (i) and (ii) are sufficient for any required discussion ;
 they present no difficulty, and     I  confine myself to a statement of a few
 of the principal results.
    The departure of the third of all systems of order 2 class      1 is repre
 sented by

    The system of 34, of order 2 class 1, presents both fifths and thirds of
 exceptional excellence.      This system may be of interest for modern pur
 poses.
    Systems of the third order and first class have equal-temperament
 thirds; for (i) vanishes when x              or, more generally, a system has
                                         o

 E.T. thirds when the number of the class is tha*; of the order.
    Systems of order r class x which make 3x—r negative need not              be
 considered, as their thirds are sharper than E.T. thirds.
    In  the third order, class 2, there is a good system of 87.
    In  the fourth order, class 2, there is a good system of 56.
    Neither of these are likely to be of practical interest.
                                Practical Applications.
    In  the light of the foregoing investigation we see that the generalized
 keyboard, as hitherto constructed, is of limited application ; it is capable

380                    Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet               on the
of controlling only systems which form their thirds by either 4 fifths up
or 8 fifths down. The systems included by these conditions are all those
of the first order, positive and negative, and all systems of any order of
class 0 or class r. These embrace all that are likely to be interesting
with reference to European harmonious music, with the possible exception
of the system of 34 above alluded to.
   The principles of position on which the keyboard is founded are, how
ever, applicable to all higher systems ; and            I
                                                shall presently investigate
its transformations.    The keyboard of the second order thus obtained
will afford a means of controlling, in a convenient manner, systems of
the first class in that order, and dealing with facility with either the
Hindoo system of 22, or the system of 34 above mentioned.
   But before proceeding to discuss these arrangements, it is desirable to
provide the extension of our notation, which is necessary for dealing with
systems of the rth order and classes other than r and 0.
                                  Generalized Notation.
  The notation which         I
                         have hitherto employed has always assumed that
the deviation, or departure, due to a circle of 12 fifths is identical with
one unit of the system employed.
   Thus c—/c represented both the departure of 12 fifths and the smallest
interval, or unit, of the system. In non-cyclical systems, and in systems
of the first order, this representation is consistent and satisfactory ; but
in systems of higher orders these two conceptions diverge. The departure
of 12 fifths and the unit of the system can no longer be represented by
the same symbol.
   The choice we will make         is,
                               that the symbol of elevation or depression
shall represent primarily one unit of the system. Thus c— /ewill always
represent the unit, but will only represent the departure of 12 fifths in
systems of the first order.
  c—//c will                      of twelve fifths in systems of the second
                   be the departure
order   ;   c—///cin systems of the third order, and so on.
  It follows that, in continuous series of fifths, at the point where two
                         a
consecutive series of the notation join, the difference of the marks, on the
two notes which constitute the joining fifth, will be r.
  Thus the following are fifths which join the unmarked series to that
next above    it
               :   —
                          In     the 1st order,    b—/f$,

and so on.
  We now require only to find the thirds.        Introducing the condition
that the system be of class x, we find the third as follows — Pass up four
                                                                     :

                                Transformations          of   the    Generalized Keyboard.
      It is only necessary to require, in the construction of the generalized
    keyboard, that all the keys shall equally fit all the bearings, to render it
    possible to produce any required position system with a sufficient number
    of the ordinary keys. This requirement has always been attended to in
    the plans for the sake of simplification ; though the important results
    which flow from it were not originally foreseen.   But it is found that
<U+25BA>   unless the attention of the maker is specially directed to the point, the
    nature of the finishing processes does not secure the result in question ;
    there      is,
             however, no difficulty in securing  when       desired.      it            it   is
       The distance of the end of the key on the plan (projection on hori                              a

      There are 12 such fundamental positions                              ;   so that we may describe the
    pattern of any key completely as function of    series of numbers running
                                                         a                     a

IX. "On        some hitherto Undescribed Optical Properties                of Doubly
       Refracting Crystals." — Preliminary   Notice.   By H. C.
       Sorby, F.R.S., President of the Royal Microscopical and of
       the Mineralogical Societies. Received June 20, 1877.
  In     theProceedings of the Royal Society (vol. xxiv. p. 393) Dr.
Royston-Pigott described      new refractometer to determine the index
                                a
of refraction of liquids and other substances by means of the displace
ment  of the focal point of an object seen through them with a low
magnifying-power.   Another paper on the subject was communicated
by him to the Royal Microscopical Society, and subsequently published

1877.]            Properties of Doubly Refracting         Crystals.                 385
in its Journal*.                                           I
                       After the reading of this paper said that it appeared
to me probable that the same principle might be applied with advantage
to the determination of the index of refraction of minerals.                 The chief
question was how to make the requisite measurements by means of such
an addition to an ordinary microscope as would not in any way interfere
with its general use for other purposes.          This  I accomplished by fixing
a graduated       scale to the body of the microscope and a vernier to the
supporting arm, so that the position of the focal point can be read off to
within about -j-^jj of an inch.             I  described this arrangement and
pointed out its value in connexion with mineralogy at a meeting of the
Mineralogical Society last March, and an account of it was published in
the Journal of the Societyt.          I  have since learned that a very similar
addition was made to a microscope in Professor Clifton's laboratory at
Oxford some eight years ago, and used for the measurement of the index
of refraction of glass, but no account of it was ever published.
    When     I  cams to study the index of refraction of doubly refracting
minerals    I  was very soon struck with the fact that, instead of seeing at
one focus the two systems of lines at right augles to each other, they
were sometimes quite invisible, or one set was seen at one focus, and the
other at a very different, as though they had been ruled on the two oppo
site sides of a piece of glass. These curious phenomena were exhibited
at the soiree of the Royal Society on the 25th of April last, and Pro
fessor Stokes immediately examined the question theoretically, and found
that they could be explained by, and might have been predicted from,
the known laws of double refraction, though apparently no one had ever
studied them, either theoretically or practically.             -We therefore de
 cided to investigate the problem independently.!             I  was to make the
practical observations, and he to give the theoretical explanations, the
 results being kept separate, but communicated conjointly to the Royal

    There   was no difficulty whatever in proving that the general pheno
 mena agreed with the results of theory ; but when            I  came to compare
 the numerical results of observation and calculation          I  found that many
 unexpected difficulties had to be contended with.                 The sections of
 minerals, originally made for an entirely different purpose, were in many
cases not cut with sufficient accuracy, or were too full of flaws.              It was
 some   time before     I   could obtain suitable specimens of some minerals,
 and it was necessary to recut nearly all my original preparations.               I also
found    that  there   were   several unforeseen sources  of error,   and  that  it was
 requisite to repeat nearly all my measurements.              Much to my regret,
 I  therefore    found it necessary to publish along with Professor Stokes's
 paper, either a large number of indices known to be inaccurate and not
 suitable for comparison with theory, or to publish this present pre-

  X. " On the Foci of Lines seen through a Crystalline Plate."
     By G. G. Stokes, M.A., Sec. R.S. Received June 21, 1877.
    At the Soiree of the Royal Society on the 25th of April Mr. Sorby
 showed me the method he had recently devised for discriminating between
 minerals by focusing a microscope over a delicate image of cross lines,
 which image was viewed, first directly, and then through a crystalline
 plate, having previously been adjusted to be at the distance of the lower
 surface of the plate.         With glass and singly refracting substances the
 alteration of   the   focus produced by the interposition of the plate affords
 a measure     of its refractive index.         But with   a plate cut from a doubly
 refracting crystal, not only is there more than one focal distance, but for
 one at least of the pencils there is (except in special cases) no true
 focus, but the foci of the two systems of cross lines are found at two dif
 ferent depths, or else there is no sharply defined image at all, according
 to the orientation of the lines relatively to lines fixed in the crystalline
 plate.    Moreover the result obtained on applying the formula which, for
 a singly   refracting plate, gives the refractive index from the measured
 displacement of the focus is often widely different from what is known
 to be the refractive index of the crystal, for the pencil under examina
 tion, in a direction perpendicular to the plate.
    The phenomena will          be described     in detail by Mr. Sorby in his own
 paper.     My object is to show how they flow from the known laws of
 double    refraction,   as consequences of which they will necessarily come
 under review *.
   *      seemed pretty certain that some      of the phenomena must have been noticed
      [It
 before, though  I am not aware that they have been described, or their theory worked
out in any detail.     I find that Prof. Clifton has been in the habit of using an instru
ment somewhat similar to Mr. Sorby's, which was procured several years ago for the
Museum of the University of Oxford, and that he was familiar with such things as the
low apparent index of calcite for the extraordinary pencil nearly in the direction of
the axis, and the astigmatism in general of a pencil refracted across a plate otherwise
than by ordinary refraction ; and, further, that he utilized these phenomena for the
instruction of students as to the general form of the wave-surface.     No one, however,
so far as 1 know, before Mr. Sorby, had applied the phenomena to the practical dis
crimination of minerals, or had worked them out quantitatively and in detail ; and it
is my desire to complete the subject, by supplying the mathematical theory, that must
be my excuse for offering to the Society an investigation which in itself consists merely
in easy deductions from well-known principles.

     The simplest   case is that of a uniaxal crystal, such as Iceland spar, cut
  perpendicular to its axis.       As regards the ordinary ray, a plate cut from
  a uniaxal crystal, in whatever direction, behaves, of course, like a plate
  of glass, so far as focusing is concerned, and the index obtained is the
  true ordinary index.       To find what takes place as regards the extraor
  dinary ray, we must have recourse to Huyghens's construction.
     Let O be any point in the further surface of the crystalline plate, OA
  perpendicular to the surface the direction of the axis, OP the direction
  of any extraordinary       ray.    Let the plane of the paper       be the plane  of

 within the crystal in the direction of the axis, and OD in OA produced
 to represent the velocity of propagation (unity) in air.                 With O as
 centre, construct the half-spheroid, BAC, which is the extraordinary sheet
 of the wave-surface,      and the hemisphere EDF representing the wave
 into which a disturbance emanating from O would have spread in air in
 a  unit of time, and let OB or OC be denoted by c. Let OP cut the half-
 spheroid in P.     At P draw a tangent plane to the spheroid, the trace of
 which on the surface of the crystal is projected in T ; and through the
 trace T draw a tangent plane to the hemisphere, touching it in Q, and
join OQ. Then if an extraordinary ray travel within the crystal in the
 direction OP, the refracted ray to which it will give rise will travel in a
 direction parallel to OQ.        Hence if we now take OP to denote the whole
path of the ray within the plate, and draw Fq parallel to QO, cutting
 OA in q, the ray OP, after refraction at P, will proceed as if it came
from q. Hence the limiting position of q, as P moves up to A, will be
the geometrical focus, after refraction, of a small pencil proceeding from
0, and having OA for its axis.
     Draw PM perpendicular to OA, and let m represent the ratio of the
sine of refraction to the sine of incidence.           Then

we have ultimately
where u, fi denote the ordinary and the principal extraordinary indices of
refraction, which are the reciprocals of a, e.
   In this particular case the ordinary and extraordinary images cannot
be distinguished directly by their polarization, since each consists of rays
polarized in all azimuths.   But if the objective of the microscope be
limited by a narrow aperture, so as to give a predominance to rays lying
in       plane, there will in the ordinary image be a predominance of
       one
polarization in a plane parallel to the length of the aperture, and in the
extraordinary image of polarization in the perpendicular plane.
   Next take the case of a uniaxal crystal cut parallel to the axis.      In
this case, as regards the extraordinary pencil, the divergence after refrac
 tion will              in the axial and equatorial planes, so that a small
                  be different
 pencil diverging from a point at the under surface of the crystal will, after
 refraction, diverge from two focal lines ; and in order that a line may be
 seen distinctly, it must lie in one of the planes of symmetry, in which
 case, at a certain focal adjustment of the microscope, each element of the
 line would be seen as a short line in the direction of the actual line, and
 therefore the line as a whole will be seen sharply defined.
    In the equatorial plane the extraordinary ray obeys the ordinary law of
 refraction ; and as regards divergence, therefore, in this plane, on which
 depends clear vision of a line parallel to the axis, the apparent index
 will be the same as the real index, ft'. In the axial plane everything will
 be the same in respect of divergence as in the first case, except that the
 principal axes of the ellipse which is the section of the extraordinary
 wave-surface will be interchanged.      Accordingly a line in the equatorial
 plane will be seen distinctly at a focal adjustment which will give an
 apparent refractive index       ft.       /ia

    There will therefore, on the whole, be three focal adjustments of the
 microscope at which one or other of the systems of cross lines, or both
 together, will be seen distinctly, namely, one for the extraordinary pencil,

ordinary       pencil, which is polarized in the axial plane, at which both
systems at once will be seen distinctly. And the ordinary index, which
will be given by the ordinary image, will be a geometric mean between
the two apparent extraordinary indices, of which one, namely, that got
from the lines in the axial plane, will be the real extraordinary index.
    There are two uniaxal crystals, calcite and quartz, for which we know
accurately the principal refractive indices for the principal lines of the
spectrum from the measures of Budberg.                  The principal indices for these
two minerals and the apparent indices in the two directions mentioned
above are given in the following Table.               The indices are given to four

    It is   well known that the double refraction of quartz differs from that
of the generality of uniaxal crystals.              Its wave-surface for any colour,
instead of being the sphere and spheroid of Huyghens, is a surface of two
distinct      sheets,   which,    instead of touching, only make a very close
approach along the axis.             The polar diameters of the outer, or ordinary,
and    of  the    inner, or extraordinary, sheet differ by minute and practically
 equal quantities from the equatorial diameter of the ordinary sheet.
 The effect of this, however, on the indices, real or apparent, determined
by Mr. Sorby's method on a plate cut perpendicular to the axis, would
not be sensible.          The peculiarity would show itself by giving the two
images      at different depths circularly polarized, one right-handedly and the
other lef t-handedly.
     It may be noticed that the refractive index is given by the reciprocal
 of the radius of curvature of a section of the wave-surface by a plane
perpendicular         to the lines seen in focus, and that in order that the lines
 may be seen        distinctly, they must be perpendicular to one of the planes
 of principal curvature.                          I
                                   This rule, as proceed to show, is general ; and
 it will much simplify the calculation in more complicated cases, by
 enabling us to dispense with the direct application of Huyghens's                   con
 struction.
     Let O     be a point    in the first surface of the plate, and consider     a small

pencil emanating from O in such a direction that its axis, after refrac
tion, is perpendicular to the plate. With centre O describe half a wave-
surface, of which only one sheet, DEF, is represented in the figure to
avoid confusion.       In a direction parallel to the surfaces of the plate draw-
                                        Fig.  2.
 a tangent     plane to the wave-surface, touching         it in E.   Join OE,    and
 draw   EG   a normal to the plate, and produce         it to cut DF in H.      Then
 OE is the course of      a ray within the crystal which, after refraction, pro
 ceeds in a direction     perpendicular    to the plate, and is therefore the axis
 of the pencil. Let OFQ be           an adjacent ray, cutting the wave-surface in
 P, and the tangent plane, which we may suppose to coincide with the
 second surface of the plate, in Q.          Then the retardation of the wave on
 arriving   at  Q, relatively  to  the  wave  at E, will be the time the ray of light
 takes to travel from P to Q.          The form of the wave after refraction will
 depend only     on  the  value   of  this retardation, regarded as a function of
 the two coordinates which determine the position of Q on the plate. This
 follows at once from Huvghens's principle.             If we regard QE as a small
 quantity of the first order, the retardation will be a small quantity of the
  tecond order ; and in determining the foci of the refracted pencil we only
  want to know the retardation true to this order, and we may substitute
 for the actual retardation       any quantity which bears to it a ratio that is
  ultimately    one of equality.      Hence, as the wave progresses within the
 crystal beyond      DEF,    we   may feign it to be travelling in an ordinary
 medium, with a velocity of propagation equal to the actual wave-velocity
 in the direction HE normal to the plate. For if from Q we conceive a nor
  mal QM drawn to the wave-surface, the actual wave-velocity along MQ will
  differ from that in the direction       HE  by a small quantity of the first order  ;
  and since the whole distance        MQ is a small quantity of the second order,
  we may neglect the variation of wave-velocity, and treat the medium as
  if it were a singly refracting one, in which a wave was travelling which
  had already, by some means, acquired the form DEF.

   Through the normal        EH     draw the two rectangular planes of principal
curvature of the surface at E, and let C, C be the centres of curvature,
and p, p the radii of curvature, on the same scale in which HE represents
the wave-velocity v in the direction HE.                Then the rays in that plane of
principal curvature, the normals in which intersect in C, may be thought
of as diverging from C in an ordinary medium, of which the refractive
index is v~i.     If r be the thickness of the plate, the distance of C from
the second surface will       be   -r,   and the product       of this by  v, or pr, will
give the distance of the focus in that plane after refraction into air ; and
therefore the apparent index of refraction will be p~i. Similarly p'_i will
will  be the apparent index        in the other plane. And in order that one or
other of the two rectangular systems of lines may be seen distinctly at
the proper focus, the lines must be placed perpendicular                 respectively to
the two planes of principal curvature.
    A similar   construction     applies to the other pencil which the plate is
 capable of transmitting independently, to which corresponds the other
sheet of the wave-surface, and which is polarized in a plane perpendicular
to the plane of polarization of the former pencil.                In a biaxal crystal, in
which neither sheet of the wave-surface is a sphere, there will in general
be four focal distances at which lines in proper directions can be seen
distinctly.     For either pencil the two required directions are perpendi
cular to each other     ;  and  if  the plate be perpendicular to one of the prin
cipal planes, or planes of optical symmetry of the crystal, the required
directions of the cross lines are the same for both pencils, namely,
parallel and perpendicular to the plane of symmetry.
    The case next in order of simplicity to that of a uniaxal crystal cut
parallel to the axis is that of a biaxal crystal cut in a direction perpen
dicular   to one of the principal axes ; but before proceeding to this it
may be well to complete the investigation for a uniaxal crystal, by con
sidering a plate cut in any manner.
    Let  0 be  the inclination of the axis of the crystal to the normal to the
 plate ; a, c, as  before, the polar and equatorial semiaxes of the spheroid.
We need only consider the extraordinary ray and the spheroid corre
sponding to it.      Let p be the radius of curvature of the elliptic section
made by the      principal plane,      p  the radius of curvature of the perpendi
cular section, which      will be the length        of the normal drawn as far as the
axis of revolution,        p and     p   are to   be  expressed in terms of d.       We

      In  biaxal crystals the simplest case, and at the same time the most
  important, is that of a plate cut perpendicular to one of the principal
  axes, or so-called axes of elasticity.        As the calculation for both pencils
  is precisely the same as for the extraordinary pencil in a plate of a uni
  axal crystal     cut parallel     to the axis,    it will   be  sufficient to give the
   result.
       Let the principal axes be designated as those of x, y, r, to which relate
   the parameters or principal velocities of propagation, a, b, e, and their
   reciprocals, the principal indices, ft, //, fi".        I  will suppose a, b, c, taken
   in descending, and consequently fi, fi', ii" in ascending order of magni
   tude *. For the arrangement of the Table, it will be convenient to specify
   the direction of the line seen in focus, and that of the normal to the plane
  of polarization of the image observed.              When these directions are dif
 ferent, the plane      of the  plate  is defined, being that containing them both.
    * In  the previous investigation for Iceland spar a was taken    for the ordinary 'wave-

394                      Prof. G. G. Stokes on the Foci of Lines                        [June 21,
     I proceed now to the case of a plate cut in any direction perpendicular
to one of the principal planes, to which                  I
                                             propose to limit myself, merely
observing  that the  leading features of the most  general case have already
been noticed.
  The principal plane perpendicular to the plate being a plane of optical
symmetry, the proper directions for the cross lines are parallel and per
pendicular to that plane.  Let the plane of symmetry be the plane of
xz, without necessarily implying thereby that the axis of y is that of mean
parameter, and let 0 be the inclination of the normal to the plate to the
axis of z. The section of the wave-surface, which     assume to be that ofI
Fresnel, by the principal plane being a circle and an ellipse, the formula
for the foci of a line perpendicular to the principal plane will be the same
as for a uniaxal crystal, inasmuch as the relation which, in the case of a
uniaxal crystal, subsists between the radius of the circle and one of the
semiaxes of the ellipse is not involved in the formulae. For light polarized
perpendicularly to the principal plane, then, the apparent index for a
line parallel to y is given by (2), while for the other pencil it is simply
b~\ or     /i'.
   To find the foci for     line lying in the plane of symmetry, we must
                                    a
have recourse to the wave-surface itself, and not merely to its principal
section.   We have to find the radius of curvature at any point in the
principal section for      normal section perpendicular to the principal
                                    a
plane.
     Let   P   be    a               section, PN the normal at
                         point in the principal                     Ma                      P,

  The extravagant changes of apparent index in the immediate neigh
bourhood of the wave- and ray-axes could probably not well be followed
by   the microscope, on account of the necessity of working with pencils of
finite angular aperture, which would make the phenomena of focusing
blend themselves with those of conical refraction.    But there can be little
doubt that     large increase or diminution of apparent index on approach

value of 0. Hence there must be four umbilici in each of these planes.

      If a plate be cut perpendicular       to the normal at one of these umbilici,
  one of the polarized pencils which it transmits will give the images of
  both systems of cross lines distinct together ; and the distinctness will
  not   be affected by     rotating the plate in its own plane while the cross lines
  are fixed.      In this respect it agrees with a plate of a uniaxal crystal cut
  in an arbitrary direction, with which it might easily be confounded. But
  if  the double refraction be strong enough to give a sensible lateral separa
  tion of the two oppositely polarized images, the two cases may be distin
  guished thereby in either of two ways : — First, if the images be compared
  with   a mark fixed to the focus      of the   eyepiece,  and the crystal be rotated
  in its own plane, while the object viewed through it/is fixed, in the case of
  a uniaxal crystal the image free from astigmatism will remain fixed, while
  any point of the other describes a small circle round its mean position,
  whereas in a plate of a biaxal crystal cut perpendicular to the normal at
 one of the umbilici above considered it is the reverse ; the image affected
 by astigmatism remains fixed, though its distinctness alters, while any
 point in the other describes a small circle about its mean position.
 Secondly, if the plane of separation of the two oppositely polarized images
 be noticed, in a uniaxal crystal the plane of polarization of the image
 which is free from astigmatism will be parallel to the plane of separa
 tion, while in a biaxal crystal cut as above supposed it will be perpendi
 cular to the plane of separation *.
     There are no umbilici in the circular sections of the wave-surface              made
 by the principal planes.         If we equate p' given by (7) to be the radius of
 curvature in the primary          plane, we get, in fact, cos20-r-sinJ 0=0, which
 cannot be satisfied.

had been supposed, from the observations of those who had specially exa
mined the question, that in biaxal crystals one of the rays obeyed the
ordinary law of refraction ; and Fresnel proved by two methods, both
requiring skill on the part of the optician who cut the crystals, that the
anticipation that his theory led him to entertain that that would not prove
to be the case was verified.           It is interesting to find that the extraor
dinary character of the refraction of both rays in a biaxal crystal admits
of being established by such a comparatively simple mode of observation
as that of Mr. Sorby.
    The theory of Fresnel is confessedly wanting in rigour ; and though
the observations of Huyghens, of Wollaston, and of Malus proved that
in Iceland spar Huyghens's construction, if not rigorously true, was at
least a very close approximation to the truth, it seemed desirable to put
it to a sharper observational test, more especially               as different  theories
might lead to Huyghens's construction as a near approximation.                      For
instance, in a paper read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in
1849,    I  obtained a formula* which led me to perceive that double refrac
tion would be simply accounted for by attributing it to a difference of
inertia in different directions, such as would be produced if a fluid had to
 make its way among a number of bodies on the average regularly
arranged, that arrangement being different in different directions, and
that the wave-velocity on this theory would be related to the direction of
the wave normal just as in the theory of Fresnel, with the exception that
the reciprocals of wave-velocities would take the place of the velocities
themselves.        I  refrained, however, from putting forward that theory
either in the memoir referred to or elsewhere (though               I have incidentally
alluded to it in my report on double refraction t), because, on calculating
the difference of refraction of the extraordinary ray on this theory and
according to Huyghens's construction, at about 45° from the axis, where
                                          I
the difference would be greatest, found it barely small enough, as seemed
 to me, to have escaped detection.            Still this theory, which has occurred
independently, in the same or a similar shape, to others +, led me to wish
for a more exact verification ; and in the report referred to                I have pro
posed a method which seemed to me well calculated to lead to the desired
result.     This method      I carried out some years later in the case of Iceland
 spar, though     I  did not publish the results ; and       I found that, to the limit
 of error of my observations (about 0-0001 in the index), Huyghens's con
 struction was fully confirmed, while the error of the other was nearly a
 hundred times as great as the limit of error of the observations §.                 The

accuracy of the Huyghenian law has also been confirmed by the elaborate
observations of M. Abria*.
    In the method of prismatic refraction employed by M. Abria and my
self, the difference between Huyghens's construction and the result of the
theory just referred to is greatest about 45° from the axis, while extremely
close to the axis, or to the equator, it would hardly be sensible.                Mr.
Sorby's method is remarkable for this, that it brings out into prominence
variations    of refraction   with change of direction,         though the absolute
refractions which are involved may be nearly the same. Thus Mr. Sorby
informs me that his method shows with perfect distinctness the two widely
different foci for a plate of Iceland spar cut perpendicular to the axis, even
though the inclination of the rays concerned to the axis is so small that,
when polarized light is used, which is extinguished by an analyzer, the
field remains dark after the interposition of the crystal.
    In the theory referred to above the extraordinary sheet of the wave-
surface is generated by the revolution of the curve which is the envelope
of straight lines whose distance,     v, from the    origin is connected with their
 inclination,  90°—   0, to the axis by the relation
                             t,-2=a-acosa0+c-asin20.
     The radius of curvature of this envelope at the axis is c~\2ac'—d*),
 and accordingly the apparent index, m, is given by
 which     exceeds  the apparent     index,              given by the     spheroid of

  1-9685 instead of 1-8505 for a plate parallel to the axis when the micro
  scope is focused on a line in the equatorial plane.           These differences are
 much too large to escape detection.

out the differential equation (between two parameters) of the lines of
curvature of the wave-surface, the discussion of which shows that there
are no umbilici oufrof the principal planes.          Hence the four directions

 " On   the Increase    in Resistance to the Passage of an Electric
      Current produced on certain Wires by Stretching." By Her

      King's College, London.            Communicated by Prof. W. G.

   The object of this iuquiry was (1) to determine the relation between
increased resistance to the passage of an electric current and stretching-
force ; (2) to ascertain how much of the increased resistance in each case
is produced by mere increase of length and diminution of section.
   In order to determine the increase of resistance from stretching, the
wires were each divided into two parts about 14 feet or more in length.
One end of each part was fastened to a stout hook, firmly fixed into a
block of wood, the two hooks used being about 8 inches apart, and the
block of wood in which they were fixed securely fastened across two
strong uprights, which were placed resting against the wall, so that the
weights attached to the wires might swing clear of the table on which
the uprights were placed. A loop was made at the other end of each part
                      * See Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxv.

402          Mr. H. Tomlinson         on the Increase in Resistance
of the wire, and to this the weights were attached by means of strong
hooks.     The two parts of the wire were joined at the top, about 2 inches
below each hook, by a piece of copper wire, which was securely soldered
on to each part of the wire, so as to connect them ; and toward the
lower extremities of the two parts, about 5 inches above the points of
attachment of the weights, two copper wires were soldered so as to con
nect the wires with a Wheatstone's bridge.         The increase of resistance
of the wires was measured by means of a sliding scale of platinum wire,
divided into millimetre divisions, each equal to -00166 ohm.             As the
object was to obtain the temporary and not the permanent increase of
resistance (which permanent increase was found more or less -with all
the wires), weights slightly heavier than those intended to be used were
first put on and taken off. Afterwards the wire was balanced as nearly
as possible by German-silver wire, without the sliding scale, and then
very exactly with the sliding scale, which was connected with one of two
resistance-coils of 100 ohms each, which formed the other two sides of
the bridge.     The weights used were then carefully put on to the wires,
and the increase of resistance measured by means of the sliding scale ;
the weights were next taken off again, and the sliding scale used for
balancing once more.        If  there was any slight difference, as sometimes
occurred, between the readings of the sliding scale before the weights
were put on and after they were taken off, the mean of the two readings
 was taken.
    In order to secure still greater accuracy, as many as eight or ten trials
 were frequently made with each particular weight, and the mean of all
 the trials taken.     This precaution was necessary, as there were continual
 small variations    from   slight changes of temperature in the air of the
 room.    These variations of temperature caused at first great trouble in
 the case of iron and steel wires, as the slightest difference of tempera
 ture was at once shown by the shifting of the light on the scale of the
 Thomson's reflecting galvanometer employed.          This instrument was so
 delicate that the warmth of the hand placed 6 inches from the wire
 caused a perceptible shifting of the light. It was, indeed, partly owing
 to this   difficulty that the observation of the permanent increase from
 stretching was not attempted.         I have, however, since devised a plan for
 getting rid of this alteration from changes of temperature, and       I hope to
 be able to make other experiments with wires in which the permanent as
 well  as the temporary increase of resistance will be observed.         Most of
 the observations of the steel and iron wires were made at first in the
 evening, with the doors and windows shut, as it was found almost im
 possible to take very exact observations in the daytime.
     The disposition of the wires is shown in the accompanying sketch. In
  order to avoid heating the wires by the current, a single Leclanche cell
  was employed, and an increase of resistance =j-c}nn,- of *he wbole could
 easily be measured.

weights.
   In the case of all the wires of different sections and materials, it was
found that the increase of resistance was exactly proportional to the
stretching-weight.    In order to show this the increased resistance per
lb. weight for the different weights employed is given in the following

   Though a smaller number of different weights were employed with the
other wires, the proportion of the increase of resistance to the stretch
ing-weight was quite      as exact as in the  case  of the three examples given,
never less     than three different   weights    being used, and each of these
tried several times.
   The increase of resistance which     a cubic centimetre       of   each  wire would
experience when stretched by a weight of             1   gramme      was then    calcu
lated, and also the resistance of a cubic centimetre of each wire in ohms
determined.       The former values will be denoted by h, and the latter by
the letter  s.
   The following Table gives the values of h,         s,  the section of each wire
in square inches, and its specific gravity : —

as could be expected     in the case of wires of the same material, but differ
for  wires of  different  materials, being greatest for brass.
   The value of Young's modulus for some of the wires was ascertained
in the usual manner with the cathetometer.             The wires were firmly
secured at the top of a staircase, and a mark placed about 3 feet above
the point of attachment of the weights at the bottom, so that the stretch
ing of about 21 feet of the wire could be observed and the increase of
length for different weights observed.         A mark was also made near the
top of the wire, in order to examine if there was any yielding of the
support to which the upper end of the wire was attached, and for some
of the wires a reading was taken both at the top and bottom marks ; but
as after several trials there was no apparent yielding, in the last experi
ments made the mark only at the bottom was observed.                    Weight*
heavier than those intended to be used were first put on and then taken
off again several times ; finally a weight was left on the wire sufficient to
keep it perfectly straight.     Then weights were carefully added, the in
crease of length observed with the cathetometer ; and the weights having
been taken off, another reading taken, and if there was any slight diffe
rence in the readings before adding the weight and after taking it off,
the mean of the two readings was taken.           The results agreed very fairly
with each other — how much so may be gathered from the following
example (two trials with each weight were taken)         : —

    The result may    be taken as a   fair average of the values obtained with
 the other wires.
    The value of Young's modulus was also ascertained by means of
 longitudinal vibrations of sound.          The two ends of the wire to be
 examined    were   securely soldered   into  two strong flat iron bars, one of
 the bars was fastened in a vice, firmly secured, whilst the other bar was
 held in the hand, and the wire pulled with sufficient force to enable a

clear note to be got out of the wire by rubbing it longitudinally with a
resined glove. The wire was then clipped in the centre and nibbed again
to test the security of the fastenings, as it was found that if the bar in
the vice was not well secured the note produced by clipping in the centre
was not the octave of the note given out by the unclipped wire, but if
the bar were well fastened a clear and perfect octave could be produced.
   The number of longitudinal vibrations was ascertained by means of the
siren, generally three or four trials of 3 minutes each being taken.               In
this work     I was assisted by Mr. Furse (the assistant to the Professor of
Natural Philosophy at King's College), to whom            I am much indebted for
help in my experiments.             The records of the siren were very good
indeed, in every case there never being a greater difference than                 per
cent., and in many cases less.             But on experimenting with different
lengths of the wires the values of the modulus would vary as much as
1 or 2 per cent.,    so that, though some of the values obtained are recorded,
I have    chosen the more reliable ones of the cathetometer for calculating
the increase of length of each wire when stretched.
   In the following Table the amount of lengthening which a cubic centi
metre of each wire experiences for a stretching-force of 1 gramme is

     It  would seem      that the increase per cent, of resistance for a given
lengthening of a wire is greater in iron than in steel, and much greater
in both iron and steel than in brass, but that the increase per cent, of
resistance per unit of stretching-force employed is greater in brass than
in iron, and greater in iron than in steel.
     The torsional rigidity of the wires was then ascertained, the vibrators
 used being      similar to those used by Sir William Thomson in his experi
 ments on the rigidity and viscosity of metals (Proc. of Roy. Soc., May
 1865), namely, thin cylinders of sheet brass, turned true outside and
 inside, supported by a thin, flat, rectangular bar.            The wire to be tested
 passed perpendicularly through a hole in the middle of the bar, and was
 there firmly soldered.        The cylinder was tied to the horizontal bar by
  light threads, so as to hang with its axis vertical ; the other end of the
 wire was securely soldered into a stout iron bar, firmly held in a vice
 attached to a rigid support.        Two experiments with different lengths of
  wire were made       with  each wire,   the result of each of the two experi
  ments agreeing very closely, as, for instance, we may take as an average
  example Steel No. 3, in which the torsional rigidities in grammes per
  square centimetre in the two trials were 783-5 X 106 and 782-2 x 106.
      If   we assume the wires to be isotropic, we can, from the values of e
  and the rigidity, which latter value will be denoted by r, obtain the ratio
  of lateral lineal contraction to longitudinal dilatation ; denoting this ratio
  by   <7, we shall obtain (Thomson and Tait's Nat.       Phil. p. 521)      —  1, and
                                                                        a=^
   therefore    easily deduce the increase of resistance that would follow in
   the case   of  each wire from mere increase of length and diminution of
   section, without considering any other alteration of resistance that
   would result from stretching.        Calling ds the increase of resistance that
   would result from mere increase of length and diminution of section,
   we can prove that

           Again subtracting from the values of                                            —   those of — we shall           obtain
      the residual alteration of resistance produced by the stretching-force.
         [Since making the above experiments       have found that Sir William             I
      Thomson has investigated the effects of strain on iron and copper, and
      states that he attempted to eliminate                                           the effects of elongation and nar
      rowing, and had very nearly established, for iron wire at least, that the
      augmented resistance due to tension,                                            either temporary or permanent, is
      a very little more than can be accounted for by tne change of form.

     in iron than in steel, and much greater in steel than in brass. In
     all probability      this residual                                increase       is   due to the increased distance

410      On Resistance to the Passage of an Electric Current. [Nov. 15,
 increase of resistance from stretching, when the weights were taken off
 the wire did not immediately attain the resistance which it ultimately
 settled at, but gradually recovered itself in about three minutes.
    This effect was very perceptible with the thicker wires, where heavy
 weights were employed.       I suppose the effect may, at any rate, be partly
 attributed to the heat which would be generated when the wire recovered
                           I
 its former volume ; but am not at all satisfied that the whole of the effect
 observed was due to this cause.
    The conclusions to be drawn from the experiments are : —
    1. That the temporary increase of resistance of a wire when stretched
 in the  same direction as the current is exactly proportional to the streteh-
ing-force.
    2.  That the increase per cent. of resistance when a cube of each mate
 rial is stretched by the same weight is greater in iron wire than in steel
 wire, and greater in brass wire than in iron wire ; also that this increase
is nearly the same for different specimens of the same material.
    3. That the increase per cent., when the material is stretched to the
 same extent, is much greater in iron and steel wires than in brass wire,
and is probably greater in iron wire than in steel wire.
    4. That there is a residual increase in each case, over and above that
which would follow from mere increase of length and diminution of sec
tion, that this residual increase is much greater in iron and steel than in
brass, and greater in iron than in steel.

                                                               is   a
culated plant, lacking the nodes and the longitudinal internodal canals so
characteristic of the Calamites.  It has large parenchymatous medulla
                                                  a
with radiating prolongations separating the very distinctly defined wedges
of the vascular zone. From the peculiar shape thus given to transverse
sections of the medulla the author has assigned to the plant the provisional
name of Astromyelon.      In the place of the canal of Calamites the thin
medullary extremity   of each  vascular wedge          is
                                                    occupied            by

and often more conspicuous vessels than those forming the rest of the
wedge. The medulla further differs from that of Calamites in being rarely
fistular. Each wedge consists of       series of regular radiating lamina of
                                         a
barred vessels separated       by
                             numerous    medullary rays — the latter varying
in composition from     solitary cell to numerous cells arranged in single
                         a
vertical series. Nearly all the stems and branches of this plant are
found to be decorticated. One specimen found by Mr. Butterworth                           is
surrounded by     very thin cortex consisting only of three or four layers
                  a
of parenchymatous cells. Astromyelon forms another example of the
                                                                        2o   2

numerous carboniferous     plants whose vascular zone grew by exogenous
additions,   yet the exclusion of every modification of tissue, except
barred vessels, from the vascular lamina) suggests Cryptogamic rather
than Gymnospermous affinities.
    Astromyelon is the only distinct type of plant left undescribed in the
lecturer's previous Memoirs ; but he has obtained a considerable amount
of additional information respecting some of those previously examined.
    Calamites. — A description is given of a series of specimens, beginning
 with very small twigs composed of parenchyma, which is only divided
into pith and bark by a ring of the internodal canals characteristic of
Calamites.     The medulla is continuous and not fistular.        Then follow
others in which very slight traces of vascular tissue are seen external to
each internodal canal, and which constitute the beginnings of a corre
sponding number of vascular wedges ; still higher in the series of sections
others are arrived at in which these vascular wedges are more fully deve
loped ; the medulla has become fistular and the cortical cells are differ
 entiated into a coarser tissue than the medullary one.          A Calamite of
 much larger dimensions is then described, in which the fistular me
 dulla is enclosed within a large vascular cylinder, the component radiating
 lamina) of which are fully two inches in length.         Sections of this ex
 ample show that the peculiar Calamitean features seen both in trans
 verse and tangential sections of all young specimens, and which feature*
 are also very distinctly seen at the inner portion of the vascular zone of
the specimen described, almost wholly disappear towards its periphery.
 The bark of this example has undergone marked development and differ
 entiation.   There is an inner zone of parenchyma, passing quickly into a
                                                                                "
 thick middle one of prismatic cells, identical with the " couche subereuse
 of M. Renault, or corky layer seen in Lepidodendrcm and Sigillarui. This
 has obviously not been the outermost       layer of the bark ; the specimen
 had been weather-worn.       A series of additional facts are given, illustra
 ting the nature of what the lecturer has previously termed the intranodal
 canals, and also the structure and arrangement of the branches given off
 from the nodes. He shows that the young branches do not exhibit all the
 peculiar Calamitean conformation until they have emerged from the vascular
 zone of the parent stem ; whilst older ones develop a thick vascular zone, like,
 and continuous with, that of the parent stem. Hence he concludes that
 the minute specimens already referred to in which the internodal canals
 exist, but have few or no vascular bundles associated with them, are pro
  bably not branches, but young plants developed directly from spores.
    The lecturer again points out the extreme improbability that two genera
  belonging to types so widely apart from each other as the Gymnosper
  mous Exogens     and the Cryptogamous -Equisetacenc should exhibit such
  minute organic resemblances as obviously exist between the supposititi-
  onsly separate genera Calamodendron and Calamites. Further it is to be
  remembered that, notwithstanding     the extreme abundance of the supposed

  1877.]            Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.                    413
 equisetiform Catamites in the shales of the Coal-measures, no one has yet
  discovered a single fragment retaining its internal organization that does
 not prove to be a so-called Calamodendron. He shows that the organization
 of the latter specimens explains the minutest details of the common
 impressions and casts found in the shales and sandstones of the Coal-
 measures ; and hence he continues to hold his previous opinion that the
 separation of the Carboniferous Calamites into two types is a fundamental
 error, and unsupported    by any  justifying facts.
     M. Grand'Eury having disputed the lecturer's conclusions respecting the
 structure of Asterophyllites, under the supposition that Sphenophylla have
 been mistaken for examples of that genus, an additional example is pub
 lished, demonstrating that the long linear leaves were uninerved, and that
 consequently the specimens could not possibly have been Sphenophylla,
 the essential characteristic of that genus being that it is multinerved.
     Lepidodendron and Sigillaria. — The lecturer notices the continued sepa
 ration of  these two genera by   M. Grand'Eury and      some other observers,
 and especially the unintentional misrepresentation by M. Grand'Eury of
 the facts which lead the lecturer to recognize a very close relationship
 between them.     The only distinction which is supposed to exist, even by
 the most earnest advocates,    for making Lepidodendron a Cryptogam and
 Sigillaria a flowering Gymnosperm, is the presence, in Sigillaria, of an
outer exogenous vascular zone, in addition to the inner non-exogenous
one seen in all the Lepidodendra.        M. Grand'Eury admits, in the most
definite language, that in all other features these groups of plants
possess   exactly the same organization.     The lecturer recalls attention to
the fact that in the Burntisland Lepidodendron, supposed to be L. Velthei-
mianum, the exogenous zone is absent from the young twigs, but is gra
dually developed in the twigs as they expand into branches ; hence,
according to the Brongniartian hypothesis, the plant is a Lepidodendron
in its young state, and a Sigillaria in its matured condition.     Additional
illustrations are given from the stems of Lepidodendron selaginoides, the
species in which the exogenous zone is the least developed of any of the
plants which possess such a zone, but which has no claim whatever, beyond
its possession of an exogenous cylinder, to       be regarded as a  Sigillaria.
The minute details of the structure of that        zone, though feebly repre
sented, exhibit, nevertheless,   every essential characteristic of the same
zone in Sigillarian stems.   These and other similar facts lead the lecturer
to adhere to his previous     conclusions, and to regard the Sigillaria as
Cryptogams, representing only the highest forms of the Lepidodendroid
type of vegetation — conclusions to which some more recent investigations
of the Arran fossils, to be published in a future memoir, give the clearest
support.
    A very remarkable series of Lepidodendroid spores have been dis
covered in the Halifax beds by Mr. Spencer and Mr. Binns. The most
abundant of these are microspores of the usual type associated with

414                       Prof. W. C. Williamson           on the            [Nov. 15,
numerous       macrospores of a new form.           These are round bodies with a
curious projecting organ           on  one  side surrounded     by a thickened ring of
the spore wall, reminding the observer of the projection, with its thickened
surrounding ring, seen at the apex of the macrospores of Isoetes lactutris.
These macrospores have their exteriors irregularly clothed with numer
ous long radiating hair-like fringes, some of which are simple, others
branched twice or three times, whilst in the interior of some of them,
the endospermic cells are beautifully               preserved.       Along with these
Messrs.      Binns and Spencer have discovered             a new     and very remark
able Lepidostrobiis.          Its almost spherical sporangia         contain numerous
 spores arranged in tetrasporal clusters, each cluster being imbedded
 in a larger group of mother and their sister cells, which are exqui
 sitely preserved.        Each united cluster of four spores is about -j-l^ of
an inch in diameter.            Whether these objects are a new and very large
 species   of  microspore    —   macrospores clustered in unusual numbers within
 the same sporangium — or whether they are merely mother cells from
 which at a later period clusters of microspores would be developed, is
 doubtful.      Some of these tetraspores enclose a number of minute cells.
     Along with the       above other smaller forms      of what appear to be macro
 spores have        been   found.      Their exterior is adorned with short trifid
 appendages, calling to memory the fossil Xanthidia of flint and the
 zygospores of some of the Desmidieas.               Some remarkable sporiferous (?)
 cavities imbedded in parenchyma significantly                    recall the imbedded
 sporangia     of  Ophioglossum       vulgatum,  whilst  a very   singular section of a
 rather large hollow spherical body, composed of a single layer of hour
 glass-shaped cells arranged vertically to its surface, and many of which
 cells are prolonged into external hairs, bears no inconsiderable resemblance
 to a section of a sporangiocarp of IsoiHes lacustri*.
     Ferns. — Two types of stem or petiole, not hitherto met with in York
  shire or Lancashire, have been found recently.                 One of these is from
  Oldham, whence it was obtained by Mr. Isaac Earnshaw.                    It is a petiole
  differing  so  little from    the  Chorionopteris Gleicha: of  Corda  that the lecturer
  has included it in his provisional genus liachiopteris as E. Gleichce.
     The affinities of the second plant are more doubtful. It is a cylindrical
  axis from Halifax, where it was found by Messrs. Spencer and Binns, to
  both of whom the lecturer is indebted for specimens of it. Its most con
  spicuous feature       is its very large central vascular bundle, which is a cy
  lindrical  mass    of barred    vessels.   The bundle is of much larger dimensions,
  proportionate to the size of the stem, than in any Fern or Lycopodiaeeous
  plant that has hitherto been found in the Coal-measures.                   It gives off
  branches almost at right angles to the main axis, and these are met with
  of all sizes, from -066 of an inch down to a mere speck. In some respects
  this plant has a Lycopodiaeeous aspect, especially in the size and appear
   ance  of its central bundle.        The bark, too, consists of an inner layer of deli
   cate parenchyma and an outer one of coarser cells. These two are Lepido

  1877.]             Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.                  415
 dendroid features. The provisional     name of Eachiopteris cylindrica is as
 signed to it.
    Two fragments have been met with that correspond very closely with
 some figured by M. Grand'Eury as belonging to Cordaites.        One of these
 is a fragment of epidermis densely crowded with stomata ; the other is
 part of the transverse section of a leaf exhibiting a single row of vascular
 bundles.
    The Arran beds have furnished a very striking fragment of wood to
 which the .lecturer gives the name of Lygiiwdendron anamalwm, and which
 appears to exhibit, in a most exaggerated form, the peculiarities of the
vascular axis of the Lyginodendron Oldhamium previously described. Its
remarkable characteristic is the enormous size of its medullary rays, which,
in tangential sections of the wood, have     a  lenticular shape — a contour
which causes the thin vascular lamina?,     when seen in such sections, to
form    a perfect network,  the large meshes of which are occupied by the
cells of the medullary rays.
    The Oldham nodules frequently     furnish fragments of the bark of some
large trees.     One of the most perfect of these is described, and consists
of an inner parenchyma, radiating into a very thick layer of prismatic
parenchyma, and an outer one of the more common type of parenchyma.
 Intermediate between these two latter is a very remarkable zone of meri-
stem tissue where active genetic action has obviously gone on during the
life of the plant. There thus appear to have been two parallel cylindrical
zones of active growth in this bark — one between the vascular cylinder
and the innermost bark, and the other between the prismatic tissue or
modified bast layer and the subepidermal parenchyma. At the junction of
the two latter tissues the tangential sections show that the prismatic cells
are grouped in undulating vertical laminoe, forming a network, the meshes
of which are occupied by tabular parenchymatous cells which stand on their
edges with their flat planes arranged tangentially to the stem. These
cells indicate an extremely active state of cell-multiplication. There is
every probability that this type of bark is Sigillarian.
    Some curious little circular disks, surrounded by a ring of seven or
eight yet smaller disks, are described : they are from Halifax.         Their
nature being problematical, the provisional name of Oidospora anomala is
assigned to them.      The lecturer concludes by calling attention to the
remarkable prevalence of prismatic parenchymatous cells in Catamites,
Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, and Asterophyllites, in the medullary rays of
Calamites, and especially in the middle bark of all these plants, where it
has constituted a modified form of phellem or corky tissue.

 " Remarks     on the Attributes of the Germinal Particles of Bacteria,
       in Reply to Prof. Tyndall."             By J. Bubdon Sanderson,
       M.D., LL.D., F.R.S. Received September 17, 1877.
    In a short paper communicated to the Royal Society at the close of
 last Session Prof. Tyndall did me the honour to criticize certain words
 reported to have been used by me at a meeting of the Association of
 Medical Officers of Health in January last. Although         I am much in
 debted to him for the opportunity he has thus afforded me of discussing
                                              I
 an important subject before this Society, cannot refrain from expressing
 my regret that he should have thought it desirable to quote at length,
 and thus to place on permanent record in the Society's Proceedings, the

1877.]              the Germinal     Particles of Bacteria.                    417
expressions used on the occasion above mentioned.           I  regret this because
these expressions occur in an abbreviated and incomplete abstract of a
hastily prepared discourse not intended for publication.
    As, however,    I  am well aware that Prof. Tyndall's purpose in his
communication was not to criticize the language, but the erroneous views
which the language appeared to him to contain,           I shall make no further
reference to the quotation, but shall regard it as the purpose of the pre
sent paper, first, to reply to the reasoning embodied in his last communi
cation, and, secondly, to corroborate certain statements previously made
by me, to which he has taken exception in the more extended memoir
published in the 166th volume of the 'Philosophical Transactions.'
    It will be my first object to enable the      Fellows of the Koyal Society
to judge how far the views      I  entertain differ from those which have been
enunciated here and elsewhere by Prof. Tyndall.               Biologists are much
indebted to    him  for the new   and  accurately observed facts with which he
has enlarged      the basis of our knowledge, as well as for the admirable
methods     of research with which he has made us acquainted.           As regards
the general bearing of these facts on the doctrine of Abiogenesis,        I imagine
 that we are entirely agreed. So far as         I  can make out, the difference
between us relates chiefly to two subjects, namely, the sense in which
                                         " and "
                                                                                   I
 have employed the words " germ                    structure," and the extent of
 the knowledge at present possessed by physiologists as to the structure
and attributes of the germinal particles of Bacteria.
    Although Dr. Tyndall, in the title of his paper, refers to my " views
 of ferment," yet as he makes no further allusion to them,           I will content
 myself with stating that in the passage quoted the first sentence (from
 the words " In defining       to the word " living ") has nothing to do with
                             "
 the following sentences, having been placed in the position which it
 occupies in the quotation by the abstractor.           The paragraph ought to
 begin with the words
                          " Ten years ago."
    Of the meaning which attached itself to the word " germ " in the days of
 Panspermism a correct idea may be formed from the following passage
 from M. Pasteur's well-known memoir " Sur les Corpuscules Organises
                                     " —"
 qui existent dans l'Atmosphore        :     There exist," says he, " in the air a
 variable number of corpuscles, of which the form and structure indicate
 that they are organized.        Their dimensions increase from extremely
 small diameters to one hundredth of a millim., 1-5 hundredth of a millim.,
 or even more.      Some are spherical, others ovoid.        They have more or
 less marked contours.        Many are translucent, but others are opaque,
 with granulations in their interior        ... I   do not think it possible to
 affirm of one of these corpuscles that it is a spore, still less that it is the
 spore of a particular species of microphyte, or of another that it is an
 egg or the egg    of a particular microzoon.     I  confine myself to the decla
 ration that the corpuscles are evidently organized ; that they resemble in
 every respect the germs of the lower organisms, and differ from each

such is the conception of a germ which was entertained by informed
persons up to 1870, and is very generally entertained up to the present
moment*.    It is obvious that these "corpuscules organises" were, if
they had any relation to the Bacteria, not germs in Dr. Tyndall's sense,
but "finished organisms;" and yet it was of these that M. Pasteur
                "
said that it was mathematically proved ." that they were the originators
of the organisms which are developed in albuminous                           liquids containing
sugar when exposed to the atmosphere.
  With reference to the word " structure "                          I
                                                 would point out that in
the passage quoted from my lecture it is distinctly stated that the
bacterial germ is endowed with structure in the molecular sense, but not
in the anatomical sense.   The meaning of the expression " anatomical
structure" was, naturally, not defined, considering that the persons
whom     Iwas addressing might be supposed to be familiar with it.    As,
however, my failing  to do so has apparently led to some   uncertainty as
to my meaning,     I
                   must, to avoid future misunderstandings, define more
completely the difference between the two senses in which the word was
used by me.
  The anatomical              of the word structure may be illustrated by
                           sense
referring to its synonyms, to the English words texture and tissue, to
the Greek word tariov, aud to the German word Gewebe, from which two
last the words in common use to designate the science of structure, viz.
histology and Gewebelehre, are made up.         What                    I

                                            no evidence   exists of their being

which     the existence     of  structure   is inferred   the following may be
mentioned     : — The protoplasm of   a Bhizopod    is admitted to have structure
because, although none can be seen in the protoplasm itself, the complicated
form of the calcareous shell which the protoplasm makes or models can be
seen.    By analogy, therefore, other organisms which are allied to the Ehizo
pod   are  inferred to have structure ; and from these, or from similar cases,
the inference is extended to all kinds of cells, with respect to which it is
taught by physiologists that although, in certain cases, no parts can be dis
tinguished, the living material of which they consist is nevertheless endowed
with structure or organization.       Similarly we assume that a Bacterium pos
sesses a more complicated structure        than we can actually observe, because
in other organisms which are allied to it by form and life history such
complications can be seen.         Again, in all embryonal organs we admit
the existence of structure before it can be seen, because in the course of
development we observe its gradual emergence. So far inference of the
existence of structure from historical evidence is justifiable ; but if we
were to carry this inference back to the ovum itself, and say that the
characteristic structures of nerve, of muscle, or of gland exist in the
ovum at the moment after impregnation,              every physiologist would feel
the assertion to be absurd.
    In  the familiar comparison of the origin of the elephant with that of the
mouse,    in which the perfect anatomical similarity of the ova in the two
 species is contrasted with the enormous difference of the result, we should
be justified    in saying that the difference of development is the expression
of structural difference between the primordium of the one and the primor-
dium of the other ; but inasmuch as it is not possible to indicate any
anatomical distinction, it is understood that structural difference of
 another kind is meant, namely, difference of molecular constitution.           In
 other words, we assume that the potential difference between the one
 and the other is dependent on an actual difference of molecular structure.
 "Whether this is accompanied with an .anatomical difference, such as we
 might expect to be able to see if we had more perfect instruments, we
 do not know.
    From the moment that it is understood that the word structure means
 anatomical      structure, the argument used by Dr. T3'ndall loses its
 relevance. After referring to the
                                        " germ-limit," he says, " Some of
                                                                             those

 velop into globular Bacteria, some into rod-shaped Bacteria, some into
 long flexile filaments, some into impetuously moving organisms, and some
 into organisms without motion.           One particle will emerge as a Bacillus
 anthracis, which produces deadly splenic fever; another will develop
 into a Bacterium the spores of which are not to be microscopically dis
 tinguished     from those of the former       organism ; and yet these undis-
 tinguishable spores are absolutely powerless to produce the disorder
 which Bacillus anthracis never fails to produce.        It is not to be imagined

 420              Dr.   J.  B. Sanderson on the Attribvtes of               [Nov.    22,
that particles which, on development, emerge in organisms so different
from each other, possess no structural differences.             But if they possess
 structural differences they must possess the thing differentiated, viz.
 structure itself."       Throughout this    passage   it is evident that it      is not
 anatomical but molecular structure that is referred to.
    In  the other passages which relate to the same subject,             I venture to
 think that Dr. Tyndall has overlooked the distinction made by me
 between anatomical organization and molecular structure.                  When, for
                           of "        structure
                                                 " in the                      from his
 example,    he  speaks         germ                       passage  quoted
 Liverpool Address, he evidently refers to molecular structure exclusively ;
for   he gives ice as his       first example, and argues that     as   ice  possesses
 structure so do      atmospheric germs — a proposition        which   I   should     not
have thought of questioning.
    The experimental evidence which we have before us goes to prove                  that
in all the known cases in which Bacteria appear to originate de                     now
(that is to    say, in liquids which are at the moment of their origin abso
lutely free from living Batteria), they really originate from "particles
great or small," which particles are therefore germs in the sense in which
that word is used by Prof. Tyndall.             To illustrate the views       I  myself
entertain, and always have entertained, on this question,          I need only refer
to my paper on the origin of Bacteria, published in 1871.                 The experi
ments made by me at that time brought to light the then new fact, now
become old by familiarity, that all exposed aqueous liquids, even when abso
lutely free from visible particles, and all moist surfaces, are contaminated
and exhibit a power of communicating their contamination to other liquids.
                                                            I
As regards water and aqueous liquids in general, insisted on the "par
          "
ticulate     nature of the contaminating agent, and coined for the purpose
the adjective      I have just employed (which has been since adopted by
other writers), at the same time pointing out that the particles in
question were ultra-microscopical, and consequently that their existence
was matter of inference as distinguished from direct observation.                    Dr.
Tyndall has demonstrated, by the experiments to which                I  have    already
alluded, that the ordinary air also contains germinal particles of ultra-
microscopical minuteness. Of the completeness and conclusiveness of those
experiments      I  have only to express the admiration which I, in common
with all others whose studies have brought them into relation with the
subject, entertain.        That such particles exist there can be no question ;
but of their size, structural attributes, or mode of development we
know nothing.
    Prof. Tyndall,     I am sure by inadvertence, has accused me of assuming
that   there  is some    relation   between the limit of microscopical visibility
and what he calls the molecular limit, by which             I presume to be meant
the size of the largest molecule.           Nothing that    I  have said or written
could justify such a supposition.          My contention is not that the particles
in question are of any size which can be specified, but, on the contrary,

1877.]                 the Germinal      Particles of Bacteria.                      421
that we are not in a position to form any conclusion as to their size,
excepting that they are so small as to.be beyond the reach of observation.
Dr. Tyndall has taught us, first, that the optical effects observed when a
beam of light passes through a particulate atmosphere are such as could
only be produced by light-scattering    particles of extreme minuteness ;
and, secondly, that by subsidence these particles disappear, and that the
contaminating property of the atmosphere disappears with them.        He
has thus approximately           determined for us the upper limit of magnitude,
but leaves us uncertain as to the lower          ; for we have no evidence that
the particles which render the atmosphere opalescent to the beam of the
electric lamp may not be many times larger than those which render it
germinative.   Consequently the fact that the air may be rendered sterile
by subsidence, while affording the most conclusive proof that germinal
matter is not gaseous, leaves us without information as to the size of the
particles of which        it consists.
  Of   each        germinal    particle, whether      inhabiting an aqueous liquid or
suspended in the atmosphere, it can              be     asserted that under conditions
which occur so frequently that they may be spoken of as general (viz.
moisture, a suitable temperature, and the presence of dead proteid matter,
otherwise called organic impurity) it produces an organism.     If, for the
sake of clearness, we call the particle            a and the organism       to which    it
gives rise A, then what is known about the matter amounts to no more
than this, that the existence of A was preceded by the existence of a.
With respect to A, we know, by direct observation, that it is an organic
structure      ;   but inasmuch    as we   know absolutely nothing        as to the size
and form of a, we cannot even state that it is transformed into A, much
less can we say anything as to the process of transformation.
  Considering that it is admitted on all hands that there exist in
ordinary air particles which are potentially germs, it might at first sight
appear needless to inquire whether or not this fact is to be regarded as
carrying with it the admission that they must necessarily possess the
other attributes of organized structure.   Very little consideration,
however, is requisite in order to become convinced that this question
stands in relation with another of fundamental importance in biology —
that, namely, of the molecular structure of living material *.    It is
not necessary for my present purpose to do more than to indicate the
nature of this relation.  As regards every form of living matter, it may be
stated that quite irrespectively of its morphological characteristics, which,
as we have seen, must be learnt by the application of the various methods of
visual observation at our disposal, it possesses molecular structure peculiar
to itself. We are certain of this because the chemical processes of which
life is made up are peculiar, that         is,
                                        such as occur only in connexion with

  living material.    Even the simplest instance that we can mention, that of
  the elevation of dead albumen into living (a process which in the case
 now before us must represent the very earliest step in the climax of
 development), is at the present moment beyond the reach of investigation ;
 for as yet we are only beginning to know something about the constitu
 tion of non-living proteids.          But this want of knowledge of the nature
 of the difference between living and non-living material in no wise im
 pairs the conviction which exists in our minds that the difference is one
 of molecular structure.
     The   sum of the preceding paragraphs may be stated in few words.
 Wherever those chemical processes go on which we collectively desig
 nate as life, we are in the habit of assuming the existence of ana
 tomical structure.          The two things, however, although concomitant,
 are not the same        ;  for  while anatomical structure cannot come into
 existence without the simultaneous or antecedent existence of the kind
 of molecular structure which is peculiar to living material, the proof is
 at present wanting that the vital molecular structure may not precede
 the anatomical.      At the same time it must be carefully borne in mind
 that there is no evidence of the contrary.            It is sufficient for my pur
 pose   to  have shown that the existence          of organized particles endowed
                                         "                   "
 with anatomical structure in the atmospheric dust has not been proved.
 I  do not dispute its probability.
     Before leaving this subject     I  may be permitted to add a word as to the
bearing of this discussion on a question which, to myself, is of special
interest — that of contagium vivwn.           According to the view which these
words are understood to express, the morbific material by which a con
tagious disease is communicated from a diseased to a healthy person
consists of minute organisms called " Disease-Germs."                 In order that
any particle may be rightly termed a Disease-Germ two things must be
proved concerning it, viz. : — first, that it is a living organism ; secondly,
that if it finds its way into the body of a healthy human being, or of an
animal, it will produce the disease of which it is the germ. Now there is
only one disease affecting the higher animals in respect of which any
thing of this kind has been proved, and that is splenic fever of cattle.
In other words, there is but one case in which the existence of a disease-
germ has been established.
     Comparing such a germ with the germinal particles we have been dis
cussing, we see that there is but little analogy between tliem : for, first, the
latter are not known         to be organized ; secondly, they have no power of
producing     disease  ;   for it has been found by experiment that ordinary
Bacteria, may be introduced       into the circulating blood of healthy animals in
considerable quantities without producing any disturbance of health.            So
long as we ourselves are healthy, we have no reason to apprehend any
danger from the morbific action of atmospheric dust, except in so far as

it can     be shown to have derived infectiveness from some                   particular source
of miasma or contagium.
     I now
         proceed to the second part of my communication, which relates
to Prof. Tyndall's serious, but most courteously expressed, criticisms of
my experiments on spontaneous generation*.
  The fact that Dr. Tyndall blames me for incautiously vouching for                            is,
" that in boiled and hermetically
                                sealed flasks Bacteria sometimes appear
in swarms."     From multiplied experiments he concludes that this
is   not     true,    and infers that       I   who vouched for          it   was incautious.
The paper referred to was one in which     as  bystander, gave an ac

count of certain experiments which Dr. Bastian performed in my pre
sence.  So far as relates to the fact above quoted, these experiments
were, to my mind, absolutely conclusive   but inasmuch as

which   tested the influence of two new conditions, viz. of prolonged ex
posure to the temperature of ebullition, and of exposure for short periods
to temperatures above that of ebullition at ordinary pressure.         The
experiments accordingly   consisted of two series, in the first of which a
number of retorts or flasks charged with the turnip-cheese liquid        e.                 (»'.
with neutralized infusion of turnip of the specific gravity 1017, to which
a pinch of pounded cheese had been added), and sealed hermetically while
boiling, were, after they had been so prepared, subjected to the tempe
rature of ebullition for longer or shorter periods. In the second series
the period of ebullition was the same in all cases, but the temperature
was varied by varying the pressure at which ebullition took place.
   The conclusion arrived at, as expressed in the final paragraph of the
paper, was, that in the case of the turnip-cheese       liquid the prone-

certain liquids can be boiled for ten minutes without being sterilized,
and, secondly, to determine the influence of prolonged periods of ex
posure.   The flasks employed were charged with the neutral turnip-
cheese  liquid, and sealed while boiling in the way already described.
Some were subjected to the temperature of ebullition for ten minutes,
the rest for an hour, the result being that whereas those heated for the
longer periods remained without exception barren, an                           exposure of only
ten minutes was followed, in the majority of cases, by                         an abundant de

Strnsburg.          The results were essentially the              same+.
      During the next year the second question which    had attempted toI
solve, viz. the influence of temperatures above 100° C, was taken up with
much greater completeness by Prof. Gscheidlen, of Breslau§.       After a
resume of the proofs already given                     byhis predecessors, that certain fluids
are not sterilized            by boiling,         and, secondly, that as means of sterilizing

temperature may be regarded as complementary to each other, he proceeds
to relate his own researches, the purpose of which was rather to fill up
defects in the evidence than to establish new conclusions.
     The flasks employed were capable of containing 100 cub. centhns.
 (3^ oz.); they wore charged in the usual way with the turnip-cheese
liquid, and exposed for short periods in chloride of calcium baths,
of which the temperatures were carefully adjusted so as to obtain the
requisite temperatures.          It was thereby definitely proved that whereas
the germinal matter of Bacteria can stand a temperature of 100° for five
or ten minutes it is destroyed by temperatures varying from 105° to
110°*
     In an appendix to my first paper, published in ' Nature in the autumn
                                                                           '

of 1873, showed that the solutions of diffusible proteids and carbo
hydrates employed by Prof. Huizinga, of Groningen, in the first of
the valuable series of experiments t published by him, relating to the
subject of spontaneous generation, require a temperature above that of
ebullition under ordinary pressure to sterilize them. This observation
has since been established by Prof. Huizinga himself on the basis of very
 carefully made experiments         J,   by which he has proved at the same time

rohre wiihreud der narulicben Zeit {he. cit. p. 167). Here the author clearly fails to
muko the necessary distinction between Bacteria (which, as is well known, lose their
vitality at a much lower temperature) and the material out of which they spring.
The mixtures referred to were cither the cheese and turnip liquid or solutions con
taining peptones and grape-sugar, to bo immediately referred to. As affording an elegant
demonstration that in the turnip-cheese liquid it is the cheese and not any other con
stituent which contains the resistant element, the following form of experiment is
worthy of notice :— A tube, A, drawn out and closed at both ends, is fused into the open
mouth of a second tube, B, of which the opposite end is drawn out and closed in a
similar manner.     In this way a compound tubo is formed which is divided by a coni
cal septum into two chambers, A and B. A small knob of glass having been previously
introduced into the chamber B, the septum can be easily broken by shaking the tube.
With tubes so prepared two experiments are made. In Experiment 1, compartment
A is charged with infusion of cheese, sealed, and then exposed to a temperature of
110° before it is united to the compartment B.           In like manner B is charged with
neutral decoction of turnip, so that when the compound tube is complete it contains
cheese in one compartment, turnip in the other.         If, after boiling for ten minutes, it
is placed in the warm chamber its contents remain barren.              In Experiment 2 the
experiment is varied by simply omitting the preliminary heating of A.         The compound
tube is boiled as before, but now its contents promptly give evidence that the condi
tions are present for an abundant development of Bacteria.

that the liquids in question are rendered completely incapable of pro
ducing Bacteria, without extrinsic contamination, by exposing them to
higher temperature.          The only points of difference between us, either as
regards method or result, are, first, that the sterilization limit (" Grenas
zur Bacterienerzeugung")          fixed by me was too low, the true limit being
1 10° C. ; and, secondly, that the experiments from which                 I bad inferred
that the liquids in question had been sterilized at lower temperature^
than this were, in Prof. Huizinga's opinion, rendered inconclusive by toe
fact that my flasks were sealed hermetically, whereas in his exchange of
air was allowed to take place, during the period of incubation, through i
septum of porous porcelain.              To this last objection       I  might perhaps
have thought it my duty to answer, had it not been shown by the sub
 sequent researches of Gscheidlen to have no bearing on- the question at
issue.     As regards the limit of sterilization,        I can  entertain no doubt      as
to the accuracy of Huizinga's measurements, and am                      quite willing U
accept 108° C. as the lowest temperature which could be                 safely employed
under the conditions laid down by him.
    It will be understood that in bringing these facts before                 the Society
my only purpose is to show, as           I        I
                                           trust have done conclusively, that          the
 statements which Dr. Tyndall in 1876 characterized as incautious,                     and
 which    he   virtually invited     me to retract,      had been     two years    before

Address to record the losses by death of eminent Fellows of this Society
which have taken place since the last Anniversary. Though, happily, these
losses are not so numerous as they have been in late years, the number
amounts to twenty-three, and the list includes the names of men of great

lasting obligations for his active interest in its welfare during upwards of a
quarter of a century.          I
                          Need name Mr. Gassiot, the founder of the Scien
tific Belief Fund, the munificent subsidizer of the Kew Observatory, and
the ever-ready and liberal promoter of scientific investigation — Mr. Foi
Talbot, the discoverer of photogenic drawing (the Talbotype process),
proved to be the fruitful parent of photography — Sir Henry James, under
whose administration the operations of the Ordnance Survey of Great
Britain were greatly extended, and its resources utilized in various ways,
especially through the application of scientific processes all tending to the
advancement or diffusion of knowledge — Mr. Bobert Were Fox, eminent
for his researches on the temperature and the magnetic and electrical con
dition of the interior of the earth, especially in connexion with the for
mation of metallic veins, and who was, further, the inventor of some and
 improver of other instruments now everywhere employed in ascertaining
 the properties of terrestrial magnetism ?       In Sir William Fergusson we
have lost a surgeon of rare ability and manual dexterity and an operator
of great repute ; in Mr. David Forbes an accomplished traveller, chemist,
and mineralogist ; and in Dr. Bowerbank a naturalist of the old school,
whose enthusiasm and genial encouragement kindled into a flame the
scientific spark that lurked in the breast of many an amateur. There
have further been removed by death from the list of Foreign Fellows two
recipients of the Copley Medal, the venerable Von Baer and the compa
ratively young Le Verrier, together with a traveller and physicist of rare
attainments, Erman, the narrative of whose travels is one of the richest
 storehouses of scientific information that has hitherto been given to the
 world in the narrative form.
     Finance. — As heretofore,  I  must refer to our Treasurer's    Beport   for
 evidence of the satisfactory condition of the Society's finances.      Not but
 that this is a matter that requires  constant  vigilance, as the demands upon
 our pecuniary resources annually enlarge, owing mainly to the rapid
  increment of matter brought before us and found worthy of publication in
 our Transact ions and Proceedings, and, above all, to the number of expensive
 illustrations which accompany many of them. This, and the prospect of
 the results of the Government      Fund for the encouragement of research
 being kid before the Society for publication, appeared to me to render it
 desirable that a Committee should be appointed to inquire into and report
 upon the receipts and expenditure of the Society, and that the subject of
 the outlay on printing and paper should be referred to the Library Com
 mittee for report, together with that of the compilation of the Catalogue
 of Scientific Papers, the labour and expense of which were likely to in
 crease with that enormous development of scientific literature which cha
  racterizes this century.

will enable us, we hope, to effect an important saving in our annual
charge for printing. It is thought, moreover, that the compilation of the
Catalogue of Scientific Papers, which, though no part of our ordinary
work, had been voluntarily undertaken and paid for by the Society, and
diligently conducted under the supervision of your officers, should not
be allowed to press unduly upon our resources,          and that the time had
come when application       should   be made                   Fund for aid
                                               to the Government
to enable us to meet      the increasing demands on our income for the work
of the Catalogue.
   And further, as bearing on the question of finauce, your Council have
resolved that the difference between the amount of Life composition
payable by newly-elected Fellows who have and those who have not pre
viously to election contributed a paper to the Transactions should cease,
and that a part of the funded property of the Society should be invested
in secure Stocks yielding a larger interest than the Government funds.
   Presents.   — It is always with peculiar pleasure that     I    announce the
presentation of good portraits of scientific worthies. Two in oils,
received during the vacation, are now hung on our walls : one of Sir
John Herschel, a very faithful likeness, presented by our Fellow, Mr.
John Evans ; the other, presented by our late Secretary, Dr. Sharpey,
is that of Haller, the physiologist, anatomist, botanist, and poet, whose
genius and labours were the admiration of his contemporaries, as they
have been ever since of his successors.  It is not without pride that our
countrymen can record the facts that an English sovereign, George II.,
was the first who recognized the merit of llaller, the Swiss, by bestowing
on him his earliest preferment, a professorship in Gottingen, and ever
after showing him every mark of respect, and that, on a subsequent occa
sion, an English University, Oxford, offered him a professorship.   The
portrait is an excellent one, in perfect preservation, and forms a most
valuable addition to our gallery.
  I   have also to inform you that a sum of ,£500 has been contributed
anonymously by five Fellows to the Society's funds for general purposes,
and that our Foreign Secretary has proposed that his office should, as long
as he holds    it,
               be regarded as an honorary one, with charge of the Society's
foreign correspondence.    This very liberal proposal was accepted       by
                                                                        the

the Fellows admitted since 1812 down to 1876.          These, with other docu

dates  of birth and death, of every person admitted into the Society since it s
origin, and hence, to a great extent, supplies valuable data for determin
ing the vitality of scientific men at different periods. In his letter
accompanying these very valuable documents Dr. Farr observes that the
records of the Royal Society were allowed for years to remain defective
as to particulars which were formerly accurately recorded, and that
Halley and others seemed to have been alive to the importance of such
facts relating to the scientific men of their age.    In future, the date and
place of birth of Fellows will be registered regularly and accurately, in
accordance with Dr. Farr's excellent suggestion, for which, as for the
documents, a unanimous vote of thanks was returned by your President
and Council.
   The Catalogue of Scientific Papers. — In my last year's Address            I
informed you that the Lords of the Treasury had granted the funds neces
sary for printing the decade 1864-73 of the Catalogue of Scientific
Papers   ; and  I have now    to announce that the first (the seventh of the
series) of the two volumes of which it will consist is published.            It
contains more than a thousand pages.       The expediency of the Society's fur
ther undertaking the compilation of an " Index of Subjects having been
                                                                "
urged upon the Library Committee, was carefully considered by them. To
this end the members were supplied with printed specimens of a well-
considered plan adapted to the decade 1864-73, with the request that
they would favour the Council with their opinion upon it; when it
appeared that, owing to the number of subjects often comprised in one
paper, and the differences of opinion as to which of these were worthy of
citation, and under what name, the task would be one of prodigious
labour and unsatisfactory result, and far beyond the Society's means.
The printing of the eighth volume is steadily progressing, together with
the compilation of the decade for 1874-83.
   Hie Meteorological Council. — The Report of the Treasury Committee of
Inquiry into the working of the late Meteorological Office was published

the members of which had served on the Treasury Committee) ; and1 the
recommendations of the two bodies are almost identical.          As a member
of the former, and cognizant of the views of the Government as to the
future of the Office,    I may state that those views were from the first, and
throughout,    favourable   to giving a more scientific character to the work
than it had hitherto possessed, recognizing the principle, that its aim
 and endeavour should be to advance meteorology as a science, while
directing and controlling all such practical operations as were required

for the public serviee.  The main difference between the recommen
dations of the Treasury Committee and our own is that we favoured
the retention of the Office under a department of the Crown, with
a Government officer as Director, in preference to leaving it subject
to a Committee or Council of Control.      The Treasury Committee,
influenced by the evidence of very eminent scientific men to this effect,
that meteorology was not as yet in a scientific condition, and that to
render it so required the combined labours of men with various attain
ments, as also by the fact that there was no department of Government
capable of controlling purely scientific investigations, recommended that,
as a tentative   measure, a modified Committee of Control (to be called a
Council) should replace the old Committee, and that the Royal Society
should be asked to nominate the members, and, after a period of five years,
to review their labours.
   Other recommendations, in which both Committees concurred, were,
that ocean meteorology should be transferred to the Admiralty, that the
maxims which determine the issue of storm-warnings should be put in a
clear shape and issued to the public, that the number and position of
both the continuously-recording  and the eye-observing stations should be
revised, that the latter should be increased so as to satisfy the claims of
the Registrars-General, Medical Council, Agricultural Societies, and other
bodies, and that a fair approximation to the meteorological condition of
the whole British Isles should be daily obtained and published.
  Far more important      to us, however, than these practical measures, is
the strong expression    of opinion on the part of both Committees that
scientific hypothesis and discussion should be pursued as a duty incumbent
on the Office, and that, to this end, an annual grant should be made for
the purpose of remunerating investigators, selected by the Council, on a
scale proportionate to the work performed.
   At the request of II.M. Treasury, and in communication with them,
your Council drew up the following suggestions for the administration of
the Meteorological Office, which, having been approved, are now put in
practice : — That the Office be in future administered by a paid Council,
consisting of a Chairman and four effective members, together with, as
an ex officio member, the llydrographer of the Navy, whose services were
rendered necessary by the Admiralty having declined to undertake the
ocean meteorology ; that £1000 should be granted for the remuneration
of the Members of Council, who should be persons in a position to
devote adequate time and attention to the duties of the Office, and
to the inauguration of investigations and experiments designed to place
meteorology on a scientific basis, to advance
                                              it,
                                              and to promote its useful
ness to the community; that paid inspectors of stations should bo
appointed for Scotland and Ireland, and £500 be granted for this pur
pose;   that a sum of £1000 per annum be granted for the payment of
individuals, to be selected  by
                             the Council, to be engaged in special scien_

432                         Anniversary  Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
tific researches ; and that £1500 be granted for new land-stations, and
£500 for the extension of telegraphy to Sundays.         The result of these
new measures will be to raise the annual grant for the Meteorological Office
from £10,000 to £14,500.
    Your Council having further been requested to nominate the effective
members of the Meteorological Council for the approval of the Lords of
 the Treasury, proceeded to do so in accordance with the spirit of the
resolutions which gave scientific research so prominent a position — keep
 ing in view, at the same time, the necessity of obtaining the services of
 as many members of the old Committee as possible, their knowledge of
 the details of the Office being at first indispensable, and their efficiency
already proved.       The result has been the appointment of Mr. Henry
 Smith, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, as Chairman, and your
 Senior Secretary, Mr.    F. Galton, Mr. De La Rue, and General Strachey
 as the other members.      The services of Mr. Scott, who has so long and
 so  ably directed the practical operations of the Office, and of Mr.
 Toynbee, whose labours in ocean meteorology are so well known to you,
 and of the other officers being all retained, nothing would seem to be
wanting, in men or money, to develop the science of meteorology, and
to supply the public with data for all the useful purposes contemplated
 in the establishment of the Meteorological Office. It is to be hoped that
the tentative measure thus inaugurated will lead, in five years, to the con
 stitution of a national Meteorological Office under the undivided control
 of a man of high scientific attainments.
    Government   Fund of £4000 per Annum for Five Years. — The constitu
 tion of the Committee for the administration of this fund, under the
 authority of the Lord President of the Council, has been provisionally
 settled, and as much of the first year's grant as was available for the last
 quarter of the financial year March 31, 187(5, to April 1, 1877, was
 allotted in March last.
    The first meeting of the Committee took place on January 11th, when
 it was resolved : — that four subcommittees should be constituted — namely,
 (A) Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy, (B) Biology, (C) Chemistry,
 (D) General Purposes ; and that all applications for grants should be
 addressed to the Secretaries of the Society, and referred by them to
 one of the first three subcommittees for examination and report and
 recommendation     ; that the subcommittees' reports and recommendations
 should be printed and circulated among the members of the General
 Committee not less than one week before the meeting at which the
 grants would be discussed ; and that the grants applied for should be
 limited   to sums required for a period not exceeding twelve months.
It was further resolved that a report of progress should be required
of the recipient at the end of the year in which the grant was made,
and     that  instruments    of  permanent    value purchased    out  of  the

Fund, or supplied by the Government on the recommendation of the
Royal      Society, should     be  regarded   as the   property   of the Govern
ment.
     The Committee meetings are fixed for February in each year ; those of
the subcommittees will take place whenever summoned by the Secretaries
of the Society ; and notice has been given that applications for grants are
to be sent to the Secretaries of the Royal Society not later than December
31st in any year.
     At the meeting of the General Committee in March last the subcom
mittees reported that 102 applications had been received, and that the
amount applied for was £14,4o9.               Of the 102 applications 33 were
approved,     and  sums  of  .£300  and under   (the total being £2220 Is. Gd. for
instruments,     assistance, and materials, and £1810 for personal remune
ration)    were  granted.
     The results of this step towards the endowment of research will, hope, I
be narrowly watched, in the interests both of science and of this Society,
which,     in undertaking      to administer for the Government a sum so
largely    devoted   to  personal   remuneration, has assumed a very onerous
responsibility, and largely increased the burthen of your Secretaries.
     Reports of Naturalists sent by the Society to Rodriguez and Kerguelen
Island. — These are being printed uniformly with our Transactions, under
the editorship of Dr. Giinther and your President.             They will consist of
a   series  of  papers, illustrated  with  plates,  on all branches of the natural
history of the islands, contributed by the naturalists themselves and
various coadjutors, whose services are gratuitous.            The cost of printing
will be defrayed by the liberality of your Treasurer, and some of the
plates have been presented by the contributors.
     The Polar Expedition. — The scientific results of the Polar Expedition,
and especially the biological, appear to me to have, in most departments,
quite come up to our expectations ; and considering that but one season
was available for collecting and observing (and we all know how short
that is in the arctic regions), they are indeed most creditable to the gen
tlemen who contributed them.           Geology has proved by far the most pro
lific field of research. Perhaps Botany comes next, and this, and the insects
which have been worked up by Mr. M'Lachlan, prove that, between 80°
and 83° N., in Grinnell Land, the conditions for the existence of these
organisms are far more favourable than are those of lands a long way to
the southward.
    The floras of the series of channels between 80° and 83° N., the shores
of which have been botanized by the officers of the Polar Expedition, have
yielded upwards of 70 flowering plants and ferns, which is a much greater
number than has been obtained from a similar area among the polar
islands to the south-westward, and is unexpectedly large.            All are from

a much higher latitude than has elsewhere been explored botanicahV,         ex
cept the islets off the extreme north of Spitzbergen.    The species are, with
two exceptions, all Greenlandic.       The exceptions are Androsace septen-
trionalis, which, though found in the northern regions of all the continents,
has never elsewhere been seen north of lat. 72°, and Pedicularis capitata.
an American and North- Asiatic species, not hitherto recorded north of
the same parallel.
    Spitzbergen, stretching from latitude 76° 30' to 80° N., quite to the
 south of the positions here referred to, has contributed not more than
100 flowering plants and ferns, notwithstanding        that its west coast is
washed by the Gulf-stream, and that its shores have been diligently
explored by many trained collectors.        Fifteen of the plants collected by
the Expedition have not been found anywhere in Spitzbergen.         Compared
with Melville Island, in lat. 75° N., and Port Kennedy, in 72° N., the
 contrast is even more striking, these well-hunted spots, both so much
further south, yielding only 67 and 52 species respectively.
    This extension of the Greenland flora to so very high a latitude can
 only be accounted for by the influence of warm currents of air, or of the
air being warmed by oceanic currents, durino; some period of the summer:
 and   I look  with great interest to the meteorological observations     made
 during the voyage, which are being discussed by Sir George Nares, who
 hopes to have them completed in a couple of months. The observations on
 the temperature of sea-water will, he expects, give new information ; and
 the study of certain warm gales and warm currents that were observed in
 lat. 82° and 83°   X. can hardly fail to increase our knowledge of the   local
 climate.
    May not these phenomena of vegetation and temperature indicate the
 existence of large tracts of land clothed with vegetation in the interior
 of Greenland, far within the mountain-ranges of its ice-clad coast, and
  protected by these from the heavier snowfalls and from the accumu
 lation of glacial ice which borders that island on all sides ?
     The fossil plants collected have been examined and reported upon by
  Professor Heer.     Of these the most important are the Miocene. They
  consist of 25 identifiable species, of which 18 are known Arctic Miocene
  fossils. All but one had been previously found in Spitzbergen.     The most
 interesting of them is the Conifer, assumed to be identical with the
  existing American
                       " Bald Cypress," Taxodium distichum, a plant which is
  now confined to Eastern North America, from lat. 39° southwards, and to
  which specimens found in the Miocenes of France, Italy, Prussia, Green
 land, and N.W. America have also been referred.
     Professor Heer further thinks that he has identified the remains of a
  Spruce with the European and Asiatic Norway Spruce (Abu* f-vceha\
  which occurs as a fossil only in Postpliocene beds.         Its existence in
  the Miocene period only in such a high latitude would indicate that it is
  a polar form which has migrated southward in more recent times.

     This tracking of the Miocene flora so far to the northward was one of
the principal scientific objects to be accomplished by the Polar Expedition ;
and the fact that the character thereof continues to be neither polar
nor arctic, but temperate, supports the hypothesis that during the era in
question a vegetation analogous to that now prevailing in the temperate
latitudes entirely covered the north-polar area of the globe.
     Other branches of Geology have yielded very valuable results in the
hands of Mr. Etheridge, who has worked up the very large number of
Palaeozoic fossils collected especially by Capt. Feilden. These, with the
Carboniferous,       Miocene, and Postpliocene     fossils, animal and vegetable,
and the abundant rock specimens, have thrown more light on the former
condition of the circumpolar regions than perhaps all the collections of
previous expeditions.
     Capt. Evans has been so gdod as to supply me with the results
of the magnetical observations made during the voyage, which were in
general accordance with those of the American expeditions to Smith's
 Sound.      Nearly continuous hourly observations of the Differential Decli
nation Magnetometer were taken throughout the winter from October to
 April. "With an inclination of nearly 85°, and a horizontal force of P13,
 the westerly declination disturbance occurred usually between 9 a.m. and
 5 p.m., the easterly between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m., the arc ranging through
 8°.    The greatest range (Feb. 19, 1876) reached 5° 48' ; the lowest
 (July   12, 1876) was scarcely 7'.       Compared with the results of previous
 expeditions, we find that, at Eensselaer Harbour, with horizontal force
 of 1*14 and inclination nearly 86°, the ranges were respectively 4° 52' and
 1° 1' ; while at Port Bowen, with horizontal force 0° 46' and inclination
 88°, they were 11° 56' and 0° 35' respectively.          The mean daily range of
 declination     was 86°-8, and mean declination 101° 42' TV.
     The observers were on the alert to observe any signs of connexion
 between the auroral displays and declination-disturbances,             but to no
 purpose   ;   for, as with   Parry   in Port  Bowen,    and  Kane  in Eensselaer
 Harbour, no evidence was discoverable.              On the other hand, various
 previous voyagers have registered a marked connexion, as at Port Ken
 nedy by Maguire, at Point Barrow by M'Clintock, and in the Spits
 bergen seas by Weyprecht.           Considering that there can be no doubt as
 to the trustworthiness        of all these observers, a decisive solution of the
  question   is greatly  to  be desired.
     Sir William Thomson and Prof. Everett have examined the few obser
  vations made for the amount of atmospheric electricity, with the result of
  finding that they confirm the observations of former explorers.
     Sir George Kares     has obligingly   sent me a resume of some of the prin
  cipal  meteorological     results, and their comparison with those taken at

    Minimum temperature of earth 20 inches beneath surface, — 13°-0.
    The warmer temperature at Floeberg Beach was due to its exposure to
 the warn) winter gales, from which Discovery Bay was cut off. The still
 warmer temperature of Polaris Bay is partly attributable to there being
 some uncovered water in the neighbourhood.
    The barometer indicated and foretold changes in the weather as in tem
 perate regions.
    Making due allowance for unavoidable sources of error, the temperatures
 of the sea observed on the west shores of Smith's Sound prove the existence
 of a stratum of cold outer water (temperature about 29°) lying between the
 locally heated surface-water and a depth of twenty to thirty fathoms, flow
ing southward in summer, as also of an underlying stratum with a tem
perature of about 30°.       This latter was not found near Floeberg Beach ;
but, coupled with the 1872 observations of the ' Polaris,' which showed a
temperature of 32°-8 at 203 fathoms in lat. 80° 44' N. (midway between
Franklin and Hals Islands, in Robison Channel), and 32°-l at 17 fathoms
in Polaris Bay, it would appear that the warm underlying water forces
itself to the northward on the east side of Robison Channel. Its entrance
into the polar sea or not will depend on the depth of water at the north
end of the channel.       They also prove the non-existence of a lower tem
perature of the water than 2S°-8 at a depth below 275 fathoms in Smith's
Sound or Baffin's Bay.         The coldest portion of the arctic water appears
not to affect Hayes Sound or Discovery Bay to so great an extent as that
of the direct channel.
    The Re v. Dr. Haughton, to whom the tidal observations of the
                             '
'Discovery' and 'Alert were entrusted, informs me that he has com
pleted the preliminary discussion of the whole, and hopes to present the

He remarks that the Discovery was better provided for observations
            '
than the Alert,' and, fortunately, her position was better also, as she lay
nearer the head of the tide at Cape Payer.             The officer charged with the
observations, Lieut. Archer, made them hourly for seven months, with only
                                                                '

hourly observations for two months only, with fifteen days of interpo

    Dr. Haughton      has already arrived      at the following general conclu
sions : — 1. The tide which      comes down Smith's Sound from the north is
generically distinct from the Behring's Straits tide and from the Baffin's
Bay tide. 2. It must therefore be the East-Greenland Atlantic tide ;

the Lords of the Treasury, after advising with your Council, have appro
priated the munificent sum of £25,000 for publishing the biological
results of the voyage in a style and with a completeness worthy of the
Expedition and the nation. Adopting a course as wise as it is liberal, Sir
Wyville Thomson has, with the approval of your Council and the Govern
ment, chosen for his collaborators the ablest specialists, irrespective of
their nationality.           It is creditable to our country that, with but few
exceptions, it has supplied thoroughly competent and willing workers in
most of the departments ; and association with such foreign naturalists
as Agassiz and Haeckel cannot fail to be gratifying to themselves and
assuring to the public.            I had the advantage of inspecting the Echino-
dermata in Professor Agassiz's charge in the Peabody Museum at Harvard
 College, and of learning the progress he had made in the examination of
the vast body of materials entrusted to him.               These, he informed me, far
surpassed    Sir  Wyville's       estimate    in number  of species and of interesting
and novel forms       ;   and   I  was surprised to find that the whole had already
 been sorted, that       the    greater part was named and ready for return to
 Edinburgh, and that nearly a dozen exquisite lithographic plates of new
 and rare forms were prepared for publication.
    Sir Wyville Thomson informs me that he is already far advanced
 towards the publication of two quarto volumes, and that he estimates the
 whole being completed in fourteen,- of the form and size of the Philoso
 phical Transactions.
     Transit of Venus. — Sir George Airy has been pleased to inform me
 that the inferences from the telescopic observations of the transit of
 Venus, made in the British expeditions for records of that phenomenon,
 under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, have now been pub
 lished — first, in response to an order of the House of Commons ; secondly,
 in a more elaborate communication to the Royal Astronomical Society.
 The number of districts of observation was five, but each of these included
 a  principal and    some subordinate stations.          The number of observers was
 eighteen,  and   as    some    of them   observed  both  ingress and egress of Venus
 at the Sun's limb, the total number of observations was fifty-four.               The
 concluded value of equatorial mean solar parallax was 8"-754.                      The
 calculation of the photographic records of the transit is advancing
 rapidly.

    The Report on the results of the total Solar Eclipse of 1875, announced
 in my last years Address as being drawn up by Mr. Lockyer, is now in
 our hands.
    The Harvard College Observatory (U.S.). — During my recent visit to
 the United States,      I was for a short time a guest at the Cambridge
 Botanic Garden, and consequently in close proximity to the fine Obser
 vatory of Harvard College, to which I paid several visits, being most
 kindly received by Professor Pickering, successor to the distinguished
 astronomer, W. C. Bond. The system carried out in this observatory is
 known to British Astronomers to be so productive of good results that
 I  felt sure that some account of it would be acceptable to the Fellows
                               I
of the Royal Society ; and therefore availed myself of Mr. Pickering's
 good offices to obtain a few particulars.
    The current work of the Observatory is threefold, and consists of obser
vations with the 15-ineh equatorial, with the 8-inch aperture meridian
 circle, and communication of true time-signals to the public.
    The principal work of the equatorial is photometrical, an instrument
having been devised by the Astronomer by which two stars may be com
pared directly without using an artificial star as an intermediate step
in the measurement.         By this    means    the relative   brightness  of the
components      of numerous     double   stars,   including   some   having only
very faint components, as also the relative brightness of the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn, has been determined.
    At the time of my visit Prof. Pickering was engaged in a special study
of the newly discovered satellites of Mars, one of which, the outer, had    I
the satisfaction of observing through the equatorial. Their brightness he
had determined       by three very ingenious     methods  : — 1st, by comparison
with an    image of  Mars shining through    a very minute circular hole placed
at the focus of the telescope; 2nd, by comparing the satellite with a
minute image of Mars formed in the field of the large telescope by a small
auxiliary telescope ; 3rd, by reducing the light of the inner satellite by
one, two, or three plates of microscope-glass, until its brightness was
equal to that of the outer satellite. Of these methods the second showed
that the outer satellite does not partake of the red colour of Mars.
    The meridian circle was, or had lately been, in use for the following
purposes : — 1st, the determination of the position of all stars brighter
than the 9th magnitude contained in the zone 50--5o° N. ; 2nd, observa
tions of Mars during the opposition of last summer for the solar parallax ;

    United States' Scientific Surveys. — Of the many surveys of the United
States territories undertaken, some by the Central Government, others
by State governments, and still others by private enterprise, more or
less aided by public funds, none has effected so much for science as
that directed by Dr. Hayden.         Its publications, distributed with great
liberality, are in every scientific library, and its Director is honoured no
less for the energy and zeal with which he has laboured as a topographer
and geologist, than for the enlightened spirit in which he has sought to
render the resources of the Survey available for the advancement of all
branches of natural knowledge by every means in his power, and with
admirable impartiality.
    Having obtained an extended leave of absence from my official duties
at the Eoyal Gardens, I, at the close of our last session, accepted an invi
tation from    Dr. Hayden to join his survey, and, in company with our
 Foreign Member, Prof. Asa Gray, to visit, under his conduct, the Eocky
Mountains of Colorado and Utah, with the object of contributing to the
records of the Survey a report on the Botany of those States.
    I  have thus had some opportunity of learning for myself the extent
 and value of the operations of the Survey, which are so interesting that
 I  venture to think a brief sketch of its rise and progress and a few of its
 results may be acceptable to you.
    When the territory of Nebraska      wras admitted into the Union in 1867,
 Congress set apart an unexpended balance of £1000 for a Geological
 Survey of the new State ; and Dr. Hayden, then a young man who had
 distinguished himself as an indefatigable palsDontological observer and
 collector (in various expeditions since 1853), was appointed to conduct
 it. In 1868 the operations of the Survey were continued, and carried
 westward into the Eocky Mountains of Wyoming, the rich Tertiary and
 Cretaceous beds of which were examined and described in detail, and the
 famous Yellowstone district,      with which Dr. Haydens name will ever
 be associated, was reconnoitred.       The value of the Survey was imme
 diately appreciated, and     in  1869  a large appropriation    was voted by
  Congress for placing it on its present footing under the supervision

  440                        Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
  of the Secretary of State for the Interior.       In 1869 and 1870 opera
  tions were carried on in Colorado and New Mexico ; and full reports
  on the meteorology, agriculture, zoology, and palaeontology of these
  regions, of great interest and importance, were drawn up and subse
  quently published.      In 1871 the detailed survey of this Yellowstone
  district was begun, and those marvellous natural features were carefully
  studied, which have excited the liveliest interest in Europe, and have
 induced Congress, on Dr. Hayden's representations, to appropriate the
  whole area as a Government       reserve, thus securing to naturalists free
 access to natural phenomena which in other places, both in Europe and
 America, are too often monopolized by speculators and closed to the
  public.
     In 1872 the Survey was further extended, and was organized into two
 corps, each provided with a topographer, geologist, mineralogist, meteoro
 logist, and naturalist, and the States of Idaho and Montana were embraced
 in its operations ; in 1873 it was pushed into Colorado, thence into Utah,
 and on its completion in 1876, an area of not less than 70,000 square
 miles, much of it exceedingly mountainous, had been included in the Survey.
     The literature of the Survey consisted, in 1876, of 41 volumes, classi
 fied as follows : — 1, annual reports, with maps and sections ; 2, bulletins
 for giving speedy publicity to new facts ; 3, miscellaneous publications,
comprising tables of elevations, catalogues of plants and animals, and
meteorological data ; 4, monographs on various branches of natural
history, especially palaeontology, copiously illustrated with admirable
plates in quarto, among which are the works of Leidy, Lesquereux,
Coues, C. Thomas, Cope, Parry, Meek, Packard, Silliman, Hayden
himself, and others, all of whom are well known on this side of the
Atlantic ; lastly, the number of photographs now exceeds 4000, and
includes, besides geological and geographical features of great interest,
views of ancient architectural remains, and of 1200 Indians, belonging
to 74 tribes.
    In  giving these particulars   I  speak from some personal knowledge.
I wish    that the same could be said of the local habitation of the Survey
and its museum, which,       I am assured, contains a very extensive and
instructive collection ; but these are at Washington, and my pressing
duties here and at Kew prevented my visiting the federal capital.
    The most important scientific results hitherto derived from the labours
of Dr. Hayden and his parties are unquestionably the geological : such
as the delineation of the boundaries of the Cretaceous and Tertiary seas
and lakes that occupied more than one basin of the mountains of Central
N. America, and the marvellous accumulation of fossil Vertebrates that
these ancient shores have yielded.    Over an area of many hundred thousand
square miles    in North America   there have been found, within the last very
few years, beds of great extent and thickness, of all ages from the Trias on
wards, containing the well-preserved remains of so great a multitude of

 1877.]                         President's Address.                              441
 flying, creeping, and walking things, referable to so many orders of
plants and animals, and often of such gigantic proportions, that the palae
ontologists of the States, with museums vastly larger than our own, are
at a loss for space to exhibit them. So common indeed are some species,
 and so beautifully preserved, that         I  saw numbers of them, especially
insects, plants, and fishes, exposed for sale, and eagerly purchased by
 travellers, with confectionery and fruit, at the stalls of the railway sta
 tions, from the eastern base of the Eocky Mountains all the way to
 California.
    An examination of some of these fossils has brought to light the im
portant fact that in North America there is no recognized break between
the Cretaceous and Tertiary beds.           This is due to the interpolation of a
vast lignitic series the fossils of which furnish conflicting evidence.         Con
cerning    this  series  Dr.  Hayden,   who   has   traced   it  over many   hundred
miles, observes* that the character of its palaeontological, as well as of
its strictly geological, results is such, that whether the entire group be
placed in the Lower Tertiary or Upper Cretaceous is unimportant, and
that the testimony of palaeontologists will probably always be as conflicting
as at present.
    Professor Marsh, of Yale College, Newhaven, one of the highest
authorities in America, has found that not even invertebrate fossils afford
a satisfactory solution of the difficulty.
                                                  " These," he says, " throw little
light on the question ;" and he is obliged to assume that "the line, if
line there be, must be drawn where the Dinosaurs and other Mesozoic
Vertebrates disappear, and are replaced by the Mammals, henceforth the
dominant type."
    This last passage     I  have taken from the lucid address of Professor
Marsh to the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, held last autumn at Nashville, to which             I  must refer for an
exposition   of the  riches  of the fossil Vertebrate    fauna   of these regions, of
the convincing proofs they afford of the doctrine of Evolution, and of
the light they throw       on the introduction,     succession, and dispersion of
existing organisms in the New World.               Among the suggestive obser
vations with which this address abounds is another in reference to this
question of the disputed horizons of the Cretaceous and Eocene beds —
namely, its dependence on the relative value to be given to evidence
derived from plant and animal remains. He concludes that plants afiord
unsatisfactory measure of geological periods as compared with animals
—a    conclusion at which     I had long ago arrived.        We agree further that
a  chief cause of this difference of value is the loss complex organization
of plants, which hence furnish less evidence of the influences of envi
roning conditious ; to which might be added the feeble conflict among
the higher members of the vegetable kingdom as compared with the
vertebrates, their stationary habits, and the duration of similar, if not

identical, forms through long geological ages, which has always appeared
to mo to be one of the most signal characteristics of the early condition
of the higher plants as compared with the higher animals.               Other, and
perhaps even more cogent, reasons for plants being so little satisfactory
is, that their reproductive organs, those upon which the classification
is principally based, are rarely preserved, and seldom in connexion with
the vegetative organs, which are abundantly preserved ; and that, with
regard to these, the vegetative organs, their prevalent and best-preserved
 characters, outline and venation, vary in individual species to a surprising
 degree, and, being repeated      in groups otherwise in no way related,    become
 too often fallacious guides.
     Another result, previously obtained in respect of other organisms, but
 ably worked out by Professor Marsh as regards the Vertebrates, is that all
 the Tertiary beds of North America — Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene — are
 of older date than the corresponding beds in Europe. This, though appa
 rently supported by his conclusions that the main migrations of animals
 took place from the American to the Asiatic continent (which he deduces
 from the American, as compared with the European, life-histories of the
 Edentata, Marsupialia, Ungulata, Rodentia, Carnivora,and even Primates),
 is a very bold generalization.       Without presuming to question the abun
 dance and teachings of the American data,           I  cannot but think that his
 theory   of  migration  is, in  the  present  state of  palaeontology, premature,
 especially under our almost absolute ignorance of the Vertebrate fossils of
 the continents of Asia and Africa. The prodigal palseontological wealth of
 the United States, as compared with the poverty of that of Europe as yet
 known, may be likened to that of a metropolitan museum or library as
  contrasted with a provincial collection ; and with regard to Central Asia
  especially, there are indications, in the narratives of travellers and the re
 ports of natives, of vast accumulations of vertebrate fossils there existing.
  These may revolutionize our present ideas, as Falconer's and Cautley's
  discoveries in the outer Himalayas did those of our predecessors ; and
  he would be a rash speculator who, having studied what is known of the
  physical geography of Asia north of that range, ignored the probability of
  the existence there of fossiliferous Cretaceous and Tertiary seas and lake-
  basins, in comparison      with which those of the Rocky Mountains may
  sink into insignificance, both as to extent and productiveness. Professor
  Huxley has, indeed, suggested, as an alternative or escape, the possible
  former existence of a submerged continent, from which both Asia and
  America derived their types of animals and plants, which is tantamount
  to an opinion that the subject is not yet advanced enough for other than
  speculation.
     Other results    of Professor Marsh's labours are equally instructive
  — such,   I mean, as support the doctrine of Evolution ; but these have
  been made known to the scientific             public of this country by Mr.
  Huxley, who examined the Tale College Museum last year. Since then,

as  I was informed by the Professor, during a visit to the same museum,

tionately in value — that is, from the paheontological point of view ; and
                    I
the address which have quoted gives a summary of the state of the whole
collection up to the present time.
   A few words on the magnificent collection of vegetable remains, Creta
ceous and others, that have been studied and described by Mr. Leo
Lesquereux in various published Eeports of the U. S. Geological Survey,
and in separate works issued under its auspices, may be fitly spoken here.
It would be difficult to overrate the value of these contributions to fossil
Botany, which, in its present state of advancement, affords no results
comparable with those obtained from the animal kingdom for fixing the
limits of periods, tracing the direction of migrations and the areas of
distribution, or for following the devious paths of evolution.             In the
whole range of the natural sciences no study is so difficult, and at the
same time so fruitless, if we regard the amount of results accepted by
botanists, as compared with the prodigious labour their acquisition
by palreontologists has demanded.        Of all the orders of fossil plants of
the formations referred to, the Gymnosperms alone have, as a rule, yielded
much trustworthy information ; and this is due to their texture, to the
peculiar   character of their vegetative aud reproductive organs, to the
frequent adhesion of these to the branchlets, to their gregarious habits,
to their wide distribution, and to their close affinity with existing species.
 Of other orders and genera of plants, with the exception of          a  few with
well-characterized    foliage, as the Palms, the identifications of a large pro
portion   hitherto  published are not recognized as having much claim to
confidence by those who have the largest acquaintance with the varied
forms of the vegetative organs of plants.            And if the identification
of the fossil leaves of one country is so hazardous, what must be the risk
of identifying the fossil leaves of one continent with those of another ?
 a forlorn hope which has constantly to be resorted to.             The result, in
the case of the North- American Cretaceous and Tertiary floras, has
 been the discovery of certain well-ascertained           plants, which would
appear to show that various prevalent existing American genera have
 inhabited that continent from a very early period ; but that, along with
them, there existed types of European, Asiatic, and Australian genera,
 temperate and tropical, that are no longer associated anywhere on the
 globe in a state of nature.     It is well, under such perplexing conditions,
 that men of ability and unconquerable zeal (such as Heer, Saporta, and
Lesquereux) are to be found who will undertake to investigate them ; and
while thanking them cordially for what they have done,              I would urge
upon    them   the importance     of constant  reference  to  large  Herbaria,  in
 order to enable them fully to appreciate the variability of foliar organs,
and the deceptive nature of the characters they present.

is,  I  need hardly say, neither the oldest of the States' Surveys nor the first
that brought its resources to bear on other matters than geography and
geology.     Indeed, from the beginning of the century, the Americans have
busied themselves with inquiries into the resources and productions of
their States — never on any recognized system, too often under difficulties
and discouragements, not seldom to be nipped in the bud, or, worse still,
sacrificed when the fruit was fit for gathering, through the ignorance or
parsimony of the holders of the national purse ; but, thanks to the single-
 miudedness of the labourers, never without some good, and often with
great results.      The Coast Surveys are admirable alike for their system,
for their breadth of purpose, for the attainments and ability of the
 officers in charge of them, and for the minute topographic accuracy
 aimed at and attained    — an accuracy which,     I need    not say, is unattain
 able by such surveys as that here briefly described.         The various surveys
 for railways across the continent have contributed a very library to natural
 science in many departments ; and some of the individual States have,
 through the like agency, contributed greatly to our knowledge of their
 natural history and other products.        For an excellent and full account of
 the history, labours, and results of all these,     I must refer you to Prof.
 Whitney's     article on  " Geographical    and  Geological Surveys
                                                                           "

 'North American Keview' for July and September 1875, which                  he was
 so   kind as to send me at the moment of my departure from the States.
 Prof. Whitney's own Geological Survey of California and Nevada is one
 of the very best of the series. It was begun in 1864, and continued for
 ten years ; but after the publication of a topographical map, and some very
  valuable results, including natural history, at a most moderate cost, the
  whole work was stopped by the State Legislature, and the geological maps
  and sections, though admirable and paid for, have consequently never been
  given to the public ! The last of these Surveys which         I shall mention is
 that of Kentucky by Professor Shaler, the State Surveyor, of which the
  first volume of the Report has just appeared, containing, besides articles
  on prehistoric remains, fossil Brachiopods, and caverns and cavern-life,
  an exhaustive article by Mr. Allen, of singular interest, on the Bisons of
  America, living and extinct.
      The American Flora. —Though       I have as yet  little to say of the results
  of Dr. Gray's and my own investigations under the Survey,           I  have every
  reason to hope that, having been extended through the Sink, Salt, or desert
  regions west of the Rocky Mountains, and thence across the Sierra Nevada
  to the Pacific coast, they will, with the materials previously obtained by my
  fellow traveller and myself, enable us to correlate our several researches
  into the distribution of North-American plants, and to point out the
  lines along which the migrations of the existing types were directed, and
   the countries whence they migrated.
      As regards the components of the United-States flora, these seemed to

us to be threefold, and to be intermixed     throughout   the continent  — an
endemic American,     a European,  and an Asiatic : it seemed that the flora
was   a ternary compound, so to speak, while that of the temperate Old
"World was, in a continental point of view, binary — Europe and Asia
having many types in common, but very few representatives of the strictly
American flora. The distribution of North-American plants, unlike the
European, is mainly in a meridional direction, the difference of the floras
of the Eastern, Central, and Western States being wonderfully great — far
greater than those of similarly situated regions in the Old World.        The
European components extend over the whole breadth of the continent,
diminishing, however, to the westward. The American components present
many localized genera, inhabiting the Eastern, Central, and Western States
respectively; theyincrease in numbers and peculiarity, as also in restriction
of range, towards the west. The Asiatic components are found both in the
Eastern and Western States, but hardly at all in the Central ; and some
of them are common to both the east and west, while others are peculiar to
each.   But whereas the European components prevail on the side towards
Europe, the maximum of Asiatic representation is on that remote from
Asia. This has been conspicuously shown by Gray's discovery, in the
Eastern States, of single representatives of Japanese genera previously
supposed to be monotypic ; and what is most noteworthy is, that such
representatives are in some cases extremely rare and local plants, found
in single and very restricted areas, indicating a dying-out of the Asiatic
representation in America.
   The evidences of climatic    changes in past eras of the existing flora
of the continent are seen in the prevalence of arctic and northern
species of plants in the alpine zones of the meridional mountain-chains,
the Appalachian, Eocky Mountains, and Sierra Nevada, even as far south
as the 33rd parallel.   These plants had spread southwards during a period
of cold, and on its subsequent mitigation had retired to the lofty situations
they now inhabit.     To the former existence of a warmer climate we may
partly look for the extension of Mexican types to the dry regions west
of the Bocky Mountains up to the 41st parallel ; and to it may be attri
buted the remarkable northward extension of the Cacti in a very narrow
meridional belt, scarcely one hundred miles broad, along the eastern flanks
of the same mountains, from their head-quarters in New Mexico, in the
33rd, almost to the 50th parallel.
   Of existing influences that determine the development in amount of
the vegetation of a country, and the extension in various directions of its
components, none are so powerful as the distribution of rainfall and of
vapour in the atmosphere.       This subject will repay a careful study in
America, especially in connexion with the presence or absence of wood
lands and forests, an excellent map of which by Professor Brewer, of
Newhaven, was published in 1873 by the Supreme Government, in which

    I must  not end my notices of some of the labours of our scientific
brethren in the United States without expressing my admiration of
the spirit and the manner in which the Government and people have
cooperated in making known the physical and biological features of
their country, and my conviction that the results they have given
to the world are, whether for magnitude or importance, greater of
their kind than have been accomplished within the same time by any
people or government in the older continents.       How great would now be
our knowledge of the climate and natural features of India and of our
Colonies had the excellent Trigonometrical Survey of the one and the
territorial and Geological Surveys of the others been supplemented by
Reports such    as those to which   I have directed attention !
    On the motion of Mr. De La Rue, seconded by Sir James Alderson,        it
was resolved — " That the thanks        of the Society be returned to the
President for his Address,      and that he be requested to allow it to be
printed."
    The President then proceeded to the presentation of the Medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor James Dwight Dana,
of Tale College, Newhaveu, United States, for the numerous, varied, and
important contributions to Mineralogy, Geology, and Zoology with which
he has enriched science   during more than fifty years.     Professor Dana's
first published   paper bears   the date of 1823, while the year 1877 finds
him, as ever, vigorously   at work.
    Commencing his career with the inestimable advantage of a sound
training in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, one of Professor Dana's
earliest writings is an essay upon the connexion of electricity, heat, and
magnetism.      He then turned his attention to mineralogy; and, after
exhibiting his thorough study of both the crystallographic and the chemical
 aspects of minerals by the publication of a large number of separate
 memoirs,   he produced a systematic treatise on mineralogy, which at
 once took the place it still holds among standard works upon the sub
ject.
    In geology, the diversity and importance of Professor Dana's labours
 are not less remarkable.    Not only have multitudinous detached essays,
 embodying   the  results of  wide and accurate observations in all parts of
 the world, and on all classes of geological phenomena, proceeded from
 his pen, but his ' Manual of Geology,' of which a new edition appeared
.two years ago, is at once a most clear and comprehensive statement
 of the present state of geological science, and a complete, though

1877.]                      President's Address.                          447
necessarily condensed, monograph of the geology of North America ;
and, it may be added, few treatises on this branch of knowledge show
so thorough and practical an acquaintance with all those sciences
which are auxiliary to geology, or so extensive and profound a study
of the phenomena presented by the existing condition of the globe,
from the knowledge of which every rational attempt to reconstruct the
past history of the earth, upon the data afforded by its rocks and their
organic contents, must start.
    As naturalist to the United States Exploring Expedition, which made
a circumnavigators    voyage, under the command of Captain Wilkes, in the
years 1838 to 1842, Professor Dana enjoyed unusual opportunities for
zoological investigation ; and his remarkable works on the Zoophytes and
the Crustacea observed during the voyage testify to the admirable use
which he made of those opportunities.       Nor has Professor Dana confined
himself to the merely descriptive side of zoology ; but, drawing general
conclusions from his vast store of accurate observations, he has published
 views on classification and on questions of general morphology of much
 originality and breadth of view.
    The Medal was received for Prof. Dana by the Hon. Edwards Pierre-
 point, United States Minister.      The President, in delivering the Medal,
 expressed his assurance of the esteem and regard in which Prof. Dana
 was held by the Eoyal Society, not less for his own scientific achieve
 ments than for the liberal aid he has always rendered to other investi
 gators.
    A Eoyal Medal has been awarded to Mr. Frederick Augustus Abel, for
 his physico-chemical researches on gunpowder and explosive agents.
    Mr. Abel's career as a contributor to chemistry commenced about 30
 years ago.    Between 1847 and 1865 he contributed a number of papers
 to the Chemical Society, which were published in their Journal : some of
 the investigations were made in conjunction with other chemists ; among
 these were the action of nitric acid on cumol (1847), and researches on
 strychnine (1849), when the composition of that alkaloid was finally
 established.    They were followed by papers relating to metallurgy
 (copper)  and  analytical processes, one of which, on the application of elec
 tricity to the explosions of mines, may have led to his various works on ex
 plosives, on which the claims of Mr. Abel for the distinction of a Eoyal
 Medal mainly rest. So far back as 1803 he directed his attention to
 the study of gun-cotton in consequence of the development of its manu
 facture in Austria for artillery purposes, and in that year communicated to
 the British Association a report on the preliminary results arrived at
 by his experiments on the Austrian process, and the products furnished
 by it.
     In 18G6 a memoir was sent to our Society, which was published       in the

448                          Anniversary    Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
Phil. Trans, vol. clvi. p. 269, " On the Manufacture and Composition of
Gun-cotton." In this paper, as the result of a long series of experiments,
made with great accuracy, the conditions were laid down for its uniform
manufacture and purification ; and the true nature of gun-cotton (tri-
nitro-cellulose) was finally established by an exhaustive series of analytical
and syntheti<al experiments.
    This paper was followed by another in 1867, published in the Philo
sophical Transactions, vol. clvii., entitled,
                                                  " On the Stability of Gun-
cotton," which was considered worthy of being made the Bakerian Lecture
for that year. This memoir details the results of four years' extensive
experiments on the effects of light and heat on gun-cotton, and upon the
protective action of water at low and high temperatures.               It will be
recollected that the uncertain stability which had been characteristic of
gun-cotton was conclusively traced to minute quantities of unstable sub
stances remaining in the fibre, even after the most careful purification
by the methods hitherto known, and the efficiency of simple measures
for securing the stability of gun-cotton was established. This led ulti
mately to the development of a system of manufacture of gun-cotton
which   permitted   of its ready manufacture       in  a high   state   of purity
(pulping).
    Mr. Abel did not, however, confine his attention to gun-cotton :
and, indeed, in 1864 had sent in a paper to the Koyal Society, which
was published in the
                          '
                            Proceedings,' vol. xiii., on
                                                           " Some Phenomena
exhibited by Gun-cotton and Gunpowder under special conditions,'' in
which the behaviour of these substances when exposed to high tempera
tures in rarefied atmospheres and in different mechanical conditions was
described.
   In  1869 a memoir, entitled
                                  " Contributions to the
                                                          History of Explosive
Agents,"   was printed  in  the Philosophical  Transactions,  vol. clix.    In this
memoir is discussed the influence of more or less strong confinement and
other mechanical conditions under which the detonation of such com
pounds and mixtures was developed. It will be recollected that some
striking results were obtained in the examination of the behaviour of ex
plosive compounds when exposed to initiative detonations of different
character.
    These phenomena were more fully discussed in a second memoir, pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1874, vol. clxiv. ; it includes an
exhaustive investigation of the transmission of detonation from one mass
of gun-cotton, fulminates, and nitro-glycerine to other distinct         masses  in
the open air, and also through the agency of tubes. The causes            of inter
ference with the transmission of detonation-force, and the development
of detonation as distinguished from explosion, were clearly discussed.
The influence of dilution by solids and     by liquids on the susceptibility     of
explosives to detonation, and also the velocity with which detonation is
transmitted by different explosive agents under various conditions, was

1877.]                      President's Address.                         449
carefully studied.  Some important results were obtained by the compari
son of the behaviour of the liquid nitro-glycerine and the solid pulped and
compressed gun-cotton devised by Mr. Abel. Among other things, the
detonation  of gun-cntton when thoroughly saturated with water, the
transmission of detonation to distinct masses of gun-cotton enclosed in
receptacles in which the space between the masses was tilled up with
water, and, further, the value of water as a violent disruptive agent (as
in shells) when it was caused to transmit the force generated by the
detonation of very small quantities of gun-cotton,    which it surrounded,
were established.
   The last memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions, on " Fired
Gunpowder," is a joint production of Mr. Abel and Captain Noble;
and as the merit of the investigation, which has occupied the authors for
some years, is divided,    I
                           do not dwell particularly upon     it, except as
affording evidence of the continuity  of  Mr. Abel's researches in physico-
chemistry, which places him at the head of all other workers in the line
of research which has mainly engaged his attention, and which has been
productive of practical results of the greatest importance to this country.
   [The Medal was received     byMr. Abel.]
  A Eoyal Medal                        Prof. Oswald Heer, of Zurich, for
                      has been awarded to
his numerous researches and writings on the Tertiary plants of Europe,
of the North-Atlantic Islands, North Asia, and North America, and for
bis able generalizations respecting their affinities, their geological and
climatic relations.
  It    mainly to Prof. Heer's labours that we owe those great advances
       is
made of late in our knowledge of the Miocene, Pliocene, and Post-
Pliocene floras of Central Europe, which establish upon broad but safe
grounds the close analogy existing between the vegetation of these epochs
and that of the present period in Eastern North America and Eastern
Asia. To Prof. Heer also we are mainly indebted for the remarkable
discovery that  rich and varied arboreous vegetation, strikingly similar
                a
to what now obtains in temperate and subtropical countries, once extended
to the Arctic Circle and far beyond    — fact of which no adequate
                                        it    a
explanation has been found, and the importance of which, in relation to all
questions as to the former geological and geographical conditions of the
northern hemisphere, cannot be overestimated.
  Prof. Heer's youthful studies were directed to botany and entomology.
His scientific authorship commenced in 1836 and the early bent of his
                                                  ;
mind towards the higher problems of natural science    evinced by one of
                                                        is
his very first memoirs, being Sur la Ge'ographie Botanique de    Suisse,'
                                                                    la

published in 1837. His earliest work on fossil plants was upon those of
the Rhone valley, published in 1846, since which period he has been un
interruptedly and indefatigably     engaged   on the comparative study of
recent and fossil plants and insects — describing and illustrating them with

 them geological and climatic considerations, remarkable alike for their

 fossilis  Helvetiae,'             Tertiaria   Helvetiae,'  and
 Arctica'    are  conspicuous examples of well-directed labour and great
 learning  ;  while the number of his minor works on various branches of
 biology testify to a life spent in successful devotion to science.
    During Prof. Heer's long and laborious career he has been conspicuous
 for the liberal aid he has given to other investigators, and for the disin
 terested spirit in which he has worked out the collections brought by the
 government and private expeditions of various European nations from the
 northern and arctic regions. In particular, we are beholden to him for
 the labour he has bestowed upon our own Arctic collections, made during
 the last fifteen years, from that of Belcher to that of Is ares, and especially
 for his elaborate and exhaustive memoir on the Miocene flora of Bovey
 Tracey, published in the Philosophical Transactions,' — labours all the
                                 '
 more praiseworthy from being, for some years past, pursued in a recum
 bent posture, to which grievous bodily ill-health has confined him.
    The Medal was received for Prof. Heer by M. Henri Vernet, Consul-
 General for Switzerland, to whom the President acknowledged the
 Society's obligations to Prof. Heer for his elucidations of the Geology of
 England and of the Flora of the Bovoy-Tracey Coalfield, published in the
 Philosophical Transactions ; and on behalf of the Society expressed his
hope that Prof. Heer might soon be restored to health.
   For the Davy Medal, now for the first time awarded, Prof. Robert
A\'ilhelm    Bunsen   and Gustav    Robert Kirchhoff, both Foreign Members
of the Society, in recognition of their researches and discoveries in spec
trum-analysis, have been selected.
   The method of spectrum-analysis,          as established  by these two emi
nent men, must rank among the most important extensions of our means
of investigating the properties of matter.          Before that discovery, the
chemical constitution of matter was examined solely by the study of the
changes which take place within the narrow range of cases of which we
can grasp and weigh        the substance under investigation ; but the tests
employed in spectrum-analysis have no necessary dependence upon the
distauce of the material from the observer.        It has enabled us to see, not
only further, but deeper ; for, on the one hand, it has led to the detection
of many of the chemical constituents of masses distant from our planet,
and, on the other hand, it has enabled us to discover many constituents of
terrestrial minerals which had escaped detection until our ordinary
methods of analysis were guided by the more refined tests afforded by
the spectrum-analysis.

                        Report    of the Kew   Committee.                       461
        Beport    of the   Kew Committee         for  the   Year ending
                              October 31, 1877.
    The Committee would commence their Report with the expression of
their heartfelt regret at the decease of Mr. J. P. Gassiot, who had been,
since 1851, among the most active Members of the successive Kew Com
mittees, first of the British Association, and latterly of the Royal Society.
Mr. Gassiot had not only devoted freely to the management of Kew Obser
vatory a large portion of his valuable time, but also had, in 1871, most
munificently endowed the establishment with the sum of £10,000 Italian
Irrigation Stock, for the purpose of maintaining in a state of thorough
efficiency the self-recording observations in terrestrial magnetism and in
meteorology.
    Committee. —The    Committee is constituted as follows     : —
                   General Sir  E. Sabine, K.C.B., Chairman.
   Mr. De La Rue, Vice-Chairman.              Mr. R. H. Scott.
    Capt. Evans.                              Lieut.-General W.      J. Smythe.
   Mr. E. Galton.                             Lieut.-General Strachey.
   Vice-Adm. Sir G. H. Richards.              Mr. E. Walker.
   The Earl of Rosse.
   Mr. R. H. Scott, at his own request, has       been  for the future relieved
of the duties of Hon. Secretary, which       he has performed ever since the
Observatory came under the management of the Royal Society, and the
duties of that post will be in future discharged by the Superintendent.
   Magnetic Work. — The Magnetographs have been in constant operation
throughout the year. The declination instrument was slightly deranged
for a short period by the presence of some extremely minute organic fibres
between the mirrors.      In accordance with the usual practice, determina
tions  of the scale-values of all the instruments were    made   in the first week
of the new year.
   The inconvenience occasionally experienced by the dropping, on to the
Magnetographs, of water condensed in the smoke-tubes over the gas-
burners has been obviated by the attachment        of suitable catch-bottles.

 462                    Report of the Kew Committee.
    The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
 continued as usual by Mr. Figg, and the results are given in the Tables
 appended to this Report. A re-determination of the moment of inertia of
 the magnet KC 1 was made in October        ; the value accorded with the pre
viously found amount.
    A  paper
              " On the Temperature-correction     and Induction- coefficients of
 Magnets,"    as determined   in  the results  of  various experiments at the
 Observatory, was read before the Royal Society, and printed in vol. xxvi.
 of the ' Proceedings.'
    Sir Edward Sabine having brought the discussion of the Magnetical
 Observations    carried on under his superintendence to a close in a final
 "Contribution," presented to the Royal Society (No. XV., Phil. Trans,
vol. 167), represented to the War Office that he was able to dispense
with the further services of the two Sergeants of the Royal Artillery who
had acted as his clerks.     These men were in consequence withdrawn on
the 31st of March.
   The documents deposited in Sir E. Sabine's late office have been pre
                 "
sented by the War Office to the
                               "        " Royal Society," and, in conformity
with instructions received from the Council, will be retained in the cus
tody of the Observatory.       A detailed list of these documents and papers
is now in course    of preparation.
   The tabulation of the magnetic curves, which was suspended at the
time of writing the last Report, has been resumed, and Tables of the
Declination have been completed as far as December 31st, 1876.
   At the request of Prof. Balfour Stewart, the range of the declination-
needle has been determined for every day during the years 1858—73
inclusive.   The results have been discussed by him in a paper read before
the Royal Society, March 22, 1877, entitled, "On the Variations of
the Daily Range of the Magnetic Declination as recorded at the Kew
 Observatory," Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxvi.
   In addition, magnetic data have been supplied to Dr. Atkinson, Prof.
M'Leod, the llydrographic Department,              Messrs. Gee, Grove, and
Groenman.
   The officers attached to the late Arctic Expedition have visited the
Observatory, and made several sets of observations with the instruments
employed by them on their voyage, Kew being the base station to which
all their observations are referred.
   The Committee have received, with great satisfaction, a communication
from Mr. R. Ellery, F.R.S., of the Melbourne Observatory, in which he
states that, in deference to the opinions elicited by the circular of the
Kew Committee from the chief authorities on terrestrial magnetism, as
explained in last Report, the Government of Victoria has furnished funds
for the erection of a new Magnetic Observatory at Melbourne.
   Meteorological Work.— The several self-recordiDg instruments for the
continuous registration respectively of pressure, temperature, humidity,

                           Report   of the Kew       Committee.                     463
wind (direction and velocity), and rain have been maintained in regular
operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker, assisted by T. Gunter.
The daily standard eye-observations for the control of the automatio
records have been made regularly, as well as daily observations in con
nexion with the -Washington synchronous system.
   The Observatories of the Meteorological Council at Aberdeen, Armagh,
Falmouth, Glasgow, Stonyhurst, and Valencia have been visited by Mr.
Whipple, and their instruments inspected.
   The examination and checking of the work of the self-recording Obser
vatories of the Meteorological Committee was discontinued in November
1876, and the scales and appliances used in the work returned to the
Meteorological Office.    Mr. Aldridge, an assistant engaged in the work,
accepted   an appointment from the Meteorological Committee. Mr. Har
rison is employed at Kew, subject to the condition that he may be at any
time sent to any of the Observatories to relieve the officer in charge in
case of illness or other cause, if required by the Meteorological Council
to do so.   The tabulation of the Kew meteorological traces is performed
by    Mr. Ha wkes worth.
     This change of arrangements            has involved a considerable reduction    in
the amount allowed by the Meteorological Office to Kew, as its central
Observatory.  This sum is now £150, instead of £400, as heretofore.
     Electrograph.   — The
                       cause of derangement of this instrument having
been apparently  removed, by dismounting and thoroughly cleaning   its         it,
action has been fairly satisfactory throughout the year.
   Considerable difficulty has been experienced at times in maintaining the
cistern of the water-dropping collector in     sufficiently insulated condi
                                                      a
tion.     The substitution of   of Varley's telegraph insulators for the
                                  a   set
ebonite supports previously used has been attended with good results.
The tabulation of the curves obtained from this instrument has not yet
been commenced.
     An instrument     having been constructed for the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich,      similar to the one at Kew, certain minor alterations in the
details have been introduced which              Mr. Whipple's experience    has sug
gested.
     Photolieliograjih.   —The    re-examination      of the measurements of the
Kew sun-pictures, as noticed in former Reports, has been steadily carried
on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple, assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin,
who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose.
  The rate of progress has been somewhat slow during the past year,
owing to the enormous number of spots visible on the sun's surface during
the (maximum) year (1870) now under discussion.       On several days,
recently measured, more than 150 spots have had their positions deter
mined.   Mr. Marth      still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric
                             is
elements.

                            Report of the  Kew Committee.
     All   of these operations have been conducted at the expense             of Mr. De
 La Sue.
     The eye-observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,
 have been made daily by Mr. Harrison, when possible, as described in
  the Report for 1872, in order, for the present, to maintain the continuity
  of the Kew record of sun-spots.
     Extra Observation. — The Solar-radiation           Thermometers        are still  ob
  served daily.
     The Campbell      Sundial, described in the 1875 Report, continues in
 action, and the improved form of the instrument, giving a separate record
 for every day of the duration of sunshine, has been regularly worked
 throughout the year and its curves tabulated.
      Wind Component Integrator. — The Wind Component Integrator, an
 instrument which automatically resolves the velocity of the wind into its
 rectangular components, which was exhibited by Prof, von Oettingen, of
 Dorpat, at the recent Loan Exhibition, having been lent by the Guarantors
 of that Exhibition to the Meteorological Council, has been erected in the
 sun-room of the Observatory at their expense. The instrument has been
 temporarily attached to the existing anemograph, and its gearing so modi
 fied as to enable it to print from type-wheels on a strip of paper the
 number of miles of wind passing over the building             from the      north,  east,
 south, and west during every half-hour*.
     At   the request of the Editor of the ' Times,' a copy of the traces of
 the self-recording instruments on a reduced scale, together with an
 epitome of the general features of the weather, is now prepared.                    This
 is published every week in that journal, the cost to the Observatory               beiDg
 defrayed by the proprietors.
     Verifications.
                     — This branch of the work of the Observatory has been
carried on with considerable success as usual.              The following magnetic
 instruments have been verified :      —
            A  set of Magnetographs     for the Batavia Observatory.
                    „         „        „        Potsdam Observatory.

                 Shadvvell.
            Two Azimuth Compasses for Mr. Frewen.
     There have also been purchased on commission and verified : — a Unifilar
for Dr. Da Souza, Coimbra ; a Collimator magnet for Mr. Kingston, To
ronto    ;  a Dip-circle for Prof. Weihrauch, Dorpat         ; a Dip-circle for Prof.
Houzeau, Brussels Observatory ; and two Dip-needles for Prof. Smirnow,
Kazan. There are also now undergoing verification a set of Magneto-

    In addition, 102 Thermometers have been tested at the melting-point
 of mercury. 12 Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and divided
 at Kew.
    The following is the list of miscellaneous instruments which have
 been verified  : —
            Hydrometers                                               249

            Dial Anemometers (Robinson's)                                5
    In addition to those for the Admiralty, the Meteorological Council,
 and the opticians, a number of instruments of various kinds have been
 verified for the Standards Department and the Ordnance Department,
 Woolwich.
    The total increase in the number of instruments         verified over last year
 has been 680, and in fees earned £25 lis. 2d.
    There are now at the Observatory undergoing             verification   56 Ther
 mometers,   1 Hydrometer, and 35 Barometers.
    London Office  for receipt   of instruments for verification. —Arrangements

 now receives instruments       for verification at Kew,   at 116 Victoria Street,
 Westminster, and takes charge of them on their return.
    Mr. Galton's apparatus for testing Thermometers has continued to
 work satisfactorily ; and a paper containing a description of the instru
 ment, with an illustration, has been published in vol. xxvi. of the ' Pro
 ceedings of the Royal Society.'

 46G                        Report of the Kew Committee.
    The new Cathetometer has received          some  slight additions tending to im
prove its usefulness.
    One Theodolite, three Sextants,           and a Clinometer      have been veri
 fied.
    Experiments have been made with the new Deep-sea Sounding Ther
mometer, invented by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra ; and the Committee
have under consideration the construction of an apparatus for the pur
pose of verifying this           class of instrument under        varying  hydraulic
pressure.
    A system       has also been organized for etching a " Hall-mark,"      QCOO
as in the annexed figure, upon all Thermometers which have                   cp^   )
been       verified.     A  pantagraph   has  been  purchased     for the   C^sJO
purpose of engraving this mark and            a register number upon the     instru
ments.
    The old " Royal Society " Standard Barometer, constructed by Newman
in 1837, under the direction of Mr. Baity, which has been in a defective
condition since its removal from the Society's Rooms in Somerset House
in 1857, having been lent to the Kew Committee by the Council of the
Royal Society for one year, has been thoroughly repaired and both its
tubes refilled, and is now erected at the Observatory, with a view of
making a lengthened series of comparisons with the two normal Baro
meters of the establishment.
    Comparison of Standard Barometers. — The Astronomer Royal having
courteously offered the Committee every facility for a suggested compari
son between the Greenwich and Kew Standard Barometers during April
and May last, a number of carefully selected Portable Standard Baro
meters were conveyed to and fro between Greenwich and Kew on three
separate occasions, and a large number of comparative readings were
obtained by the Superintendent and Messrs. Baker and Foster.
    A    complete detailed account of the experiment has been drawn up, and
will   be laid before the     Royal Society.
    A determination has been made of the daily range of the Thermometer
at Kew for the past twenty-one years, viz. 1855-75, inclusive.                  The
results have been discussed by Prof. Balfour Stewart, and embodied by
him in a paper         " On the Variations of the Daily Range of Atmospheric
Temperature           as recorded at the Kew Observatory,"          Proc. Roy. Soc.

    Pendulum         Experiments. — The apparatus specified in the Report for
1875, as granted by the Committee to the Hydrographer for the service
of the Arctic Expedition, was returned to the Observatory shortly after
the arrival home of the vessels        ;  but no observations    having been made

  with the pendulum      apparatus,  it was not re-erected at Kew, nor      base
  operations repeated.
     Instruction given. — One    assistant from   the   Standards   Department
  received  instruction in the manipulation   of thermometers, and Dr. Taaffe
  in the use of meteorological instruments.
      Waxed Paper supplied. — "Waxed paper has been supplied         to the fol

     A  supply of chemical and photographic material has also been procured
 for the Mauritius Observatory.
     Loan Exhibition. — The old instruments lent to the Science and Art
 Department, enumerated in last year's Report, remain for the present
 deposited in the galleries at South Kensington.
     A " Diplome d'honneur " has been presented to the Committee         by the
 Societe Franchise de Photographie for the curves exhibited at their recent
 exhibition of objects illustrating the adaptation of photography to scien
 tific purposes.
     Workshop.   — The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such      as the
 "Wbitworth Lathe and the Planing Machine, procured by Grants from
 either the Government-Grant Fund or the Donation Fund, for the use
 of the Kew Observatory, have been kept in thorough order ; and many
 of them are in constant, and others in occasional use at the Observatory;
 but the funds of the Committee do not at present allow of the employ
 ment of a Mechanical Assistant, although one is much needed.
     Library. — During the year the Library has received as presents the
 publications of
          10 English Scientific Societies and Institutions,
          40 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions,
and numerous pamphlets from various individuals. A few standard
works of reference have been purchased, and a number of periodicals
bound.
    The Committee have also purchased the small Scientific Library belong
ing to the late Mr. John Welsh, F.R.S., formerly Superintendent of the
Observatory, which has been for some years stored in the building.
    Observatory    and Grounds. — For the protection of the Observatory
against fire, a portable hand-pump and two dozen fire-buckets have been
purchased, the latter being distributed throughout the building.
    The room formerly occupied by the Sergeants of the " Magnetic Office"

has been made use      of since their departure by the assistants engaged in
the verification of thermometers, Messrs. Foster and Gunter.
   The floor of the Computing-room has been covered with linoleum.
   The exterior of the Workshops has been painted, and the roofs of the
Verification-house     and Magnetic Observatory have been made water
tight.
   A gravelled path has been cut across the lawn, for giving more con
venient access to the Rain-gauges and Magnetic house.
   Owing to the giving way of part of the embankment separating the
River Thames from the Old Deer Park, on the morning of January 2nd,
the basement of the Observatory was again flooded, the water rising to an
extent higher than has been previously experienced, covering the floors of
the Magnetograph-, Photographic-, and Pendulum-rooms             to a depth of
three or four inches.        By laying down planked ways, the instruments
were maintained in action, and no interruption was experienced in the
work of the Observatory.        The water was withdrawn from the building
by  the  aid of a fire-engine, which, with a gang of labourers, was sent by
the Commissioners of Woods and Forests for the purpose.

to evince in this institution, over which he has presided for so many
years.

Report of the Kew Committee. 469
 470                   Report of the Kew Committee.
                                 APPENDIX I.
 Magnetic Observations    made    at the  Kew    Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6"  N.,
     Long. 0" lm 15'-1  W.,for    the year October 1876 to September     1877.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
 Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
 the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones, the property of the
 Magnetic Office, directed by General Sir E. Sabine.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
 Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33, the needles
 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3      j inches in length.
    The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
 values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
 observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the units in
 the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
 and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
 the factor for reducing the English values to metric value being 0-46108.
    By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
    The value of log ir2K employed in the reduction is 1•64365 at tem
perature 60°.
    The induction-coefficient  ft  is 0-000194.
    The correction of the magnetic power for temperature         <0
                                                                    to an adopted
standard temperature of 35° Fahr. is
                0-0001194(t0-35)+0-000,000,213(<0-35)2.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar
marked 1-0 ft. and 1-3 ft., are 1-000075 ft. and 1-300097 ft. respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force of
the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made           for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
   The value of the constant P, employed in the formula              of reduction
   In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings
have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected about
a quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the
orientation of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined
by the late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
   The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G. Figg.

      I. " On     the Tides at  Malta."      By Sir G. B. Airy, K.C.B.,
                Astronomer    Royal.      Received  July  14, 1877.
                                    (Abstract.)
    A   self-registering tide-gauge had been erected in the harbour of La
 Valetta, and records had been made with it continuously from 1871,
 March 31, to April 28, and with interruptions through other days, under
 the care of Admiral Sir Cooper Key, Naval Commander at Malta ; and
 the register sheets were placed in the hands of the Astronomer Royal.
 They form a band about 60 feet long.
    The first step required to make the observations available was to
 eliminate the effects of frequent non-tidal undulations, whose period is
 approximately 2 lm. This was done by carefully bisecting the intervals
 between adjacent elevations and depressions in about 1 100 instances, and
 drawing     a pencilled curve through the points of bisection.
    It  then became necessary to consider the best plan of reduction.       It
 was determined to commence by comparison, in respect of times, with
the predicted tides at London, as given in the Admiralty Tide-Tables,
which are generally recognized as accurate, and are free from diurnal tide.
The times of London high-water were therefore laid down on the register-
sheets (without regard to difference of longitude) ; each tidal day was
divided into 48 equal parts, and for each dividing point the ordinate of
the tidal curve was measured. The number of measures is about 1900.
These measures were collected in groups of 6 measures for each group
(or 8 groups for each tidal day), and the mean of each group is exhibited
in  a Table.
    The method of treating these       means    of group-measures is then ex-

plained.      The object is to express every height on each separate day by
the following formulae, in which 8 is the tidal angle, increasing from 0 at
the beginning to 2ir, or 24h, at the end of the tidal day         : —
                   For mean height, M ;
                   For semidiurnal tide, P . sin   20 +Q   . cos 20    ;
                   For diurnal tide,       p . sin  0+ q   . cos    0.
 The mathematical process is investigated, and an easy practical rule is
found for its application.       Thus the numerical values of M, P, Q,^,, q are
found for every day. The two tidal expressions are               without difficulty
 converted into the following —
    Half semidiurnal range X cosine of (20 — 2 retard of         semidiurnal high-
 water on the zero of tidal time),
    Half diurnal range x cosine of (0— retard of diurnal         high-water on the
 zero of tidal time),
     By the formula),
    Half -range = V(B2 + Q2) or= V(F+'/) f0r the two             tides respectively,
                                             p
    Tan    2 retard for semidiurnal tide=-^,
    Tan retard for diurnal tide=^.
                                      1
    Thus the retard of    each tide on the zero of tidal time is found     for every
 day-    The adopted zero of tidal time, for a reason given in the paper, is 16m
 earlier than the tabular time of London high-water : and thus the real
 time of each of the Malta high waters for every day is found.               This is
 then compared      with the  time  of  moon's  transit in the  Nautical  Almanac    ;
 and thus the retard of each high water on the moon's transit is found.
 For more distinct view of the changes the lunation is divided into eight
 equal parts, and the means of the several classes of results are taken for
 each eighth part, by a process explained in the paper.
    The following are the principal results : —
     1. The value   of M, the mean height for each day, has a regular and
 well-defined luni-menstrual change connected with the moon's declina
 tion.     It is suggested that, viewing the extreme slowness of the change,
 it is probable that this inequality differs little in magnitude and epoch from
 the corresponding inequality on the oceanic shores of Spain and Morocco,
 and that perhaps it gives the best measure of that inequality.
     2. The semimenstrual inequality in time of the semidiurnal tides is
  very well marked. In magnitude it is sensibly the same as that at London,
  but its epoch is about three days earlier.
     3. The semimenstrual inequality in height of the semidiurnal tides is
  also very well marked.        Its epoch is earlier than that for London by
  about three days ; but the proportion of its coefficient in height to the
  coefficient of semidiurnal tide in height is greater than at London.
     (It  is curious that these results should be deduced with such certainty

 and accuracy from tides in which the greatest single coefficient is 3g
 inches.)
   4. The mean retard of semidiurnal high water on the moon's transit is
 about 16h 4m, which may be taken as the establishment at Malta.
   5. The results for the diurnal tides (whose coefficient in the mean is
about 0-3 inch) are somewhat discordant, but appear to exhibit a
periodical law of coefficients, such as is proper for them.
    The last point for examination      is,
                                       the character of the non-tidal undu
lations already mentioned.      These, in many cases, far exceed the tidal
oscillations.  Similar undulations at Swansea had attracted attention
many years ago                                    "
                   Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,' Tides and Waves" and

the undulations of the same character in the Swiss lakes, called
Seiches, have been carefully examined by Dr. Eorel    and there appears to

be no room for doubt that the non-tidal oscillations at Malta are genuine
Seiches.  They appear to be formed by waves reflected from opposite
shores, producing stationary waves between them.     The shores concerned
in forming the Seiches of Malta seem to be those of Africa and Sicily.

   My Deae Huxley, — Though            the question of " Spontaneous Genera
tion" is, Ibelieve, practically set at rest for the scientific world, you may
possibly deem the following facts of sufficient interest to be communicated
to the Royal Society.
I    brought with me this year to the Alps sixty hermetically-sealed flasks,
containing infusions of beef, mutton, turnip, and cucumber, which had
been boiled for five minutes in London and sealed during ebullition.
They were packed in sawdust, and when opened at the Bel-alp the
drawn-out and sealed ends of six of them were found broken off. These
six flasks were filled with organisms, the remaining ones were pellucid
and free from life.
   Two or three of them were subsequently broken                 by
                                                             accident, but for
six weeks fifty of the flasks remained perfectly clear.
   At the end of this time took twenty-three of them into shed con
                              I                                            a
taining some fresh hay, and there snipped off their sealed ends with                      a
pair of pliers. The air of the hay-loft entered to fill the vacuum produced
by the boiling in Loudon. Twenty-seven other flasks were taken im-
mediatety afterwards to the edge of      declivity, which might almost be

 called a precipice, with a fall of about a thousand feet. A gentle breeze
 was blowing from the mountains, which were partly snow-covered, and
 partly of bare rock, towards the precipice.         Taking care to cleanse my
 pliers in the flame of a spirit-lamp, and to keep my body to leeward of
 the flasks,  I snipped off their sealed ends.
    The two groups of flasks were then placed in our own little kitchen,
 where the temperature varied from about 65° to 90° Fahrenheit.
    Result : — Twenty-one of the twenty-three flasks opened on the hay-loft
 are filled with organisms ; two of them remain clear.
    All the flasks opened on the edge of the precipice remain as clear as
 distilled water. Not one of them has given way.
    This is a striking confirmation of the experiments of Pasteur upon the
 Mer   de Glace.

III.    " Researches     on the Effect of    Light upon Bacteria and other
       Organisms." By Arthur Downes, M.D., S.Sc. Cert. Cantab.,
       and Thos. P. Blunt, M.A. (Oxon.), F.C.S.                Communicated
       by  J. Marshall,       F.R.S.,   Professor  of  Anatomy to the Royal
       Academy of Arts.          Received October 18, 1877.
    The   investigation to which the following communication relates was
undertaken by us with the view of ascertaining, first, whether light could
be shown to exert any appreciable influence, favourable or the reverse,
upon the development of Bacteria and other organisms in certain of those
solutions    which    afford   a suitable   medium   for their appearance and
increase.
    We feel justified in thus presenting our earlier researches and the
conclusions drawn from them, by considering that every fact, however
small, which tends to throw light upon the life-history of these organisms
is of importance as bearing upon questions of the highest moment and
most varied interest.
    In the experiments about to be recorded the contents of the tubes were
in most cases examined under a high power, and the turbidity, when such
occurred, was invariably found to be occasioned by swarms of Bacteria.
The   best index   of the development of the Bacteria we found to be the
degree of turbidity and the time of its commencement.
    Obs. 1. April 24. — Eight ordinary thin test-tubes were cleansed with
strong sulphuric acid and thoroughly rinsed with tap-water.          They were
then partially    filled  with  freshly  made  unboiled  Pasteur's solution, the
exact composition of which is given in the Appendix (.4).          Four of the
tubes were encased in thin sheet-lead so as entirely to exclude light, and

four were left quite bare.   The tops of all were loosely covered with
sheet-lead capsules, and the whole were placed in a test-tube-stand out
side a window facing south-east, and about thirty feet above the ground.
None of the tubes were plugged.
   May 4. —Tubes examined as to turbidity. The solution remains per
fectly clear in the four bare tubes, while in each of the encased it has
become distinctly and uniformly milky.     This turbidity was proved mi
croscopically to be caused by innumerable Bacteria,       The bare tubes
remained quite clear till May 28th, when they were unfortunately acci
dentally lost.
  This observation was again and again repeated with similar result.
  In the large majority of cases the exposed tubes remained clear for an
indefinite time, and in every instance were conserved for a distinct period
after their encased companions had become turbid.      The most marked
differences in the conduct of the two sets of tubes were obtained when
the sun shone brightly ; when for a period of a day or two at the com
mencement of the experiment the weather was close and sultry and the
sky dull, the conservative effect of light appeared to be less pronounced.
Thus, in an observation started on June 12, it was found on the 14th
that while there was a thick zoogloea and advanced turbidity at the upper
part of the solution in the encased tubes, there had already commenced a
much slighter but recognizable cloudiness in two tubes filled with the
same Pasteur's solution, but freely exposed to the light.   This result we
attributed to the fact that throughout the whole of the 12th and 13th
there was not one ray of direct sunlight, the sky being completely over
cast and the atmosphere remarkably thick and hazy.
   Obs.   May 5. — Two of the bare tubes used in Observation
           2.,                                                                 1   were
taken and the contents were found   to be equally and perfectly clear.
One was then encased, the other left as before, and both again replaced
on the window-ledge for exposure.
     May   16.   — the contents of the       encased   tube are now distinctly turbid,
those of the bare tube being perfectly clear.              (The latter remained clear
till May 28th, when    was destroyed.)
                             it
   From this observation        evident that the fitness of the cultivation-
                                  it   is
fluid as nidus for the development of Bacteria
           a                                           not impaired
                                                                is       the    by
action of light for we find that the contents of tube, which remain per
                   ;                                        a
fectly clear so long as they are freely exposed to the sun's rays, swarm
with Bacteria after being deprived of the access of light. This being so,
it becomes important to determine whether light may exert, either directly
or indirectly, destructive influence on Bacteria.
                   a                                  The obvious mode of
settling this question would be to protect the tube to be insolated from
subsequent impregnation, and finally to encase it.        then       If
                                                                  remainedit
clear for an indefinite period   might be fairly inferred that the Bacteria
                                        it
had been destroyed, either in their rudimentary              condition, or successively
as they came to maturity.

490                Dr. A. Downes and Mr. T. P. Blunt          on       [Dec. 6,
    Obs. 3.    May 30.— Two tubes were partially filled with Pasteur's solu
tion (Appendix, B). Both were plugged with cotton wool. One was
encased in paper, the other left bare.
    June 5. —The encased tube was quite turbid.
    June 12. — The bare tube, which had remained perfectly clear, was
now encased, and continued quite free from turbidity up to June 21.
    June 28. — Solution quite clear, but small tuft of mycelium growing
at bottom.
    July   7. — Examined   with a high power. Mass of matted mycelium ; no
Bacteria or other living organisms seen.
    July 11. — The solution now teems with Bacteria, having doubtless
been impregnated       by the dipping-rod used on July 7.
   'Obs. 4.    May  30. — Two tubes containing unboiled        Pasteur   solution
(Appendix, A) were plugged with cotton wool, capsuled, and insolated
until June 21, when both were encased in the way previously described,
the plug being withdrawn from one, and the lead capsule replaced.
    Both tubes remaining clear up to July 2, the unplugged one was im
pregnated by means of a glass rod dipped in a solution containing
abundant Bacteria.
    July 4. — The impregnated solution      is distinctly turbid. The plugged
tube has remained perfectly clear up to the present date [October 11th].
     From these observations we conclude that so far as Bacteria are con
 cerned the solution may be absolutely and perfectly sterilized by sunlight.
 It is important to note, however, that in Observation 3 the germs of a
 fungus had apparently survived an amount of insolation which was fatal
 to the development of Bacteria. . This interesting point will be further
 investigated in the sequel.
     O65. 5. May 5. — Two of the tubes used in Observation 1 were taken ;
 the contents of the one (encased) were turbid, and the other (bare) per
 fectly clear. The contents were well mixed, and divided between the two.
 They were then exposed as before.
     May 8. — The contents of the encased tube are much the more turbid,
 those of the bare tube are but slightly, if at all, more turbid than on

     This experiment tends to indicate that not only is light inimical to the
  original development of the individual, but also materially retards the
  rate of increase, even when the organisms are present in a matured con
  dition.     The next observation was designed as a crucial test of this.
      Obs. 6.  July 10. — Seven tubes containing    Pasteur's solution  (A) were
  inoculated with    a glass rod  dipped in  a solution  teeming with Bacteria,
  care, however, being taken not to impair the translucency of that in the
  tubes in question.     Six of these tubes were then insolated, the seventh
  being encased.     The encased     tube became   turbid on   July  14, the rest
  remained perfectly clear.

   Our next object was to determine what period of exposure to light
might    be sufficient to sterilize a given solution.
    Obs. 7.  July   10. — Seven   full-sized test-tubes were partially filled with
solution A and      plugged   with  cotton wool.     Six were exposed to the light
for periods varying from nine hours to seven days, and were then encased.
There was but little direct sunlight upon them during this period, the
tube exposed for nine hours having 3^ hours' sun, and the one encased
at the end of seven days receiving in the aggregate about 12 hours of
direct sunlight.
   All, however, were sterilized, while the seventh tube, which            was encased
from the first, and served       as a control, became      cloudy with Bacteria on
July   14th.
    Obs. 8. — On   July  29th, a very hot day, with much sunshine, six tubes
(series a) containing solution A were each inoculated with two drops of
a similar solution, which was swarming with Bacteria.                   They were all
then plugged with cotton wool, exposed to the light for periods varying
from thirty minutes to eleven hours, and then encased, the duration of
sunlight received in each case being carefully noted.
    On July 31st four, which had received half, one, two, and three hours'
exposure respectively, were turbid with Bacteria.               The other two, how
ever, which had been exposed, the one for five and the other for eleven
hours, were clear at this date       ; but some days later the former contained
some Bacteria and a tuft of mycelium with sporidia, while the latter
showed a similar growth of mycelium but no Bacteria.                  These tubes had
received four and a half and nine hours' direct and powerful sunlight
respectively.
    On the same day six tubes (series b) containing the same solution, but
not inoculated, were similarly plugged, insolated, and encased.                  These
tubes all contained countless Bacteria on August 2nd.                  This somewhat
dissimilar    result  we  attribute    to  the  fact  that   for    series  a we pur
posely chose very narrow tubes, not exceeding a third of an inch in dia
meter, while those of series b were about two thirds of an inch.                   The
fact, however, that, while in Observation 7 we succeeded in steribzing a
solution by an exposure of nine hours, only three and a half hours of
which were direct sunlight,        nevertheless in Observation 8 (series b) we
find the same solution      breaking down after eleven hours, nine of which
were true insolation, we can only explain by supposing that external con
ditions — notably temperature — may retard or counteract the preservative
quality of the solar rays.      This point is one which calls for careful in
vestigation.     It  must  be understood,    however, that the putrefactive ten
dency of warmth does not in our experience, with this solution at least,
override what we have termed the preservative quality of light ; for, pro
vided that there was a full amount of sunlight, we have preserved tubes
exposed continuously from day to day as readily in hot weather as in
cool.

   An important result, we venture to think, in connexion with series a
of Observation 8, is the appearance of mycelial fungus in the two tubes
which were longest insolated.
   In the course of our investigation we have found that, when Bacteria ap
pear early and in large numbers in the solutions we have used, the mycelium
of Penicillium or other microscopic fungus is rarely seen, the Bacteria
apparently preoccupying the ground ; when, however, the development
of the Bacteria is from some cause retarded or prevented, we have fre
quently found tufts of delicate mycelium submerged in our experimental
solutions, after they have been encased or removed into diffused light.
An example of this is        seen    in Observation     3, and other instances might
be cited.    It is to be observed, however,       that no mycelium appeared during
the period of exposure of a solution, except under the conditions here
after stated, nor, indeed, afterwards, if this were sufficiently prolonged.
   We infer accordingly that light may retard or altogether prevent the
appearance of mycelial fungi, but that its influence in this respect is
slower and less powerful than upon the Schizomycetes.
   May not this explain, in part at least, the sparing distribution of
Bacteria in ordinary air as compared with the prevalence of the spores of
Penicillium <fcc., a fact observed by Burdon Sanderson and others, and
which our own experience tends to corroborate ?
   In the course of our investigation we found that, within certain limits,
the rapidity with which Bacteria appeared in the solution A was propor
tionate to its dilution.       This is illustrated in the following observation, in
which we took advantage of the greater resistance to decomposition of
the stronger solutions for the purpose of ascertaining whether diffused
light exerts any appreciable influence on the processes under considera
tion. We had already observed that diffused light did not prevent the
appearance of Bacteria in a solution when made in the strength given in
the Appendix      (A).
    Obs. 9. July    24. — Four solutions are prepared, so that —

    It  is right to state that the tubes of series 3 were inadvertently
exposed    to  about twenty minutes of sunlight on           J uly 24th ; but we do
not think that this materially interfered with the result, which demon
strates the preservative influence of diffused daylight alone, although in
less degree than that of the direct solar rays.
    The greater tendency of the more dilute solution to decomposition has
been pointed out.           We have again and again endeavoured to sterilize a
solution one tenth of the strength given in the Appendix (^4), but without
success.      Whether this failure was due to the unfavourable state of the
weather and clouded skies which have invariably supervened, or whether
in a solution of this strength the development of the Bacteria proceeds
with such rapidity that a warm night may in its favouring tendencies
outbalance the retarding influence of the day, we cannot say. We have,
however, notwithstanding one or two failures in dull, close weather,
repeatedly succeeded in sterilizing urine, and have at the present time in
our possession tubes containing that liquid which has been preserved
perfectly fresh and clear through the summer months.
     One example is given.
     Obs. 10. July 26. — Three test-tubes were partially filled with fresh
 urine of a golden sherry tint, and the mouth of each was guarded by a
 pledget of cotton wool.          Two were insolated, one encased.
     Aug. 1. — The contents of the encased tube were turbid and putrid, but
 the urine in the tubes which were exposed to the light remained perfectly
 pellucid.     One of these (a) was now encased, the other (b) was left as
 before.
     In about a week two small tufts of mycelium had appeared at the
 bottom of the tube marked a, the solution in which, however, was other
 wise perfectly clear.
     Oct. 13. —The urine in tube         b was as clear as when the experiment was
 first started, nor could any thing except mycelium with sporidia be dis
 covered in tube a on close examination with an immersion -fa".                   The
 urine in this tube had a strongly acid reaction.             On the other hand the
  urine in the tube which was encased from the first was so offensive as to
  render the examination of even a drop a disagreeable task.             It contaiucd

 494              Dr. A. Downes and Mr. T. P. Blunt on                [Dec. 6,
rods and dumb-bells in great numbers, and an abundance of the micro
cocci associated with the ammoniacal fermentation of urea.        The reaction
was alkaline.     Prolonged insolation, it may be noted, had a bleaching
effect on the urinary colouring-matter.
   Most of our preliminary observations have been made with Pasteur's
solution and with urine, but more recently we have experimented on some
hay-infusion.
   Obs. 11.   Sept. 22. — Three capillary tubes were filled with infusion
made from some very old hay.        One end of each was sealed off, the other
end having a small plug of cotton wool.         The infusion was of a deep
yellow-brown     colour.  Two  of the tubes  (a) were insolated, and one (b)
encased.
   A portion   also of the infusion was boiled for five minutes in a test-
tube, the mouth of which was closed during ebullition with cotton wooli
the tube (which was labelled c) being then placed in the dark.
   Oct. 7. —Each sample was closely examined under the microscope.          In
the encased tube b large numbers of moving rod-like Bacteria were seen ;
but in the insolated tubes a a very few moving particles alone were visible
to an immersion           The solution c, which had been boiled, contained a
large number of rods, of greenish tint, with slightly clubbed refractive
ends, for the most part motionless, and usually single.         None of these
were observed in the capillary tubes.
   In  some observations   with turnip-infusion made in May last we found
that while it became extremely rotten and offensive in those tubes which
were encased, in corresponding tubes exposed to the light it was com
paratively odourless, although the development of the Bacteria had not
been  wholly prevented.
   Judging from the following experiment with       zymase,   light would not
                                                     "
appear to exercise any retarding influence on the indirect fermenta."
    Obs. 12. — Some yeast water, four or five times filtered, was mixed with
weak syrup (which previously to the experiment was proved to have
scarcely any action on Fehling's solution) and placed in two test-tubes.
 One was encased in the usual way, the other was exposed for two hours
to full daylight, including about three quarters of an hour of direct
sunlight.
   At the end of this time,
         25 grain measures of Fehling's solution were reduced by 110 grain
              measures of the insolated liquid.
         25 grain measures of Fehling's solution were reduced by 112 of the
              solution from the encased tube.
   These results may be regarded as being, within the limit of experi
mental error, practically the same.
   What is the true account of this influence of light which has been
 shown to act so destructively on organisms by no means deficient in their
 tenacity of life ?   We do not profess to enter into this question at pre

sent any further than to state the results of one or two of the numerous
experiments which we have made in this direction.                 The first question
which presents itself is, with what rays of the spectrum is this property
of light coincident ?       Is it localized in any one part, or is the unbroken
pencil     of rays necessary?         The most definite result which we have
¦hitherto obtained is embodied        in the following experiment.
    Obs. 13. — On Oct. 8th       eighteen small test-tubes were partially filled
with    a solution, which was purposely made        of twice the strength given in
the Appendix,       and were then plugged with cotton wool.
    Three of these tubes were placed in each of four boxes, the sides of
which were made of blood-red, yellow, deep blue, and ordinary glass
respectively.      Of the remaining six tubes, three were encased, and three
were simply exposed to the light. All were placed as usual on an outside
window-ledge facing south-east.
    Oct. 11. — The encased tubes became turbid with innumerable Bacteria.
    Oct. 12. — The tubes in the yellow box were all clouded          with Bacteria.
    Oct.  13. — The   tubes in the red box showed signs of commencing tur
 bidity, all the other tubes remaining up to this time quite pellucid.
    Oct. 14. —All the red tubes were very turbid ; two of the tubes in the
 box of ordinary colourless glass were also slightly turbid.
    Oct. 17. — One blue tube has become slightly clouded with Bacteria.
    The tubes as they broke down were all carefully examined with a
 immersion.       No organisms other than the ordinary rod-shaped Bacteria
were seen in any, nor did these differ as regards their apparent vitality
 and activity.
    The remaining tubes in the blue glass case, those simply exposed to
 the light (i. e. not placed in any glass case), and the surviving tube of the
 three exposed in the box of ordinary window-glass have remained per
fectly clear to the     date of writing (Oct. 17th).       This experiment points
 forcibly   to the  actinic rays  of the  spectrum  as the  active agents ; we hesi
tate, however, to affirm this positively for the present.
    In the course of our investigation we have repeatedly had occasion to
 notice the proneness of mycelial fungi to appear (to the exclusion of
 Bacteria) in solutions which were themselves of a yellow colour, or were
subjected to yellow light. Thus tubes containing urine exposed to light
have several times developed a tuft of mycelium either during insolation
 or afterwards when encased.
    The following observation illustrates the same fact as regards the
 artificial   solution   with which      most   of our experiments        have  been
 made.
    Obs. 14.   May 30. — Three small test-tubes containing solution A were
 suspended in three larger tubes containing solution of picric acid of such
 strength as to represent three gradations of colour from a barely per
 ceptible yellow to a deep tinge of the same. Three corresponding arrange
 ments were made with pure distilled water in place of the picric acid.

496                Dr. A. Downes and Mr. T. P. Blunt on                [Dec. 6,
solution.    A tube containing some of the same Pasteur's solution was
encased in the usual manner and all were plugged with cotton wool.
   June 5. — The encased tube became turbid.
   June 8. — A tuft of mycelium appeared in the medium yellow.
   June 9. — The deep yellow became clouded with Bacteria.
   June 11. —Tufts of mycelium appeared in the faintly yellow.
   The tubes suspended in distilled water became sterilized, nor could
any thing save mycelial growths be discovered in either of the solutions
exposed to yellow light, with the exception of that suspended in the yellow
of deepest tint, in which Bacteria had appeared at an early period and
excluded the mycelium. This result we attribute to the apparent fact that
the less deep shades of yellow allow rays to pass which may at least check
the development of Bacteria, but are less potent in their influence on the
germs of the higher fungi, which accordingly develop the more readily
since they have not to struggle with the former for the mastery.       By this
indirect influence, therefore, rather than by any special and direct action,
we explain the tendency of mycelium to spring up in yellow light. This
explanation, moreover, is in accordance with our deduction that, although
the mycelial fungi are injuriously affected by light, they are nevertheless
more resistant to its influence than Bacteria.
   The breaking      down in Observation     13  of the tubes in the case of
window-glass     is remarkable when     contrasted  with the survival of the
solutions in the blue case.       We have, however, invariably found it a
difficult matter to sterilize an ordinary cultivation-liquid when a second
screen of glass was placed between it and the light.
   Early in the investigation it occurred to us that oxygen might be found
to play a part in the phenomena under observation.          Tubes containing
solution  A were   therefore exhausted at the Sprengel pump and sealed off,
our intention being, in the first place, to observe the effect of insolation in
the absence    of  an  atmosphere, filtered air being afterwards admitted.
To our surprise we found in a preliminary experiment that on breaking
the sealed points of the tubes under cotton wool, after the vacuum had
been maintained for two days, the solutions were perfectly sterilized and
could be preserved indefinitely.      This fact (which, we have since been
informed, was stated by Professor Tyndall in the Transactions of the Eoyal
Society this year) cut off for the present this mode of approaching        the
problem.
   The deductions which we draw from these simple experiments may be
summed up as follows : —
   1 . Light is inimical to the development of Bacteria and the microscopic
fungi associated with putrefaction and decay, its action on the latter
organisms being apparently less rapid than upon the former.
   2. Under favourable conditions it wholly prevents that development,
but under less favourable it may only retard.
   3. The preservative quality of light, as might       be expected, is   most

powerful    in the direct solar ray, but can be demonstrated to exist in
ordinary   diffused  daylight.
   4. So far as our investigation has gone it would appear that it is
chiefly, but perhaps not entirely, associated with the actinic rays of the
spectrum.
   5.  The fitness of   a cultivation-liquid to act as a nidus is not impaired
by insolation.
   6.  The germs originally present in such a liquid may be wholly
destroyed, and a putrescible fluid perfectly preserved by the unaided
action of light.
   Although there are many vital phenomena, both of plant-life and of
animal, whether in health or disease, to the elucidation of which may be
applied this quality of light (now demonstrated, so far as we are aware,
for the first time), we have endeavoured in this paper to confine ourselves
to the plain facts of our observations, and have studiously avoided specu
lation and theory. We cannot, however, refrain from offering one com
ment on the striking antagonism between these facts and many views
that have hitherto prevailed on the relation       of light to life. This rela
tion  has been   principally investigated  as regards the chlorophyl-cell ; but
chlorophyl may be regarded as simply an organ of nutrition adapted to
special circumstances, and differing essentially in its vital phenomena
from the true cellular tissue of the plant and its protoplasmic contents.
   It appears to us that the organisms which have been the subject of our re
search may be regarded simply as     individual "cells" or minute protoplasmic
masses specially fitted by    their transparency and tenuity for the demon
stration of physical and other influences.      May we not expect that laws
similar to those which here manifest themselves may be in operation
throughout the vegetable, and perhaps also the animal kingdom wherever
light has direct access to protoplasm ? On the one hand we have chloro
phyl, owing its very existence to light, and whose functions are deoxi
dizing ; on the other the white protoplasm, or germinal matter, oxidizing
in its relations, and to which, in some of its forms at least, the solar rays
are not only non-essential, but even devitalizing and injurious.
   This suggestion we advance provisionally and with diffidence ; nor do
we wish to imply that the relations of light to protoplasmic matter are
by any means so simple as might be inferred from the above broad
statement.

   It is self-evident that tubes exposed with a south-easterly aspect would
receive but a fraction of the total solar rays each day. We have not,
however, been able to place them in a position where they would be under
the direct influence of the sun during the whole period that it was above
the horizon ; with such an arrangement we should expect to obtain results
proportionately     greater.

                                       Postscript.
   We have stated in the preceding paper that, on exhausting tubes con
taining solution A by means of a Sprengel pump and sealing them, we
found that not only, as might be expected, did no development of
organisms occur under these conditions, but that if the vacuum was
maintained for a sufficient length of time, the solution became absolutely
barren.     Knowing the necessity of oxygen to Bacteria (of the ordinary
kind at least), and taking into consideration the products of their
" respiration,"    we inferred that this result was attributable     to the absence
of oxygen, and consequent asphyxia not only of the mature forms of
those organisms visible to the higher powers of the microscope, but also,
it necessarily followed, of that rudimentary " germinal
                                                                  "

eluding even the piercing test of the electric beam, is distributed with
extraordinary uniformity in almost every water.
   We observed, also, that we have since learned that this mode of
sterilization has been recently demonstrated by Professor Tyndall, with
a similar interpretation,       and on this account we did not consider it
worth while to enter upon any details of our own experiments in this
direction.      Within the last few weeks, however, we have, by employing
urine as the experimental fluid, obtained results of considerable interest,
and have thought it well to append some account of them.

   We concluded from this experiment that while three hours' vacuum
was insufficient     to sterilize   the solution   employed, one of eight      days
duration rendered      it absolutely barren, the latter fact being confirmed by
several repetitions of the experiment, one of which demonstrated the
sterilization  of the solution by two days' vacuum.
   On substituting urine for Pasteur solution different results were
obtained.
    Obs. 2. — A tube containing      fresh acid urine was on September 19 ex
hausted and sealed off.       On September 22 the capillary point was broken
under cotton wool.        On September 29 the contents were found to be
turbid with Bacteria.
   Having thus ascertained that urine resisted the sterilizing effects of a
vacuum for a period sufficiently long to enable us to test the effects of
insolation on this fluid in vacuo, we proceeded to carry out our original
plan of investigating the more intimate nature of the processes by which
light exerts its germicidal action. The result of this inquiry, so far as
it has gone, is shown in the following observation : —
   Obs. 3.   Oct. 26. — Of eight test-tubes containing     fresh acid urine, two,
which we will call aa, were simply plugged with cotton wool and insolated
in the ordinary way ; two, labelled a' a', were plugged and encased.            The
four remaining tubes were exhausted at the Sprengel pump and sealed ;
two, bb, were exposed for insolation, the remaining two, b'b' , being encased.
   Oct. 30. — a'a' were both swarming with Bacteria.
   Oct. 31. — The exhausted tubes, both insolated and encased (bb and b'b')
were distinctly and nearly equally turbid, the degree of cloudiness being,
if any thing, more marked in the insolated tubes bb.
   The urine in the tubes aa, which were insolated in the ordinary manner,
contained numerous small points of submerged growing mycelium, but
with this exception was perfectly bright and clear.
   Nov. 2. — On examination         with  a       immersion    objective numerous
rods in active movement were seen           in each  of the four tubes which had
been exhausted.
   The tubes a'a' also swarmed with bacterial life ; their contents were
putrid and slightly alkaline in reaction. The contents of the exhausted
tubes had in each case a disagreeable putrefactive odour, but the reaction
was still acid.
   The urine in tubes aa was acid and fresh in odour.             With the excep
tion of numerous mycelial tufts and one or two moving rods in the
meshes, nothing was seen in these tubes on microscopical examination.
This experiment was a repetition of two previous observations which
 gave similar results and need not be detailed.
    In  all cases exhaustion      at the Sprengel    pump was carried on until
 ebullition occurred in the liquid operated upon, and the mercury had for

gauge was attached to the pump.             We do not, of course, regard such a
vacuum as perfect ; but it was sufficient for our purpose, and, as regards
the Pasteur solution, proved fatal to the contained organisms.
    In   the experiment of which Obs. 3 is here given as an example we
observe, on the one hand, the prevention of bacterial development and
consequent growth of mycelial forms (the quantity of light being insuf
ficient for the destruction of these) in those tubes which were insolated in
the presence of ordinary atmospheric air.                On the other band we see
specimens of the same urine insolated to precisely the same degree as the
former, but, in the absence of an atmosphere, becoming turbid, even in vacuo,
with Bacteria as early as their encased congeners.
    This remarkable fact, then, appears to follow as a deduction, that a
vacuum (or approximation              to such) which of itself is a condition
antagonistic to the development of Bacteria, nevertheless shields these
organisms from the germicidal effect of light *.
    It is not our present purpose to speculate on the interpretation of the
phenomena here presented, nor should we be justified in so doing until
we have further extended our observations, and more fully confirmed the
curious results here provisionally detailed.
IV. " Points          of Resemblance between tbe Suprarenal Bodies of
        the Horse and Dog, and certain occasional Structures in the
        Ovary." By Charles Creighton, M.B., Demonstrator of
        Anatomy, Cambridge University.                    Communicated by Pro
        fessor Humphry, F.R.S. Received October 12, 1877.
                                        (Abstract.)
    The object of this communication is to prove, with the aid of accurate
drawings, that there exists an essential resemblance between the con
stituent parts of the suprarenal bodies of mammals and certain structures
in the mammalian ovary that are of occasional but normal occurrence.
The appearances on which the comparison is based are best seen in the
suprarenals of the dog and horse, and in the ovaries of the bitch.                  The
suprarenals of the horse and dog are known to have, immediately under
the fibrous tunic, a zone of follicles of singular though well-defined struc
ture.      The first point in the communication is one of criticism, and has
reference to the division of parts within the suprarenal.              It is held that
the outer zone of follicles, as they are seen in the horse and dog, are
quite unique among the structures composing the suprarenal, and are
broadly contrasted with the rest of the organ lying internal to them.
The contrast is unmistakable in these two animals, and it is equally
   * We wish, however,      to make it clear that we by no means insist on this explana
tion  ; the facts, indeed, admit of other explanations.

  well-marked   in the    foetal state of the organ in other mammals.       In
  opposition, therefore, to the usual subdivision of parts, it is proposed to
  limit the term " cortex " to the extreme outer zone consisting of the
  peculiar structures above-mentioned, and to apply the term "medulla"
  to the general mass or parenchyma of the organ which the outer zone
  covers, including in the medulla the extreme central and generally pig
  mented part to which the term " medulles " has been hitherto limited.
 This proposed rearrangement of terms is based upon the fact that the
  outer zone has no continuity of structure with the zones next to it ;
  whereas the extreme central       part differs from the neighbouring paren
 chyma in unessential       particulars, and chiefly in the character of the
 blood-vessels or blood-spaces within it.
     The comparison with structures in the ovary is based upon the above
 radical distinction of cortex and general parenchyma in the suprarenals,
 and is worked out in two sections dealing with the two parts respec
 tively.   The structures in the ovary to which the cortical follicles are
 compared are here described for the first time, and the discovery of
 them, and of their nature, has been the starting-point of the present
 investigation.   They are the remains of Graafian follicles within which
 the ovum, after reaching a degree of ripeness, has shrivelled up and
 disappeared.    The appearances in question are numerous in the ovaries
 of the bitch, especially towards old age. Their structure is perfectly
 definite and their occurrence tolerably uniform.       They are spoken of as
 obsolete Graafian   follicles, and are to be carefully distinguished from
 those Graafian follicles from which a ripe ovum has been successfully
 discharged.
    The ovarian structures to which the general parenchymatous mass of
 the suprarenal is compared are persistent corpora lutea, entirely solid
 and cellular.   This part of the comparison occupies the second section
 of the paper, and the details of it are referred to at the end of the
 abstract.
    Coming to the details of his comparison, the author first states the
facts relating to the cortical suprarenal structures.       Their form, espe
cially in the horse, appears different in the surface section and in the
perpendicular section.        But, premising that the same differences of
shape occur among the corresponding appearances in the ovary, they
may be taken to be essentially elongated closed cylinders, straight, or
curved, or tortuous, or doubled up. The cylinders are completely filled
with long and narrow epithelial-like cells arranged in close order across
their lumen, i. e. at right angles to their long axis. Each cell stretches
across, generally speaking, the whole width of the cylindrical space ;
the nucleus of a cell is generally towards one end, and the other end
is often pointed. Cells appear alternately to arise from opposite sides of
the space, their pointed or relatively free extremities interlocking among
the nuclear or basal ends of the cells opposite.

    The  same appearances are produced     in the ovary in the following way.
The Graafian follicle may be in a more or less advanced stage of ripeness.
Either the membrana granulosa may closely invest the ovum, or it may
be separated from the ovum (within its cumulus proligerus) by the cavity
for the liquor folliculi.     In the former class of cases, the membrana
granulosa has a short circuit, in the latter it has a very much longer
circumference.     Within a follicle of either class the ovum decays, and
the remains of it are expelled or absorbed. The circuit of the membrana
granulosa has been broken, and the circular belt of cells is found either
to have straightened itself out, if it were of small extent, or to have be
come folded or thrown into sinuosities if it belonged to one of the more
distended or riper class of follicles.       What remains of the aborted
Graafian follicle is the membrana granulosa, in the form of a longer or
shorter cylindrical body, straight, or slightly curved, or sinuous, or
doubled up. These long, narrow, and variously curved cylinders, as they
are found, in their ultimate state of quiescence, in the substance of the
ovary, have the most remarkable superficial resemblance to the cortical
cylinders of the suprarenal.     But the resemblance in minute structure
is still more remarkable. While the ovum was shrivelling up or decaying,
the round and nuclear cells of the membrana       granulosa were taking the
 shape of long and narrow columnar epithelial cells, stretching from one
side of the belt to the other.   These cells have their nucleus towards one
end, and the cell is seated by that end either upon the outer or concave
circumference of the belt, or upon the opposite convex or inner circum
ference, the two sets of cells interlocking with their free ends across the
 space.    Comparing a given length of such ovarian cylinder with a corre
 sponding length of cylinder in the suprarenal, the minute points of
 resemblance are as follows : — Both cylinders are completely filled with
cells packed in close order across their long axis ; the cells have precisely
the same length and breadth, the same relation of attached ends and free
 ends, the former uniformly broad and containing the nucleus, and the
 latter pointed and interlocking with the attached end opposite.           As
regards cell-substance, and size and shape of nucleus, no differences are
 discernible.
    The structures from two different organs, that are here brought into
 comparison, not only resemble one another closely, but they are each
 of them unlike any thing else in the body. The origin of the structures
 in the ovary can be traced in the clearest manner ; they are the remains
 of Graafian follicles within which the ovum has aborted or decayed.
 The conclusion is that the cortical structures of the suprarenal are the
 obsolete condition of follicles that, in their active period, resembled the
 existing Graafian follicles ; and that conclusion is so far in accordance
 with the hypothesis, based upon independent evidence, that the supra
renal body as a whole (and in its several parts) is an obsolete organ.
    In  the suprarenals of other mammals besides the dog and horse, the

structure of the cortical zone is not of a kind to suggest or to bear out
the above comparison.          But, according to Henle, the peculiar structures
of the horse and dog are occasionally found in other mammals.                    An
occasional reappearance is what might be looked for in an obsolete
structure.     But, exact similarity apart, there is in the suprarenals of all
mammals a zona          glomerulosa, which corresponds to the cortical zone
above described ; and the zona glomerulosa, being subject only to laws of
heredity, and not to laws of function, may be considered in most
mammals to have lost those distinctive features which survive, for un
explained reasons, in the dog and horse. Again, as regards the parallel
structures in the ovary, they are seen clearly in the bitch, are indistinctly
seen in the cat, and are not to be distinguished in the mare.             But those
differences    are   not    fatal to the generalization,     and explanations    are
offered of them.
   In the second section of the paper the author describes the resem
blance of the general intracortical mass of the suprarenal to another
class of ovarian structures, viz. corpora lutea.           The corpora lutea here
spoken of are large cellular masses of very definite and stable struc
ture, occurring at various points in the ovary, and in some cases of so
great extent as to transform the ovary into an organ of altogether new
appearance.       Instances are referred to of ovaries from the mare and
bitch in 'which corpora lutea seemed to have greater persistence than is
usually attributed to them, and it is held that the prevalent theory of
the circumstances of their         formation     and decay  is not comprehensive
enough.
   Taking, however, the corpora lutea as they are found, and directing
attention to their minute structure, they have the following points of
resemblance to the intracortical mass of the suprarenal.               Both struc
tures are cellular throughout, and the individual cells are the same. The
cells are epithelial-like and polyhedric, with a central nucleus and a wide
zone of cell-substance.         The cell-substance in both cases is so coarsely
granular   as  often   to  resemble   the vitellus of the mammalian ovum, and
in both cases the granular protoplasm is sometimes replaced or occu
pied by a vacuole. The one point of difference is that the cells of the
corpus luteum are half as large again as those of the suprarenal paren
chyma.     The second point is that the cells in both cases are set in a fine
meshwork of fibres connected with the walls of the capillaries.             Thirdly,
there is, in both, the same radial arrangement of blood-vessels (capil
laries) from centre to circumference.              Fourthly, the central vein or
system   of   venous lacuna?      of  the suprarenal has its counterpart in the
corpus luteum.       Lastly, there are points of resemblance relating to the
pigmentation      of the respective structures.
    Although it is not essential to the justice of the comparison that the
 obsolete Graafian follicles should have the same position round the cir
cumference of corpora lutea which the cortical           suprarenal  follicles have
                                                                    2k   2

round the parenchyma of that organ, yet there is to be seen in many
preparations a curious similarity in that respect also.
   The present communication does not go beyond a statement of points
of resemblance. The corpus luteum, which enters so largely into the
comparison, is itself as much an unsolved problem as the suprarenal.         It
may    be said, however,  to afford better opportunities of study ;  and if the
resemblance above outlined be a resemblance in essentials, a sound theory
of the suprarenal as a whole will probably be found to depend upon a
sound theory of the corpus luteum.

    If  the bulb of an ordinary thermometer be coated chemically with
silver, and then electrically with a metallic deposit, the mercury will
traverse some portion of the scale, and finally take up a definite posi
tion, independently of temperature.        To this phenomenon    I  have given
the name electrostriction.    Of the metals hitherto worked with, copper,
silver, iron, and nickel constrict the bulb   ; zinc and cadmium distend it.
   The general conditions under which the experiments were made were
as follow : — A thermometer coated with silver by immersion in a solution
of ammoniacal argentic tartrate was placed vertically near a bare ther
mometer at one side of a depositing cell ; the anode stood at a distance
of 11 centimetres. The bulbs of the thermometers were about their own
depth below the surface of the electrolyte ; the covered one was turned
half round at every comparison.        The source of electricity was a pint

   The difference between experiment and calculation in the last value
of y is doubtless due to the considerable amount of stratification observed
in the electrolyte, which had not been stirred subsequently to the last
observation.      Omitting this result, the probable error of a single com
parison of the calculated with the found values of y is -056. The calculated
total ascent is 11-22 scale-units.     By continuing the preceding experi
ment, but with two Daniell's cells, for 23£ hours longer, 10-933 units
were actually attained.
   A thermometer (" 502 ") having a very nearly spherical bulb was next
employed; its polar axis (a line representing the prolongation of the
mercurial thread) measured 11-73 millimetres, its equatorial axis 11-55
millimetres.      This instrument was prepared in the same manner as the
preceding, immersed vertically in the electrolyte, and turned halfway
round every half-hour. Even deposition on a sphere is, under such cir
cumstances, out of the question, most of the metal being precipitated on

its equatorial, and much less on the polar regions.         The registered rise
was the height of the mercury in melting ice. After the twenty-second
hour, and as soon as the scale had been read with the kathetometer, the
mercury rose spontaneously 0*16 of a unit. The subsequent observations
 are accordingly lessened by this amount.         The equation is —

At  the end of the experiment the deposit was found to be somewhat cor
rugated, but fairly satisfactory.    The electrolyte had the disadvantage of
being freshly prepared, and not having been         continuously   worked prior
to this deposition.
                       Value of the Electrostrictive Effect.
   In  order to ascertain the value of the electrostrictive       effect, thermo
meter 454 was adjusted in a water-pressure apparatus capable of indi
cating about 2| atmospheres : it was then submitted to uniform com
pression, and the resulting ascent of the mercury in its stem noted.
Two    sets of observations at higher pressures showed, after the usual
reductions, that   a unit of scale corresponded to 8-2 and 8-5 atmospheres
respectively ; the mean is 8-3 atmospheres.        After this the bulb of the
instrument was unfortunately broken, while preparing it for considerably
increased compression.       I have, however, little hesitation in accepting
this result as a datum for calculating the total electrostrictive effect at
much higher readings.      Similarly with thermometer 502, a depression of
0°-199 C. was caused     by opening ; this would correspond to 5-03 atmo
spheres per scale-unit.      Again, ten experiments with thermometer 455
 were conducted in an Andrews's duplex apparatus (a most admirable

instrument for such a purpose), at pressures varying from 49-4 to 133-6
atmospheres.       By these it was found that a scale-unit corresponds, in
this case, to 9-44 atmospheres, with a probable error of 0-1 atmosphere
for a single determination.

    It thus appears that the extreme force at work on the bulbs must have
 been very considerable.
                       Subsidiary Experiments and Remarks.
    (1) An instrument having a general resemblance to a thermometer was
 constructed with a cylindrical caoutchouc bulb, about 30 millimetres long
 by 11 millimetres wide.          The bulb was rendered conductive, and then
 made a kathode      in the copper bath already referred to          ;  it was frequently
 turned half round.        In the course of a day it had become coated with a
 sufficiently  thick  layer    of metal, and had then undergone most palpable
 collapse. We have here, therefore, a real case of local constrictive effect.
    (2) Two flat microscopic slides of the usual size were silvered chemically
 and then made the kathode in a similar circuit. After twenty-four
 hours, the deposited copper on both slides was found to be arched down
 wards and inwards, towards the anode ; the deposits were in fact, owing
 to their contiguity, to a great extent united.              The upper parts of the
 deposits had torn themselves away from the glass ; and two close parallel
 lines cut through the silver of one of the plates had the copper between
 them curled inwards like a gutter.              From this evidence it was inferred
 that the cylindrical deposit, if cut in the direction of its length, would
 spring   open.     Such was found to be actually the case even with the
 copper   deposited    on the caoutchouc bulb ; and to a still greater extent
 with copper overlying some of the same caoutchouc, where that material
 was stretched over a glass shoulder for the purpose of fastening, and
 there did not admit of collapse.           The opening backwards of nickel                and
 iron films has already been noticed.

    (3) The electrostrictive effect brings vividly to the mind the ordinary
phenomenon of contraction during cooling — differing, perhaps, but little
from that phenomenon, except in the circumstance that it is brought
about without necessary change of temperature.              The electrolyte is, in a
manner, a melted metal. This view did not, of course, admit of experi
mental illustration in the case of the metals to which reference has been
made. It was, however, conceived that substances other than metallic
should yield the result in question, and a specimen of hard paraffin was
selected for trial.      This was heated to a point not far from that of
fusion, and thermometer 454 was dipped into it several successive times.
The following table shows the constriction           obtained.

    These results were confirmed by a second set of experiments.              In each
set, the coating    of  paraffin  was found   to   he vertically  fissured before the
conclusion of the observations ; this accounts for the gradual diminution
of the effect.
    (4) Electrostricting metal appears to be in a partially unstable condition.
Thus a decided fall is observable in a coated thermometer after the
deposit has had its surface disturbed by sand-papering or filing ; this
was noticed both with silver and copper.               On the other hand, the con
strictive effect is increased by heating the deposit to 100°, or by keeping
in ice. Thermometer C, for example, having had its zero raised electro-
strictively to   30-52, showed an elevation         to 5°-00 after heating for ten
minutes to 100°, afterwards falling permanently to 40-86.               Thermometer
50 had its zero raised in a similar manner to l0-87 ; this was increased to
20,96 by a temperature        of 100°. In another experiment with the same
thermometer, a like increase from 0°-65 to 0°-79 was recorded ; the latter
number rose spontaneously to 0°-90 in the course of six months.                Again,
two similar thermometers (103 and 104) were electrostricted at about
 10° C, and the zero was found to rise by heating, as before. The zero of
 103 then fell gradually, during nine months, from 4°-73 to 4°-37 ; that
of 104 fell during two months from 2°-01 to l°-80, and then rose during
 seven   months to 20-14.        Thermometer       101, made     exactly on the same
pattern,    but left uncoated, exhibited      the usual continuous ascent of zero
 during   the  same period, viz. from 0o,07 to 0o-31 in nine months.              All
 three thermometers showed identical and normal readings at 100°.               Pacts
 like these prove that the nature of the deposit requires further elucida
 tion.   In any case the best evidence of electrostrictive effect is gained,

with copper at least, at the melting-point of         ice ; and it is not improbable
that copper deposited at or near 100° would not show any such effect at
any temperature.       One circumstance may be mentioned as bearing on
this point, viz. that the electrostrictive effect is greater, and more rapidly
produced, at the winter temperature than at that of summer.                  It may
be added    that soft metallic deposits are, as a rule, obtained from heated
electrolytes.
   (5) Uniform external pressure on          a cylinder takes effect chiefly on the
diameter, and less on the length ; and these results are practically in
dependent of each other *. If we conceive such pressure to be produced
by the electric deposition of successive layers of metal (as was actually
the case with thermometer         502),   it  seems   reasonable to suppose that
each of the layers will have nearly the same constrictive effect.            But the
first layer constricts the bulb alone ; the second constricts the first also ;
the third its predecessors, and so on. Hence the observed effect upon
the bulb should diminish at compound interest.                   If y be the total
obtainable effect after a time x, D the portion of it due to diametral
constriction,   L  the portion    of it due to longitudinal constriction, and
d and I the respective geometric factors, we have, in the case of the
cylindrical thermometer,
                                    y=D<f+Lf,
D being always greater than L.               On the other hand, the spherical
thermometer necessarily receives more metal upon its equatorial region
than can be deposited above or below, that region being nearer to the
anode ; and the longitudinal constrictive action must tend to bulge the
equatorial part, opposing the constriction         at work there.
   Hence we have, for the sphere,
                                    y=D<f-I/,
D being the greater    as before.      Nevertheless     it appears probable that in
both    cases, at the early stage of deposition, the difference between
diametral and longitudinal compression is but slight, not having yet been
much multiplied by the increased stress. Hence, during that period, an
equation
                                      y = Vd
may doubtless more accurately represent the experimental results.
Subject to this and some other minor considerations (the close discussion
of which would be out of place in mere indicative work) there is a fair
agreement between theory and experiment.               The probable error, in fact,
of a single observation does not on the whole exceed -053 of a scale-
unit, being about "4 per cent, on the total quantity determined ; and this
reduces to less    than '3 per cent., if we exclude           the first comparisons,
made at a lower temperature,        in Table I.

   (6) We    have seen in(4) that metals may be deposited on a thermo
 meter bulb and then deprived of a determinate part of their electro-
 strictive power, and that there is an experimental possibility of deposit
ing them with none of this effect. We are therefore in a position to
compare, one with the other, the two states of the same metal.        The
electrostricted metal (submitted, as may have been the case, to more than
a hundred atmospheres' compression) must oppose the effect of a solvent
much more than that which is soft and no longer the subject of electro-
striction.   In other words, a gramme of the former should require more
of a reagent to dissolve it than should the latter, under the same con
ditions.    But this excess corresponds to a known amount of electro-
strictive effect, which, again, is known in atmospheres pressure.     We
ought therefore to be in a position to measure chemical effect in atmo
spheres pressure.
   My best thanks are due to Professor .Sir William Thomson for the
loan of an Andrews's apparatus : to Professor George Forbes, for a
pressure machine ; and to Mr. W. H. Walenn for much practical                      advice
in connexion with electro-metallurgy.

                F.R.S. Received August 11, 1877.
   Itis now many years since        I   first began to examine air so as to obtain
decidedly those bodies which            have from    the earliest times been sup
posed to exist in it, bringing with them, on certain occasions, some
of the worst results.  About eight years ago (that              is,
                                                     in 869), after       1
giving  ashort summary of some of my work in the Journal of the
Scottish Meteorological Society, used these words — " For satisfactory

investigation of the subject, one must look to the multiplication of these
experiments, and perhaps to the establishment of    department at some

although my numerous engagements may well form a kind of apology.
My present object is partly to draw attention to the fact of my proposal
and not to let it be forgotten, and it is also combined with another object,
namely, to speak of methods of study or experiments which have been tried.
   In obtaining specimens of any soluble or insoluble body from the
atmosphere,           I
               have washed the air with pure water —that     have shaken        is,

except         by   me, has been to pass the    air through water.

found both in the tubes through which the air passed before entering
the water.            This little incident   made an era          in all my inquiries. I tried
minutely pointed tubes, but did not succeed,                       and for the same reason, or
rather for that and an additional reason, viz. the minuteness                           detained
the air longer in the tubes, and the result was worse.

   These results are very irregular.                It was thought that the solution of
barium hydrate used was rather weak.                      With a much stronger solution
the following experiments were made.

   It   is clear from these experiments that a series of three washing-
bottles    containing barium hydrate are not sufficient to absorb the
carbonic acid from the air aspirated through them ; with a series of six
bottles it is troublesome to work, but more, and perhaps all, is obtained.
Equal speeds are compared here and equal solutions.                            With the three
absorbents the strong baryta solution gave still too little.

    I have not, in my usual experiments, separated the solid particles of
the air, because we must breathe them. It was thought better to examine
them by what is called Wanklyn's process for organic nitrogen.        My
reason for that is given elsewhere.    never did receive   I                           it as    a method        of
obtaining  all the  nitrogen  in every substance ; but                                 I    did receive

in the places examined, the organic ammonia has been in intimate rela

    1." There are not found in the spectra of different nebulae the dif
ferences of relative brightness of the bright lines and of the continuous
spectrum which would be expected on Mr. Stone's hypothesis.
   2. " The star-clusters which are just within the resolving-power of the
largest telescope do not give, even faintly,                          a   spectrum of bright lines.

    3.
        " The    same bright lines appear to be common to all the nebulas
which give a bright-line spectrum.          On Mr. Stone's view, differences in
the constitution of the enclosing atmospheres of different star-groups
would be probable."
    Upon the first point      I must   remark that, after an examination of the
spectra of the nebulas of Orion and ij Argus,          I  am not   of Mr. Huggins's
opinion.
    The second point appears to            me confirmatory       of my views. The
irresolvability that     I  contemplate, as connected with bright-line spectra,
does not arise from the sensible vanishing of the angles subtended by the
distances between the isolated stellar masses of the cluster.             In this ease
the spectra would be continuous.           In my paper in the ' Proceedings ' for
April 19,      I   state this point as follows : — " The linear spectrum can
only appear when the resolvability of the cluster is at least injuriously
affected by the light of the gaseous envelopes becoming sensibly propor
tional to that from the stellar masses, and in the majority of such cases
it would only be in the light from the irresolvable portions of the
cluster that bright lines could be seen in the spectrum."               By irresolva
         I
 bility here mean something independent of the power of any particular
telescope used.
    With respect to Mr. Huggins's third objection           I must   remark that the
 difficulty   is neither    greater   nor less, whether     my  views  be accepted or
 rejected.      It  cannot be more difficult    to conceive that the same gas is
 present and predominant in certain isolated stellar clusters than that              it
is present and predominant in certain isolated irregular masses.
    With respect to the objection which appears to have been raised by
 Professor Stokes, " that in a star-cluster in which the stars are surrounded
 by self-luminous atmospheres, the proportion between the sum total of
 the light from the stars and the light from the atmospheres will be in
 dependent of the distance of the cluster from us."                  Such, no doubt,
 would be true in the kind of clusters Professor Stokes has in contempla
 tion.     I have,   rather unfortunately, in my paper of April 19, spoken of
 a "close stellar- cluster," without, perhaps, explaining with sufficient
 clearness that the comparative closeness to which            I  refer is not optical
 but linear.       The clusters  I  contemplate are only close in the sense that
 the individual stellar masses must be close enough to destroy the isolation
 of the vaporous surroundings, and thus give rise to a gaseous envelope
 continuous over the whole or over portions of the stellar cluster.              I am
 quite aware, theoretically, as well as from experiment, that the spectra
 of many clusters, however much they may be condensed to a centre, must
 be continuous        and not    linear.  In   fact, according to my views, the
 question     whether     a  cluster  which  was    irresolvable with our present
 optical means would give a continuous or linear spectrum, would depend
 on whether the irresolvability resulted from the vanishing of its linear
 dimensions, or from the light of the stellar masses in any given direction

having become sufficiently enfeebled in comparison with the light of the
intercepted area of the gaseous envelope.            The continuousness of the
gaseous envelope      I  contemplate   is a   physical, not a mere optical, con
tinuity.

    Let   A  and  B  be two of the stars    of such   a cluster, C  D  a section  of
the dispersed gaseous envelope enveloping the cluster.
    Then the light falling within the solid angle at O may be considered to
arise from the star A and the area C D of the gaseous envelope.
    Suppose the system removed to a greater distance.               The light from
 the star A is diminished in the proportion of the inverse square of the
 distances, while that from C D is sensibly equal to that from CD'.             The
question, therefore, whether such a cluster would, according to my views,
 end in becoming a nebula or a mere optical cluster, would depend upon
 whether it would be possible, with any supposed distribution of stellar
 masses and vaporous envelopes, to diminish the brightness of the star A
 below that given by the intercepted area C D of the enveloping surface,
 before the star B has been brought to strengthen the beam of light which
 gives the continuous spectrum. In the one case we should have absolute
 irresolvability at that and all greater distances with any optical means at
 our disposal ; in the other irresolvability, which might become resolv-
 ability with increase of optical power. The case of two stars is of course
 only taken for simplicity ; it is the proportional increase in other
 cases which has to be considered.          I  have chiefly had in contemplation
nebulae like those of Orion and 17 Argus, which extend over large angular
 distances   ; but at great distances such nebulae might assume the character
 of planetary nebulae.    I see no difficulty in conceiving stellar clusters such
 as those   I contemplate,   which would give rise to bright-line spectra ; and
 I  believe that the more the matter is examined the larger will be the
 number of facts which will be found to group themselves around the
 hypothesis which     I have  suggested.

    In the Journal of the Chemical Society, November 1868, we first pub
lished an account of the " Chloride-of-Silver Battery."             Since 1874 we
                                                                    2o2

 520        Messrs.   W. De La Rue and H. W. Miiller                on  [Dec. 13,
 have commenced working with it systematically, and have gradually aug
 mented the number of cells ; we now possess 8040 in actual work, and
 have 2680 more completed, but not charged with fluid.               Amongst the
 8040 cells now in use are the first 1080 constructed in 1874, experiments
 with which we described on the 24th February, 1875*. Subsequently
 from time to time we have communicated to the Society some of the
 results we have, arrived at, and in the detailed communication of which
 the present is a short abstract we have given the full particulars of our
 experiments.    The paper in question deals mainly with the striking-
 distance between terminals of different forms in air and in other gases at
 ordinary atmospheric pressures, and in air at reduced pressures short of
 the partial vacua of the so-called vacuum tubes.            Besides these experi
 ments the paper describes the effects of currents of high tension in
 inducing secondary currents, and also their effects in inducing mag
netism.
    We have found that the discharge of the battery, with one or two
poles in the form of a point, presents several interesting phenomena
which precede the true jump of the spark, and which do not occur
with other forms of terminals — for example, disks or spherical surfaces.
With 8040 cells the striking-distance betw een a paraboloidal point, posi
tive, and a disk is about 0'34 in. (8•64 millims.) ; but there is always a
luminous discharge, very apparent, far beyond the distance measurable
by our micrometer-discharger, namely 1•16 inch (29-5 millims.), as we
have before stated  t.
    The current which passes during the luminous discharge which pre
cedes the jump of the true spark is extremely feeble in comparison with
that which takes place after the spark has passed and the voltaic arc has
formed ; even when the point and disk are not more distant than -02
inch beyond the striking-distance (0-34 inch) for 8040 elements, it is only
TEWi Part 0f     i moreover the current is diminished to j-g-i'oTT 0£ that of
the arc when the point and disk are 1•16 inch distant.
    The appearance of the discharge is very different, according as the
point is positive or negative ; it is intermittent in both cases, but is much
less discontinuous when the point is negative than when it is positive, as
can be seen with a microscope having a rotating mirror placed in the bend
of the body, between the objective and eyepiece.                 The appearances
observed are shown in the wood engravings which illustrate the paper.
   When a point and a disk 1•5 inch diameter are used as terminals, and a
band of glazed writing-paper l-5 inch wide, and say 0-00425 inch thick,
is placed on the disk, a very strong adhesion of the paper to the disk
take?  place, and it requires a very strong pull, when 8040 cells are em
ployed, to make the paper slide on the disk ; the adhesion is strongest
when the point is negative.      The strain required to make the paper slide

on the disk was 30,000 grains with the point negative, and 18,000 grains
when it was positive : to reproduce these strains the paper had to be
loaded with 129,600 and 53,530 grains respectively after the current had
been shut off.
   When terminals with plane or spherical surfaces are used, the luminous
phenomena preceding the jump of the spark do not take place, and there
is scarcely an appreciable adherence between the band of paper and the
terminals ; it generally takes a diagonal position, forming a bridge between
them.
   Between a point and a disk the spark is longest with the point positive,
when from 5000 to 8000 cells are used ; but for a less number of ele
ments, 1000 to 3000, it is longest when the point is negative.
   The length of the spark is greatly influenced by the form of the point :
thus with a point in the form of a cone of 20 degrees the striking-distance
is 0-184 inch with 5640 cells and 0-267 inch with 8040; while with a
point approaching a paraboloid in form, and with the same base and of
the same height as the cone, it is 0-237 inch with 5640 cells and 0-343
inch with 8040.        The ratios 1^=0-776            and §2?=0-778, almost iden-

tical, represent the proportion which exists between the length of spark
obtained with a conical point and one paraboloidal in form.
   The striking-distance between a point and a plate is in accordance,
very nearly, with the hypothesis of this distance increasing in the direct
ratio of the square of the number of elements, at all events up to 8040
cells, thus *: —

    Between     plane, spherical, or cylindrical surfaces the striking-distance
does not    follow  this law ; on the contrary, the increase is nearly, but not
quite, in the ratio of the number of cells.             We have given the striking-
distance   from    1000    to 8000    volts,  between     spherical surfaces 1*5 inch
diameter and 3 inches radius, in the Proceedings, No. 182, so that it is only
necessary here to state the striking-distance for

    The nature of the metal used for terminals has, in almost all cases, no
influence on the length of the spark ; but there is one striking exception,
namely, in the case of aluminium. When an aluminium point is used the
spark is longer than with points of all other metals tried in the ratio of
1-242 to 1.
    The length of the spark is different in various         gases — for example, air,
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid ; and the ratio between the
lengths of spark in various gases varies with the forms of the terminals.
The length of the spark bears no simple relation either to the density of
the gas or its viscosity *.
    The paper contains an account of a few experiments on the length of
spark in air at different pressures, from 141-5 millims. to 760 millims.
Between a point and a disk the length of the spark increases nearly, but
not quite, in the ratio of the dilatation ; but between two spherical sur
faces it increases far more rapidly, and it is possible that at a certain
degree of rarefaction the striking-distance may be coincident for spherical
surfaces and points.
    The appearance of the          voltaic  arc at ordinary     pressures differs in
different gases.
    In air   (possibly also in other gases) the arc, when examined with the
microscope, presents a stratified appearance, especially in the barrel-
 shaped surrounding of the central brilliant spindle.             The striae are very
close, and can be seen with difficulty even when the microscope, with a
rotating minor, is employed for the examination of the arc.
    In hydrogen, with the point positive, the central spindle of the arc is
 surrounded with a beautiful blue halo resembling a glass shade illumi
nated with fluorescent light.           With the point negative the arc moves
about rapidly and forms a sort of star on the positive disk.               Before the
jump of the spark, when the point is negative, the luminous discharge
 has the appearance of a pale olive halo, in form like a glass shade, extend
 ing from the point to the periphery of the disk.
    In   nitrogen the arc is reddish violet      ; in oxygen it presents the same
appearance as in air.
    When a strong resistance is interposed in the circuit, 4,000,000 ohms
for example, the discharge is completely changed in character ; instead of
  the ordinary spark and production of the voltaic arc, very brilliant snap-

ping sparks pass between the terminals at more or less rapid intervals,
exactly like the sparks of a small Leyden jar.           They pierce writing-
paper with   minute   holes.   It  is usually necessary to approach the ter
minals to a distance of 0-3 inch, when the striking-distance of 8040 cells
is 0-34 inch, in order to produce this static discharge.
   It has been found that an accumulated charge of a condenser of 42,8
microfarads capacity, charged with the potential of 3240 cells, produced
neither an elongation nor a contraction of a metallic rod 0-2 inch when
suddenly discharged through.         This charge deflagrates 10-5 inches of
platinum wire 0-0125 inch in diameter.
   More dense sparks were obtained with one of Apps's coils for pro
ducing 6-inch sparks when the primary was connected with 1080, 2280,
3480 chloride-of-silver   cells, than when     it was used  with a zinc-carbon
bichromate-of -potash battery of 6 cells, producing a current 300 times as
great, thus showing the influence of high potentials in inducing se
condary currents.
   These currents of high potentials have also a marked effect in inducing
 magnetism, when the actual current is taken into account.
   The second part of the paper, which is in course of preparation, will
 deal with the 'discharge in rarefied gases, in the so-called vacuum tubes.

 I. "Notes     on Supersaturated Saline Solutions."              By Charles
          Tomlinson, F.R.S. Received September 14, 1877.
   There is probably no subject in science that is more involved in con
tradiction than that of supersaturation.        All the phenomena connected
with it seem    to behave differently  in  the hands of different inquirers, so
that the facts affirmed by one writer are simply denied by another ; and
the same theory which seems to have been disproved by one is again and
again brought forward by another.
   Take one point by way of example, namely, the nuclear action of
bodies in producing the sudden crystallization of a supersaturated saline
 solution.   Ziz, in 1809, stated that not only air, but solids, act best as
 nuclei when dry : if wet, or boiled with the solution, or thrown into it

•while hot and allowed to cool          with it, they are inactive.    L<iwel   (1850-57)
denies that air, whether  wet or dry, has any nuclear action ; but he
admits that solids exposed to the air become active, and that alcohol is
always active.   Selmi and Goskynski, in 1851, assert that dry air is
nuclear, and acts by getting rid of water at the surface, and producing
small crystals there which continue the action.       This seems to be a
revival of Gay Lussac's theory, namely, that air is absorbed at the surface
of the solution and precipitates a portion of the salt in the same way
that one salt may precipitate another, and this precipitate continues the
crystallization.  Lieben, in 1854, states that soot is a nucleus, also
platinum    black whether ignited or not ; that pounded glass heated in
sulphuric acid produces     sudden   crystallization, but that platinum
sponge and precipitated sulphate of baryta after being heated have no
action.  Schroder, in 1859, remarks that it is always a matter of chance
whether such or such a substance produces crystallization.   " Such facts,"
he says, " singularly increase the difficulty of interpreting theoretically
the phenomena of supersaturation."    He concludes that the only general
rule that can be admitted in the presence of so many opposed and con
tradictory results is that bodies act on supersaturated solutions only
after having been exposed to the air.  In 1866 Gernez and Viollette and
in 1868 Schiff are satisfied that there is only  one nucleus for a super
saturated solution, and that is a salt of the same kind as the one in solu
tion or one isomeric therewith.    In 1866 Jeannel opposes this theory of
pancrystallography, as he calls           it,
                                   on the ground that     cannot be sup
                                                                      it
posed that crystals, often of rare salts, are to be found waiting in the
atmosphere, ready to enter our flasks as soon as they are uncovered.
Pellogio* also, in 1875, "gives proofs that the phenomena of supersatu
ration are not so simple            French physicists would imply, namely,
                                as the
that the only nucleus      issalt of the same kind," seeing that some super
                                a
saturated solutions, such as those of hyposulphite of soda, acetate of
lead, acetate of soda, &c, may be exposed to the air, in places where the
air   any thing but still, for fifteen or twenty days without the formation
      is
of crystals. He states further that porous bodies are active, such as
common sponge, platinum black, iron reduced by hydrogen, and carbon.
For example, carbon was raised to     red heat, quenched under mercury,
                                                a

set in and spread all through the mass. Viollette, on the contrary, finds
that bodies greedy of water and capable of being hydrated, such as the
fused sulphates of copper and of iron, and porous bodies recently cal
cined, such as carbon, have no action on supersaturated saline solutions.
    In the midst of all this conflict of testimony, my own results were not
likely to escape censure. Gernez and others opposed me and Professor   ;

Grenfell, some eighteen months ago, joining in the opposition, having
told me of his experiments,        I  asked him to prepare a paper on the subject.
In this *,    as  also  in a second paper, he is at variance with all his pre
decessors.       In  his second   paper he gives a summary of the three prin
cipal theories that have been propounded, and goes into minute experi
mental detail in support of his own objections to them and of his own
views.      His theory rests on absorption, which, it will be seen above, is
not so novel as he supposes it to be.
    There is one point upon which all observers, down to the time of Prof.
Grenfell, are agreed, namely, that if a supersaturated solution, say of
Glauber's salt, boiling in a flask, be tied over with bladder and left until
cold,   it will, if the bladder be pierced, immediately become solid. Indeed
this has long been a common lecture-table experiment ; and                I  thought it
a step in advance when         I showed    that if this experiment      be made    in the
open air of the country, the solution remains liquid.                  I  also exposed
solutions to the air of my garden with various results, as              I have already
had the honour of describing to the Society t. But Prof. Grenfell goes
far beyond any thing that I, or previous observers, have done ; he exposes
these solutions to the air of rooms, places them on various surfaces,
handles them, makes mud pies with them +, and yet they do not crystal
lize. It is probable that his minute method of dealing with drops may
alter the conditions ; but certainly in the air of my house and garden                    I
cannot expose my flasks as he does his drops without producing sudden
solidification.
    I  will give two or three out of a multitude of similar results. Last
summer      I made    a strong solution    of sodium sulphate and filtered it into
two long-necked globular          flasks, which were reboilcd and tied over with
bladder.      They were left during three weeks and remained unchanged.
The bladder over one flask was then pierced and the solution immediately
crystallized.      I  took the other flask into the fields and uncovered it ; it
remained liquid during a long walk, although the wind blew into the neck
with such force as to produce a musical note. When the still uncovered
flask was brought into the house the solution soon crystallized.                          I
have     repeated this experiment with this and other salts with similar
results, and it furnishes an argument against the Gernez and Viollette
theory.
   A strong solution of alum was tied over just after being boiled. It
was repeatedly shaken during several days.                     "While resting on the
mantleshelf of my study the bladder was pierced, when immediately
some amorphous powder at the bottom               of the solution began to        assume

 Next day enlarged the opening into the second flask to the size of a
 small pea, and after two or three hours the solution became solid.
     Pellogio and others claim for sponge and other absorbent bodies a
 nuclear action.       I immersed three bits of sponge in boiling water, and
 took them out with forceps and put them in a dinner-plate, which together
 with the forceps were placed in the kitchen oven. Three flasks, contain
 ing sodium sulphate solution (3 salt to 1 water), prepared the day before,
 were taken into the kitchen, and the bits of sponge, now dry, hard, and
 warm, were taken up with the forceps and dropped severally into the flasks,
 which were covered with small beakers. The flasks were put upon the
 window-ledge in my study.          One of the solutions crystallized after eight
hours ; the other two formed a good deal of the modified salt, in which
the sponge became entangled : the second solution crystallized on the
third day ; the third solution had not crystallized after ten days, although
it was repeatedly shaken ; the beaker was then taken off, and the solution
crystallized within half an hour.          In all three cases the sponge soon
absorbed    a  portion   of the  solution and   became thoroughly soaked ; the
solutions were exposed to considerable cold in the window, the weather
being chilly, but the sponge was quite inactive.
    Such results as these are certainly in opposition to the absorption
theory ; but the difficulty in this, as in other parts of the subject, lies in
the fact that one observer, in an apparently carefully conducted experi
ment, finds sponge, charcoal, and other porous bodies to be nuclear, while
another equally good observer (M. Viollette, for example) declares them
to be inactive.      In trying the effect of vapours on these solutions some
years ago, a sponge dipped in ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, &c.
was held      over the surface    : whenever    the sponge touched the surface
crystallization set in ; or passing the sponge hastily over the surface the
portion adhering to the sponge crystallized immediately, while the solu
tion in the vessel did not.
    In repeating Prof. Grenfell's experiments on drops,          I find the same
spirit of contradiction to prevail.       The  solutions  which  with him are so
permanent      are transitory   with  me.   I found   sodic sulphate  solutions of
various strengths, from six parts of salt to one of water, to one part of
salt to one of water, to be sensitive in every room of my house and on
every kind of surface on which they were deposited.            My method was to
boil the filtered solution in a clean flask and then to cover the neck with
a small beaker.       A couple of dropping-tubes (constantly kept in water,
except when in actual use, so as to keep them free from nuclei) were
employed for getting a supply of the solution from the flasks. A large
drop, made up of 5 or 10 or more single drops, was in this way deposited

on the surface to be tried, and around this were arranged a number of
single drops.        My observation agrees generally with that of Prof.
Grenfell, that the large drop is more ready to solidify than the smaller
ones   ; and the reason that      I should'give for this is, that the larger surface
is more likely to catch nuclei from the air than the smaller ones.                  In the
early stage of this inquiry it was thought that the sudden shock pro
duced by the inrush of air when the bladder was penetrated produced
crystallization ; but Prof. Turner, of University College, London, showed
that if the neck of the flask containing the solution were drawn out to
a capillary opening the solution could be retained in the flask without
becoming solid.         Lowel also showed that solutions could be kept longest
in ordinary flasks in proportion as their necks were narrow ; and another
early observer noticed that while a flask with its neck upright led to
crystallization, it was less likely to do so if the neck were placed at an
angle, and still less so if placed horizontally.              This evidently points to
the increased difficulty of a nucleus getting into the flask under such cir
 cumstances.
    I tried a large number of experiments on supersaturated solutions in
Prof. Grrenfell's manner, not only with those of sodic sulphate, but also
of sodic acetate, magnesic sulphate, zinc sulphate, potash alum, ammonia
alum, sodic carbonate, and some others. On uncovering the flasks for the
purpose of filling the dropping-tube, the solutions in the flasks often
                             * ; and it has not unfrequently happened that the
 crystallized suddenly
 drop of sodic sulphate and of some other solution at the end of the
 dropping-tube suddenly became solid before it fell, and thus acted as a
 nucleus to the contents of the tube.
    I repeated Prof. Grenfell's experiments with oily surfaces.                 A drop of
 oil (olive or niger) rubbed with the finger over a glass plate made the
 plate powerfully nuclear : drops of sodic sulphate became immediately
 solid, the large drop swelling up into a well-shaped conical figure with a
 rounded top.
     Experiments with magnesic sulphate (2 to 1 solution) showed this salt
 in drops to be even more sensitive than sodium sulphate.                 Drops of zinc
 sulphate (2 to 1) and of sodium carbonate (3 to 1) soon became solid on
 glass, paper, and other surfaces, -whether in the open air of my garden
 or in different rooms of my house.
    Potash alum solution (2 to 1) in drops crystallized rapidly into an
 opaque white mass, or into transparent crystals in concentric circles
    * In retailing,  the flask must be kept in motion over the flame so as to melt the salt
 gradually and not allow one part of the flask to become much hotter than another.
 As the solution approaches boiling, the flask, being chemically clean, is liable to violent
 Dumpings.     These may be prevented by keeping in each solution a fragment or two of
 oharcoa    (that from cocoanut-shell being most efficacious), as pointed out in my paper
 in the ' Proceedings' for 1869, p. 251. That the action of the charcoal is not impaired
 by use has been shown in these repeated reboilings as well as in the cases given by me
 in the Phil. Mag. for August 1875.

round a central pit.    A similar solution of ammonia alum behaved in a
similar manner : an opaque white ring formed at the circumference of
the drop and gradually closing in on the centre, and drawing matter
therefrom, produced a pit-like depression.          The large drop of the solu
tion often displayed suddenly beneath the surface a small well-shaped
octahedron, and this increased in bulk until the whole solution was solid.
The crystal would sometimes appear while the large drop was in the act
of being built up ; and the solutions in the alum flasks, more frequently
than in the other flasks, became solid and had to be reboiled.
    Sodium acetate in drops solidified both in crystalline lines and also in
heaps, these varieties occurring in the same set of drops. The crystalline
lines originated generally in a radiant-point, and in some cases two or
three such points caused the needles to cross.            Sometimes in the open
air a speck of soot or a small insect formed the radiant-point.          Within
doors the carrying of the plate across the room caused several of the
drops suddenly to crystallize.      It was noticed with this and other saline
solutions that the deformed drops crystallized first, while those that
formed perfect lenses with sharply cut edges remained liquid for a longer
time.    Drawing a point across these so as to deform their shape
generally led to crystallization ; but when a tail thus formed sprang back
again and the drop recovered its form there was no crystallization.          In
general when a point was drawn through a drop, crystallization set in
where the point made its exit.        Oil of almonds smeared over a plate
and polished with the pad of the hand was eminently nuclear.
   These experiments with drops were conducted during the week of fine
weather commencing on the 26th of June of the present year.               I had
often noticed during many years past, while conducting experiments on
the cohesion figures of liquids, the motions of camphor, creosote, &c. on
water and on surface-tension          generally, that the .phenomena varied
greatly from day to day.        On dull moist days drops spread out into
films sluggishly or not at all ; camphor, creosote, &c. would be more
or less inert ; in short, all surface-tension phenomena would be in a
depressed state.    Whereas on bright sunshiny days, with a brisk dry air,
although the temperature might not be high, some force seemed to be
present which exalts all the phenomena of surface-tension.           It may be
the evaporative force or the crystalline force ; but whatever it is it has a
powerful influence on the phenomena of supersaturation.             As already
noticed, the solutions in the flasks frequently became solid, and the drop
at the end of the dropping-tube could not be delivered on account of ita
solidifying. The drops on various surfaces formed well-shaped lenses,
and any thing that tended to destroy their symmetry led to crystallization.
These facts bear affirmatively on the details already laid before the Society
by Prof. Van der Mensbrugghe and myself on the connexion between
the surface-tension of liquids and supersaturation *. Although the con-

elusions of this paper have been called in question by some of the French
authorities on this subject, yet       I  venture to submit that the foregoing
details support our main conclusion, which may be so far modified as to
present    itself in this form, namely, that during certain        states of the
atmosphere, if not always, such a connexion really exists.
    On the 1st of July rain set in, and the weather during some days was
cloudy and unsettled.        The effect of this change on some of the solutions
was remarkable      ; but  I saw reason to   direct my attention specially to the
behaviour     of the sodic acetate solution.        During these wet and un
settled days the solution exposed in drops remained permanently liquid.
I  found that even when crystals of the salt from a drop that had previously
become solid were brought         into contact with the liquid drops, they no
longer produced crystallization.        This led me to suspect that the salt is
deliquescent as well as efflorescent in varying states of the atmosphere.
Accordingly on placing a known weight (30 grains) of the dry salt on
filtering-paper in the scale-pan of a balance          I found that it increased
in weight from day to day in wet weather, and lost weight in dry.
The same experiment was tried repeatedly with the supersaturated
 solution, of which 30 grains placed in the glass scale-pan became 33 in
the course of some hours, and went on increasing from day to day during
damp weather ; but when dry weather set in it lost in weight, and when
the solution crystallized there was a further loss of 6 or 8 grains from
evaporation consequent on the heat liberated during solidification.
    Here, then, is the explanation of the fact which has excited the surprise
of several observers, namely, that supersaturated solutions of sodic ace
tate may remain liquid for days, and even for weeks together, exposed all
the while to the dust of the room.           Such a fact has been cited in dis
proof   of  the  theory   of aerial nuclei, and  was appealed to by the French
chemists as a complete answer to the theory of surface-tension ; and it
had so powerful an effect on the mind of Professor Van der Mensbragghe
as to lead him to withdraw from all further connexion with that
theory.
    With  a westerly   wind, a bright sun, a tolerably high temperature, and
 a moist air,  I have   known the drops of sodic acetate to remain liquid
during eleven or twelve days, and drops that had previously become solid
liquefied again. The point of a needle drawn across the drops, which had
thus absorbed water, had no action in inducing crystallization, though a
considerable amount of friction was used. This was on glass ; on writing-
paper each drop, after remaining liquid for some days, had a wet halo
round it of considerable width ; but it seems that as the paper absorbed
water from the drop, the drop was absorbing moisture from the air. On
passing the point of a pencil through the drops on paper, so as to draw
out a tail, there was no action, and a crystal of the salt placed in the
drop was equally inert. In fact the solution was no longer super
saturated.     Sodic carbonate remained for days together on paper without

crystallizing   :  the paper became wet and sodden, and all appearance of
drops ceased.
    All the solutions thus exposed in drops are more or less affected by the
state of the atmosphere as to moisture.          The drops of the solution of
alum instead of becoming solid in a short time, as they do when the air
is dry, remain for hours in the liquid state, and then one or more of them
would display an octahedral crystal in the midst of the liquid, which
was the more conspicuous in a compound drop, or one made up of five or
ten single drops.       In damp weather I have known the drops to remain
liquid during     from twelve                          I
                                to twenty hours ; and have no doubt that in the
damp days of winter this solution, as well as that of other salts, will not
be so ready to crystallize as the drops were during the months of June,
July, and August, when these experiments were made.
    Drops of sodic sulphate in my bedroom crystallized some of them im
mediately, and all after a few hours.          But in a damp air, after heavy
rain, the time was considerably extended.            I have even found them to
remain liquid much longer on paper than on glass. On the other hand
I  have found magnesic sulphate solidify more readily on paper than on
glass, and plumbic acetate and zincic acetate more readily on glass than
on paper.       But the facility with which the drops solidify on various
surfaces seems to vary from day to day ; and hence it does not appear
possible to tabulate the salts in the order of their sensitiveness, seeing
that the order of one day, or even of one hour, may be quite different
from that of another day or hour.             Thus on two different days in
August equally fine, only on one day the wind was in an easterly, and on
the other in a westerly quarter, the order in which the solutions respec
tively crystallized was as follows      : —
                   Wind  easterly.                       Wind westerly.

 10. Sodic acetate      was liquid after forty-eight hours, when the experi
           ment was terminated.
    On the table in my study, in which this last experiment was conducted,
was a glass plate on which drops of sodic acetate had been deposited
fifteen days before — one compound drop surrounded by six single drops,
all of which, except two single drops, had crystallized.        These two
had apparently retained their surface-tension, while the other drops
had become more or less deformed.    There was heavy rain on the 27th
August, and on the morning of the 28th all the drops, which had pre
viously crystallized, were quite liquid. Sodic arseniate solution of the same
strength (2 to 1) behaves in a similar manner, absorbing moisture from
the air in damp weather, and remaining liquid the while ; whereas drops
of sodic phosphate solution (2 to 1) become solid after a few hours even
in damp weather.
   An extreme case of persistence in the liquid form during damp weather
is afforded by sodic acetate that has undergone the watery fusion ; that
is, the salt newly crystallized is melted in a test-tube over a spirit-lamp
in its own water of crystallization and so boiled. Drops of this on a
glass plate will remain liquid during many hours, and even days, if the
wind is in      a westerlyor southerly quarter.   Meanwhile they absorb
moisture from the atmosphere, as was proved by balancing 44 grains of
this solution ; it gained 11 grains in the course of a couple of days, and
then crystallized slowly with large crystals and interposed water, as
in an evaporating-dish, and without that loss of weight which accom
panies the sudden crystallization of a supersaturated saline solutiod.
There is only one exception to this loss of weight that           I
                                                             am aware
of, and that is in the case of a salt under the aqueous fusion.  This,
in suddenly solidifying,       becomes  very hot; but there is no loss of
water from evaporation, because      the whole of the water present becomes
constitutional water in the salt.        For example, 45jJ grains of recently
fused sodic acetate were poured into         a balanced watch-glass while   still
warm, and the solution formed a resplendent convex lens. In the course
of an hour it had gained one grain in weight from the absorption of
moisture. While watching       its bright surface became suddenly clouded
                               it,                                             :

to cover the surface like a fan, while an- opaque appearance was seen to
descend throughout the depth of the mass, very much after the behaviour
of the 7-atom        sodic sulphate when touched by a nucleus.              The watch-
glass and the metal pan on which it rested became very hot (the tempera
ture rising, as was afterwards found with the remainder of the solution,
from    60° to 129° F.) *, but still with no loss of weight, seeing that the
whole of the water of the solution had again become water of crystalliza
tion.    If  there is any water to spare it is driven off by the heat of com
bination, and there is a corresponding loss in weight.
    Some of the drops, when exposed to the air, form pulpy masses, such
as those of sodic, zincic, and magnesic          sulphates ; but by continued ex
posure they soon develop into hard well-formed crystals.                      This is,    I
suppose,    the  explanation     of an effect that   I obtained    some   years ago.     A
spoon of white metal shaped like a deflagrating-spoon,                   with its wire
run through      a flexible porous plug, was lowered         into  a boiling solution of
sodic sulphate : the plug was then fitted into the neck of the flask, which
it closed accurately, and the solution was left to cool. The spoon was
next drawn up full of the solution and left in the air of the flask.                    In
the course of some days the liquid in the spoon evaporated and left a salt
which, on being lowered into the solution, was inactive ; but if the spoon
containing the salt were first taken out and exposed for a few seconds to the
open air and then lowered into the solution, it was powerfully nuclear.
This exposure to the open air or to the air of a room seems to be necessary,
in some cases, to the formation of a crystalline salt, either by evaporation
or by the action of some other force.
    Schroder insists on the powerful action of the air in connexion with
the phenomena of supersaturated saline solutions ; and Lowel asks, " What
is this mysterious action of the air which endows bodies with a nuclear
action?"        He supposed it to be catalytic in its mode. The French
theory supposes the air to act as a carrier of salts of the same kind, which,
it says, are alone capable of acting as nuclei. In the course of my experi
 ments the air has had abundant opportunities of becoming charged with
 salts of the same kind as those          I was working with in solution.             For
 example : during all the time that         I was weighing the solutions of sodic
 acetate, so as to note their increase in weight by the absorption of mois
 ture from the air, an evaporating-dish, containing sodic acetate in crystals,
 was within a foot and a half of my balance ; but although for days
 together the solution caught moisture from the air, it never caught a
 crystal of the salt from the air.        When, however, the wind got round to
 the north, or to the east, the solutions of this and of other salts crystal
 lized, not only when exposed as drops, but also often in the covered flasks
 which supplied the drops.
    When the air is from a dry quarter the results are tolerably uniform                   ;
    * In my first paper (Phil. Trans. 18(58, p. (?63)a case is given in which sodic acetate

when from a damp one they vary, although the conditions are apparently
the same.        For example, one day last summer, when the wind was
westerly, and there was a bright warm sun occasionally obscured by
clouds,   I  placed twelve watch-glasses on a parapet wall in my garden,
and poured into them, while still warm from the boiling, a solution of
sodic sulphate (2 salt to 1 water).             In the course of about twenty
minutes four of the solutions crystallized in large crystals of the normal
salt, with interposed liquid not supersaturated ; four formed thin crys
talline needles, which started from        a radiant-point   as from the action  of
a nucleus     ; and the remaining four, which remained liquid, were touched
on the surface with a needle dipped in olive-oil, and they crystallized in
the pulpy form from the point.
   I  think the foregoing details go some way to prove that supersaturated
saline solutions behave differently among themselves and to different
bodies under varying atmospheric conditions.            If so, many contradictory
details connected with this subject are on the road to reconciliation.           A
supersaturated saline solution in a closed flask in which the air is saturated
with moisture is in a different condition (at least as regards surface-tension
and the power of spreading the drop of oil into a film) as compared with
a similar flask loosely covered and in the open air on a fine day ; so that
an oil &c. introduced into the closed flask, as in M. Viollette's and Mr.
Liversidge's experiments, may be inactive, while under the other condi
tion the same oil may be active.         One fine day in August      I placed four
flasks containing sodic sulphate solution (2 to 1) in the open air, and let
fall from a dropping-tube(just taken out of water and put into ether) a drop
of ether on the surface of each. It was striking to see, from the cohesion-
figure of the ether, long lines of crystals radiating to the sides and bottom
of each flask. A fifth flask of the same solution was treated some days
later in my laboratory with a drop of ether ; but this was inactive, and
the solution did not crystallize until the flask was inverted against my
thumb.                                                               I
            On a day in September, when the wind was 8.E., let fall into
each   of  four flasks containing a similar solution a drop of paraffine-oil
            " lubricating       It  formed a well-shaped lens on each surface
(marked                    ").
without any separation of salt ; but on gently shaking each flask, so as
to break up the lens, there was a sudden crystallization, and the normal salt
was produced in all four flasks.        Some hours later    I repeated the experi
ment in my study with five flasks of a similar solution.            The oil spread
upon    all  five  surfaces   and  the  solutions  crystallized immediately, the
normal salt being again produced.          I have hundreds    of such cases in my
note-books which have supplied            material  for former papers ; but in
referring to them no discredit is intended to         be cast upon the negative
results obtained by other observers who deny that oils, ether, &c. have
any nuclear action.       I  would suggest that in my numerous experiments,
carried on during several years, it is not probable that there was always
a lurking fallacy in the shape of a crystal of the same kind as that of the

solution either floating in the air and waiting to enter the flask as soon
as it was uncovered, or lying concealed in the oils, ether, and other bodies
which      I regarded       as nuclei.       The varied behaviour of oils under different
conditions, as pointed out in my second memoir*, has not been attended
to ; and because in many experiments in the hands of others oils have
been     inactive,     it   has been       denied that oils have any action at all on
these solutions.            I  confess that       I  was not able to reconcile the results
as stated by my opponents                  with my own results, until within the last
few months, when               I  set to work to repeat Professor GrenfelTs experi
ments, during which it became plain to me, what                                    I had not before
suspected, that the hygrometric condition of the air has a powerful in
fluence on these solutions ; so that under one set of conditions bodies may
act as nuclei, while under another set they may be inactive, as in the case
already cited, where sodic acetate solution by exposure during damp
weather becomes inert even to a crystal of the salt itself. But the exact
determination of these conditions can only be settled by a further long
and laborious experimental investigation                       upon which       I am now    engaged.

        Received October 4, 1877.
    In   the preceding Note              I   have proved that the elevation of Asia and
Europe displaced the axis                of  maximum inertia through 69 miles t, in the
direction of the meridian of the Andes, away from Greenwich.                                       The
axis of rotation being thus separated from the axis of figure by 69 miles,
or 1°, commenced to revolve uniformly on a right cone round the axis of
figure, and would continue to do so for ever, if not prevented by friction.
    Astronomers are agreed that the motion of the pole at present is
secular and very slow, all traces of wabbling caused by the elevation of
 Asia and Europe having disappeared.
    The object of the present note is to discuss the motion of the axis of
 rotation, from the period of the elevation of the continent until (by reason
 of friction) the axis of rotation came again to coincide with the axis of
figure ; and, if possible, to calculate the absolute length of time that has
elapsed from the epoch of elevation.

the pole revolves uniformly on a circle of 138 miles diameter, completing
each revolution     in 304-75 days, will continue for ever unless stopped by
friction.
    In   one day the pole moves through 1-423 mile ; but while the solid
globe (supposed rigid) revolves round each instantaneous axis in succes
sion, it is not so with the ocean, which tends to revolve round yesterday's
axis until compelled to revolve round today's axis by the friction of the
ocean against its sea-bed.      This friction may be thus taken account of.

 to revolve round the axis of figure in 304'75 days, with the component
of rotation round that axis always constant ; while the equatorial com
 ponent has a periodic variation passing through all its changes in 152-37

 but also subject to a periodic variation of 152•37 days, because sin* u

   Let us now proceed to calculate the coefficient of friction from the

Tidal Residual Current.

100,000 years*.
   The accompanying figure shows Newton's construction for the dis
turbing force of the moon upon the ocean.  The moon lies in the direc
tion AC, and the distance of the moon from the earth (=60 AB) repre
sents the attraction of the earth at the distance of the moon. The dis
turbing forca is BC, if AC=3AD.         Let AB=r, then the tangential
component of the disturbing                    force is

544           The Rev. S. Haughton on Physical Geology.                  [Dec. 20,
   From the preceding investigation it appears, if Asia and Europe were
manufactured, per saltum, causing a sudden displacement of the axis of
figure through 69 miles, that this event cannot have happened at an
epoch less than 641,000 years before the present time, and that this
event may have occurred at an epoch much more remote.
   It is highly improbable that the elevation of the nummulitic lime
stone took place so rapidly ; and     I  shall therefore discuss several cases of
supposed slower elevation.
    1. Let the displacement of the axis of figure caused by the manufac
ture of Asia and Europe have been due to 69 geological convulsions,
each of which displaced the axis       of figure through one mile, and let the
radius   of the wabble   be reduced    from one mile to 5 feet in the interval
between each two successive convulsions.
   From equation (12) we have
    The interval between two successive convulsions
                          = log,            x 68,588,
                                   (^2)

                          = 398,420 years.
    Total time occupied in   the  manufacture of Asia and Europe
                          = 398,420 x 69,
                          = 27,491,000 years;
say, 27 1 million years.
    From this it also appears that no geological change, altering the position
 of the axis of figure through one mile, can have taken place within the past
400,000 years.
    2. Let  us suppose that the     Earth's wabble   has the minimum observable
radius of 5 ft., and that geological changes        take place at such a rate that
the increase of this radius is exactly destroyed by friction during each
wabble, so that the radius of 5 ft. continues constant.
   "We now have
                                 A      —,

    At this rate of geological change the total time required for the manu
facture of Asia and Europe would be

                               =4170 million years.
    Assuming the minor limit of the epoch of the elevation of the nummu-
litic limestone to be 640,000 years, we can assign an approximate minor
limit to the whole period during which stratified rocks have been forming
 on the surface of the globe, assuming the rate of deposition to have been,
on the whole, constant.

    The proportion which the total thickness of strata              bears  to that of

    It  is extremely improbable that the continent of Asia and Europe was
formed per saltum, and therefore our minor limit of time is probably far
short of the reality.
    If  Europe and Asia were formed in a million years, which is 27 1 times
as rapid as supposition      No. 1, the total duration of geological time would
be nearly 37      millions of years.
    Whatever may have been the time actually employed in the manufac

day by an amount which may be thus calculated                 : —

  III.    " On  certain Movements of Radiometers."          By G. G.   Stokes,
               M.A., Sec. R.S. Received November 1, 1877.
      Nearly two years ago Mr. Crookes was so good as to present me with
  two of his beautiful radiometers of different constructions, the disks of one
  being made of pith, and those of the other of roasted mica, in each case
                                                        I
  blackened with lampblack on one face. With these was enabled to make
 some experiments, having relation to their apparently anomalous move
 ments under certain circumstances, which were very interesting to myself,
 although the facts are only such as have already presented themselves to
 Mr. Crookes, either in the actual form in which      I witnessed them, or in
 one closely analogous, and have mostly been described by him. Although
 it will   be necessary for me to describe the actual experiments, which have
 all been repeated over and over again so as to make sure of the results,    I
 do not bring    forward the facts as new. My object is rather to endeavour
 to coordinate them, and point to the conclusions to which they appear to
lead.
     I  do not pretend that these conclusions are established ;     I am well
aware that they need to be further confronted with observation ; but as      I
have not leisure to engage in a series of experiments which would demand
the expenditure of a good deal of time, and have lately been urged by a
                                I
friend to publish my views, venture to lay them before the Royal Society,
in hopes that they may be of some use, even if only in the way of stimu
lating inquiry.
                                      I
     In describing my experiments will designate that direction of rotation
in which the white face precedes as positive, and the reverse as negative.

1877.]                            Movements    of Radiometers.                              5-17
It   will      be remembered that, under ordinary          circumstances, radiation to
wards either radiometer produces positive rotation.
  1. If a glass tumbler be heated to the temperature of boiling water,
and inverted over the mica radiometer, there is little or no immediate
motion of the fly     but quickly a negative rotation sets in, feeble at first,
                              ;
but rapidly becoming lively, and presently dying away.
   2. If after the fly has come to rest the hot tumbler be removed, a posi
tive rotation soon sets in, which becomes pretty lively, and then gradually
dies away as the apparatus cools.
   3. If the tumbler be heated to a somewhat higher temperature, on first
inverting it over the radiometer there is a slight positive rotation, com
mencing with the promptitude usual in the case of a feeble luminous
radiation,  but quickly succeeded by the negative rotation already de
scribed.   If the tumbler be heated still more highly, the initial positive
rotation is stronger and lasts longer, and the subsequent negative rota
tion is tardy and feeble.
   4. If the pith radiometer be treated as in § 1, the result is the same,
with the remarkable difference that the rotation is positive instead of
negative ;           it is also less lively.
  5. But             if   the tumbler   be removed when the    fly has    come to rest,        it
remains at rest, or nearly so.
  6. If the tumbler be more strongly heated, positive rotation begins as
promptly as with light. In this case the tumbler must not be left long
over the radiometer, for fear the vacuum should be spoiled by the evolu
tion of        gas    from the pith.
   7. If the tumbler be heated by holding it over the spout of a kettle
from which steam is issuing, and held there till the condensation of water
has approximately ceased, and be then inverted over the pith radiometer,
the bulb is immediately bedewed, and a negative rotation is almost
immediately set up, though sometimes, just at the very first moment, there
is a trace of positive rotation.   The negative rotation is lively, but not
lasting; and, after 15 seconds or so, is exchanged for a positive rotation,
which is not lively, but lasts longer.
     8.   If   the tumbler be lifted when the negative rotation has ceased, and
the dewed surface be strongly          blown upon, a lively, but brief, positive
rotation is set up.
     9.   To produce positive rotation by blowing, it is not             essential    that the
bulb be wet.     If it be merely warm,           and the circumstances are such that
the fly is at rest for the moment, or            nearly so, blowing produces positive
rotation, though much less strongly              than when the bulb is wet.
   10. If the tumbler be heated as               in §   7, and inverted     over the mica
radiometer, the rotation is positive, as when the tumbler is dry.
   11. If the tumbler or a cup be smoked inside (to facilitate radiation),
heated to a little beyond the temperature of boiling water, and inverted
over the pith radiometer, a positive rotation is produced                   ;   and   if,   when.

548                             Prof. G. G. Stokes on certain                        [Dec. 20,
this has ceased, which takes place in a couple of minutes or so, the heated
vessel be removed, a negative, though not lively, rotation is produced as
the apparatus cools.
     12. These results do not seem             difficult to coordinate   so   far   as to reduce
them to their proximate cause.
   As regards the small quantity, if any, of heat radiated directly across
the glass of the bulb, the action of which was experimentally distin
guishable by its promptitude,              both radiometers behaved           in the ordinary
way.
   13. As regards the mica radiometer, when the bulb gets heated, and
radiates towards the fly, the fly is impelled in the negative direction, as
if the white, pearly mica were black and the lampblack were white. And
there is nothing opposed to what we know in supposing that such is really
their relative order of darkness
                               as regards the heat of low refrangibility
absorbed and radiated by the glass ; for the researches of Melloni and
others have shown that lampblack is, if not absolutely white, at any rate
very far from black as regards heat of low refrangibility.     On the other
hand, glass and mica are both silicates, not so very dissimilar in chemical
composition ; and it would not therefore be very wonderful, but rather the
reverse,     if
          there were a general similarity in their mode of absorption of
radiant heat, so that the heat most freely radiated by glass, and accord
ingly abounding in the radiation from thin glass such as that of the bulb,
were greedily absorbed by mica. The explanation of the reversal of the
action when heat and cold were interchanged is too well known to require
mention.
     14.    With the pith radiometer, when the bulb as a whole is heated, and
radiates  towards the fly, the impulse  is positive, though less strong than
in the case of the mica (§ 4) ; and when the bulb as a whole is cooler than
the fly the impulse is negative (§ 11).
   But to explain all the phenomena we must dissect the total radiation
from or towards the bulb.              When     I
                                     first noticed the negative rotation
produced by a heated wet tumbler,                I
                                     was disposed to attribute it to radia
tion from the water, which possibly the  glass of the bulb might be thin
enough to let pass ; but when              I
                                 found that hot water in a glass vessel
outside, even though the glass of it were thin, produced no sensible effect,
and that blowing on the heated bulb when it was dry produced a similar
effect to blowing on it when dewed, though of much less amount,        per                 I
ceived that the moisture acted, not by direct radiation from  and in conse    it,

similarly, the blowing   on the dewed surface acted by causing    rapid                a
superficial cooling.   When the dry tumbler radiates to the bulb, the
radiation     is  absorbed at various depths   the absorption

     15.    In
          the struggle between the opposing actions of the outer and
inner strata we see the explanation of the strange behaviour of the pith
radiometer.   In the experiment of      the outer stratum at first shows

                                  direct radiation from the tumbler, and
then the inner prevails. In the experiment of        the whole bulb cools,
                                                                     §   5
partly by radiation, partly                 by

and the slightly greater coolness of the outer than of the inner stratum
makes up for the superiority of the inner when the two are equally cool,
so that the antagonistic  actions nearly balance, and slight causes, such as
greater or less agitation of the air, suffice to make the balance incline one
way or other.    That the inner stratum would prevail          the two were       if
about equally cooled may be inferred from the behaviour of the radiometer

to radiations       in general (especially luminous radiations, which are the
most easily studied) with what we observe as to the motions of radio
meters, we may arrive at some probable conclusions.
     17. We may evidently conceive a series of ethereal vibrations of any
periodic time, however great, to be incident on a homogeneous medium
such as glass, and inquire in what manner the rate of absorption would
change with the period ; though whether we can actually produce ethereal
vibrations of a very long period is another question, seeing that we can
only act on the ether by the intervention of matter, and are limited to
such periods of vibration as matter can assume when vibrating molecu-
larly, in a manner communicable to the ether, and not as a continuous
mass, in the manner of the vibrations which produce sound.                      We may
inquire whether, on continually             increasing the period of vibration, the
glass (or       other   medium)       would   ultimately become and remain very
opaque, or whether, after passing through a range of opacity, it would
become transparent again, on still further increasing the period of the
incident vibrations.
     18.   This is a question the experimental answer to which, as it seems
to me, could only be given, in so far as it could be given at all, as a result
of a long series of experiments, of a kind that Melloni has barely touched
on. A variety of considerations, which               I  could not explain in short com
pass, lead me to regard the second alternative as the more probable,
namely, that, on increasing the periodic time, homogeneous substances in
general (perhaps even metals, though this is doubtful) become at last
transparent, or at least comparatively so. The limit of opacity, in all pro
bability, varies from one substance to another ; and the lower it is, the
lower would be the lowest refrangibility of the radiation which the same
 substance is capable of emitting.
     19. In what immediately follows            I  shall suppose accordingly that glass
 is strongly absorbing through a certain range of low refrangibility, on
 both sides     of which it gradually becomes transparent again*. Imagine a
 spectrum       containing     radiations of all refrangibilities with which we have
 to deal ; let portions of this spectrum on the two sides of the region of
 powerful absorption for glass be called wings of that region, and let left to
 right    be the order of increasing      refrangibility. Then the spectrum of the
 radiation      from a thin plate of glass, if it could be observed, would be
  seen to occupy the region of chief absorbing (and therefore emitting)
 power and its wings.              The spectrum of the radiation from the outer
  stratum of the bulb of the pith radiometer, after transmission through the
  inner, would consist of two wings, with a blank, or nearly blank, space
  between     ;  it would resemble, in fact,      a widened    bright spectral line, with
     *  It may be noticed    that this supposition, which, as appearing the more probable,
  is adopted    for clearness of conception, is not essentially involved in the explanation
  that follows, which would hardly be changed if the "left wing" were not terminated
  on the left.

a dark band of reversal in its middle, save that, instead of being confined
to extremely narrow limits of refrangibility, the central space and its
wings would be of wide extent.        It follows from the experiments that, in
the complete radiation from glass, the portions of the spectrum called the
wings together act negatively, the portion between positively.                 It does
not, of course, follow that each wing acts negatively, but only that the
balance of the two is negative.      When the tumbler is heated a little over
212° there is a slight positive action from radiation which passes directly
through the bulb. The circumstances lead us to regard this as an exten
 sion of the right wing ; for it comes from a depth, measured from the
inner surface of the bulb in glass, i. e. not counting the intervening air,
somewhat greater than the thickness of the wall of the bulb ; and we
know that the more a solid body is heated, the higher, as a rule, does the
refrangibility of the radiation which it emits extend, and the greater the
proportion of rays of high to those of low refrangibility. It is simplest,
therefore, to suppose that the action of the right wing, like that of the
space between the wings, is positive, and that the observed negative
action in the experiment of § 7 is due to the excess of negative action of
the left wing over positive action of the right. In the mica radiometer
the experiments indicate no such difference of action in the different
layers of the bulb as in the case of the pith radiometer.             Hence taking,
in accordance    with  what  now  appears    to be made out to be the theory of
the motion of the radiometer, the direction in which the fly is impelled
as an indication which is the warmer of the two faces of the disks, and
that again as an indication which is the darker with respect to the radia
tion to which it is exposed, we arrive at the following results as regards
the order of darkness of the substances for the three regions into which
the spectrum of the incident radiation has been supposed to be divided,
the name of the lighter substance being in each case placed above that of
the darker: —

    Hence, on descending in refrangibility, the order of darkness of the
 two substances of either pair is at lirst the same as for the visible spectrum,
 and at last the opposite ; and the reversal of the order takes place sooner
 with mica and lampblack than with pith and lampblack.                     The order
 falls in very well with that of the chemical complexity                of the three
 substances.
    20. The whole     subject of the behaviour of bodies with respect to
 radiant heat of the lowest degrees of refrangibility seems to me to need a
 thorough experimental investigation.         The investigation, however, is one
                                                                    2q2

involving considerable difficulty.    We can do little towards classifying
the rays with which we are working unless we can form a pure spectrum.
A refraction-spectrum is the most convenient ; but the only substance
known which would be approximately suitable for forming the prism,
 lens, &c. required for such a spectrum, and for confining liquids, is rock-
 salt, of which it is extremely difficult to procure perfectly limpid speci
mens of any size ; and even rock-salt itself, as Professor Balfour Stewart
 has shown, is defective in transparency for certain kinds of radiant heat.
Then, again, the only suitable measuring-instrument     for such researches,
the thermopile, demands a thorough examination with reference to the
coating to be employed for absorbing the incident radiation.       Hitherto
 lampblack has been used almost exclusively for the purpose ; and it is
 commonly assumed, in accordance with certain of Melloni's results, that
lampblack absorbs equally heat-rays of all kinds. But the experiments
by which Melloni established the partial diathermancy of lampblack
prove that rays exist for the absorption of which that substance is un
suitable.
     On calling on Mr. Crookes after the         above was   written,   I was surprised
to find that all his mica radiometers behaved towards a heated glass shade
in the opposite way to that he had given me, going round positively in
stead of negatively.  Mr. Crookes showed me and gave me a specimen of
the kind of mica he employs, as eminently convenient for manipulation.
It is found naturally in a condition resembling artificially roasted mica.
It is not, however, quite so opaque for transmitted light, nor of quite
such a pearly whiteness for reflected light as that which has been arti
ficially roasted at a high temperature.   The mica radiometer that Mr.
Crookes first gave me, which           I will   call   M,, was, Mr. Gimingham told
me, the only one they had made     with roasted mica.
   Mr. Crookes was so kind as to give me, for comparative experiment,
a mica radiometer, which       I
                              will call Ma, made from the natural foliated
mica.    It revolves a good deal more quickly than M, under the influence
of light ; it also gets more quickly under way, indicating that the mica is
thinner.    When covered with a hot glass it revolves positively, as already
remarked ; there        is,
                       however, but little negative rotation when the glass
is   removed.

   P.S. — It might be supposed at first sight that the change of rota
tion from negative to positive (in § 7) was due, not to a change in the
conditions of absorption, but to the circumstance that the inner surface
of the bulb had become warm by conduction, so as to be warmer than the
surfaces of the fly instead of colder.   For we now know that the " repul
sion resulting from radiation," as in some way or other it undoubtedly
does result, is an indirect effect, in which radiation acts only through the
alterations it occasions in the superficial temperatures of the solids in
contact with the rarefied gas ; and it might be supposed that when the
inner surface of the bulb passed from colder than the fly to warmer, the
direction of rotation would, on that account alone, be reversed.        This,
however, is not so.      If
                         bulb and fly are at a common temperature, and
the instrument is protected from radiation, the fly remains at rest whether
the common temperature be high or low.      If a small portion of the total
surface in contact with the rarefied gas be warmed by any means, repul
sion takes place, through the intervention of the rarefied gas, between
the warmed surface and the opposed surfaces, if not too distant ; if it be
cooled, the result is attraction.     It   does not matter whether the surface at
the exceptional temperature belong to the fly or the bulb. The former
takes place in the ordinary case of a radiomter exposed to radiation, the
latter in that of a radiometer at a uniform temperature and protected
from radiation when      a small portion     of the bulb is warmed or cooled, in
which case the part at the exceptional temperature repels or attracts the
disk irrespectively of its colour or the nature of its coating*. Suppose
now that the fly is being warmed by radiation from without, the bulb
being cool, at least at its inner surface. Let A, B be the two kinds of
faces of the disks, and suppose A to be the better absorber of the total
radiation.   Then A will be the warmer, and therefore will be more
strongly repelled than B. Suppose now that the bulb is heated till its
inner surface becomes warmer than the fly. Then the fly will still be
receiving heat by radiation, to some extent also by communication from
the gas ; but this will be the same for both faces. Hence if A be still the
better absorber of the two (A, B), A will be the warmer, and being less
below   the temperature of the interior surface of the fly will be less
attracted, or, which is the same, more repelled.        Hence, whether the
inner surface of the bulb be cooler or hotter than the fly, a reversal in
the direction of rotation, while the fly is being heated, indicates a reversal
in the order of absorbing power of the two          faces, and that, again, shows
   * Theoretically there would be a minute difference of temperature, produced, other
circumstances being alike, by the difference in the absorbing or emitting power of the
two faces of a disk, as regards the radiation which is the difference between the radia
tions from or towards the affected portion of the bulb and the same portion at the
normal temperature. But this, and the repulsion or attraction corresponding to       it,
would be only a small quantity of the second order, the main effect being deemed one
of   the first order.

that the order is different for different components of the total radia
tion, and that the ratio of the intensity of those components has been
changed.
   It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe that the radiometers men
tioned in this paper are of the usual form — that is to say, that their arms
are symmetrical, so far as figvre is concerned, with respect to a vertical
plane passing through the point of support.          Accordingly the rotation
which is attained, for instance, with a radiometer with concave disks of
aluminium, alike as to material on both faces (of which kind, again, owe I
a beautiful specimen to Mr. Crookes's kindness), has not been referred to.
This rotation, depending on the more favourable presentation, to the bulb,
of the outer (and therefore nearer and more efficient) portions of the fly
on the convex than on the concave side, has nothing to do with the one
isolated subject to which the present paper relates, namely, the elucida
tion of the peculiar behaviour in certain cases of certain kinds of radio
meters, by a consideration      of the heterogeneous character of the total
heat- radiation.
      November 20, 1877.
    2nd P.S. — This morning    I received from Mr. Crookes an account of the
behaviour of a kind of radiometer which he was so good as to construct at
my suggestion.      The consideration of an experiment mentioned in a paper
of his presented to the Royal Society, which will shortly be read, and which
he has kindly permitted me to refer to, suggested to me the desirability
of investigating the effect of mere roughness of surface, all other circum
stances being alike, and the disk of the radiometer being metallic, so that
the two faces may be regarded as practically at the same temperature.
Mr. Crookes's experiment, above referred to, led me to suspect that mere
roughness might increase the efficiency of a surface ; and      I suggested to
him some experiments with heated glass shades, or with a hot poker pre
 sented to the radiometer, the bulb being covered with a cool tumbler to
 defend    it from being heated    by the rays easily absorbed by glass.   The
 result   in every  case answered    my expectation ; and it may be stated
 shortly that the law of the motion is that when the fly is hotter than the
 bulb the rough surface is repelled, or, say, the motion is positive ; when
 cooler, negative.
    I  subjoin Mr. Crookes's memorandum of the results of experiment : —
     " Aluminium Radiometer (1326),       one side of the vanes being ruled

  " 3. The Bunsen burner removed.       The positive rotation gradually

   " 6. On removing the shade and ring the positive movement soon comes
to rest.
  "   7. Covered   with    a hot glass shade, negative        rotation, with positive
rotation on cooling (the same as 4).
   " 8. Plunged into hot water. Negative rotation.
   " 9. Removed from the hot water, and immediately plunged into cold.
Positive rotation."
  Results nearly identical        were obtained with another radiometer             de
scribed as   " silver radiometer (1327),     one side coated        with finely divided
silver, electro-deposited."
   We must accordingly recognize three distinct conditions under which
motion may be obtained in a radiometer, namely : — (1) difference of tem
perature of the two faces, as in a pith radiometer coated on one face with
lampblack ; (2) more favourable presentation of one face than the other,
as in a radiometer with curved disks ; (3) roughness of surface on one
face    this be really different from 2). These three conditions may be
      (if
variously combined so as to assist or oppose each other, as the case may
be, in producing motion.

     Dr. SiBSoy, bora iu 1815 at Cross Caaoaby, near Maryport, in
Cumberland, was educated iu Edinburgh, where he also commenced the
study of medicine.      He was a pupil of Lizars, and in his pupilage, in
1831-2, volunteered to serve in the Cholera Hospital, and in that first

gave himself to study both in the wards and, especially, in the patho
logical theatre.     Among those whose admiration he attracted was the
late Dr. Hodgkin, who, from that time, never ceased to encourage him
in all his labour and to aid him in every way that could lead to success.
     In 1835 he was appointed resident surgeon to the Nottingham General
Hospital, and during that appointment, which he held till 1848, gained a
considerable knowledge not only of medicine, but of surgery, of which, in
later life, he often made good use in consultations.     There, also, he made
 his chief investigations into the mechanical physiology of respiration and
 the position of the internal organs in health and disease, which were
 throughout his life a principal subject of his studies ; and through these
 his name will always bo honourably remembered in the history of
 medicine. They brought him early into high repute when first published
 in 1844 in the ' Provincial Medical and Surgical Transactions,' and sub
 sequently in a separate volume.     His great work on Medical Anatomy,
 towards which most of his researches led, and in which all his chief
 results may be studied, was published in 1869.       It is a book to be com
 mended for its thoroughness.       Its preparation involved severe labour,
  most of which was carried on in the dead-house of the Marylebone In
  firmary.
      In 1848, at the end of his tenure of office at Nottingham, Mr. Sibson
 graduated at the University of London, and passed in the same year the
 examinations     for M.B. and M.D.,      gaining honours in both — a note
 worthy achievement, considering the active life of practical work in which
 he had long been engaged. He remained always devoted to the Univer
  sity, fulfilled for some years the duties of examiner in medicine, and in
  1865 was made a member of the Senate, on the nomination of Convoca
 tion. Few were so constant as he in attention to all the business of tho
 university that had relation to the medical or other natural sciences.
  Alike in the senate, in committees, and in convocation, he was zealous
  for the promotion of all good designs.
      The like may be said of his work in the College of Physicians, of which
  he became a member in 1849 and a Fellow in 1853.            In this year he
  delivered the Gulstonian Lectures, in 1870 the Croonian, in 1873 the
      vol. xxvi.                                                   h

Lumleian    ; but his chief   work was in the office of secretary to the Com
mittees on the Nomenclature             of Diseases.    It would be impossible to
overestimate the value of his services in that capacity.                He was the
principal originator of the undertaking, and never ceased to labour in it
during the six or more years in which it was in progress. Of all the
great honour due to a work of so large importance, even of much more
than national importance, the greater part was certainly gained by Dr.
Sibson.
    Dr. Sibson was elected     one   of the physicians of St. Mary's Hospital in
1851, and held the post during twenty years : he was also for some time
one of the lecturers on medicine in the school. His teaching was earnest,
laborious, and minute.        Emphatic as he was in speech, and never for a
moment doubting the importance of even the smallest fact, he made all
listen to him, and he made many learn.             Few, indeed, could follow him
in all the minuteness of detail with which he spoke on his chief subjects,
such as the diagnosis of diseases in the chest ; but he made his pupils
feel that they had work to do for which nothing less than the devotion of
a life could suffice, and he showed them how to do it.
    Dr. Sibson was not less vigorous in the British Medical Associa
tion. He first became a member in 1843 ; in 1850 he delivered the
address in physiology, in 1870 that in medicine ; for many years he
was a member of the General Council, for three years its president,
and after     this   a  permanent       vice-president.    It  was   at his   sugges
tion that the plan for grants for scientific researches was adopted, and
he was chairman of the Grant-Committee.                    Briefly, he took part in
every good work of the Association.
    And he took a willing part in larger and more public works.              He was a
very active member of the Asylum District Board and of the Govern
ment Commission in the Greenwich Hospital Enquiry in 1867-8.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849 after the pub
                                      '
lication of two papers in the Transactions,'             became a member of the
Council in 1872, and was for some years Treasurer of the Royal Society
Club.     Among his honours he had the honorary degree of M.D. of
Dublin and of LL.D. of Durham*.
    It is not possible to give a summary of Dr. Sibson's numerous published
essays, comprising, in addition to the subject above mentioned, researches
 on narcotic poisons, ether, and chloroform.             It was while investigating
the action of anaesthetics that, by making use of soft lead as the most
pliable substance for adaptation to the mouth, he succeeded in con
structing   a very ingenious      mask to be worn during inhalation ; and to
him the profession is indebted for the double valve for expiration and
inspiration.
    Nearly every    one   of the   essays   relating  to the chest was in itself a

 summary of minute and laborious studies.                    The characteristic of all this
part    of  his work      was    in   his   devotion   and immense      labour to determine
the questions which he set himself.                      Perhaps he overestimated the
 relative importance of some of them ; but even if he did he should hardly
 be charged with fault ; rather his example may be studied as a protest
 against the greater and much more common fault of thinking that facts
 are easy to be established.             He will probably always enjoy the rare honour
of having     settled    some     things so certainly that they will never need to be
investigated again.
    It may be doubted whether we had in our Society a man of stronger
will for work than Sibson.                  He never flinched from any duty ; he never
 tried to   make    it   easy   :  when      he saw a duty to be done he looked to see
 how large it could be made, how manifold in detail ; and he did it all.
 No man followed better the advice of the king Preacher, " Whatsoever
 thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might."                   And surely no one ever
 worked harder with as light and genial a heart.                     Who of us can forget
 the gentleness and enthusiasm of his social life, his fervent greetings,
 his words of affection, the sincerity of which was proved by the whole
 tenour of his pure unselfish life ? He was a many-sided man, and on all
 sides good ; a true lover of nature and of art, his house was adorned
with    a fine collection of engravings, and especially Wedgwood ware, of
which he was a critical judge : his collection of Wedgwood medallions of
scientific men (unfortunately dispersed by sale after his death) was probably
the most complete ever got together, and was especially rich in repre
sentations of Fellows of the Royal Society.
    Dr. Sibson married, in July 1858, Sarah Mary, younger daughter of
Peter Aimé Ouvry, Esq., of East Acton, a lady of highly cultivated mind
and of rare artistic accomplishments.                    His death was, as he expected,
 sudden.      He died at Geneva on the 7th of September, on his way home
from a vacation tour ; and when we might have thought of him as coming
to us again, with his enthusiastic narratives of adventure or of                             some
 study in rare art, abrupt news came that his career was finished *.

    J. B. A.  L. L. £lie    de Beaumont     was born on the 25th September,
 1798.   In the year 1817 he became a student at the Ecole Polytechnique,
where he greatly distinguished himself.          In 1819 he left that School,
having the first place among those who were leaving at the same time,
and commenced his studies at the Ecole des Mines, He soon evinced
a decided taste    for geological pursuits, and in his second year his excellent
and distinguished master, M. Brochant de Villiers, wrote of him as
 follows : — " II est regarde comme un de nos plus forts sujets presents et
 passes.   II a surtout un grand gout et beaucoup de dispositions           pour
 la Ge'ologie." The papers he wrote after various geological excursions
 made by the pupils have been preserved in the School and show his zeal
and capacity for that study.
    In the beginning of his career as an engineer his masterly memoir on
the sandstone strata of the Yosges attracted much notice, and at once
gave him a place among rising geologists.
    In 1822, just as the pupil engineer was completing his brilliant course
of study, an incident decided his career. The Council of the Ecole des
 Mines having received a copy of the fine Geological map of England, just
executed, were so much struck with the importance of the work that they
expressed \o the Administration a wish that a similar map of France
should be drawn up.
    Before this suggestion could be carried out, it was necessary to gain a
large mass of information from England ; and Elie de Beaumont was
soon afterwards       sent   with Brochant    de  Villiers, and his friend and
colleague, Dufrcnoy, on a mission to England, in order to study the
principles on which this map had been prepared.             On their return they
published a description of the principal metallurgical establishments
of this country, then little known to French manufacturers.            The Geo
logical conditions of the workings in Great          Britain, the processes em
ployed in manufactories, and the general arrangements of plant were
carefully described in this elaborate work, which is considered to have
rendered an immense service to French Metallurgy.              As a consequence
of this mission Elie de Beaumont and Dufrenoy were commissioned,
under the direction of Brochant de Villiers, to prepare a Geological Map
of France, a task which, begun in 1825, occupied eighteen years.
    In 1824 Elie de Beaumont was appointed as Engineer of second class
at Rouen, and held that position until 1827, when he was placed as
assistant to M. Brochant de Villiers in the duties of the Geological Chair
at the Ecole des Mines, and in 1835 succeeded to the professorship.
    Hitherto Elie de Beaumont had been chiefly remarkable for great
power of work and intelligence.          He was now to take high rank as an
original investigator.     In 1829 he made a communication to the Academy,
in which he asserted that the oldest chain of mountains in France was
that of the Cote d'or, in Burgundy, that the Pyrenees and Apennines
were of later date, that Mont Blanc belonged to a still more recent

                                       V
period, and that the St. Gothard was younger than Mont Blanc. The
most eminent geologists of the time adopted the new doctrines, which
were enthusiastically propagated by Arago.         Thus encouraged, iDlie de
Beaumont prosecuted his studies of the origin of mountain-ranges with
                                                       '
renewed vigour, and his ' Systemes des Montagues         was the result, fol
lowed in after years by large additions of facts and the development
of his great idea of the pentagonal network of mountain-chains.          His
views have not met with universal concurrence either from geologists
or mathematicians.      They have been ably controverted by other geo
logists, among   whom   are Sir Charles Lyell and Mr. Hopkins in his anni
 versary address to the Geological Society in 1853.
    In 1832, on the death of Cuvier, Elie de Beaumont was elected almost
unanimously to the vacant chair in the College de France.          There he
 created a school of Geology, and for upwards of twenty years his lectures
 were numerously attended by students of geology.
    He was early in his career elected into the French Academy, and on
 the death of Arago in 1853 he was selected for the important post of
 Perpetual Secretary of that learned body, which post he retained until
 his unexpected death on the 21st September, 1874.
    After long service as Inspector-General of Mines he became, in 1861 ,
 Vice-President of the Conseil-General des Mines, and a Grand Officer of
 the Legion of Honour.      He was also a member of the French Senate.
 For nearly 50 years of his life (that is to say, from his entrance as pupil
 in 1819 until his superannuation in 1868) he was attached to the Ecole
 des Mines.
    The extent and number of his writings can only be judged of by a
                                             '
 complete list ; but his Geologie Pratique may especially be noticed.
                         '
    M. Elie de Beaumont married a lady of the distinguished house of
 Quelen.    Her death and the miseries of the late war no doubt tended to
 hasten his end.
