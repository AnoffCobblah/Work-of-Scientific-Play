 1.    The true surface of the sun is the outer boundary of his enormous
atmosphere ; but the principal escape of heat takes place from a concentric
layer at a vast depth beneath the surface.              Within this luminous film there
is a dark body, glimpses       of which are    occasionally seen as the umbrae of spots.
      2.  The part of the atmosphere above the photosphere, which may be
conveniently called the Outer Atmosphere, is eminently transparent to
most of the rays which emanate from the shell of clouds, or from be
neath them.           But this is not the case in reference to others.                  The
atmosphere         absorbs  rays  of those   refrangibilities    which   correspond  to   the
dark rays visible in the solar spectrum, and multitudes of others of a like
kind beyond the limits of the visible spectrum.                  The depth of the atmo
sphere is so enormous that we must conclude it to be many times more

2                      Mr. G.    J.  Stoney  on the  Physical            [Recess,
of such rays.     That there     are  dark lines in the solar spectrum reveals to
us the fact that the surface of the atmosphere is cooler than the luminous
region beneath.       But we may go further than this.           Most gases are
colourless  ; in other words,      they do not scatter rays incident on them.
Neither    do  they  reflect  light from their surface. It follows, then, from
the laws which regulate the exchange of heat, that where such a gas is of
sufficient  thickness to be opake in reference to any particular ray, it will
send forth the most intense ray of that particular refrangibility which it is
possible for a body of the temperature of the gas to emit.             Hence that
there are lines in the solar spectrum of very different intensities is an
evidence to us that the surfaces of the atmospheres from which they have
their source are at different temperatures. It thus appears, upon a rough
 view, that the upper layers of the atmospheres of sodium, magnesium,
 and hydrogen are cooler than those of iron and calcium, and that these
 again are cooler than the upper layers of the atmospheres of nickel, cobalt,
 copper, and zinc.      In this, then, we have evidence both that the atmo
 spheres of the several    gases extend to different heights, and that the tem
 perature increases from the surface of the solar atmosphere downwards.
 Again, such facts as that some of the iron lines are less dark than others
 in their neighbourhood, that some of the copper lines are not noticeable,
 prove that even before descending sufficiently far to have passed through
 a stratum of these gases thick enough to be opake to these rays, we have
 already arrived at a sensibly higher temperature.        This temperature, in the
 case of some of the lines of cobalt, copper, and zinc, appears to approach,
 if it does not pass beyond, the temperature of the luminous clouds.
     3. Let us now direct our attention         to the darker nucleus which lies
 within the photosphere.         It is known that a body, when surrounded on
 all sides by an opaque envelope of others at its own temperature, will reflect
 some of the incident light, if its surface be in any degree polished, and if
 the body be not wholly transparent or wholly black. It will scatter others
 of the incident rays if either its surface or its substance be such as would
 not be wholly invisible if exposed to light brighter than that corresponding
 to its temperature.     And, lastly, it will emit rays in virtue of its own tem
 perature of such kinds and in such quantities that, along with those trans
  mitted, reflected, and scattered, they will make up a total which is definite
 for each temperature.       This is one of the established laws of the exchange
 of heat. It follows from this that a body thick enough to be opaque which
 emits much more feebly than others at a given temperature must reflect
incident rays better, or scatter them more copiously.            It cannot in an
   minent degree do both.        Unless the dark body of the sun is cooler than
 the photosphere it is therefore, at least in those places which are exposed
 to us as spots, either such that it scatters incident light abundantly, or it
 has a highly reflecting surface,
     4. Before pursuing further our inquiry into the nature of the central
  body  of the sun, it will be convenient to enter upon the discussion of the

 phenomena of the luminous clouds ; and it will avoid confusion in this part
 of our investigation to adopt provisionally the definite hypothesis that the
central body of the sun is an opake ocean with a highly reflecting surface —
 such a surface as an untarnished white molten alloy would present.        We
shall run no risk of error in doing this if we afterwards carefully reexamine
such parts of our inquiry into the phenomena of the clouds as would be
affected by substituting for this hypothesis any other that is admissible.
    5. [We shall also assume that the photosphere is not itself the origin of
the heat which it disperses abroad, but draws it from the adjoining regions.
No doubt if chemical action could be the source of solar heat, the photo
sphere might be its seat, and resemble the luminous part of a candle-
flame.    In this case the opaque regions within might be cooler than the
photosphere, provided the photosphere were so translucent as to allow a
sufficient radiation through it from the parts within to the open sky. But
the photosphere to be thus translucent should of necessity be at a far
higher temperature than an equally bright body with a perfectly radiating
surface.  And almost to this intense heat it would raise a great extent of
the outer atmosphere, which, being eminently transparent, is but imper
fectly fitted to moderate the heat it
                                    receives from contact with the photo
sphere.   Hence we should expect to see conspicuous bright lines in the
solar spectrum, which, however, we do not find. Moreover, the amount of
the sun's radiation appears to be decisive against our attributing it to
chemical action. — September 1868.]
   6. Let us consider what would happen if the photosphere were away, and
nothing but an atmosphere of fixed gases in contact with an intensely heated
molten sphere.    To simplify our conceptions, let us conceive the molten
mass to have a core which is maintained at a constant temperature, to
have a surface reflecting perfectly, and to be enveloped by an extensive
atmosphere of one fixed gas, which, for further simplicity, we shall sup
pose gives a spectrum of invariable lines. The atmosphere is supposed to
be extensive enough to render the change     of temperature throughout it so
gradual   that there are    no currents of convection.  The under surface of
this atmosphere would      be raised by direct contact to the same temperature
as the polished surface of the dark body within.   The temperature would
very slowly decrease in passing outwards  from  the core, first through the
molten ocean, and then through the atmosphere, until that upper layer of the
atmosphere was reached which alone can emit heat into space. Through the
thickness of this outer stratum the temperature would rapidly fall, the whole
escape of heat from the system taking place exclusively from        it,
                                                                  in the form
of undulations of the ether of those particular wave-lengths which the gas
constituting the atmosphere    can excite.   Such       picture of what would ulti
                                                    is

     7.Let us now suppose the surface of the ocean to lose part of its re-
flecting-power, and to become such an imperfect mirror as   possible with
                                                                  is
 the bodies we know to exist. The surface of the ocean will at once begin
                                                                   b

moderately to radiate heat, most of which will escape into space. It will
thus become a surface of minimum temperature, cooler than the depths of
the ocean within, and also for a time than the adjoining parts of the at
mosphere without — just as the surface of the ground becomes a surface of
minimum temperature while dew is falling. This surface of minimum tem
perature will draw heat from the warmer bodies on both sides of   and willit,
thus tend to cool both the atmosphere  above and the ocean  beneath.
    8. Let us next conceive     particle with
                                   a           highly emitting surface, and
                                                     a
of the same temperature as the surrounding    medium,   situated in the atmo
sphere   ashort distance above the ocean.   Such    body, owing to its lavish

radiation, would quickly fall in temperature    far below the bodies around
it. If, however, these latter can supply         with heat so fast as to prevent
                                                    it
its reduced temperature sinking below the temperature of brilliant incan
descence,      will continue

                                  a
darkness around. Let us now suppose that we have in the neighbourhood
of this particle    a vapour such that       gaseous at the ardent temperature

                                                is                       smoke or

                                                         ;   it                 so

precipitated, begin itself to radiate copiously, and so will tend to      maintain
the reduced temperature which          the condition of its continuing to blaze
                                       is
 forth.    The process      the inverse of what takes place in setting
                             is                                              flame

 the upper parts, when precipitated in luminous cloud, will protect the rest
 of the vapour from that free radiation towards the sky which           the neces
                                                                         is
 sary condition of the phenomenon.        If the blaze had been first communi
 cated to a  part below the outer layer,     would at first form
                                              it                     cloud in that

 situation — the radiation from the upper side of this cloud would be least
 obstructed — the blaze would therefore tend to spread outwards, and would
 no doubt do so much more swiftly than the cloud could subside.                The
 blaze would therefore soon fly to the uppert surface of the vapour, where
 alone   it could establish itself permanently.       Such, then, appear to be
the luminous clouds.
     Since the great escape of heat takes place from the photosphere,

must be cooler than the contiguous parts of the regions within or of the
atmosphere without. And the lowest temperature to which either of these
could possibly fall     is   evidently the reduced temperature of the clouds,       a   mi-
    *It seems not improbable that as there are substances which will take fire sponta
neously and, when they have done so, will maintain a temperature of ignition — a far
higher temperature than they had before — so perhaps there may be vapours in the
solar atmosphere capable of spontaneously forming      molecule of liquid or of solid at
                                                         a

that its instantly beginning to radiate both renders its new state fixed and sets the
whole neighbourhood ablaze.
    tIt will be shown further on, that a trace of the vapour which forms the clouds
may, and probably does, extend far beyond them.      But the clouds are at the boundary
of the region in which there are large quantities of the vapour.

stratum was an absolute screen stopping every ray of heat coming from
beyond    it,
          and also reducing the entire of the intermingled atmosphere of
fixed gases quite to its own low temperature.    The former of these con
ditions, especially, seems improbable when we bear in mind that the film
in which cloud can form must be so transparent as to admit of the abundant
radiation towards the sky which we have found to be essential.   We shall
be able to treat this subject further on with more precision   but, in the           ;
meantime, we are clearly entitled provisionally to regard the film of
clouds as colder than the regions on either side of it.
   10. Let us now consider more attentively the thermal conditions of the
photosphere and of the subjacent regions.      In doing this     necessary          it   is
to distinguish         part of the condensed vapour from which there
                      that                                                                           is
so abundant     radiation outwards as would enable vapour in that region
                 a
to pass into cloud, from such other parts of the condensed vapours as are
too much screened from the sky to allow any more cloud to form. It will
accordingly be convenient henceforth to restrict the word cloud to the
former,   and to use such words as mist or rain when we have occasion to
speak  of  condensed vapour in   lower situation.

which by its own weight, and                 by
                                  the coolness would impart to the fixed

merged in the general luminous stratum. This behaviour would be hastened
by a sudden change of the density of the solar atmosphere, which, as we
shall find hereafter, takes place at the boundary of the photosphere.

     1. The clouds, though of       thickness small when compared with the
                                             a
enormous   extent of the atmosphere of the sun, may nevertheless be of
considerable depth   but they can in no place be of such
                         ;                                 density and              a
thickness       as   to be opaque, since no part                of the stratum      can come       into
existence from which there   not   sufficiently free radiation towards parts
                                    is            a
already  cooled down   or towards the  open sky.     This, then, will put                            a
limit to the density of the clouds. If, from any cause, heat     supplied                 is
unequally  to different parts of the stratum, the  density of the   clouds
must be correspondingly unequal, inasmuch as, in the more heated
regions, even the lowest part of the stratum, which   the worst-situated, is
must be sufficiently exposed to the sky to enable    under these adverse it,
circumstances, to maintain the low temperature which      essential to the     is
formation of cloud.    The clouds will accordingly be rarest where most
heated.     As, then, the clouds are translucent in all parts, and in some parts
more so     than in others,    becomes of importance to study the intensity
                                  it
of the heat and light which reach us from beyond them.

with the latter hypothesis first.                 Assuming, then, that there         is   such an in

terval, we may suppose that the part of the atmosphere which occupies it
is either nearly saturated with the vapour from which clouds are formed,
or but sparingly supplied with it.                          If
                                        it be very moist, the clouds as they
descend, either through convection or by subsidence, will pass into the
form of mist, which will collect into a rain that will fall towards the ocean
beneath.                If, on the other hand, the interval             between    the clouds and ocean
 be far from being charged                                        will dis
                                                with vapour, the cloud            as   it   descends
solve away among the hot and dry gases below, while the ascending cur
rents, as they rise into the situation from which they can freely radiate,
restore the same quantity of a thin gauze-like cloud.  The possible alter
 natives, then, are,               1st, that the interval      between the clouds and ocean is
 transparent, or, 2nd, that it                   is rendered in a considerable degree opake by
 mist and rain, or, 3rd, that the clouds reach to the ocean.
        13.    Let us examine hypotheses, beginning with that of a clear
                                        these
atmosphere under the clouds.                               If
                                     there be such a transparent space,
it is easy to see that the intensity of the rays which strike the under
surface of the clouds is greater than that part of the solar radiation
which emanates directly from the clouds ; for a portion of the rays which
flow downwards directly from the clouds will be reflected by the body of
the sun beneath    another portion will be scattered at the same surface.
                               ;
These two portions will fall short of the entire quantity of rays in the first
instance radiated downwards from the clouds.       But as the body of the
sun is hotter than the clouds, what is here wanting will, according to a
known law regarding the exchange of heat, be more than made up by what
the body of the sun will itself emit*. Thus we have already a quan
tity of heat radiated upwards against the clouds greater than that emitted
by them downwards.      But further, the clouds must scatter a part of the
rays that strike their under surface.  Some of the rays so scattered will
be afterwards reflected or scattered by the body of the sun, and will
augment still further the heat striking the under surface of the clouds
over that which they radiated downwards.     This excess will be great if the
clouds be of a material that  scatters light copiously ; for in this case wc
shall not only have a large supply of rays that had been so scattered
added to the stock, but also, if the clouds scatter incident rays abundantly,
they will, in obedience to the laws of the exchange of heat, be at the same
time such as will emit more feebly ; and accordingly the brightness which
shines upon them from the background will be relatively more conspi

would intercept least of the greater brightness beyond. In the marginal parts
of the disk the spectator looks obliquely through the stratum of clouds,
which     istherefore more opaque to his view, so that, in approaching the
edge of the disk, the less intense light emitted by the clouds would be pro
gressively less and less fortified by the splendour within.      The brightness
of the disk would be accordingly shaded off towards the edge.            At the
same time thinner parts of the film,         not too extensive, would be seen
                                                   if

from above upon water in the act of boiling, the smooth tops of the columns
of ascending water being represented                on the sun by the brighter           patches
due to the thinness of that cloud which can maintain                        its existence in the
hotter vapours, while the turmoil which     seen in the water between these

by prolonged emission become the most dusky seem to show like black or,
at least, very dark pores.   This honeycombed structure of the stratum of
clouds will modify the effect of obliquity in rendering the marginal parts
of the sun's disk less bright than the centre. It will cause the effect to be
perceived further from the border than    otherwise would be.

tiny we are forced to resign  as untenable.
                                       it     For, as has been explained,
the light which has suffered but one reflection, or been but once scat
tered, by the body of the sun, falls short of that which emanates di
rectly from the clouds, and the greater brightness of the background                             is

8                     Mr. G.  J. Stoney   on the Physical              [Recess,
due to the additions made (1) by the rays emitted by the ocean in
virtue of its higher temperature, and (2) by the light which has suf
fered more than one reflection or been more than once scattered at the
surface of the ocean.     Now the    umbrae   of spots exhibit to us the body
of the sun so dark when compared with the luminous clouds, that the
great brightness of the faculae cannot be due to the light emitted by the
ocean.     It must  therefore be   due to the second     cause,  which,   as  we
know, can only produce any considerable effect if the clouds are of such
a nature that they scatter light abundantly.        But, again, we know from
the proximity in which the umbrae of spots have been seen to the edge of
the disk, that the interval between the clouds and the ocean is trifling as
compared with the superficial dimensions of many faculae.          Hence, if the
illumination of the background be due to the second cause, to light reflected
or scattered from the body of the sun, the parts under extensive thin por
tions of the clouds would be sensibly less illuminated, and would give rise to
an appearance more like that of penumbrae than of faculae.      The hypothesis
would therefore fail to account for large faculae.     Its rejection is also de
manded by the appearance of the spectrum.           For if the clouds had the
property of scattering light in the degree which would account for the gra
nulated aspect of the photosphere, they would in the same proportion
emit light feebly ; and the whole light reaching us, whether from or through
them, would fall very perceptibly short of the maximum corresponding to
their temperature.    And as, on the other hand, a gas is a perfect emitter of
the rays of which its spectrum consists, there could not fail to be conspi
cuous bright lines from those gases which extend only to the hotter strata of
the solar atmosphere.     Now it is certain that no such lines are conspicuous.
    16. The same objections lie with still more force against the hypothesis
that the clouds are in contact with a polished ocean.        We may therefore
summarily dismiss this hypothesis.
    1 7. Let us then turn to the alternative of an interval with mist and
rain.    The mist beneath the clouds, as it is found in a hotter region,
would    emit more light, though the mist were no more dense than the
cloud.     But the mist is probably much more dense ; and it is natural to
suppose that it is dense enough to be opake, in which case, if it be formed
of a material which is a good radiator, it will emit light of almost the max
imum intensity which can be emitted by a body of its temperature.        Indeed
this effect would be produced if the mist and rain were in a quantity much
less than that which would be opake, in consequence of the assistance ren
dered by the body of the sun beneath, and that without any hypothesis as
to the state of the latter, except only that it is opake and at as high a tem
perature as the mist.    Now as it is likely that the average quantity of mist
and rain is much more than this, its density may undergo very considerable
fluctuations without its ceasing to pour forth its full torrent of light and
heat.     Such, then, appears to be the brighter background which shines
through the clouds.     As in the last case, the currents of convection which

 1868.]                Constitution   of  the  Sun and Stars.                      9
prevail generally over the sun produce the gradation of light fading towards
the edge of the disk, and the finely granulated structure of his surface, with
its little bright patches, its dusky intervals, and its dark pores. Where
circumstances render the cloud thinner over any considerable extent while
the rain continues, we have a facula which is visible (if it be not lost in the
equal brightness of all around) when it is near the centre of the disk.
Where such thin parts occur in numerous small patches, they produce that
ordinary mottled appearance of the sun's surface which is visible in tele
scopes   of moderate power.      If  the rain stop, we have penumbra.         If the
cloud also vanish, we have the umbra of a spot.
    18. We have thus arrived at an hypothesis which in a very satisfactory
manner agrees with several of the phenomena.              Before, however, we trust
ourselves to this or any other particular hypothesis, we must retrace our
steps and go over the whole ground with care, retaining at each step all
the alternatives which up to that point are possible, and reducing the num
ber by eliminating from the list every hypothesis which we find to be in
consistent with any known fact.
     19. Now, in the first place, the gradation of brightness from the margin
to the centre of the sun's disk has usually been attributed to the action of
an absorbing atmosphere telling with most effect upon the edges of the
disk. But of course faculae cannot be referred to any action of our earth ;
and it is incredible, therefore, that they exist only near the edge of the disk.
 Hence the cause of the gradation of light, whatever it is, must be such as
will leave the faculse of unimpaired lustre as they move from the centre to
 the edge of the disk, while it renders other parts more dusky.              We may
 therefore discard the hypothesis that an absorbing atmosphere is the cause,
 since it would not act in this way.        It is therefore due in some way to the
 nature of the photosphere itself.
     The telescope informs us that the photosphere consists of two parts which
                          —
 may be distinguished : a brighter part, seen in the centre of the disk, in the
 faculse, in smaller bright patches, and in its purest form in the brighter
 specks of those parts of the surface which are granulated ;
                                                                        and a dusky
 part, seen towards the margin of the disk and            in the interstices between
 the bright specks of the granulation.            Now, incandescent bodies radiate
  equally in all directions, and therefore, if the light of the sun emanated
  from a mere mathematical surface, the disk would not be brightest at            the
  centre.    Hence the photosphere is a stratum, not a surface.            Again, the
  brighter parts cannot   be  at the   top  of  this stratum,  since in that case the
  margin of the sun's disk would be the brightest.             Hence the bright   and
  dusky parts are either intermingled, or the dusky parts form the outer
  layer ; and if they are intermingled, the brighter parts must be the more
  transparent, to render this hypothesis consistent with the gradation of light
  we find on the disk.
      Again, the observations show the whole granulated surface of the sun to
   be in a state of incessant change, although not by any means so impetuous

10                         Mr. G.          J.   Stoney on the Physical                  [Recess,
as the earlier        observers supposed             ;    hence at least the outer layer of the
photosphere is mobile.                It   is accordingly      either a gas, a liquid, or a cloud.
The nature of its spectrum forbids our admitting it to be a layer of gas* of
moderate depth ; and if the layer of gas were so profound as to be opake,
it would radiate the maximum amount of light belonging to its tempera
ture at great depths, and so obliterate the mottled appearance which exists.
   Again, an opaque liquid would be luminous only at its surface, which we
have found to be inadmissible.  Nor is an ocean of transparent liquid suf
ficient.                 through 20 metres of sea-water, and probably a
                Little light   gets
few hundred metres of the most transparent liquid would be practically
opaque.   This trifling depth therefore would render the incandescent
ocean luminous to almost the full extent which is possible for a body of its
temperature.    Such an ocean, therefore, if tranquil at the surface, would
reduce the whole sun's disk to an uninterrupted gradation     of brightness.     t
If, to account for the granulation, we suppose the ocean to be every here
and there fretted with storms, the foam, being endowed with the property
of scattering light abundantly, would no doubt be a bad emitter, and would
therefore form dusky spots; but these spots would be most conspicuous at the
centre of the disk. We must therefore reject the hypothesis of a transparent
ocean.   The hypothesis of a cloud, then, is the only one which remains.
   20.      Of clouds, there                  varieties — clouds precipitated
                                 are two well-marked
from a state of vapour, like the clouds in our atmosphere, and clouds of
fixed solids or fixed liquids, such as smoke, a cloud of dust, the mud in
turbid water, oil in an emulsion.    The sun attracts with so much more
force than the earth that everything on his surface presses down with a
force twenty-eight times as great as that with which it would press down
wards on the earth's surface.   From this, and from the amazing extent of
his outer atmosphere, it is natural to suppose that the pressure in its lower
strata must be enormous.     This must occasion the lower strata to be very
dense, unless the effectof the pressure be counteracted by the terrific heat.
On  the other hand,  the average density of the whole sun being only about
one-fourth of that of the earth, the solids and liquids on his surface are pro
bably much less dense than with us.                         If
                                             it should happen that the lower
strata of the atmosphere were more dense than some of the solid or liquid
substances on the sun, these latter would rise until they reached that part
of the atmosphere which is of the same density as themselves, and would
float there ; and if in a state like dust, they would doubtless be maintained
in violent agitation by currents of convection, those on the outside being
most cooled by radiation and sinking, to be replaced by others from the

hot regions beneath.  The dust in the ascending currents would be the
warmest, and therefore the brightest, and if the currents of convection
were on a sufficiently  extensive scale, we might expect as a result such a
granulated    appearance as the sun presents.    But it would be one which
would be incompatible with the gradation of brightness which extends from
the centre to the margin of the sun's disk.      The stratum in which these
convection-currents exist could affect the light coming from beyond merely
as a partial screen, since there would be no marked* difference in point of
transparency between the ascending and the descending currents, so that
the peculiar action which the honey-combed structure of the stratum would
otherwise produce is not developed.   There would accordingly be scarcely
any diminution of brightness till quite close to the edge of the disk ; and
there it should fall off very rapidly. As these are not at all the appear
ances which present themselves, we must give up the hypothesis    of a cloud
of fixed solid or liquid matter. The hypothesis of clouds precipitated from
vapour is therefore the only one not excluded ; and we have found that it
appears consistent with all the phenomena that have been yet discussed.

   t The dynamical theory of the molecular constitution of gases, which, if mistake not,
may be ranked in point both of importance and probability along with the wave theory
of light, does not appear to have yet met with that general attention and acceptance
which it seems to deserve.  It may not be out of place, therefore, to add to the num
berless proofs which have been drawn from its interpreting the phenomena of gases, by
many writers, but especially by Clausius, the following negative proof, which demon
strates that no statical theory, whether on the hypothesis of a continuous substance     or
of distinct particles, is pavsilic.
   A gas is susceptible of enormous dilatation and compression without an abrupt
change in the laws upon which its pressure depends ; hence, if it consist of particles at
rest, the force which acts in any direction on any one, must be the result of forces ema
nating from many others, no one contributing more than a share which may be regarded
as infinitesimal.    Hence it is easy to see . that if the density be changed, the pressure
will vary as the square of the density; for the force in any direction on any one particle
will increase as the number of the particles on that or the opposite side (according as
the elementary forces are attractive or repulsive) near enough to act on   it,t. e. will in
crease as the density   and the number of particles subjected to this augmented force
                        ;
which are found within each element of volume will also have increased in the same
proportion. Hence the pressure per square millimetre across any surface within the gas
will increase as the square of the density and as this

 of molecules moving about actively and irregularly in all directions, the
 path of any one being for the most part rectilinear, or, in other words,
 most of its motion being executed at a sufficient distance from the neigh
 bouring molecules to be beyond the reach of sensible influence from them.
 Every now and then, however, each molecule comes sufficiently near some
 other molecule to have its course bent, on which occasions it darts off in a
 new direction.  Moreover many facts in physics and chemistry lead irre
 sistibly to the conclusion that the molecules are resolvable into simpler
 elements ; and the probability distinctly is that each in most gases is a
 highly complex system.     When a body so constituted is enclosed, the
 molecules by flinging themselves against the walls of the containing vessel
produce the pressure of the gas.    If the enclosure be at the same tempe
rature as the gas, they do so without gain or loss of vis viva.   But if the
wall be at a higher temperature, the activity of those molecules which strike
it is increased, and vice versd. The altered activity is shared with the rest
of the       by conduction and convection — or more slowly by conduction

both in mass and in the motions that prevail within* them.       That the
internal motions differ is abundantly testified by the amazing variety in
the grouping of the spectral lines to which the various gases give rise t.
Again, the number of molecules per cubic millimetre is known to be the
same in all perfect gases, when taken at the same temperature and pressure.
Hence the masses of the molecules are in most simple gases proportional
to what chemists have called their atomic weights ; and in those instances
in which this is not the case they stand in the same simple relation to these
atomic weights as the densities of the gases nearly do. Thus the masses
of the gaseous molecules of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, selenium,
bromine, iodine, and tellurium bear to one another the ratios of the num
bers 1, 14, 16, 35-5, 79 5, 80, 127, 129— which are the atomic weights of
these substances, and nearly in the ratios of their vapour-densities.
                                                                        But
to represent the mass of molecules of phosphorus on the same scale, we
must double the number used as its atomic weight, and take 62 instead of
gases,     it follows that
                       no gas consists of distinct particles at rest.   The same proof ap
plies, by the principles of the differential calculus, to the hypothesis of a continuous and
homogeneous     substance.   For this proof given more at large, see Proceedings of the
Royal Irish Academy, vol. vii. (1858), p. 37.

31, since its atomic vapour- volume is half that of the foregoing gases.
Similarly in arsenic we must take 150 instead of 75 ; on the other hand, in
cadmium and mercury we must halve the atomic weights, and take 56 and
100 instead of 1 12 and 200. In the case of sulphur, each molecule of its
vapour has a mass represented on the same scale by the atomic weight of
sulphur, viz. 32,       if
                     the vapour be observed at temperatures above 1000°
Centigrade ; but at some lower temperature it seems to contract to one-third
of its former volume, since at 500° Centigrade, and under, it is found to be
thus shrunk.    The mass of each molecule has become three times what it
had been before, and is therefore represented at low temperatures by 96.
  23. Let us now consider what it is that puts a limit to the atmosphere.
Let us first suppose that it consists of but                  one gas, and let us conceive a
layer of this gas between two horizontal surfaces of indefinite extent, so
close that the interval between them is small compared with the mean
distance to which molecules dart between their collisions, but yet thick
enough to have, at any moment, several molecules within it.         Molecules
are constantly flying in all directions across this thin stratum.     Some of
them come within the sphere      of  one another's attraction while within the
layer, and therefore pass out  of  it with altered direction and speed.    Let
us call these the molecules emitted by the layer.  If the same density and
pressure  prevail above  and below  the layer, the molecules  which strike
down into it will, on account of gravity, arrive with somewhat more speed
on the average than those which rise into it.        Hence those molecules
which suffer collision within the stratum will not scatter equally in all
directions, but will have a preponderating downward motion, so that of the
molecules emitted by the stratum more will pass downwards than upwards.
This state of things is unstable, and will not arrive at an equilibrium until
either the density or the temperature is greater on the underside of the
layer.       If
            the density be greater, more molecules will fly into the stratum
 from beneath than from above  ; and if the temperature                   be greater the mole
 cules will strike up into         it,
                            both more frequently and                      with greater   speed.
 In the earth's atmosphere         by    combination of
                                         it   is     a                    both these that the
 equilibrium     maintained
                  is        both the temperature and
                                    :                                     the density decrease
 from the surface of the earth upwards.
    24. We have hitherto taken into account only those molecules which,
 after   a collision, have arrived at the stratum from the side on which
 the collision took place.    But beside these there will be certain number a
 of molecules which, having passed through the stratum from beneath,
 fall back into    without having met with other molecules, either by reason
                   it
 of the nearly horizontal direction of their motion, or because of its low
 speed. The number of molecules that will thus fall back into the stratum
 will be     very inconsiderable proportion of the whole number passing
             a
 through   the stratum, so long as the temperature and density are at all like
 what they are at the surface of the earth. In the lower strata of the at
 mosphere, therefore, the law                 by   which   the temperature and density de

                                        affected
But in those regions where the atmosphere is both very cold and very
attenuated, where accordingly the distance between the molecules is great
and the speed with which they move feeble, the number of cases in which
ascending molecules become descending without having encountered others
will begin to be sensible. From this point upwards the density of the
atmosphere will decrease by a much more rapid law, which will within a
short space bring the atmosphere to an end.
  Not, however, before the density has sunk immeasurably below what                    can
be reached in our laboratories.         If   there be a     unit-eighteen
                                                                          * of   molecules
in every cubic millimetre of the air about us, there will remain about a
unit-fifteen in every cubic millimetre of the best vacuums of our air-pumps.
The molecules        still closely packed, within about an eighth-metre of one
                    are
another ; i, e. there are about 60 of them in a row as long as a wave of
orange light. This accounts for our atmosphere's spreading to the height
at which    meteors betray its presence,           which   is far beyond the height     at
which we can detect     it by any ordinary means.
   25.   If an   atmosphere consist of a mixture of
                                              gases (for example, of un-
combined nitrogen  and hydrogen), the  boundary of each gas will be at a
different height. Where the nitrogen is no longer able to maintain itself,
the molecules of hydrogen, with a velocity           \/\4
                                                (or nearly 4) times as great,
can still spread far beyond it. It is also to be observed that the nitrogen
will reach a greater height in consequence of the presence of the hydrogen
than it could alone, since an ascending molecule of nitrogen has more
chance of escaping the fate of falling back without having encountered
 another molecule if there be molecules of hydrogen to be met with as well
as molecules of nitrogen.   In this way a substance of which there is but
little in the atmosphere may ascend nearly to the full height to which it
would rise if present in abundant quantity.
    Thus the vapour of sodium, which, as we shall find, is present in the
sun's atmosphere as a mere                 nevertheless to reach nearly the
                                   trace, seems
full height assigned to it by the mass of its molecules, through the assist
ance afforded to it by the abundant atmosphere of hydrogen, which extends
much further.        In
                     the same way the vapour of water is probably borne to
the limits of the earth's atmosphere, although but a minor constituent ; and
the trace of carbonic acid which terrestrial air also contains, is probably
supported to a height nearly as great as it would reach if present in much
greater quantity.    Where, then, as in the sun's atmosphere, the lightest
constituent is abundant, all the other gases which enter into its composi
tion, will range to heights which stand in the order of the masses of their
molecules, whether they be present in large or in small quantities. And

  constitaent, viz. the vapour        of water, it will form      an exception to the rule,
 inasmuch as      it will  be unable to maintain         its footing more than a little
 beyond    the limits     of the lightest of the abundant constituents, which in
 the case   of the earth's atmosphere is nitrogen.
    26.  It  becomes    of importance, then, to arrange the constituents of the
 solar atmosphere in the order of the masses of the molecules, as this will
be the order in which the surfaces of their successive                     atmospheres will
succeed   one   another. A provisional attempt is made in the following table
to arrange    on this principle the better-known of the elementary substances,
including all the bodies whose spectra have yet been compared with the
spectrum of the sun, or with those of other celestial bodies.                       The posi
tion in the   list of those substances whose            names are printed in ordinary
type has been       ascertained by direct observations on the vapour-densities,
and may be depended on ; but all the rest, which are printed in italics, are
placed on the provisional supposition that the masses of their molecules
when in the       state of vapour        are proportional     to their generally received
atomic weights.        It  is probable that in some of these instances the mass is
proportional to some simple multiple or submultiple of the atomic weight,
and that the position in the list ought to be altered accordingly.                         We
shall find   grounds for concluding that this is the case with Barium, and
that  it ought to be placed in the list probably between zinc and selenium,
perhaps between calcium and titanium,               or between sulphur and chlorine.

       [The position of vanadium has been altered from that assigned to it in the MS. of
this memoir, in accordance with Boscoe's recent investigations regarding this sub
stance.    If the vapour-density of vanadium be ever determined, it is presumable that
its  molecular  mass will prove to be 2 V, i. e. 102-4, in analogy to those of phosphorus
and arsenic, in which case its position in the Table will need to be altered again. — Sep

      27.   Such, then, is the order in which we should expect to find that
  those    of the elements which exist in the sun's atmosphere succeed one
  another, — the atmosphere of hydrogen far overlapping all the rest ; then,
 at a   profound depth, sodium and magnesium, reaching nearly to the same
 height, since the masses of their molecules are nearly equal ; next, at a
 great distance further down, calcium ; then, in a group reaching nearly to
 the same       height, chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, and cobalt ; then,
within a moderate distance of these, copper and zinc ; and lastly, after a
vast interval, barium.            These are all the elements as yet known to exist in
the sun's atmosphere.               Let us now compare with the observations this
anticipation      founded     on   the  molecular constitution of the elements, bear
ing in mind that the order is likely to be in some few cases incorrect,
owing to our having occasionally erred in assigning the foregoing masses to
the vapour-molecules.            To make this comparison most effectually, Table II.,
opposite to p. 32, of the intensities of the solar lines observed by Kirchhoff
will be of use.         In this Table the lines of each known constituent of the
solar atmosphere are placed in the order in which they occur in the parts
of the spectrum mapped by Kirchhoff, which extend between wave-lengths
43 and 77 eighth-metres, that is from the indigo about G to the extreme
crimson beyond A*.                Each spectral line is represented by a number,
    * The reader should have by him Kirchhoff' s maps of the solar spectrum in illustra
tion of this paper.      They have been published in a separate form by Messrs. M'Millan
and Co.       It will make a reference to these exquisite maps much easier, not only for the
purposes of this memoir, but also for many other purposes,              to mark with pencil-dots
upon KirchhofTs       arbitrary scale each of the following positions of an absolute scale,
 founded    upon Angstrom's determinations of the wave-lengths of 70 lines (see Poggen-
 dorffs ' Annalen,'    1864, vol. iii., or Phil. Mag. 1865, vol. i.).

    (N.B. Those positions which have a note of interrogation a fter them are doubtful, as
 they are   too distant from rays measured       by Angstrom to ad     it of a safe interpolation.)

venient to begin by studying the iron lines, since they are numerous,
extend over a great range of the spectrum, and above all because there
appear to be no bright lines in the iron spectrum to which dark lines in
the solar spectrum do not correspond.                This was invariably the case with

       '29. The first thing that strikes the eye in the part of the table appro
 priated to the iron lines is a continuous gradation of intensity from the
 indigo to the red. The most refrangible iron lines mapped by Kirchhoff
 are those in the indigo, all of which he found of the deepest black, which
he represents by the number 6. Then follow the lines in the blue, in
which there appears to be a struggle between this intense blackness, and
the darkest shade short of blackness recorded by Kirchhoff, and to which
he assigns the number 5. In this part of the spectrum lines of the in
tensity 6 are still predominant.                In the next region, the bluish-green,
this struggle         is continued, but now      with a predominance of lines of the
intensity      5.     About    the  middle of the green we for the first time meet
with an unexceptionable line of intensity 4, corresponding to the wave
length 53-87 VHIth-metres.                 The last line of intensity 6 presents itself
 at wave-length 55-77, after which, in the yellow, orange, and red, the in
tensity of iron lines has for the most part sunk to 4 or 3.
      30. Now the iron lines         seen  in the solar spectrum originate in the upper
part of the iron atmosphere, each ray coming from a stratum of such a
thickness that it is opake for that particular ray.                 This thickness differs
from ray to ray, being greater for those rays which are caused by atomic
motions of feeble intensity.             Such rays therefore will in part originate from
a greater depth in the solar atmosphere, and therefore from a region of
greater heat. They will therefore be brighter, or in other words less con-
 little informed     on these subjects to speculate with any confidence   on the cause, and
 perhaps the following conjecture is the best that can yet be made.
     The effect may perhaps be due to the brief duration of the sparks. The enormous
 temperature caused by each spark lasts for a very short time, and is not renewed until
 after the lapse of an interval long in comparison. The electricity, when it passes, pro
 bably produces its direct effect in accelerating and controlling the directions of the
 motions cf translation of the molecules of the gas ; and only indirectly, through tho
 resulting violence of the molecular collisions, excites those more subtle atomic motions
 which give out     the light.   Those of the atomic motions therefore which are most in
 fluenced by each collision will be the first to reveal themselves, and the rest not until
 after very many collisions shall have taken place, so that before they have had time to
 culminate, the duration of the spark may be over : whereas when they have time fully
 to unfold themselves, as they can in a continuous current, they may attain in some
 cases a higher intensity, and consequently emit a greater brightness.
     In support of this explanation, we have the fact that the lines seen with RuhmkoriTs
 coil have been observed to correspond to the most conspicuous lines in tho solar
 spectrum. Now those atomic motions which are most developed by a few collisions
 will usually be those of which the periodic time is most subject to perturbation (sec
 Phil. Mag. 1868, vol. xxxvi. p. 132). They will therefore in such cases give rise to dilated
 lines in the solar spectrum, and if the circumstances bo such as to cause much of the
  breadth of the line to appear quite black, as for example in many of the iron lines, it will
  in consequence   of its breadth appear much more     intense. On the other hand it should
  be remembered     as against our conjecture,  that if tho RuhmkorfTs sparks last as long as
  the measures Wheatstone        mado  of the duration of the spark of a Lcydcn Jar, viz.
  four Vth-seconds, the number of collisions which take place during the continuance of a
 spark must be so great as to take away much from the probability of the explanation.

22                        Mr. G.   J. Stoney   on the Physical                  [Recess,
 spicuous as dark rays.          These same rays, since they are due to feeble
atomic     motions,  will,  in  the  iron spectrum produced by artificial means,
 appear the faintest.       Now in all regions of the iron spectrum artificially
 produced, rays present themselves of every possible degree of intensity ;
 whereas of those observed by Kirchhoff in the solar spectrum, the fluc
 tuation of intensity in any one region of the spectrum seldom exceeds one
 degree of his numerical scale, and but once exceeds two degrees.                  This is
 conclusive evidence      that iron is so very abundant in the solar atmosphere as
 to be opaque     for the feeblest of these rays before a depth is reached which
is very much hotter than the outer surface of the iron atmosphere.                      It
 also shows that the gradation of brightness in the iron lines from the more
 to the less refrangible parts of the spectrum is not due to the less refran
 gible lines    coming from profound depths, and being on this account
 brighter.    But the cause is sufficiently obvious.          If a body of such a kind
 that it emits the maximum light corresponding to its temperature, be
gradually heated, it will first begin to glow with scarlet, orange, yellow, and
 green rays ; and according as its temperature rises its spectrum will ex
 pand in both directions towards the extreme red, and still more towards
 the violet.    If, then,    a body heated in a furnace be compared with one
 at a much      higher temperature, the spectrum of the former will every
where be fainter than that of the latter, but not equally so.               It may have
a considerable brightness in the red and orange rays, and show sensible
light in the green, and at the same time appear in the comparison abso
lutely black at higher rcfrangibilities.         And the same general appearance*
would doubtless be found         if the maximum spectrum of any one tempera
ture were compared with the maximum spectrum of a higher tempera-
turet.      Now the upper layer of the iron atmosphere, from which comes
all the light that reaches us in the iron lines of the sun's spectrum, is at a
vastly lower temperature than the photosphere, but not so cool as to be of
insensible brightness through the whole range of the spectrum.                  It begins
to glow sensibly in the green, even in comparison with the intense light of
the sun, and renders the iron lines of the green short of absolute blackness.
And this effect goes on increasing until it reaches its climax in the orange
and red.

molecules, in the ratio of 40 to 56, calcium vapour must reach a far cooler

          §
   t It is natural to suppose that this steady increase of intensity with the temperature
which pervades the whole range of the visible spectrum, should extend beyond it ; and
we are assured of it by the phenomena       of calorescence.    Dr. Tyndall succeeded in
heating a body so as to be visible by the concentration upon it of rays beyond the red.
This would have been impossible,— it would have been at variance with the principles of
the exchange of heat, ifvthe rays which wero brought,
                                                        together were of an intensity that
could be emitted by a non-luminous source.       Hence the source from which they came
(which was in fact a far hotter body whose luminous rays had been intercepted) was
able to send forth invisible rays more intense  than any non-luminous body could emit.

  region   of the solar atmosphere than iron.             Nevertheless none* of the
  calcium lines observed by Kirchhoff appear to be as intense as many of the
  iron lines.    This is no doubt due to calcium vapour being a much smaller
  constituent of the sun's atmosphere than iron, just as oxygen is less abun
  dant  in our atmosphere than nitrogen, and carbonic acid much                 less abun
  dant  than either.     Judging from the indigo and green calcium lines, which
  are all less intense than the ir»n lines in their neighbourhood, it would
  appear that some light reaches us from a hotter region than any light
 that reaches us from iron lines, and accordingly that calcium gas is so rare,
 and in consequence the stratum which can intercept and therefore is em
 ployed in emitting these rays is so thick that, though its upper surface
 soars far above the upper surface of the iron atmosphere, its under surface
 stretches further down than the under surface of the corresponding, and
 comparatively shallow, active stratum of iron gas.                 This appears to be
 the case too with most of the rest of the calcium lines observed by Kirch
 hoff; but the lines 55-99 and 56-03 in the yellowish -green, and the lines
  61-63, 64-32, and 64-55 in the red, all of which are of intensity 5, arc
  probably exceptions, and owe their strength to calcium gas being much
  more opake in reference to them, so that they are emitted by a stratum
  shallow enough to reach but little beyond the extreme verge of the iron
 atmosphere.       These are some of the lines that give the calcium light,
 when seen undispersed, its beautiful purple colour.             Calcium is no doubt
 very opake also in reference to the other lines of the same class, such as
 the lines H,, H3 and g, beyond the limit of KirchhofPs maps.                  In taking
 a general review of the calcium spectrum, these lines should be left out of
 consideration as not being comparable with the rest ; and if this be done,
 the remaining lines will exhibit the same gradation of intensity                from the
 red to the blue which we found in the iron lines.
     32. But in the immense extent of atmosphere which spreads upward
 from    the surface of the calcium, in the vast elevation to the boundary of
 the atmospheres of magnesium and sodium, and in the far greater heights
 to   which hydrogen alone can soar, the temperature has fallen too low
to produce light visible in comparison with solar light in any part of the
spectrum.       And accordingly all the lines referable to magnesium, sodium,
or hydrogen, in whatever part of the spectrum they may lie, are in
tensely black.        But before proceeding to examine these lines in detail,

line 56-07 of intensity 5, which is also a line common to the two spectra, is probably a
stronger lino on this account than it would be either as a calcium or as an iron line.

throughout the depth of each such upper stratum the stream of heat                                   is   on
the decrease.
     34. We shall               better understand     what takes place by considering the
agency by which the heat               is   carried outwards through the solar atmosphere.
It    partly by conduction, but principally
     is                                                              by

and irregular motions such as would result from storms.      By conduction
I    mean that conductionwhich    effected by the rectilinear motions of the

                      It   is
itnecessary to attend, since the quantities of transparent gas upon which
they operate are not such as to be, in the cool state in which they have
examined them, perceptibly opake to any of the incident rays.      But when
the gas    incandescent
             is          and present in enormous quantity, the chief trans
ference of heat through      will be in consequence of what

by one part of the gas are absorbed by the surrounding parts before they
can reach the outer boundary and escape.                             If

any particular ray, which      in general the case of those rays that appear

rapid carriage of the heat to great distances.     It should also be borne                                in
mind that      an extensive gas have
                 if                     uniform temperature throughout, the

the photosphere should attain            un enormous temperature.           It is in contact
with      the luminous clouds, and would on this account alone be brought to
as high a temperature          as theirs ; but, beside this, rays of every refrangi-
bility     are emitted from the hotter region beneath the clouds of an intensity
corresponding to the far more consuming heat which there prevails. And
if     out of this terrific heat all the rays be selected which correspond to all
the spectral lines of every gas in the solar atmosphere, they will constitute
a body of heat, a small part of which is no doubt spent upon the gauze
like     luminous clouds, or absorbed by the intermingled atmosphere, but the
bulk of which is poured into the atmosphere overhead. On the other
hand the only heat which escapes outwards from this upper atmosphere is
the quantity, small in comparison, which is emitted by these same spectral
rays at the reduced temperatures which correspond to the dusky lines
visible in the solar spectrum, or to similar lines lying beyond the limits we
 can see*. All the rest of the heat received by the superincumbent atmo
 sphere is returned by it downwards, and is the measure of the fervid tem
 perature which its lowest stratum attains. Thus the atmosphere above
 the luminous clouds will begin by waxing in temperature, and continues to
 grow hotter through that interval to which the heat emitted from beneath
 can in any abundance directly penetrate.               At the limit of this space there
 will be a surface of maximum temperature, after which the heat will very
 gradually fade off by reason of the conduction, convection, and internal
 radiation which feed the escape outwards from the upper layers of the
 successive atmospheres.
      36. It is of importance        to observe that      if the boundary of any one of
 the gases that constitute         the sun's atmosphere fall within the stratum
 which is hotter than the luminous clouds, or very close above it, that gas
  can only exist in a state of such utter attenuation within the stratum that
 we can scarce expect to detect any lines in the spectrum corresponding to
  it. The stratum in question rests upon the luminous clouds beneath, and its
  upper limit is to be defined as that situation in which the temperature has
  again fallen to the same point at which it stands in the shell of clouds.                At
  all intermediate stations the temperature is higher, or, in other words, the
  motions of the molecules of the gases are more active. At the upper and
  under boundaries of the stratum they are equal ; but the pressure, and
  consequently the density, is somewhat less at the upper station, or, in
  other words, the molecules of the gases constituting the atmosphere are
   there a little more separated.           Now any gas which comes to an end
  within the stratum must        be unable to maintain         itself at the upper surface
       * We should remember that much of the sun's heat lies in this direction           ;  for
   Hie wave-lengths of almost all visible vibrations lie between 4 and 8 seventh-metres,   and
   the invisible rays beyond the extreme lavender probably do not include waves much
   less in length than 2 seventh-metres, w hile the obscure heat-rays at the other end of the
  spectrum have been observed to extend, though with decreasing intensity, until the waves
  are 18 or 20 seventh-metres long, and probably reach much further.

   of the layer, while in the stratum of luminous clouds it is able to hold its
   ground with equal molecular motions, solely because the molecules are there
   somewhat nearer together.            It must therefore at the lower station be in a
   state of almost inconceivable rarefaction ; and, from the laws of diffusion,
   its density at any higher point can nowhere go beyond this.                  It appears,
   therefore, almost in vain to expect to see bright lines in the solar spectrum.
   If, however, any such exist*, they will probably be most readily detected
   in light taken from near the margin of the sun's disk, where the bright
   ness of the region behind the luminous clouds is cut off, and where the
   thickness of the stratum of attenuated gas which forms the bright lines is
   increased by the oblique position of the spectator.
       37. This rarefaction (which would be carried to an extreme in the case of
  a gas, if any such exist, which extends into, but not beyond, the stratum
  that is hotter than the luminous clouds) will also affect in a very consi
  derable degree those gases which do not spread far beyond it.                     Accord
  ingly the fainter lines in the solar spectrum either arise from such low-
  lying gases in a state of great tenuity, in which case those lines only can
  be visible in reference to which these gases are most opake, which will
  therefore be the brightest of their artificial spectra ; or they arise from
  constituents of the solar atmosphere which spread into the colder regions
  above, in which case they can only be those lines in reference to which
  these gases are highly transparent — such as are lines 50-48 and 53-52 of
  the Calcium spectrum, and the lines 49'21 and 51-81 of the Nickel spec
  trum.      It may perhaps be found that faint lines of this latter class will be
  seen about equally distinctly in spectra formed of light taken from the
  centre of the sun's disk, and in spectra formed of light taken from near its
  margin.      When the light is taken from the centre these lines have the ad
 vantage of a brighter background to set them off ; when it is taken from
 the margin they have in their favour the greater depth of Calcium or of
 Nickel atmosphere which is looked through. But in the case of those
 faint lines of the other class which originate in the lower strata of the sun's
     *  I have several times thought   I saw such a line, of wave-length 58-88, between the
 more refrangible of the lines D and the next line recorded in Eirchhoff's map to the
 left, almost in contact with this latter line. The appearance, however, may have arisen
 from the adjoining part of the spectrum having been subdued by lines not marked on
 KirchhofT's map, and which a spectroscope of two equilateral flint-glass prisms could
 not sufficiently make out.     I sometimes received the impression that there were such
 dim lines, but could not satisfy myself that they accounted for the bright line.       Pos
sibly there is also a bright line somewhere between the lines 1025-5 and 1027-7 of
 Eirchhoff's scale, and another in the right hand of the two parts into which the space
between the lines     D is divided by the Nickel line.    Although it is on the whole im
probable that the appearances are really due to bright lines, it would perhaps be worth
repeating the observations under more favourable circumstances, of which the most
important would be to admit only light from the margin of the sun's disk.        If the sus
pected bright line between the      lines D should prove real, it is perhaps occasioned by
zinc.     [For a continuation of this note, see the postscript, p. 57.]

     38.     Let us now consider the information given to                  us by the lines   of the
spectrum  which are due to hydrogen, sodium, and magnesium.       In the
first       the sodium lines are narrow and sharply defined. In both
          place
respects they differ from the lines of hydrogen and magnesium, which arc
broad and winged, that       shaded off on one or both sides into dusky
                                      is,
bands less dark than themselves.      Now at and up to the temperature of
the flame         of a spirit-lamp sodium vapour                can give rise to such lines
                                                                                      but     ;
at   the temperature of          a   Bunsen's     burner the sodium lines have begun to
expand  and be ill defined.                 Hence we learn that in those upper regions of
the sun's sodium atmosphere in which                       these lines originate, the temperature
is lower than that of the flame of                   a     Bunsen's    burner.   Nor   need we be
astonished      that this or much lower temperature can prevail so

the     fierce heat of the photosphere, when we take into account how                       effectu
ally the  outer parts of the sun's atmosphere are screened from the glare
beneath by the stoppage in the intermediate regions of almost every ray
that could act upon them.
   39. The absence of wings to the lines D indicatest to us that there      not               is
in  the sun's atmosphere enough of sodium vapour of temperatures inter
mediate between the temperature of Bunsen's burner and the temperature

drain off heat from this region.       No heat passes beyond, except the small
quantity necessary  to keep  up   the  feeble escape from the lines of hydrogen,
sodium, and magnesium, and others of the same class, such as B, A, &c.,
which are not only of a lower temperature, but are also few in number, if
we may deem those that fall within the visible part of the spectrum a
sufficient sample of the whole.       Since, then, there is so much greater an
escape of heat from the upper layer of the iron atmosphere than from the
regions outside, there will exist a surface of minimum temperature near
the limit of the iron, beyond which there will be first a very slight recovery
and then a gradual fading off of the temperature.          The observations of the
sodium lines indicate that this surface of minimum temperature which lies
near the outer boundary of the layer from which iron lines originate, can
not be as hot as the flame of a Bunsen's burner.
   4 1 . Within the iron atmosphere, on the other hand, there is a rapid
stream of heat directed outwards to supply the outpourings from near the
boundary of the iron atmosphere, as well as what is feebly dispersed by
lines such as those of hydrogen, sodium, and magnesium.                Still further
down the stream becomes        a torrent, as    it has there to supply also the
lavish expenditure of heat by the multitude of lines more faint than the
iron lines, which are not only more numerous than lines of an intensity
comparable with the iron lines, but also each one of which discharges into
space a flood  of heat proportioned to its exalted temperature, or, in other
words, to its faintness as a line in the spectrum.        All this leads us to con
clude not only that the temperature increases very rapidly within the iron
atmosphere, but that the rate of this increase becomes more and more pre
cipitate as we descend.     And this is in exact accordance with the intelli
gence brought to us by the sodium lines,        which, from being wingless, indi
cate that the interval  from  the  surface   of  the iron to the region where the
temperature first becomes comparable with that of the photosphere, is
both intensely hotter, and of trifling extent when compared with the vast
expanse    from the surface of the iron up to the surface of the sodium
atmosphere.
   42. Molecules of magnesium have very nearly the same mass as mole
cules of sodium.    The two gases therefore rise to nearly the same height
in the solar atmosphere.     Nevertheless      the lines in the spectrum due to
magnesium present a very different aspect from those of sodium, into which
we must now inquire.       The lines of sodium are narrow and sharp ; those
of magnesium broad and fringed, the borders being of the intensity that
Kirchhoff represents by the number 4. Now, the iron lines in their neigh
bourhood are of intensities 5 and 6, which shows that the upper layer of
iron in which the iron lines take their rise may be distinguished into two
strata, the outer of which produces in that part of the spectrum lines of
intensity 6, while both together produce lines of intensity 5. To produce
a line of intensity 4, a third stratum below the layer in which iron lines
originate must be in action.      Light reaches us from this third stratum in

  the wings    of the magnesium lines      ; and in fact the black part of the mag
  nesium    lines is due exclusively to the magnesium vapours between the top
  of the magnesium atmosphere and the plane of demarcation between the
  two strata into which we have distinguished             the active layer of iron,
 while the wings are caused,       at least in part, by the magnesium vapour which
 exists   in the lower section of the active layer of iron and in the stratum
 which immediately adjoins it beneath.               Thus the layer of magnesium
which gives rise to the lines of the group b may conveniently be distin
guished into two parts, the outer of which extends from the remote boun
dary of the magnesium atmosphere to the middle of the layer from which
iron lines      originate, and the second from this latter station through a
hotter layer      which lies further down. If magnesium vapour existed in the
situation of this lower moiety only, the magnesium lines would be bands
of their present breadth, but nowhere attaining the intensity 6 : the super
position of the central black stripe is the work of the magnesium vapour
in the vast outer section.
    43. When we take into account how much higher a specific opacity
sodium and magnesium vapour have than iron for the principal rays which
they respectively       emit, we are led to conclude that while magnesium va
pour is abundant when compared with the attenuated vestige of sodium in
the   sun's atmosphere, it may be but sparingly present when compared with
such a constituent as iron; and that this is so is established by the absence
from the sun's spectrum of any lines corresponding to the rays of magne
sium,    in reference   to which the specific opacity    of magnesium is low, such
 as  the magnesium lines 44-92 and 46' 06.
    44. We have found that there is but the merest trace           of sodium in the
 sun's atmosphere,       and that this trace mounts to an immense height above
 the  iron.     To render this possible there must      be some abundant gas which
 extends     as far as or beyond the sodium, in which it may diffuse itself, and
 so be   borne to the full height corresponding to the small mass of its mole
 cules.     The gas which does it this service appears to be hydrogen, which,
 having    a  molecular mass only one twenty-third of that of sodium, must soar
 to an   almost inconceivably greater height.
    Hydrogen seems to be a very large constituent of the sun's atmosphere.
 There are three considerable rays in the spectrum of incandescent hydro
 gen,   and a fourth faint one has been lately pointed out by Angstrom.          To
 these   four rays, even to the faintest, there correspond intensely black lines
 in  the solar spectrum.       This indicates an abundance of hydrogen.        The
 wave-lengths      of the four lines are 41-04, the new hydrogen line, Ang
 strom's h, in the violet; 43'43, in the indigo, which is the second of the
 six very conspicuous lines seen in the sun's spectrum on the less refrangi
 ble side of G ; 48-65 in the blue, which is Fraunhofer's          F ; and 65-68 in
 the red, which is Fraunhofer's C.           All these lines are winged : the black
 stripe in the more refrangible lines is very broad, and in the others it is
of considerable width.        These circumstances also indicate an abundance

30                     Mr. G.  J. Stoncy  on the  Physical             [Recess,
of hydrogen.      The temperature of the sun's atmosphere above the surface
of the iron is too low to dilate hydrogen lines. The breadth, therefore, of
the black part of the hydrogen lines must be due to the quantity of this
element which is to be found in the interval between the outer boundary
of the iron and that situation in which the temperature first becomes
too high to appear black when projected against the brightness of the
photosphere. This interval is small in the part of the spectrum where the
line C occurs ; at the line F it extends through a considerable part of the
thickness of the layer that gives out iron lines ; at the hydrogen line near
G it extends quite through this layer ; and in the situation of the fourth
hydrogen line it extends much further down.           But even in the least of
these intervals there is enough of hydrogen to give a very sensible breadth
to the line C.     This quantity must be very considerable ; as also must the
 quantity   which  can produce, in the hotter regions below, the fringes which
border all the hydrogen lines. To recapitulate, — the width of the hydrogen
lines, the wings that fringe them, the intense line in the sun's spectrum
 which corresponds to a faint hydrogen ray, and the height to which
 hydrogen can support traces of other gases, and more especially the vestige
 of sodium in the solar atmosphere, all testify to the abundance of this
 element.
     45. The sodium lines    D  are an open channel    through which heat is
 poured from a very hot region into that immense upper expanse of the
 sun's atmosphere which is tenanted by sodium, magnesium, and hydrogen
 alone.    This is not the case with the magnesium lines of the group h, nor
 with the four hydrogen lines. These all stop heat before it has travelled
 to any great distance, by reason of the great abundance of hydrogen, and
 by reason of the specific opacity of magnesium for the rays b, and its
 quantity, which, though small, is immeasurably greater than the quantity
 of sodium.     And on a different account, the same may be true of the
 faint rays of the spectra of sodium and magnesium.            Two such mag
 nesium rays were observed by Kirchhoff of wave-lengths 44-92 and 46-06;
 and Huggins has recorded three faint pairs of sodium lines, of wave-lengths
 51-6, 56-9, and 6T6, and a nebulous band at 49-9.           It is not yet fully
 ascertained whether there are lines in the solar spectrum answering to any
 of these rays.     If there are such lines, they are faint.    Now, if it shall
 prove that no such lines can be detected, it will indicate that heat from
 beneath of these wave-lengths passes without sensible diminution through
 the cool parts of the sun's atmosphere and therefore does not heat them ;
  and if it be found that they give rise to faint lines, this faintness is to be
  attributed to but little of the heat despatched from hot regions being en
  tangled in its passage outwards.      Similarly the heat which is so trans
  mitted through the wings of conspicuous lines crosses with little obstruc
  tion the colder regions above ; since at the temperatures that there prevail
  few of the periodic times of the atomic orbits deviate sufficiently from
  those central periodic times which correspond to the middles of the lines.

     46.   But of whatever kind
                            these or other vehicles for the conveyance of
heat beyond the atmospheres of calcium and iron may be, it is certain that
no sodium or magnesium rays can carry heat beyond the limits of the so
dium atmosphere.           Itis also certain that the heat borne outwards is un
able to maintain         beyond the iron atmosphere a temperature as high as
that of    a Bunsen's burner, and that, after passing a situation but          little out
side the iron, the temperature falls off from this maximum.      It must
have sunk very low where the next considerable escape of heat takes place
— at the boundaries of the atmospheres of magnesium and sodium. Ac
cordingly, we must regard the hydrogen in that still higher dreary waste
which is tenanted by hydrogen alone, as a feebly conducting body, of im
mense depth, warmed but moderately beneath, and exposed on the outside
to a chilling radiation towards the open sky. Its outer strata must be in
tensely cold.
     47. The case  of a comet consisting of a gas * not found in the solar at
mosphere is altogether different.     As it approaches the sun it is exposed to
the full unveiled glare of the photosphere, and absorbs the heat of those
wave-lengths which correspond to the lines of its spectrum.    However small
a part of the incident heat this may be,  it may make the comet nearly as hot
as an opake body would become          ;   since the comet can lose by radiation no
heat except through these same spectral rays.
  48. Having now examined in detail the lines of hydrogen, sodium,
magnesium, calcium, and iron, we may treat in a more cursory manner the
other elements that have been observed in the sun's atmosphere.    Chro
mium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and zinc enter in small quantities into the
     * If, indeed,
                 a comet consist of gas, which, perhaps, we ought to deem '.highly im
probable.   The molecules of a gas pass most of their time beyond the reach of one
another's molecular action, and, unless further confined by a sufficient force of gravity,
would each pursue an independent orbit of its own. They would therefore tend gra
dually to extend like a stream of meteors along their common path ; for the orbits
being slightly different would have slightly different periodic times, which in the lapse
of ages would operate in this way. It does not appear likely that the gravity   ofa body
so large, and with so small a mass as a comet, could successfully withstand     this ten
dency. But if the comet were kept together by a molecular cohesion, somewhat like a
solid, there would be no such difficulty. Nor is it necessary to suppose that this solid,
if such we are to call    it,
                          would retain this constitution when subjected to an intense
gravity like the earth's  :the hardest Archangel pitch flattens down under its own
weight, and in time adapts itself to its containing vessel. The matter of comets may
on our earth be gas.
  And, again,    seems improbable that comet can have been raised to the temperature

composition of the sun's atmosphere.     Probably nickel is the most abun
dant of them.   Of the others no lines appear in the sun's spectrum, except
those in reference to which they have a high specific opacity, in many
cases  higher than that which iron has for any of its rays. There are,
therefore, but traces of them present ; and the appearance of the lines
agrees well with the situation in the sun's atmosphere assigned to them
by the masses of their molecules : chromium, projecting quite through the
iron atmosphere, produces a few lines of an intensity comparable with that
of the iron lines in their neighbourhood ; and the boundaries of cobalt,
nickel,copper, and zinc, appear to lie within that upper layer of iron
which sends forth iron lines.
      49.    The appearance of the zinc lines is not incompatible                               with this
element's having the vapour- density usually supposed by chemists, viz.,
32\5 instead of 65 ; but the evidence of the sun's spectrum, such as it
is,for     scanty, owing to the paucity of the lines, seems to lean against
            it   is

this point, there    at least no doubt that barium cannot have

number, which would barely raise the boundary of the barium atmosphere
within the lower part of the layer from which iron lines proceed and,                           ;      if
it                                     grounds, the strength of such lines
     were not for objections on chemical
as the barium lines 45-66, 49-37, and 61-43 would prompt us to suspect
for the vapour of barium even    lower density.   But the strength of these

barium in the sun's atmosphere.

              readily be perceived that      vain to look for the cause of

density more than 70 times that of hydrogen.      This narrows very much
the field in which to search for the origin of the darker of the lines enume
rated in Table III., opposite, the table of unappropriated lines. Many
of these, as, for example, three of the five lines of the group at 60-3, are
probably due to manganese, and may be removed from this table, as soon as
a list of the thirty manganese lines, lately identified Angstrom, shall              by
have been published.    Others of them are probably some of the 460 iron
lines, produced              by
                   continuous electrical current, or among the additional
                                  a
lines which may be produced under like circumstances in others of the
elements which we have been heretofore examining.     When all these are
eliminated            it   not seem likely that many conspicuous

  But it is very much to be wished that a comparison should be made of the
 spectra of boron, fluorine, sulphur, chlorine, titanium, and phosphorus,
 with the sun's spectrum, and especially of chlorine, if any weight is to be
 attached to the suspicion, founded on very insufficient grounds, that the
 solar lines 43-40— , 43 55— , 66-38, 66 50. 66-68, and 70- 00, the group of
three lines at 45-1, and several others, are to referred to this element.
    51. The absence from the sun's atmosphere of such gases as nitrogen
and oxygen, and of hydrogen from the atmospheres of some other stars,
and the fact that while some active chemical agents lose, like sulphuric
acid, their energy under such increasing temperatures as our laboratories
can provide,     others, like boracic acid, become practically more powerful,
give a considerable amount of colour to the presumption that compound bo
dies exist in the sun.         The masses of the molecules of these compound
bodies will in most cases be too high to permit them, however volatile, to
reach the cool parts of the sun's atmosphere, so as to reveal themselves in
conspicuous solar lines.       But the probability of their so appearing is very
much greater in the class of ruddy stars, as we shall find in the sequel ; and,
perhaps it is not impossible that the line B of the solar spectrum, or some
of the lines less refrangible than B, may result from some compound of
low vapour-density, such as hydrochloric acid*.              It is certainly very re
markable that neither B nor any line less refrangible has up to the pre
sent been identified with a ray of any simple substance.
    52. Upon a general view of all the lines of the solar spectrum it appears
that their intensity continuously diminishes from the violet end of the
spectrum up to the line B. At this point, owing to the sudden introduc
tion of an entirely new set of lines, their intensity abruptly and very much
increases.     These new lines either have a terrestrial origin or come from
substances which stand high in the solar atmosphere. The lines, however,
which originate further down, do not attain their minimum of intensity
until they reach a point further to the right than B. This appears both
from the progressive diminution of their intensity up to B, and from the
total, or almost total, absence of lines further on, wherever a vacuity is left
between the lines which we must attribute to a different origin, as at wave
 lengths 71-1, 73-8, and in the wide spaces between the prominent lines from
 this situation up to the line A.
    53. When this is considered in connexion with the cause to which the
diminution of intensity is to be referred, it indicates that if two perfectly
radiating bodies were gradually heated while the difference of their tempe
ratures was kept constantly the same, the point of the spectrum at which
the difference of their brightness is least would advance with increasing
temperatures towards the red end of the spectrum.                When the body of
   *  If there be chlorine in the sun's atmosphere, the presumption upon chemical
grounds is very strong that there must be hydrochloric acid in the upper regions ; and
from its vapour density (18'25) the lines of hydrochloric acid would be black in
whatever part of the spectrum they might occur.

lower temperature has but just begun to glow, we know that this situation
of minimum difference of brightness is found in the orange ; at tempera
tures approaching that of the photosphere it has removed at all events as
far as the line A, that is nearly to the extreme verge of the visible spectrum,
and it has, perhaps, advanced beyond it. This, as we shall find further
on, explains how some solitary stars can attain a depth of colour that ap
proaches crimson.
    54. It appears from the analysis which has-been made that none other
of the gases in the solar atmosphere that extend as far as the stratum
from which iron lines come, can compare in quantity with hydrogen and
iron ; and from what has been stated in § 36, we may be sure that there is
no very abundant gas which comes to its limit in the hot regions that in
tervene between this stratum and the photosphere. Hydrogen and iron are
accordingly the principal ingredients of the parts of the sun's atmosphere
which extend beyond the photosphere.
          Section  IV. — Of the   Photosphere and the subjacent parts.
    55.  In interpreting phenomena of solar spots we should never forget the
 disadvantages under which we attempt the enterprise.            Our theory may
be true, but it is incomparably more meagre than our knowledge of the
 causes of terrestrial weather.     Our observations may be correct, but they
 give  us only outside glimpses, and from       such a distance that France or
 Spain would be specks too small to make out whether they are round or
 square. We must not imitate the peasant who saw from afar the smoke of
a great city, and persuaded     himself he had a very good idea of the kind of
place a city is. If our explanations of the phenomena of terrestrial weather
are dim and unsatisfying, we cannot reasonably ask from a theory of the cor
responding phenomena of the sun, even though it were beyond a doubt the
true theory, more than the first hazy and rude sketch of an interpretation.
    56. Many fixed gases which are too heavy to extend at all, or in any abun
 dance, through the stratum of minimum temperature, must wax in density
very rapidly within it.     Hence the density of the solar atmosphere becomes
 almost suddenly greater at the shell of luminous clouds.          This may be
the cause of an appearance not unfrequent in spots near the margin of the
 sun's disk, in which situation the further side of the umbra of a spot is
 often bordered by a bright crescent, giving to the umbra the appearance of
 a hole punched through a plate.        This appears to be because there is, in
 these cases, in reality a depression of the dense strata at the umbra, shal
low, perhaps, but yet with sides sufficiently inclined to enable light coming
 so obliquely as to suffer total reflection* against the flatter surface of the
penumbra, to escape through it.         A similar cause may, perhaps, and pro
bably does, enable light to escape from patches of the penumbra when
the surface of the penumbra is irregularly undulating in a sufficient degree.
                     * Such an that which produces Fata Morgana.

 Local showers   are in other cases the cause   of brightness in the umbra and
 penumbra.
    The sudden increase of density of the sun's atmosphere at the pho
 tosphere must serve to keep the luminous stratum in a nearly spherical
 form. The surfaces of the gases above the photosphere may be violently
 tossed about by the storms of the solar atmosphere, but the surface of the
 photosphere is never carried further than to the top of a facula or the bot
 tom of the umbra of a spot.
    57. The winds which affect the photosphere may be distinguished into
two classes, those of the sun's outer atmosphere, and those of the regions
within the photosphere.       Both classes may coexist in different parts of
the same storm. The former class sweeping through the open space above
the photosphere, and through rarefied air, will often come from far, and as
 a general rule be the swiftest.     Those below, moving in the dense part of
 the atmosphere, and perhaps within         a confined  space, can but seldom
attain the same high velocity.
    58. Both classes of wind tend to obliterate the cool film in which clouds
usually exist, and  to replace   it by hotter air. But the hotter air substi
tuted by winds from below, will be equally charged with moisture ; while
winds from above will tend to dilute with dry air both the cool film and
the adjoining strata immediately under it.         In both cases new and more
transparent clouds will form ; but in the former case the rain will not cease,
and we have only facula ; in the latter it may and often does, — in fact,
whenever the film of clouds and the subjacent stratum with which it is
mixed by convection, have been rendered sufficiently dry. When by pro
longed convection this state of things is passing away, there will be a
struggle between dry weather and wet, which we shall see in the patched
appearance of the penumbra.
    59. An umbra presents itself when the cloud, too, is removed, and the
dusky body of the sun seen through the opening.          It does not seem likely
that this can take place so long as there is any of the moist stratum at a
temperature below its boiling-point and exposed to radiation.        If this view
be correct, the umbra can only occur either when the depression caused
by a rotatory storm, or by winds impinging from above, has obliterated the
dense stratum and brought the air into contact with the ocean ; or when,
by the influx of hot air from above or the upheaving of the hot strata
beneath, it has come to pass that throughout the whole of a vertical column
there is no place where the vapour which forms cloud is at a temperature
below its boiling-point.      If  this happen through the rise of subjacent
strata, we should have an umbra without penumbra ; and it does not seem
impossible that the same appearance may sometimes present itself where a
depression is caused by a wind impinging from above which has not exerted
much horizontal friction against the surrounding parts of the photosphere.
    GO. It must often happen that a hot current sweeping over the surface
 of the penumbra     dissolves awav part of the cloud, diluting the vapour
                                                                  d 2

while exposed underneath to the heat of the penumbra.                If a current so
charged with vapour happen to cross the umbra, it will receive less heat from
below, and some of the vapour in it will now be able by radiation to main
tain itself as cloud.      This cloud will be peculiarly circumstanced.          It is
formed from an isolated body of vapour, and once formed will continue in
existence, since the hot currents which will rise at intervals through it when
convection sets in, will consist of dry air unable to generate the cloud
overhead, which would otherwise screen it from the open sky.                   It will
accordingly often find itself under circumstances to become by reason of
this prolonged existence progressively cooler ; and as the temperature falls,
 more of the vapour is able to precipitate itself, until at length the cloud

 dissolved in the dry air below, long before it can reach the body of the sun ;
 but if it last through a space of even a few thousand metres, it will give to
 the bridge of vapour the brightness of a facula.         In other  cases the vapour
 either carried into the umbra from around,               or perhaps rising into it
 from a steaming ocean beneath, appears to form mere pellicles of cloud
 that mottle its deep shadow.           When the storm is of the nature of a
 whirlwind,    a current    of dry outer air which has not lapped up mois
 ture from the photosphere, usually seems also sucked in, and manifests
 its presence in the dark spot which Mr. Dawes has called the nucleus of
 the umbra.
     61. It appears more reasonable to suppose that the phenomena which
 have hitherto been explained by the transference of ponderable matter over
 immense distances in incredibly short times, the filling up of gulfs, and the
 like, are phenomena of the rapid formation or dissolution of cloud, and lose
 much of their marvellous character.          Terrestrial cloud may be seen to form
 within a very    few minutes over the whole       of the visible heavens, and often
 when there is no wind, or apparently advancing against the wind.
      62. If there be a substance in the sun of low vapour-density,           but not
  capable of existing in a state of vapour in the coolness of the height to
  which it would otherwise rise, and if this refractory substance is volatile at
  the temperature and pressure which exist lower down, it will behave in a
  very peculiar manner.       In the lower strata of the sun's atmosphere it will
  exist as a vapour ; and from this situation it will keep continually making
  its way upward in its effort to find its natural level.        Before it reaches its
  destination, however, the gas incessantly streaming upward will as inces
  santly be precipitated.      If the particles of the cloud so formed are heavier
  than the surrounding       atmosphere, they will begin to subside.         Not only
  so, but the   chill caused   by their radiation in their new solid or liquid state,
  will make the inverse flame spoken of in § 8 burn downwards, until it
   sinks to that level at which the upward supply of vapour, owing to its
   tendency to diffuse itself upwards, or caused by currents of convection,
   exactly balances    the   downward     motion of the fiery cloud from         subsi

 dence or the  descending currents of convection.   Here, then, if this sub
stance be  in sufficient abundance, we have all the conditions necessary for
the sun's luminous clouds.     And we are led almost irresistibly to conjec
ture that in carbon* we have such a substance. The mass of its molecules
is very low, either six, or twelve, or twenty-four                       times the mass of a mole
cule     of hydrogen.       It   appears to have just the requisite degree of fixed
ness ; it shows no sign of volatility at any ordinary high temperature, but
has been driven  into vapour by one hundred elements of Bunsen's battery,
each element consisting of six ordinary cells coupled side by side ; that is
at a temperature which may, quite consistently with everything we know,
be that of the strata adjoining the sun's photosphere.    There is enough of
carbon in the sun to produce the luminous clouds, if carbon be as large a
constituent of the sun as it is of the earth ; and most of the carbon in the
sun is    probably uncombined,         as carbon does               not seem apt to form com
pounds     likely   to be abundant which can stand intense heat.                It moreover,

the phenomena of spots that      not. it   is

remove the one difficulty in which this hypothesis involves us.  Now, in
the first place,  would disappear

clouds melts the falling flakes, so that they reach the ocean like rain,
and mix with the other liquids constituting it.  And    would disappear       it
if the heat and dryness of the space beneath the clouds enable        to                      it
evaporate the flakes ere they reach the ocean.    And, finally, would dis           it
appear   there be no such ocean, but only continuation of the atmosphere

has by far the lowest vapour-density.    It at all events, presumable that

among   such abundant   elements as nitrogen, oxygen, silicium, and alumi

sun, there may be some which, like carbon, are solid or liquid at the tem
peratures and pressures of the greatest heights to which they would, if
gaseous,      rise.    the atmosphere of the sun extend to any great dis
                       And     if
tance below the photosphere, there must be in the sun such     substance                  a
to account for the dusky background  we see in the penumbrae and  umbra
of   spots.     There must in this case be               a second layer of clouds, formed not
far beyond the photosphere,                       in the comparatively short space through
which the temperature augments rapidly between the luminous clouds and
the central parts of the sun. These clouds must, moreover, be of some
transparent material to possess in sufficient degree that property of scat
                                                     a
tering light which would render them as devoid of emissive power as we
see them to be.            For the      same        reason    we must conclude      that the sooty
shower from above cannot reach them, as                         it   would inevitably soil them, so
as to deprive them         of these  qualities. We learn from this, that the
                                         essential
point at which carbon boils must fall within the short interval between the
two layers of clouds. This    not at all unlikely, inasmuch as the advance
                                             is
downwards of the inverse flame, of which mention has been so often made,
would probably be arrested only by its close approach, either to the bottom
of the atmosphere, or to the situation in which carbon boils, so as to be
entirely dissipated in vapour. And the second layer of clouds would quickly
follow, since its position depends on that taken up by the carbon clouds,
as    must lie within the layer of rapidly varying temperature immediately
     it
under them.           If
                  this hypothesis, then, be the true account of what takes
place on the sun, the penumbrae of spots are caused by our seeing the
clouds beneath through      gauze-like film of carbon cloud which has ceased
                                    a
to send down rain     and the umbrae of spots are formed when
                           ;                                         very shal        a
low saucer-like depression of the photosphere has carried           part of its       a
outer surface so far that     has reached the region in which carbon will
                                        it
boil.   Here the filmy cloud of carbon, which nowhere else can entirely
disappear, will be completely dissolved away.
   65. In this branch of our enquiry we are often obliged to deal with hy
pothetical matter, and cannot in such cases look for conclusions which
command our assent.      We must be satisfied     we may hope that they will

      66. But to return to what is more to be relied on, we may be sure that some
  small part of the carbon, or whatever else the luminous clouds mainly con
  sist of, and similar traces of any other ingredients that enter in less quan
  tities into their composition, must escape precipitation, and will diffuse
  themselves upwards, and the more freely as they come first to a region
  where they are raised to a higher temperature as well as subjected to less
  pressure. Through this hot stratum they will continue gaseous, but a short
  distance above it they will meet with a temperature low enough to condense
  them.      Here, then, separated from the photosphere by the whole depth of
 the hot stratum, they will form a second film of luminous clouds, one, how
  ever, which is so attenuated as to be visible only during an eclipse, when it
  constitutes the lowest of the clouds that then present themselves.                    They
  may   be  traced  in  Dr.  De  La  Rue's  photographs     of   the  eclipse of  July 1860*
 as continuous arcs of cloud extending about 35° on either side of the points
 of first and last contact. Hence, and from the apparent magnitudes of the
 sun and moon on that occasion, we may conclude that this upper shell of
 clouds was at an apparent distance of about 11" of space from the edge of
 the sun's disk, which corresponds to an absolute height above the photo
 sphere of 8 metre-sixes, or 1| time the earth's radius t. And as the
 clouds of which we are now speaking are a little outside the hot stratum
 that lies immediately over the photosphere, we shall not be far wrong in
 concluding this stratum to be about as thick as the earth's radius is long.
 The clouds outside it probably form a nearly continuous shell round the
 sun. They are everywhere of extreme tenuity, but may nevertheless be
 very variable in density ; and it is probably owing to this that the concave

    Dr. De La Rue took two eye-sketches also of the eclipse, commencing the first about
thirty seconds, according to his estimate, after the eclipse began. Now the arc of cloud
about the point of first contact is represented on the first, and indeed on both drawings,
and must have been at a greater height in the sun's atmosphere than I have assigned to
it, to have been seen by Dr. De La Rue, unless we may suppose that he overestimated
the interval of time which had elapsed by a few seconds.       This, however, on an occasion
of so much hurry, may perhaps have happened, and it seems difficult otherwise to re
concile the eye-draughts with the photographs.       The data made use of to get out the
result in the text are : —

   The allowance of    5 seconds from the moment of contact       has been made, because the
cloud seems to have taken about that time to impress itself upon the photographic plate.

sides of the two arcs shown in the photographs exhibit such a ruggedness
that, as Dr. De La Rue has pointed out, it cannot be accounted for by the
mountainous edge of the moon.     In fact the film of cloud seems to be so
excessively thin that even during an eclipse it can only be seen where it is
presented very nearly edgewise at the extreme margin of its disk, or for a
short distance inside      distance which varies with the local density of
                                      it,   a
the film, and so gives rise to the appearance in question.
   67. This second shell of clouds, as they consist of the same materials as
the clouds of the photosphere, and are higher in the atmosphere, and
therefore subjected to less pressure, will evidently not form until they can
do so at   somewhat lower temperature.
                  a                         But the difference may be so
slight that in their normal position these clouds lose more heat by radia
tion towards the sky than they receive by absorption from the photo
sphere, which would      cause them to imitate, but with   languor propor           a
tional to their flimsiness, all the phenomena of convection, &c. which we
have traced in the principal layer of clouds.
     68. But this behaviour would be altogether changed      by any cause           if              a
part of the film were borne upwards into the cool regions above.   At what
ever part of the atmosphere    cloud may find itself,

temperature                bordering upon that of the photosphere itself*. A cloud in
this situation will therefore warm, instead of cooling, the air in which                           it
                                                                                                   is
dispersed, and will tend to float violently upwards until   gets to    part of      it    a
the atmosphere so rare, that the particles of condensed vapour tend to sink
in    from their specific gravity as fast as they are carried upwards by the
     it
body of heated air entangled with them.        This may be the cause of the
columnar clouds with overhanging tops which have been observed during
eclipses. As they spread out at the top and become diffused, they will
not as effectually heat the intermingled air, and will therefore begin to sub
side.  Between clouds that are carried so violently upwards and those that
repose in the luminous shells, any intermediate descriptions may exist,
and were perhaps the cause of the mountainous projections from the upper
shell that have been seen, and of several of the detached clouds.

clouds     of the photosphere,     we must remember that there may exist other
substances in the sun or       in some other stars capable of giving rise to clouds.
If   there be materials of sufficiently low vapour-density,       and in a sufficient
degree more volatile than carbon, though not volatile enough to stand the
cold of the height to which their vapour-density would otherwise lift them,
they will be precipitated in cloud.         Or gases in the solar atmosphere which
are kept asunder by the temperatures of its lower strata, may be able to
combine in the cooler regions above.           If the new body be a solid or liquid,
it will constitute a cloud. Even if it be gaseous, it will in general have
other spectral lines than those of any lower-lying gas in the atmosphere,
and will therefore be subjected to the direct radiations of the photosphere ;
it will    accordingly become intensely heated, and in many respects behave
like a cloud. Its density, too, will in most cases be greater than that of
either of its constituents.        And, finally, a gas which in the lower parts of
the sun's atmosphere emits only rays of a spectrum of the second order,
may in the upper regions find itself under circumstances to produce a
spectrum         of the first order. If this should happen, the gas in its new
condition would be exposed to the full heat of the photosphere, and
 would conduct itself like a cloud.
     70. From the exceeding transparency of the solar clouds, they are
 entirely without that abundance of internal reflections and refractions
 which are what give to a cloud of steam dense enough to be opake, or
 a sheet of paper, or a piece of white marble, their lustre when illumi
 nated.       It is accordingly by their inherent splendour given to them by
 their being made intensely hot by the photosphere, not by borrowed
 light, that they shine. A cloud of dark opake materials is therefore,

 pressed on the photographs, though not visible to the eye, must have been

 some of higher refrangibility.
      71.   It  is very likely that there may be substances in the sun's atmo
 sphere,       or   in those of some of the stars, which reach a height at
 which they are unable to remain in the state of gas by reason of the sur
  rounding cold, or to assume permanently the form of cloud because of the
  heat of the photosphere to which they would thereupon immediately become
  exposed.        In such cases there will be a struggle between the two condi
  tions, the vapour continually condensing and redissolving until it has by
  this process imported much heat into its neighbourhood. Wherever such a
  state   of things exists, it must inevitably have the effect of raising some of
  the isothermal surfaces above the position in the atmosphere they would
 otherwise occupy.          Similar consequences would ensue if two gases became
  so cool that they could no longer continue uncombined, and were so heated
 through their new spectral lines the instant they united that the new sub
 stance was at once resolved back into its constituents ; or where a gas
 reaches a situation too cold for its existence in the state in which it sends

   72. We may catch a glimpse from the foregoing investigations of what
 appears at least a possible explanation of several phenomena of the solar
 spots, which we do not seem yet in a position to refer to their causes with
 confidence, such phenomena as the local distribution of spots and their
 periodicity.     If from
                        any cause a portion of the lower strata of the outer
 atmosphere is thrown upwards, it will carry a part of the second stratum
 of clouds above its natural level.   The intermingled air will dilate and tend
 to cool down as it ascends ; but its temperature will be restored by the heat
 absorbed and communicated to it by the cloud carried with it.         Its thus
 remaining   hot will convert what was perhaps at first only a gentle upheaval
 into a violent upward current, which will, from the operation of causes fa
 miliar upon the earth's surface, occasion a cyclone in the lower strata of
 the outer atmosphere.     The inner atmosphere (that                    is,
                                                               the dense atmo

of whirlpool will result which will depress the central parts into the pen

                                                   as we shall presently see
we have reason to suspect, there are preexisting currents in the inner atmo
sphere setting in opposite directions along the zones of spots.
   73. If, then, we are right in attributing large proportion of the spots

cause which can determine the existence of such upward curreuts in two
bands parallel to the equator. It natural to look for this in some phe
                                               is
nomenon analogous to our trade-winds   and, as Sir John Herschel has

they cannot be    ;for as the outer atmosphere     an imperfectly conducting

whole sun, and their inner strata very slightly cooler      and at the equator,

                      is
and its outer strata cooler.   Hence at the poles, where the temperature of
the outer parts of the atmosphere         is   higher than the average, hey will diffuse
                                                                           t

 themselves upwards and overflow             ;  at the equator, where the temperature is
 less  than the average, they will subside and tend to escape laterally at the
bottom.          Moreover, the lower strata being subjected at the equator to more
pressure than the average, by reason of the coolness of the superincumbent
strata, and to less pressure at the poles, will also contribute to produce au
under-current in the outer atmosphere from the equator towards the poles.
Hence if it were not that the rotation of the sun modifies the result, we
should have a constant wind blowing steadily from the equator to the
poles over the surface of the photosphere, and a counter-current in the
upper regions of the atmosphere.
     74. The effect upon the inner atmosphere is directly the reverse.                    Heat
will escape from the photosphere very slightly more freely                       at the poles,
less freely at the equator, than the average.                 The upper strata of the inner
atmosphere will therefore be a little lighter at the equator, and will over
flow towards the poles, tending to produce a feeble surface-current in the
photosphere in the same direction as the wind which blows] above it from
the equator towards the poles.
     75. But the sun's surface is all the time being carried round by his ro
tation from east to west. This will impart a strong westerly direction to
 the descending current where it reaches the photosphere at the equator*,
 and will further render it where it spreads out over the photosphere towards
 the poles, a south-east wind in the northern hemisphere, and a north-east
 wind in the southern.            Thus these winds blow in such directions as to
 rotate more rapidly than the general body of the sun, and they therefore
  seek to raise themseves            above the photospheret.          At the equator the

     t The similar centrifugal tendency in the current which overflows from the earth's
  equator would no doubt keep it throughout its whole course outside the polar current,
  were it not that being charged with moisture and cooling as it advances, some of its strata
  soon become so loaded with clouds, that they, and the clouds amongst which they are
  entangled, come to have between them so much higher a specific gravity that their
  downward tendency due to this cause overcomes the outward tendency of their superior
  rotatory motion. In the case of the sun, on the other hand, the clouds and the ro
  tatory motion operate at first in the same direction upon the equatorial current, both
  tending to raise it ; but after some elevation has been attained, they there, as on the earth,
  act in opposite directions, the motion of rotation tending to depress the current as soon as
  it gets above a height which must be moderate, when compared with the vast extent of
  the sun's atmosphere.
     Furthermore,     the earth's polar current coming from regions of slower motion has a
  tendency    to descend, and when it gets down, a tendency to creep along the surface of
  the ground.      Both the currents accordingly seem to contribute to that descent of both
  which   takes  place in the earth's temperate zones.    But on the sun the ascent of both the
  currents over the zones of spots seems to be brought about by the tendency of the equa
  torial current to rise being more powerful than the tendency of the polar current to cling
  to the photosphere.

on either side of the equator.         In somewhat higher latitudes, the equa
torial  current  having    ascended,    and, as it were, split the polar current
into two sheets, has diverted one of them along the surface of the
photosphere.       In these regions, therefore, there is a constant wind
blowing over the photosphere from the north-west in the northern
hemisphere, and from the south-west in the southern.                 Accordingly, in
the  two   zones of spots   there  are  probably   variable winds   blowing    over the
photosphere, the polar and equatorial currents threading their way through
each   other, and both tending upwards, like the fingers of the two hands
interlaced into one another.         Meanwhile the equatorial current which had
risen into the middle of the atmosphere over the zone of spots exchanges,
in the northern hemisphere, its north-westerly direction, first for one due
north, and then for one towards the north-east, as it ascends still higher.

  But this temporary effect of its vertical motion will be lost, and it will
  again, when it ceases to ascend and advances only horizontally,                  direct its
 course to the north-west,            until, in higher latitudes, the swifter rotation
 which      its westward      direction imparts to it no longer offers any sen
sible impediment to its sinking in the atmosphere *.                      And here it will
be induced to do so by meeting in greater concentration the upper polar cur
rent, coming too from regions of slower rotatory motion, and therefore with
a tendency       to descend.       Here, then, will end the space throughout which
it has split the polar current into two sheets.                It descends to the surface
of the photosphere producing a zone of variable winds —in this case, how
ever, caused by polar and equatorial currents which are both descending,
and so unable to give rise to cyclones.                 Between this and the pole the
equatorial current seems to be next the photosphere, and blows somewhat
towards the pole, but chiefly from the east.                There will be ascending cur
rents about the poles ; but they will breath upwards so gently, and over so
great a space, that they are probably unequal to the task of heaving up
the upper stratum of clouds in the vigorous way that leads to cyclones.
Our conclusions may now be collected.                   The annexed diagram shows in
one view the directions of the various trade-winds that seem to blow over
the surface of the photosphere, and the prevailing character of the zones
that separate them.            The diagram is in the position in which the sun's
disk is usually seen in a telescope.
     76. We found that there is in the inner atmosphere a slight tendency to
produce surface-currents           from the equator towards the poles, owing to the
greater escape of heat at the poles.              But the influence of the winds in de
 termining currents in the photosphere over which they sweep is probably
 so    predominant, that both between and beyond the belts of spots they
 are able      to determine the currents in the photosphere, those of middle
 latitudes being accordingly currents towards the east, whilst the equatorial
 and polar currents set in the opposite direction.                   Such currents would
 evidently conspire with the winds that blow over them to produce agitations
 in the photosphere.           They would also contribute to that proper motion
 of the spots in longitude which has been observed.
      77. We appear to be compelled to resort to some external cause to account
 for the periodicity of the spots. Among causes known to exist, that which
 seems to offer itself with most plausibility for our acceptance is a swarm
 of meteorites like those which visit us in November three times in a cen
 tury, and those which visit us in other months every yeart.                     To account
 for the periodicity of the spots, we must suppose the meteorites to describe
 their orbit in 11-11 years, the period of mutations of the spots.                     Hence
    * Near the    equator a swifter rotation tends   to make a body fly outwards through the
 atmosphere     ; near the pole it tends to made the body retreat from the pole without much
 changing its level.
     t  [I find that Sir John Herschel in 1864 suggested such a swarm of meteorites ope
 rating in a different way, as a possible cause of this phenomenon.            (See Quarterly
  Journal of Science, 1864, vol. i. p. 233.)— July 1868.]

  the semiaxis major is 4- 98 times that of the earth's orbit.                   The perihelion
  distance must be very small (say, 0-01)to admit of the swarm's grazing the
  sun's atmosphere at each perihelion passage.                     This would assign 9'95 to
  the aphelion distance, a quantity from which it cannot much deviate. Now
  the mean distance of Saturn is 9-54              ;   so that we may safely conclude,      if the
  explanation which is now offered is the correct one, that the meteorites in
  question were diverted into the solar system, by either Jupiter or Saturn,
  at no enormously remote period              ; just     as the November       meteors seem to
  have been brought in by the attraction of the planet Uranus in a.d. 126.
  At each perihelion passage some of the outlying members of the stream
  become     entangled in the upper parts of the sun's atmosphere, dashing
  through it at a rate of about 414 kilometres per second*.                      The enormous
  friction they must undergo before they are brought to a state of relative
  rest will convert their immense vis viva into heat, which will be expended
 in raising the temperature of the upper strata of the part of the sun's at
  mosphere upon which they act. This part is of necessity more equatorial
 than polar, and is very much more equatorial than polar, except on the pe
 culiar supposition, which we have no reason to select, that the plane in
 which the meteors move is very nearly perpendicular to the plane of the
 sun's equator.         The heat imparted by the meteors to the sun's atmosphere
 therefore tends to diminish that defect of temperature in the upper parts
 at the equator which occasions the trade- winds of the sun.                      The influx of
 meteors, therefore, into the sun's atmosphere mitigates the violence of the
 trade-winds, and in this way enfeebles the cause of cyclones and of spots.
 Furthermore, except on the very improbable hypothesis that the axis-major
 of the orbit of the meteors lies exactly along the line of intersection of its
 plane with that of the sun's equator, the meteors must act more on one
 side of the equator than the other, and thus soften the trade-winds, and
 render the spots less frequent and extensive in one hemisphere than in
 the other.       So that the hypothesis of a stream of meteors has the follow
 ing points in its favour : — it is a vera causa ; it accounts for two wholly
 distinct phenomena, the periodicity of the spots and their prevalence in one
 hemisphere more than in the othert                  ; and it leads to such an aphelion dis-
    * The velocity of    the sun's equator  is about 2 kilometres per second.
    t [It also accounts   for the approach of the zones of spots to the equator during the periods
 of minimum spot-frequency ; inasmuch as when the current descending at the equator from
 great altitudes is enfeebled, the surface winds of middle latitudes, which have a tendency
to cling to the photosphere, owing to their having a less rotation, will encroach further upon
the equatorial current and will thus bring the junction between them, along which the spots
lie, nearer to the equator.
    If the decennial mutations of the spots be due to a current of meteors, this hypothesis
ought to offer some indication of the cause of fluctuations of longer period, such as that
of fifty-six years.   This is perhaps to be sought in the great perturbation which the
motion of the members of the stream must suffer from the attraction of Jupiter. This
planet must act upon them with intense effect, since the planet and the meteors have
nearly the same periodic time.— July 1868.]

tance  of the orbit of meteors as assigns to them       a position into which either
Jupiter or Saturn could have brought them.
   78.  If these  solar meteorites exist, they would seem to have had time to
extend themselves round the greater part of their orbit, and leave the vacant
space smaller at present than       that which is occupied, so as to render the
phenomenon depending          upon their absence, viz. the increase in the
number and size of spots, that which develops itself in the most marked
manner.      We may, then, perhaps presume that the epoch at which they
came into the solar system was long before the year 126, though, cosmi-
cally speaking, a recent occurrence.
   79. This appears the proper place to observe that the heat which is so
lavishly dispersed by the sun cannot be kept up, as has sometimes been
supposed, by the continual falling in of meteorites moving in orbits round
him ; since if that were so, the outer parts of the solar atmosphere would
be kept intensely heated, which is contradicted by all the phenomena.              In
the next part of this memoir, which will treat of other stars, I will offer
what appears to me a possible account of the proximate source of solar
heat.
                          Part II. Of other Stars.
                         Section  I. — Of Solitary Stars.
   80. Observations with the spectroscope having apprised us of the pre
sence in the sun and other stars of several of the elementary bodies with
which we are familiar on the earth, we are bound to assume provisionally
and until something offers to warrant a different belief, that those which
are abundant on the earth and in the sun are             abundant    elsewhere also.
Let us then consider how such differences as we must presume to exist be
tween star and star would affect a body like the sun.
   81. Star manifestly differs from star in mass ; they probably also differ
in temperature.     Let us therefore inquire how a great change in the sun's
mass or in his average temperature would operate.             Strange to say, an in
crease of his temperature would produce many of the same effects as a dimi
nution of his mass.      This is   because   the dilatation of the sun's bulk, and
the consequent removal of the outer parts of his atmosphere to a greater
distance from the centre would lessen the force of gravity upon them.              In
either case, therefore,   the  effect  upon    the atmosphere     would  be the same
as if the  gases constituting  it became    specifically  lighter.    They would all
be able to maintain their footing with feebler molecular motions.            In other
words, each gas would rise in the atmosphere until the distance between
its outer layer exposed by radiation to the intense cold of the sky, and the
inner layer heated by the photosphere, interposes a space of such thickness
as will, in obedience to the laws of conduction, reduce the temperature
on the outside to the lower minimum which the gas can now endure.
Accordingly, the spectral lines of a star, either hotter or     less massive than our

48                           Mr. G.       J. Stoney   on the   Physical                      [Recess,
sun, should be all of them more intense than the corresponding lines of the
sun's spectrum.    Moreover, many substances which by reason of the large
mass of their molecules are unable to stand in the sun the low temperature* of
the clouds of the photosphere,and are therefore confined to the regions within,
are able, on a star which attracts with less force orwhose centre is far removed,
to pass through this obstacle and show themselves in the atmosphere                              above.
Finally, such stars will be ruddy.   The sun himself is a somewhat  ruddy
star, as may be seen by a glance at Tables II. and           Both ends of III.
his spectrum are subdued by lines.    The yellow, orange, and scarlet are
nearly as bright as they came from the photosphere ; the green is sensibly
shaded over by lines ; the blue suffers somewhat more ; the indigo about
G and the crimson beyond B, very much ; and the violet from G to H to
such an extent, that it is difficult to find a spot where the full light of the
photosphere appears to penetrate.       The chemical rays beyond the violet
are progressively more and more enfeebled as their wave-lengths shorten ; so
much so, that the fluorescent spectrum from several artificial sources is longer,
and from some much longer, than the sun's.       A similar deficiency seems
to exist at the other end in that prolongation of the solar spectrum beyond
A, which Sir David Brewster has dimly seen and succeded in figuring.

   82. The consequences     of the two other alternatives, of      star's mass     a
being greater than the sun's, or of the temperature within the photosphere
being less fierce, so that these regions are of less bulk, will be plain now.
In such stars, some of the substances which range through the part of the
sun's atmosphere above the photosphere are imprisoned within that lumi
nous shell.   Others of them, such as iron, calcium, and those of    like                        a
vapour-density, can only hold their ground while at higher temperature,
                                                                      a

such as sodium, magnesium, the substance that causes the line     (if this                 B
ray be of solar origin), and above all, hydrogen, would perhaps still con
tinue dark.   The lines of hydrogen, from its incomparably small vapour-
density, would be so much the last to yield, that there  probably no star is
with gravity so intense as to produce any sensible impression upon them.
And accordingly, in all very white stars which have                    been examined, these
four lines stand out in extraordinay prominence.
     83.   It   is   now no longer
                               mystery why solitary stars are either white or
                                     a
of   red or yellow tinge.

sun, the   star will be equally white.    The class of more brilliantly white
 stars with an almost violet gleam, such as Sirius and a Lyrae, are those with
 masses too great in proportion to their temperatures for this adjustment.
 And, on the other hand, those whose masses fall short of what the fore
 going condition assigns, or, on the other side, whose temperatures are in
 excess, will, in proportion as they deviate from its fulfilment, have spectra
more and more closed in upon that part in which the spectra of two incan
descent bodies differ least in brightness when the luminous bodies are at
nearly, but not quite, the same temperature — that                is,

                                                 a
yellow, orange, scarlet, or crimson.    The minute crimson stars which are
met with here and there in the sky seem to be either very small stars, or
stars enormously distended by heat.        It very desirable that the proper

motion and parallax of these bodies should be inquired into when practi
cable, on the chance that some of them may be found to owe their colour
to being  very small, and therefore very close to us.
   84.   Ineed not say with what fidelity these many consequences         of                 a
change   in the force of gravity in passing from star to star reproduce them
selves in Mr. Huggins's observations.     But before making the comparison,
it   will be    well to consider rapidly what interfering        causes   may have to be
taken   into account.
   85. We have hitherto spoken of the effects of the intensity of gravity in
a  star upon substances giving the same lines as we see in the sun.      Our
results are therefore subject to modification wherever the system of lines                  is
itself changed.    If, for example, the elements which give rise to the more
prominent lines of the sun's spectrum are wanting in the stars, other lines,
which perhaps are not, like those of the sun, pretty evenly spread over the
whole spectrum, may take their place.    If this should happen, some co
lours will be more absorbed by them than others and this will tend to give
                                                            ;

be mixed     the effect of the cause just mentioned being blended with that

state of things, which would be improbable in solitary stars, may have been
brought about in the case of the companions of some double stars.           Or,
again,  elements  which in the sun are free may  in the stars be found  only in
a state of combination, and be either absent from the star's atmosphere or
give rise in    to an entirely new set of lines.

     * Or the whole of the free hydrogen may have been thrown off into rings. If the
 star's rotation were such as to cast off the upper layer of hydrogen at his equator, and   if
the hydrogen       could remain uncombined under these circumstances,     fresh hydrogen dif
fusing upwards or flowing in from the poles would constantly fill the void and each sup

fate  of hydrogen in a Orionis, (I Pegasi, and the other stars in which there
are   no  lines corresponding to the solar lines C and F.              If, however, the
lines that are in this way withdrawn be as few as the lines of hydrogen,
their absence will not sensibly affect the colour of the star.               And finally,
such conditions may prevail upon particular stars as will enable a spectrum
of the first order to present itself, — that kind of spectrum in which the
usual scattered lines of a spectrum of the second order are replaced by a
multitude of fine closely ruled lines arranged in groups of regularly shaded
bands, so as to give to the spectrum of the gas the appearance of a fluted
pillar.     The bands in the spectra of        a. Orionis,  /S Pegasi, and some others
probably arise in this way, and perhaps from some compound                 of hydrogen*.
The lines constituting such bands will be affected by differences of the force
of gravity in the same way as other lines, and will therefore, if distributed
with tolerable impartiality over the spectrum, cooperate with them in produ
cing that tendency towards a ruddy hue which belongs to stars that exercise
a feeble attraction at their surfaces.          It may be noted that in none of the
figures which Mr. Huggins has given of the spectra of solitary stars with
 shaded bands, do they seem crowded abnormally over the yellow,                   orange,
and red, but rather the reverse.
    86. We are now in a position to appreciate the significance of the pheno
 mena which the spectral examination of stars has brought to light. We can
 easily see why in the class of bluish-white stars of which Sirius and a Lyrae
 are types, stars at whose surfaces the force         of gravity  is greater than on our
 sun,  " the   dark lines they present in great number are all, with one excep
 tion, very thin and faint, and too feeble to modify the original whiteness of
 the light," and why "the one exception consists of four very strong single
lines, one line corresponding to Fraunhofer's              C, one to F, and another
 near G"t.        There can be little doubt that the multitude of faint lines will
 prove to be due almost exclusively to iron and the substances near it in
 vapour-density, such as calcium, chromium, manganese, nickel, and cobalt,
 with of course sodium and magnesium.                These, with the exception of so
 dium and magnesium, can produce only lines which are faint through the
 whole extent of the spectrum, since when attracted down with so much
 force as they are by the stars they cannot exist beyond regions of elevated
 temperature.        And substances a little higher in vapour- density will be un
 able to endure even the chill of the photosphere, and therefore shrink
 within it. The violet and indigo rays being in these stars not subdued by
 lines in the same way as they are in the sun, gives to the whiteness of the
 stars a somewhat coloured tinge in eyes, like ours, accustomed to adjudge
 the sun's light to be white.
    * If this surmise is well founded, the compound must be sought among the compounds
of hydrogen of low    vapour-density, such as marsh-gas (mass of molecules 8), ammonia 8-5,
 water 9, olefiant gas 14, methylamine 15-5, sulphuretted hydrogen 17, phosphuretted
 hydrogen 17, hydrochloric acid 18-25, &c.

   87. On the other hand, Aldebaran is a good sample of a star which exerts
less attraction   at his surface than the sun, but which in other respects
differs little from him.    All the gases which cause solar lines can rise in
the atmosphere of Aldebaran to colder heights than they can on the sun,
and, as a consequence, they encroach more upon the violet end of his spec
trum, and thus give to his light its rose-like tint. Another consequence                          is,
that substances present themselves in the star's outer atmosphere with
vapour-densities so high that the sun's superior attraction keeps them im

is  therefore also    star on which the force of gravity

first order, one of whose bands has been observed to fluctuate in distinct
ness.     We have reason to suspect, therefore, that the changes of bright
 ness of this star, which      slightly variable, arise from some cause which

  89. Hitherto we have considered only the case of stars uninfluenced by
one another.  If, however, two stars should be brought      their proper        by
motions very close, one of three things would happen.        Either they
would pass quite clear of one another, in which case they would recede to
the same immensity of distance asunder from which they had come         or                    ;
they would  become    so  entangled with  one  another as to emerge  from
the frightful conflagration which would ensue as one star or, thirdly,           ;
they would brush against one another, but not to the extent of preventing
the stars from getting clear again.        this last cause which we must now

not    thing of uniform density.
        a                                Since these forces are not parallel to
the tangents of the orbits, they will produce normal components, which

 effect of both forces will be at each revolution             to shorten the ellipses in
which the stars move, and at the same time to augment or reduce the peri
helion distance, according as the effect of the normal or tangential com
ponent of the resistance preponderates.               If   the normal force carry the
day,    the  stars  will at successive    passages gradually work themselves clear
of one another, a result which may be very much promoted by the beha
viour of the atmospheres.
    90. If what I here venture to offer as a surmise with respect to the prox
imate cause of stellar heat and the origin of double stars, is what really
took place, we must conclude the sky to be peopled with countless hosts of
dark bodies so numerous, that those which have met with such collisions
as to render them now visibly incandescent, must be in comparison few
indeed.      In the majority of those cases in which adequate collisions have
taken place, the two stars must have emerged from the catastrophe, moulded
into   one, dilated by the conflagration to an enormous size*, and rotating.
 Occasionally, however, the circumstances of the collision must have favoured
the disentanglement of the two stars from one another by a predominating
influence in these cases of the normal force acting in the way that has been
traced    in the last paragraph.       Wherever this happens, there is a prospect
that a double star may form. The heat into which much of the previous
vis viva of the two components has been converted will dilate both to an
immense size, and thus enable the two stars gradually in successive peri
helion passages to climb, as it were, to the great distance asunder, which
we   find in the   few cases in which the final perihelion        distance can be rudely
estimated, a length comparable with the intervals                 between the more re
mote planets and the sun.           While this is going on, the ellipticity of the
orbits is at each revolution decreasing ; but if the stars succeed in getting
nearly clear of one another's atmospheres before the whole ellipticity is
exhausted, the atmospheres will begin to shrink in the intervals between
two perihelion passages more than they expand when the atmospheres get
engaged, and will thus complete the separation of the two stars.                      When
once this has     taken  place,   a double star is permanently established.
    91. It is a striking confirmation of this view to find that the astonishing
phenomena witnessed last yeart in T Corona> were precisely what we should
expect to arise towards the end of the process which has been described.
The stars having been intensely heated by previous perihelion passages, and
having begun to shrink, would, at ordinary times, present a spectrum sub
dued by an abundance of very dark lines ; but immediately after one of the
   * If any dependence is to be placed upon the records of Sirius's having formerly been a
ruddy star, it would appear to argue that Sirius when he last met with a collision was heated
only in the outskirts of his enormous mass : that these parts were so dilated as to render
him a ruddy star, but that the store of heat laid up was so small that evenwithin the little
term of human history he has so cooled down as to have during it shrunk into an intensely
white star.
   t This was written in the spring of 1867.

last occasions upon which their atmospheres brush against one another,
the outer constituent of their atmospheres, and the outer constituent alone,
would be raised by the friction to brilliant incandescence, which would re
veal   itself by the temporary substitution of four intensely bright for four
 dark hydrogen lines in a spectrum which everywhere else continues to be
filled with dark lines.          And, moreover, these dark lines would for a while
 be rendered faint by the fierce heat radiated upon the outer parts of the
 atmosphere of each star by its companion*.                 It will be a matter of great
 interest to watch this star when sufficient time shall have elapsed to give a
hope of seeing it double.
     92. When a body of moderate dimensions enters the atmosphere of a
 great star, the resistance to which it is subjected will be very nearly the
 same per square metre over the whole of its front surface ; but if it be of
 sufficient size to occupy a considerable height of the atmosphere through
 which it passes, it will be exposed to much more resistance beneath than
 above ; and those conditions will have arisen which may terminate in a
 double star.        The cases must      be rare  in which two stars that clash together
 happen to be       of nearly equal      mass.      But when this does occur, the cir
 cumstances which           are   the most favourable to the formation of a.double
 star have taken place.           This seems to account for the very remarkable pro
 portion of double stars which have nearly equal constituents.                       It would
 appear,    too,   that  in  this  class  we  should   expect   to  find those   instances   in
 which the perihelion distance is greatest, since it will be nearly the sum                  of
 the radii of the distended atmospheres of the two stars.
     93.   If two    stars which are undergoing the process of formation into a
  double star, be of very unequal mass, the smaller one will be stripped at
  each perihelion passage         of some   of its atmosphere.      All those parts which
  by the friction are brought into a state of rest relatively to the parts of the
  atmosphere of the larger star with which they come in contact, will, after
  the stars have been separated, settle down upon the larger star.                 They will,
  before the next perihelion passage, be replaced upon the smaller star by a
  fresh supply of the same gases diffusing upwards from beneath, and almost
  to the same height. When the stars come together again, this, in its turn,
  will  be stripped off ; and by a sufficient repetition of the process at succes
  sive perihelion passages several of the lighter constituents of the atmo
  sphere of the smaller star will be transferred over to the larger.                     Upon
  the larger star this will not have any visible effect ; the acquisition will

  either quite, or nearly into, a circular orbit, so as for the present to subject the outer
  layer of hydrogen to such a friction as keeps it constantly alight. If so, and if the stars
  are of materially unequal size, this must terminate, either by the atmosphere of the large
  star shrinking away from the companion, or by the companion's settling gradually down
  by a spiral motion through the atmosphere of its primary. If the latter be what is to
  occur, we shall have a splendid conflagration, the star first becoming intensely white, and
  afterwards deep red.

 not even swell his bulk perceptibly *.               But upon his satellite the conse
 quences will be very remarkable.             Hydrogen was the first gas to go ; then,
 in order, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron.                          If
 the process has gone far enough to distil away all of these gases in the
 free state, the spectrum of the companion has been robbed of the principal
 lines found in solitary stars, to be replaced by an entirely new system ema
 nating from substances of higher vapour-density, which, to judge from the
 spectra of the few coloured double stars that Mr. Uuggins has succeeded
 in examining, are crowded abnormally over the scarlet, orange, yellow, and
 part of the green, giving to the companions of double stars those blue, violet,
 or greenish tints which are met with nowhere else. If the process be con
 tinued still further, more gases will be swept away, and the photosphere
 laid nearly bare ; as a consequence, the smaller star will appear white and
 nearly destitute of lines. This may have furnished that numerous class of
 double stars of which the companions are small and white.
      94. No double star can come forth unless unequal pressure has acted so
 effectually on the smaller constituent as to communicate to it a swift
 motion of rotation.         It is likely that cases may occur where the forces that
 accomplish      this  act with    such inordinate strength that the cohesion of the
 smaller star is unable to withstand             them,    and there result two or more
 fragments spinning violently, and destined thenceforward to traverse slightly
 separate paths.        This seems a not improbable account of such a multiple
 system as y Andromedae.
     95. Upon the primary            the consequences of the same violence would
 probably be entirely different.            They would compel him to rotate at a
 great speed, perhaps        so  rapidly  as  to fling off his own equatorial partsf-
 These would form rings about him of the elliptic section which was inves
 tigated by Laplace ; at least, they would assume this form if they consisted
 only of gas, or of gas with cloud dispersed through it which is constantly
 dissolving and reforming, so as to keep always in a state of minute division,
 — so   long, in fact, as the gaseous pressure caused by any accidental conden-
   * A moment's consideration will make this plain. In fact, if the quantities of all    the
 gases in the earth's atmosphere were doubled, it would add only 3J miles, or, more      ex
 actly, 5534 metres to its height. The result, after all disturbance had quieted down,
 would be the same as if a denser stratum of air of this trifling thickness were slipped in
 between the present atmosphere        and the ground.      To spectators from without, who
 would judge of our atmosphere chiefly as one which reaches upwards to a distance of
 about 200 kilometres (the height at which meteors begin to glow), the effect would be
 wholly insensible.
    t  This would be most likely to occur when the friction had acted chiefly on the super
ficial parts of the larger star, since under these circumstances a star might be enormously
dilated without any considerable increase of its moment of gyration ; so that, ceeteris
paribus, such a star would rotate swifter than one whose bulk was due to the equal expan
sion of all parts.
   Sirius may have been an instance of such a star (see footnote, p. 53). We have
perhaps some reason, judging from the existing areolar momentum of the parts of the
solar system, to suspect that it was in a considerable degree the case of our sun also.

sation in one part of the ring tends to disperse the gas which had accumu-
mulated there and so restore the balance, with better effect than the slightly
superior attraction of the condensed knot can disturb it.    The gases first
cast off will soon be replaced on the star by a fresh supply of the same
kinds diffusing upwards from below, to be in turn flirted off into the rings,
if the      star have retained sufficient rotation.                                It   would seem, then, that the
rings must of necessity consist of exceedingly light materials. These rings
will obviously move nearly in the same plane as the companion, or frag

sufficiently hot, the ocean must have then formed an atmosphere of steam so vast, that it
may perhaps have even reached to a ring which afterwards became the moon.
    Possibly the giants of our system (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) owe their
small density to their great mass, by reason of which they retain enough         of their pristine
heat   to be still clothed in immense aqueous atmospheres.

lines exist,     they are due to constituents of the solar atmosphere which are eminently
transparent      to these rays, either from being intrinsically so, or from the excessive tenuity
of the gas. Hence the gas adds in these rays, but only adds a little, to whatever bright
 ness may be transmitted through it from beyond.               It behaves like a faintish flame of
 very high temperature placed between the eye and a more conspicuous but less hot coal.
 Hence, if the background be the spectrum of the umbra of a spot, the bright line should
 be a faint streak     across it.   On the only occasion on which I had an opportunity of ex
 amining      the spectrum of a spot,      one of the rays I suspect to be bright lines presented
 this appearance to my eye.
     Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Huggins have observed that some dark lines appear broader in
 the spectrum      of a spot than in the spectrum of ordinary solar light. This is no doubt
 because the wings of these lines lose brightness which had before shone through them
 from beyond, and the duskier parts of them in consequence become dark enough to add
 to the breadth      of the central black stripe. Wings appear to be always (except in the
  anomalous case of the iron line 49-61,         which demands a careful experimental scrutiny)
 fainter than the central band.        This may arise in either of two ways, either, 1°, because
 the gas is so rare, or else the perturbations which occasion the wings so evanescent, that
 the wings are     in a considerable degree transparent, and much light from the photosphere
  streams    through them ; or 2°, because though opaque they come from a region hot
  enough to render them less dark than the central stripe.         It is in the case of wings of
  the former kind only that the appearance recorded by Messrs. Lockyer and Huggins will
  present itself.     Lines of which the wings are quite opaque ought, on the other hand, to
  appear narrowest when seen in the spectrum          of the umbra of a spot, since the brighter
   parts  of the wings would be then undistinguishable from the faint background, which
  would therefore seem to encroach upon them.         — September   1868.]

                                                                Bangalore, June 17, 1868.
     My dear Sir, — As it          is now three weeks since        I  have been able to
  make any use       of the Royal Society's    telescope   &c.,  owing to the setting in
  of the rainy season, and as circumstances oblige me shortly to move my
  quarters and start the instruments for the eclipse, it seems better to send all
 the observations       I succeeded   in getting since   I last wrote up to the time      of
  the change of weather.
     I am sorry this second list is not a fuller one.         But the fact is, that now
 that the planetary nebulae list is exhausted, and the more conspicuous
 nebulai,    I  find no small difficulty in seeing anything.         It is true that the
 globular clusters alone form a long list for examination, a considerable
 number of which may be visible with the spectroscope ; but as they seem
 to show continuous spectra without exception, the interest attaching
 to this class is considerably diminished.
     I have still a long list of nebulae proper to examine ; but the proportion
 of these which exhibit monochromatic spectra seems very small — so small,
 indeed, that      I cannot report a single new instance in this class.        There are
 some conspicuous ones which will present themselves later in the year,
 among which one or two may possibly be recognizable as gaseous ; but the
majority,      I  may say the large majority, seem otherwise, and therefore diffi
 cult of positive identification.
    It  will   be necessary to despatch the instruments along with my camp
 equipage     &c.   in a fortnight or three weeks, as the spot selected for a sta
tion of observation is upwards of 300 miles distant from Bangalore.                        I
cannot expect that the return journey will have been effected before the
middle or end of September.             For the next three months, therefore, the
nebulae must be allowed to pass unchallenged.                           I
                                                            Whether shall have the
opportunity        of continuing my search then, or not, must depend on circum
stances   which      I cannot now foresee. Should the Society see fit to allow
the instrument to remain in my hands for a few months longer, I will at
least undertake to prosecute the search during such intervals of leisure as
my other duties may leave at my disposal.               But at present, perhaps, the
question of the disposal of the instrument after the eclipse is not an urgent
one.
    The station selected for the eclipse observations is Jamkandi (vulg. Jum-
khundee), about midway between Belgaum and Sholapore.                      The selection
has been determined chiefly by the small rainfall of that district, and by

pointed. There is certainly a better chance there than at any point on the
east coast.                                             Yours truly,

   The evidence in the case of these is purely negative. They have been
brought on the slit with sufficient precision to make it in each case almost
a certainty, taking into consideration their apparent brightness, that had
their light been monochromatic in the sense in which other similar nebulae
are so,it must have been recognized as such ; whereas, if dispersed, ana
logy  would forbid any expectation of detecting the feeble continuous spec
trum.   In each case I have satisfied myself that the inference was a iegi-
mate one before recording             it,
                                both by testing the focal adjustment on                         a
neighbouring star and        by
                           repeating (if necessary) the adjustment in respect
of direction, until the case appeared hopeless one.  a
   Some instances, in which the presumption was not so strong as to seem
to justify the inference, are omitted from this list.
    Several nebulae, the measurements                    of whose spectra were given in my
previous list, were reexamined.             I        am rather   inclined to believe that the
position of the principal lightnot quite constant for all.
                                            is              The newer
and more careful measurements certainly throw doubts upon some of the
earlier ones. Nevertheless have reason to believe that the discordances
                                    I
are not wholly due to inaccurate determination.       But on this and other
points   hope to be able to write more fully on

        Communicated by Prof. Stokes.   Received August 8, 1868.
     I have had two or three opportunities of seeing this spectrum to advantage
 of late. The storms at the period of the setting in of the south-west monsoon
here are very frequent, and supply for a time almost incessant flashes, many
                                                                  I
of which are of course very brilliant. The first time examined the light in
the spectroscope I had no idea of measuring, but was content to realize the
principal facts of a continuous spectrum crossed by bright lines  ; but sub
sequently     I
           made  several attempts (with  some  success) to obtain  measures.
That I was unable to do more in this line is due partly to the difficulty of
utilizing the short-lived appearance, partly to that fascination of waiting for
" one more " bright flash to verify the intersection, which can only be
thoroughly appreciated by the aid of a similar experience.
   The principal features of the spectrum are a more or less bright conti
nuous spectrum crossed by numerous bright lines, so numerous indeed as
to perplex one as to their identity.     This perplexity is increased by the
constantly changing appearance due to a variable illuminating power. This
variable character of the appearances is unquestionably the peculiar feature
of the spectrum. It is not that the whole spectrum varies in brightness in
the same degree, but that the relative intensities are variable, not only
among the various lines, but between these and the continuous spectrum.
The latter is sometimes very brilliant ; and when that is the case, the red
portion is very striking, though in general the spectrum seems to end ab.
ruptly at D+0-34 (E=D+l-38, KirchhofFs 120 7 = D + 0 55).
   There is one principal line which I found equal to D + 2'20 as the result
of five independent measures. The probable error of this value is about
 +-02. The general mean of all my measures of the principal nebular
line (obtained from twelve different nebulae) is 2-18, with a probable error
of about + -02. I have therefore very little doubt that these are the same,
viz. the nitrogen line identified in the case of nebulae by Mr. Huggins.
This line in the lightning spectrum            and sharply defined, and is
                                                 is narrow
conspicuously the brightest, except as noted below.
  The next in prominence is situated about D + 3 5 8 (F=D + 2-73, Kireh
hofFs 232-5 = D + 3-50).               It   is broader and less vivid, and not so well
defined at the edges.
    There are several other conspicuous lines, but none comparable to the
first. I noticed a sharp line in the red, but did not get a measure.
   I said that at D + 0-34 the continuous spectrum ends abruptly. A faint
continuation      however, seen frequently in bright flashes, very bright ones
                  is,
bringing out brilliant red end crossed by bright line.

brighter as to give the character in question.    What strikes one most,
however, is the varying relative brightness of the continuous and linear
spectra ; sometimes the lines are scarcely seen, and sometimes very little
else is seen. This may be nothing more than an illusion ; but in the ab
sence     of any certainty that it is      so, the impression left on the                mind is worth
recording.
   The difficulty of discriminating between the many less prominent lines
is immensely increased by the momentary character of the phenomenon.
Before the mind has selected an individual, the feeble impression on the
retina     has vanished     ;   and before another flash succeeds,                       the memory of
the half-formed       choice has vanished with           it,   and there          is   nothing on which
to found      a   selection.     Otherwise      it   would     be easy           enough to     measure
many more lines.

          I
the products of its destructive distillation in copper retort. These were

a quantity was obtained to enable me properly to examine it.
     As  wished to procure these products in larger quantities, instead of
          I
 employing small copper retorts, which were rapidly destroyed,    conducted               I
 the operation in tolerably large cast-iron ones heated in gas-furnace, and        a
found that they were not sensibly corroded even after   great number of           a
distillations. The quantity of sodium-salt decomposed in each distillation
was about 200 grammes.
     The oily products obtained by this process, after separation from the
 supernatant watery layer, were introduced into                         a      copper retort having a
 bent glass tube luted into the neck and redistilled,                          the retort being heated
 to redness towards the close of the operation. In this way considerable                 a
 amount of impurity was removed.       The bright yellow-coloured oil was
 then rectified in     a                       It

dilute sulphuric acid on sulphobenzolic chloride, C8 H, CI S 02, and calls
benzyl-mercaptan, C8H^S.            He says it boils at "about 165°C., and has

    From the description given by Vogt and Otto, it is evident that the
phenyl-mercaptan obtained by the destructive distillation of sulphobenzo-
late of sodium in an iron retort is identical with theirs, and that the offen

arising from the phosphoric chloride employed in the preparation of the

     Phenyl-mercaptide of lead. — On adding acetate of lead to an alcoholic
solution of the mercaptan, a bright yellow crystalline precipitate was formed.
This when heated fused, and at a higher temperature was decomposed.
     Phenyl-mercaptide of copper was prepared in a similar manner, substi
tuting   acetate   of copper for    acetate   of lead .  On exposure     to the air in a
moist state    it  became    oxidized,  forming cupric oxide and bisulphide of

spirit.

    When dry phenyl-mercaptide of lead is heated to a temperature superior
to 280° C. it is decomposed, an oil distils over, and plumbic sulphide is
left in the retort.     This oil boils constantly at 292° 5 C, and corresponds
in all its properties with phenylic sulphide.         By oxidation it yielded a sub
stance crystallizing in oblique prisms, and        which  was proved to be sulpho-
benzolene.      The action of heat on the lead mercaptide is therefore as
follows   : —

    When the pure mercaptan was mixed with about an equal bulk of con
 centrated sulphuric acid, the latter acquired a dirty purple colour, and
 after the lapse of some time, with occasional agitation, became hot and
 gave off sulphurous anhydride.          When cold the upper layer solidified to a
 mass of crystals, which, on being separated from the acid, washed with
 water, and crystallized several times from spirit, gave a white crystalline
 substance.      It was dried in vacuo and analyzed.

    The analysis corresponds to the formula C0 H5 S, bisulphide of phenyl.
 It  is insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, very soluble in ether, benzol,
  and bisulphide of carbon, melts at 61° C. (Vogt* gives 60° C. as the melt
 ing-point of his bisulphide of benzyl).        It is again reduced to the mercap
 tan by zinc and dilute sulphuric acid, or better, by digestion with hydriodic
 acid and amorphous phosphorus.
     As but   traces  of phenyl-mercaptan were obtained on decomposing the
 sulphobenzolate of sodium in a copper retort, while a considerable por
 tion of the distillate consisted of the mercaptan when an iron one was used,
  I was induced to make some experinents in order to see whether it was the
 copper which caused this difference.          This I ascertained to be the case by
 distilling sulphobenzolate of sodium mixed with copper cuttings in an iron
 retort, when the proportion of the mercaptan to the sulphide was compara
 tively small, and the surface of the copper was converted into cupric sul
 phide.      Granulated zinc produced a similar result.

cohol (about 400 parts), but more so in hot. It is far more soluble in
benzol and bisulphide of carbon, from the latter of which it may be ob
tained in fine crystals, sometimes half an inch or more in length.            It melts
at 159° C. and solidifies at 153°C. It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric
 acid, forming a solution of a magnificent purple colour, and which when
largely diluted with the concentrated acid appears purplish red.               On the
addition of water the colour disappears, and a crystalline precipitate is
produced, apparently the unaltered phenylene sulphide.                  With concen
trated nitric acid a reaction takes place, red fumes are evolved, and a crys

 69-70 per cent, bromine.         This substance is therefore analogous to the
 corresponding ethylene compound discovered by Carus*.
    The sulphobromide       crystallizes in black prisms, which slowly give off
 bromine on exposure to dry air, and are rapidly decomposed by moisture
 with evolution of hydrobromic acid. They, are tolerably soluble in car

 purple, and ultimately dissolved, giving off traces of sulphurous acid.               The
 compound thus produced, when cold, was semifluid, and gradually absorbed
 moisture from the air, becoming a semisolid crystalline paste. This was

         mann,   Ph.D., M.D., LL.D.           Received September 11, 1868.
    In   a former Note     submitted to the Royal Society some months ago*, I
have sketched      a series  of compounds isomeric with the well-known sulpho
cyanic ethers ; today I shall endeavour to delineate more in detail the
bodies the existence of which I then pointed out.
    In   order to prepare these substances, which, from their analogy with
the     essential oil of mustard-seed,      I   have designated by the name of
mustard-oils, the monamines were in the first place treated with bisul
phide of carbon ; the alcohol-sulphocarbonates of the monamines thus
formed were then submitted to the action of heat and converted, by the
loss of 1 molecule of sulphuretted hydrogen, into sulphuretted ureas, which
were finally deprived of 1 molecule of monamine by means of anhydrous
phosphoric acid. Circuitous as this process may appear, it has the merit
 of being a general one, furnishing, in fact, the mustard-oils both of the
fatty and aromatic series.        When working with fatty substances, however,
 the method may be very considerably curtailed.               Let it be ethylic mustard-
oil that is   to be prepared.
                                                   I
    Even on the threshhold of my inquiry had hoped to see ethyl-sulpho-
 carbamic acid split up into sulphuretted hydrogen and ethylic mustard-oil ;
 experiment, however, proved that the metamorphosis assumes another
 form, the acid yielding as products of decomposition its two components,

however, this precipitate blackens, even at the common temperature, more
rapidly on heating, with formation of sulphide of silver. Simultaneously
the odour of ethylic mustard-oil becomes perceptible ; and if the liquid
be heated to ebullition, this oil distils in large quantity with the vapour of
water.    The disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is observed at
the same time, belongs to a secondary reaction, the unstable hydrosulphide
of silver (which is formed in the first instance) splitting up into sulphide of
silver and sulphuretted  hydrogen.
    In this experiment no excess of silver should be used. Ethyl mustard-
oil, more especially upon protracted ebullition, exchanges its sulphur for
oxygen, thus giving rise to the formation of cyanate of ethyl, easily re
cognizable by its fearful odour.    Ultimately this ether is entirely decom
posed into carbonic acid and ethylamine ; after some time the solution
contains nothing but nitrate of ethylamine.
  Mostof the metallic ethyl-sulphocarbamates, more especially the copper and
mercury salts, behave exactly like the silver compound.                I
                                                           have almost inva
riably employed  mercuric  chloride for preparing ethyl-mustard-oil.  In this
case the hydrochlorate     of ethylamine which is produced unites with the
excess  of corrosive sublimate to form an insoluble compound. Accordingly
the ethylamine, which in this reaction is separated as salt, exists partly in
solution, partly in the precipitate ; it is easily recovered by treating with
caustic soda the residue which is left after the mustard- oil has been ob
tained by distillation.    When working with pure ethylamine, one half of
the base may thus be regenerated for a new operation.
   But it would be useless to employ pure ethylamine for this purpose.
The crude mixture of bases, which is obtained by allowing alcoholic am
monia to stand for some time with iodide of ethyl and distilling the iodides
thus formed with an alkali, is very well adapted for this operation.    This
mixture, as is well known, contains, together with ammonia, the primary,
secondary, and tertiary monamines of the ethyl-series.
     I
     have satisfied myself, in the first place, that diethylamine is just as
easily converted into ethylic mustard-oil as ethylamine.    The experiment
was made with absolutely pure diethylamine prepared by means of diethyl-
oxamic ether.         Bisulphide of carbon, more especially in alcoholic          solution,
acts with great energy upon diethylamine, diethyl-sulphocarbamate     of di
ethylamine being formed, which,  when  treated by a metallic salt, furnishes
a metallic  diethyl-sulphocarbamate   together with a salt of diethylamine.
On ebullition, the former is converted into ethylic mustard-oil ; but instead
of the metallic hydrosulphide generated in the analogous metamorphosis
of ethylamine, in this             case a mercaptide is formed.

 I       should not leave unmentioned, however, that the formation              of mercap
 tide    is   still to be further proved by direct experiment.             On working with

 mercuric     chloride,   the precipitate which remains nfter the ethylic mus
 tard-oil is separated by distillation, neither dissolves in boiling water nor
 in boiling alcohol.       If this precipitate were pure mercaptide of mercury,
it should     be crystallizable    from boiling alcohol.         Probably it is a double
compound        of mercaptide and chloride ; at all events, I have established
by experiment that mercaptide and chloride of mercury unite to form a
compound perfectly insoluble both in water and alcohol, even on boiling.
    Triethylamine also unites with bisulphide of carbon ; but this com
pound, as might have been expected, yields no longer any mustard-oil.
    Ultimately, as regards the ammonia, which invariably occurs in the crude
mixture of the ethyl-bases, its presence rather increases than diminishes the
quantity of mustard-oil which is formed.                 This ammonia remains in the
residue in the form of a salt, together with salts of ethylamine, diethyl-
amine, and triethylamine ; and a corresponding quantity of the primary and
secondary ethyl-bases is converted into mustard-oil, the yield of which
may thus be very considerably augmented.
   The mercuric salts also attack ethylic mustard-oil,                although much less
easily   and   rapidly  than nitrate   of silver.   A   large  excess  of chloride of mer
cury, however, should be avoided. If the ethylamine be prepared from iodide
of ethyl, it is convenient to employ the mercury salt and the mixture of bases
in such proportions that         1  molecule of mercuric chloride reacts upon the
bases generated by means         of  2 molecules of iodide of ethyl.
   In an experiment carried out upon rather                 a large scale     a quantity     of
ethylic mustard-oil was obtained amounting to from 60 to 70 per cent, of
the theoretical proportion which might have been expected from the
weight of iodide of ethyl employed.

   As to the physical properties of ethylic mustard-oil,                 I have not to add
anything to what I have formerly stated, except a determination of the
gas-volume weight, which was taken in the vacuum of the barometer at the
temperature of 185° (in the vapour            of boiling aniline).

of the methyl-group            in   toluol,    our views respecting the difference of con
stitution of the two isomeric monamines have acquired     solid foundation.         a
In toluidine the substitution of the primary ammonia fragment (H2 N)
for hydrogen has taken place within the benzol nucleus;          in benzyl
amine, on the other hand, the substitution occurs in the methyl-group en
grafted upon the benzol nucleus.    Benzylamine thus belongs, in measure,                   a

is   present   in the fatty portion of the compound.                           Under     these   circum
stances   it appeared rather probable that the base isomeric with toluidine
would     yield its mustard-oil by conversion into the bisulphide-of-carbon
compound  and distillation of the latter with perchloride of mercury. Ex
periment has verified this anticipation.
  Benzylamine dissolves in bisulphide of carbon with evolution of heat,                               a
beautiful       crystalline compound being formed, which, when distilled

perties of which I have lately described to the Royal Society *, yields like
wise a mustard-oil, if it be successively treated with bisulphide of carbon
and mercuric chloride.        I have not, however, more minutely examined this
compound.
   All the mustard-oils here mentioned exhibit, more especially with refer
ence to ammonia and its derivatives, the same reactive power which belongs
to ethylic mustard-oil,    more minutely described in my former communica
tion, and by which the mustard-oil par excellence, the well-known allyl-
compound, has long fixed the interest of chemists.                Of the legion of urea
like bodies which    are here possible,     I  have prepared but few.         It may be
stated that the sulphuretted methylic and amylic ureas, and also the sulphu
retted methylamylic and amyltolylic ureas vie with each other as to beauty
and facility of crystallization.    I have not, however, examined more minutely
these ammonia compounds, their study promising but very little scientific
gain. On the other hand, I have investigated with some care the metamor
phoses of the mustard-oils, since their comparison with the corresponding
transformations of the sulphocyanic ethers promised to elucidate the dif
ferent construction of the two groups of bodies.
   The results of these inquiries unequivocally confirm the view suggested
by the formation of the two classes of compounds.               It is indeed only neces
sary to trace their origin in order to understand the nature of this difference.
We could not select better illustrations than the isomeric terms of the
methyl-series.     Both bodies, methylic mustard-oil and sulphocyanide of
methyl, are in the last instance derived from exactly the same compound?,
viz. methylic alcohol, bisulphide of carbon, and ammonia.                 Let the mole
cules of these three compounds unite with separation of 1 molecule of water
and 1 molecule of sulphuretted hydrogen, and a body will be formed pos
sessing the composition of both methylic mustard-oil              and sulphocyanide    of
methyl.

   Accordingly the nature of the body produced must depend upon                      the
conditions (it might be almost said upon the order) in which the molecules
of water and sulphuretted hydrogen are separated from the aggregate of
atoms.
   Conceived in its simplest form, the first step of the generation of methylic
mustard-oil consists in the action of ammonia upon methylic alcohol, when
methylamine is produced with separation of water.

    The reactions occur in the inverse order when sulphocyanide of methyl is
produced.       Here the process commences with the reaction between bisul
phide of carbon and ammonia, hydrosulphocyanic acid being formed with
separation of sulphuretted hydrogen.

    This inverse order, in which the reactions       succeed   each other, gives a de
finite direction to our speculations as to the arrangement of the atoms
within the molecules of the two compounds.                 If bisulphide of carbon,
S C 8, in contact with methylamine, H, C N H2, is found to disengage
sulphuretted hydrogen, we cannot doubt that the carbon-atom of the bisul
phide, meeting, as it were, with its two freed attraction-units those liberated
in the nitrogen atom, associates with this nitrogen-atom, and consequently
that it must be by the nitrogen that the carbon of the methyl-group is
 chained to the carbon of the bisulphide.          On the other hand, if in hydro
sulphocyanic     acid we may conceive the hydrogen to be in union with the sul
phur,     we are, after this hydrogen has been converted into water by the         hy-
droxyl of methylic alcohol, also justified in considering the sulphur-atom as
 the link of connexion between the two carbon-atoms of the compound, the
 attraction-unit, which has become available in the carbon-atom, being satu
 rated by the free atomic power of the sulphur.             The relative position of
 the atoms in the molecules of the two compounds would thus be indicated

V. "Account of Spectroscopic Observations of the Eclipse of the
       Sun, August 18, 1868, iu a letter addressed to the President
       of the Royal Society.          By Captain C. T. Haig, R.E. Com
       municated by the President.         Received September 21, 1868.
                                                        Poona, 24th August, 1868.
   My dear Sir, — I     hasten   to send you an account of the observations       I
have fortunately been able to make at Beejapoor of the total eclipse on the
 18th instant with one of the hand-spectroscopes sent out by the Royal So
ciety in the care of Lieut. Herschel, R.E., not waiting to let my report be
forwarded by Colonel Walker, R.E., my departmental superior, on account
of the delay which would necessarily be caused thereby.
   I may state at once that    I  observed the spectra of two red flames close
to each other, and in their spectra two broad bright bands quite sharply
defined, one rose-madder and the other light golden.          These spectra were
soon  lost in the spectrum   of the  moon's   edge just  before emergence, which
had also two well-defined bright bands (one green and one indigo) about a
quarter the width of the bands in the spectra of the flames, this spectrum
being again soon lost in the bright sunlight.
   I will now proceed to give a somewhat detailed account of the observa
tions, in which Captain Tanner, Bombay Staff Corps and of the Miliar
Survey (who, on my earnest solicitation, accompanied me), and Mr. Kero
Laxuman, Professor of Mathematics in the Deccan College, took part, and
during which Mr. Hunter, Bombay Civil Service, and Dr. Kielhorn, Pro
fessor of Sanskrit in the Deccan College, were present as non-professional
observers.
   Our instrumental equipment consisted as follows : — Mr. Kero Laxuman
brought an ordinary pedestal-telescope of 2|-inch aperture and 36 inches
focal length by Home and Thornthwaite, which he temporarily mounted on a
stand equatorially ; and he had a scale fitted inside a 60-power eyepiece,
which, however, he was unfortunately not able to use, on account of a fall
which his instrument sustained from being blown down by the high wind ;
he therefore had to use another eyepiece of power 70, not furnished with
a scale.   He also had a pocket chronometer beating five times to two seconds,
by Arnold and Dent.
   Captain Tanner had an Everest theodolite by Troughton and Simms,
having a remarkably good telescope,      l|-inch aperture and      18 inches  focal
length, and an eyepiece of power 46.
   I had one of the Royal Society's small hand-spectroscopes, and a small
6-inch transit theodolite by Troughton and Simms, the cap of the object-
glass of which    I had cut so as to receive the prism-cap of the spectro
scope,   and had fitted one to the other, so that       I could at once shift the
prism-cap from its own telescope to that of the theodolite, and vice versd.

1868.]                          of the Solar Eclipse.                              75
I had   also a black frame about 2 feet long by 1 foot high with a slit in the
centre, the width of which was regulated by turning a black excentric
cylinder.     This I had previously used in observing the lines in the solar
and other common         spectra, and I placed it 10       feet from the theodolite
 (the shortest distance the telescope could focus) ;        and close at the back of
it I placed a heliotrope held by a Survey Signaller,       intending, if opportunity
 offered, to examine the lines in the spectrum of          the corona.    In the dia
 phragm of the theodolite-telescope I had a system of wires (shown by dia
 gram below), which I had intended for assistance in general observations of
 the flames, in case   I  should find that    I  could make no satisfactory spec
 trum-observations,   which,    from the absence
 of any slit arrangement in the spectroscope,
 I   was rather inclined to anticipate.        The
 wires A A, B B were vertical, C C, D D,
 E E horizontal, F F the direction of the
 moon's path at the middle of the eclipse,
 and G G perpendicular to F F. This system
 gave so many fixed distances and points'
 that   I  thought it would be useful both in
 estimating the position and the height of
 the flames.      However, its utility was not
 put to the test ; for the little time      I   had
 was given to the spectroscope.        I also had
  an eight-day mean-time chronometer beating half-seconds, by Baker.
     The sky in the early morning of the 18th was very cloudy, so that our
 hopes of success were very low ; but as it afterwards brightened up for a
  while rather suddenly, we were somewhat encouraged to hope for a similar
  brightening during part of the eclipse. Soon, however, at about 7 o'clock,
  it darkened again, and remained so till after the total phase was over, oc
  casional openings in the nimbi giving us glimpses of the sun through the
  cirrocumuli which were floating very high up. At 7 o'clock we had reached
  our station of observation, which was on a large solid tower called the
  Upari Burj, 67 feet high and about 60 feet diameter (on the top were two
  guns, one of which was 31 feet long) — one of the many ruins of the city,
  and a most favourable position from which to observe the phenomena of
  the eclipse and the general aspect of the surrounding country. On account
  of the prevailing very high wind,     we planted our instruments on and near
  the top of the external stone staircase so as just to be protected by the tower
  from the wind. Mr. Kero Laxuman at first set up his telescope on the
  top of the tower; but it was blown down, as         I have previously mentioned.
  This accident much interfered with the carrying out of our preconcerted
 plan of observation, which was as follows.
     Mr. Kero Laxuman and Captain Tanner were to take the times of first
 and last contact, the latter by observing the actual occurrences, the former

 76                 Capt. Haig's Spectroscopic      Observations         [Recess,
 by measuring several lengths of the common chord soon after first and
before last contact, with the aid of the scale in his 60-power eyepiece and
noting the times.        Captain Tanner (an expert delineator) was, during
totality, to take command of Mr. Kero Laxuman's telescope, measuring
 the heights of the flames at times which would be recorded by Mr. Kero
Laxuman, whose whole attention during totality was to be given to record
ing the times of occurrence of any phenomena that he, or either of us,
might observe. Captain Tanner was also to make rapid sketches of all
he saw, and      I was to confine myself to spectrum-observations.
    Unfortunately, contact was not observed until about fifty seconds after the
commencement, when Captain Tanner at once made a sketch of the obscu
 ration, Mr. Kero Laxuman recording the time.             The sketch made the
 common chord       equal to 3' at 7h 51m 17" local time, giving 7h 50m 17" as
 the time of first contact.     Captain Tanner afterwards tested that sketch
 by noting the time before last contact, when the chord appeared of a similar
length, which gave an interval of 45' ; so that, taking the mean between
 the original estimate and its verification, we have 7h 50m 24",5 as the time
 of first contact.
    While the obscuration was increasing, Captain Tanner, during the few
peeps we got at the eclipse, made drawings of the sun's spots, and sketched
 the mountains on the moon's edge, of which there were two plainly visible
 even with my small theodolite.         The darkness increased very slowly till
just before totality, when the increase      was very rapid   and sudden, and a
 general spontaneous exclamation "Oh!" from all of us gave              Mr. Kero
 Laxuman the time of beginning of totality, which he recorded as        9h lm 49".
 The eclipse    was at that time completely shut      out from our view by the
 clouds  —  nimbi low down being carried past by the high wind ; we there
fore felt at leisure to make our remarks on the degree of the darkness, which
we were     surprised to find so far from total.     We could easily write, read
 our writing, and read the seconds of our watches without the aid of artifi
 cial light.    We were all lamenting our misfortune in not being able to
 observe   the eclipse, and had given up all hope of witnessing the phenomena
 we had come so far to see, and Captain Tanner had just noticed the faint
 reappearance of light in the west, when, contrary to all expectation, and to
 our intense satisfaction, a sudden opening in the nimbi showed us the
 eclipse through the cirrocumuli.        We were each at our telescopes in an
instant.     1 immediately saw through the naked telescope of the small theo
 dolite that red flames were visible, and at once pointed the spectroscope,
 using the theodolite-telescope as a rest.        Very fortunately I directed the
 spectroscope with its
                          " refracting edge" tangent to the moon where two
 red flames were protruding, separated from each other by a small interval ;
 so that their spectra, which      were identical, were extended over the dark
 background of the moon's disk, and stood out in most marked and brilliant
 contrast with the feeble but continuous spectrum of the corona ; and in

1868.]                             of the   Solar Eclipse.                            77
their spectrum there were the two broad bright bands I have above de
scribed. Most fortunately also these red flames were on that part of the
sun which first reappeared         ;  so that  just before or just at emergence there
appeared at the very part         I  was  intently observing one brilliant wide spec
trum with the green and indigo bands before described, remaining visible
for an interval just long enough to enable me to make quite sure of the po
 sition of the bands, which were then obliterated by the bright light of the
sun.       Of course, observing with the spectroscope alone it would have
 been impossible to say whether the spectrum with the green and indigo
 bands appeared just before or just after emergence ; but I think it must
 have been just before, because Captain Tanner called out when totality was
 over ; and     I immediately remarked that           I   thought he was rather late,
 but he    was quite    confident about the accuracy of his observation.           What
 struck    me as being very remarkable was the circumstance, that though the
 light of the red        flames   was   to the naked eye so feeble as to be out
 shone to extinction by that of the corona, nevertheless, when viewed with
  the spectroscope, the spectrum of the corona was very weak, and that of
 the flames remarkably brilliant.            On the first glimpse of the eclipse, before
 looking through the        telescope,   the corona appeared so bright, that it gave
  me the momentary          impression (as it did to Captain Tanner) of its being
  an annular eclipse.        We are divided in our estimate of the length of the
  interval during which we observed the totality.                It appeared to me very
  short  —  so much    so,  that  when   it  was  over  I  was quite taken by surprise to
  hear that both Captain Tanner and Mr. Kero Laxuman had taken sketches
  of the flames ; and their sketches, both as to position and structure, were,
  with one slight exception, remarkably coincident.                From the time of my
   first pointing the spectroscope to the bursting out of the sun's light I never
   once withdrew my eye, though it had been my intention to shift the
   prism-cap on to the telescope of the theodolite as soon as I should have
   carefully noted the spectrum of the flames ; but while I was intently gazing
   on the two bright bands to impress their colour well on my memory, the
   new spectrum of the moon's edge appeared, so that I was under the im
   pression that the length of the time of observation was very short.            On the
   other hand, Captain       Tanner,    judging from the amount of work he did in
   the time, estimated it at a minute.          Mr. Kero Laxuman estimated it at 40
   or 45 seconds.      Immediately after the totality was over we all three made
   rough   notes  of our   observations ; and Captain Tanner's and Mr. Kero Laxu-
   man's notes agree together wonderfully in their description of the structure
   of the flames.
       The accompanying rough sketch was made by Captain Tanner, who had
   not the means of making a more finished drawing.                 The sketch shows the
    actual appearance of the eclipse.            It was observed by Captain Tanner
    wholly inverted, and by Mr. Kero Laxuman (who used a diagonal eyepiece)
    inverted vertically but not laterally.        Captain Tanner and Mr. Kero Laxu

  78                Capt. Haig's Spectroscopic       Observations          [Recess,
  man only differed in their position of the small flame c, the former placing
 it  to the right, the latter at a similar distance on the left of the flames b ;
 hut Captain Tanner at once yielded his conviction to that of Mr. Kero Lax-
 uman, which, therefore, we accepted as most likely to be true.           The spec
 trum of c was not observed by me at all.          I therefore think it could only
 have appeared simultaneously with the bright spectrum of the moon's edge.
 I  so held the spectroscope that    I could not  see  the spectrum of the flame a.
     The following is an extract from Captain Tanner's notes, taken almost
 immediately after the eclipse: —      I
                                     " at first saw three prominences — one
                                                                                long
 curved pointed tongue, and two close together, straight but flat-topped,
 about two-thirds the height of the former.           They were of a rose-madder
 colour, and were decidedly more like flames than anything else, not only in
 their general appearance and colour, but by their being composed of smaller
 tongues of flame parallel (or nearly so) to the general axis of the flame,
 so that they had a streaky appearance and a ragged edge.               At the first
 glance,  when   the  sun  was  somewhat     obscured  by  clouds,  I thought they
were homogeneous and had hard edges ; but this idea was at once dis
pelled when the clouds cleared off.          The two protuberances, which were
close together, were not, as far as      I could see, joined by any smaller shots
of flame.      I afterwards   observed one     small protuberance, and marked
the position of it in my sketch.         I  did not observe that it was streaky,
as the others were    — perhaps   on  account of its being so small, and perhaps
because    I had not sufficient time to examine it properly.         As regards the
corona, when we first began to see the eclipse through the clouds,            I  was
under the impression      that the eclipse, instead of being total, was only an
nular, so bright was the corona near the moon's limb.           I  could not detect
any irregularities in the structure of the corona, but the light appeared to
be gradually shaded off all round."
     Captain Tanner also says,
                                 " The most careless observer would notice the
streaks of which the flames b were composed ; but it required more care
ful inspection to determine the streaky nature of the flame a."
     The following is from Mr. Kero Laxuman's notes : — " The protuberance
a appeared like a red flaming torch, width £ a minute, height about 2
minutes, colour dark red, lines stretched over a less-red ground.          The di
rection not perpendicular to the edge of the moon, but making an angle of
60° with it.     Those marked b were broader and almost as high as a, but
not pointed.      They appeared to expand a little at the vertex. They were
also streaked by several dark-red lines.       That marked c appeared semicir
cular, with a breadth of about £ a minute.          The flame a was visible for
about 2 minutes after the end of totality ; and had there been no clouds,
I   think it could have been seen longer."
     Both Captain Tanner and Mr. Kero Laxuman also agreed in describing
the form of the red flames b as somewhat similar to hands with fingers
slightly separated.

 1868.]                             of the Solar Eclipse.
   There is a curious coincidence which              I   may here mention, though          I
imagine it can only be regarded as purely fortuitous, viz. that the flames
were almost exactly opposite the spots on the sun's disk.
   On the afternoon of the 18th, Captain Tanner and went to Moolwar,  I
eighteen miles south of Beejapoor, where the German astronomers had put
up their instruments.          We there learnt that they had only seen the eclipse
for less than 5 seconds during totality, and that through an upper stratum
of clouds which rendered photometric observations impracticable                    ;  but we
were surprised to hear that neither a spectroscope nor a polariscope was
attached to either of their equatorial telescopes at the time of visibility, but
that both the observers with these instruments were intent on measuring the
heights of the flames. They determined the normal height of flame a to be
3 minutes ; but as they must have seen it at an earlier phase than Captain
Tanner and Mr. Kero Laxuman, it would appear slightly longer to them
than to us.
   It is very curious how the darkness during totality seems to have differed
in degree in different places. At Beejapoor we were told that down below
in the town the darkness was so great that it was not possible to see one's
own hand.        We thought this account might be an exaggeration; but we
afterwards learnt that at Moolwar a gentleman dropped part of an eye
piece of a telescope, and that it was not possible to find it even by placing
the eye close to the ground, until after the end of totality.
   We have not had time during our continual travelling to compute the
elements of the eclipse for Beejapoor for ourselves ; and it might have
been waste of time to have done so before we started on our journey,
for we were uncertain of our being able to get so far south as Beeja
poor ; but I give below a statement of elements for Beejapoor as com
puted by Mr. Pogson, astronomer at Madras, and published in the
' Times of India,' and with it the times as observed or estimated
by us.

    There was a difference in our times of last contact. Mr. Kero Laxuman
 made it at 10" 28m9'; I made it 10h 28m U'.and Captain Tanner 10" 28m 1 7".

limb after      Mr. Kero Laxuman had called out               ; so  I   attributed his error to
the vibration of his telescope caused by the wind.                  Capt. Tanner observed,
I  believe, the last contact ; but, strange to say, the point of the moon which
made last contact was a mountain-peak of this
 shape    ;   Capt. Tanner would            make    it thus,
 dividing the mountain into two hills ; and he says                   I  was a second too soon
in my observation, which was of the spherical last contact ; and perhaps
 he was right, as he had a better telescope than I had.                      His observation at
 10h 28m 17' was the time of the peak leaving the sun's limb; so that he and
 I differ   only by 1 second, as to whether the spherical last contact occurred at
 101,28n,14,or 10hs28m 15'.
     I sent a native assistant to Moolwar (the station selected by the German
 astronomers) to take observations with a barometer, and with wet-, dry-,
 and black-bulb thermometers, continuously for some days before and after
 the eclipse, but       I  anticipate no interesting results (from the rough glance
 I  took at the records on the evening of the 18th).                     The atmosphere      was
 during the time in a very disturbed state.
     Mr. Chambers, of the Bombay Observatory, went to'                          a village called
 Mongoli, about six miles            east  of Moolwar, with the intention of observing
 the eclipse ; but he was disappointed, for it was completely obscured by
 clouds during the whole of the total phase.
     I  have not yet heard what success has attended Lieuts. Herschel and
 Campbell with the spectroscope and polariscope at Jamkhandi, so that                            I
 am quite ignorant          of the value of our observations ; but I trust that even
 should other observers have succeeded                 in contributing to physics more de
 finite information,         ours may at least be valuable as corroborative evidence.

VI.     "Account      of Observations of the Total Eclipse               of the Sun,
        made August 18th, 1868, along the coast of Borneo, in a Letter
        addressed to    H.M.    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by His
        Excellency J.     Pope    Hennessy, Governor of Labuan." Com
        municated by the Right Hon. Lord Stanley, F.R.S.                     Received
        October 8, 1868.
                                                         Government House, Labuan,
                                                              19th August, 1868.
    My Lord, — Seeing        the interest which Her Majesty's Government and
the scientific public     in  England have shown in the remarkable eclipse
which occurred yesterday,        I  took steps to make such observations as I
could along the coast of        Borneo,   and  I  have now the honour of laying
them before your Lordship.
    After passing from the         Gulf of Siam across the China Sea, the line
of total eclipse    passed   across  the Island of Borneo, touching the colony
of Labuan on the east, and stretching not far from the River Bintulu on
the west.
    Having ascertained that the precise centre of this band of total eclipse
would be found at Barram Point (a place within my jurisdiction as Consul-
General in the Island of Borneo), I made arrangements with Capt. Reed,
of H.M. S. 'Rifleman,' to take my observations at that spot. As that
well-known officer has been for years in charge of the important survey
of the China seas, his ship afforded special facilities for such an expe
dition.
    We left Labuan on Monday at noon, and arrived off Barram Point                    at
five o'clock next morning, Tuesday the 18th.
    A tent   was fitted up on an open space between a Casuarina-plantation
and the sea, and the following        corps of observers landed at ten o'clock : —
Captain Reed, Lieutenant Ray, Lieutenant Ellis, and myself, our four
telescopes being securely adjusted on large tripod stands manufactured
for the occasion.       Four other officers landed with us: — Dr. O'Connor to
note    the physiological phenomena, Mr. Wright to watch the magnetic
needle, and Mr. Doyley and Mr. Roughton to mark the time.                        A few
intelligent sailors were in attendance to assist the observers, if necessary.
                                                                                  '
    Mr. Petley and the other officers left on board the ' Rifleman had
charge    of the barometrical and thermometrical observations, and they were
also   directed by Captain Reed to watch the vibrations, if any, in the
magnetic compasses.
    Before leaving the ship I made some observations upon the solar spots.
At 8 a.m. I found some spots in a line from east to south *. The upper
   *  It did not seem necessary to reproduce the sketch sent by the author, as the posi
tion of the spots may be represented by conceiving the next figure to be turned round
through about 65° in the direction of the hands of a watch.

82                  Governor Hennessy's Observations on the                [Recess,
spot was surrounded by a penumbra stretching towards the centre of the
sun, the second spot was small and sharply defined, the third spot, or
group of spots, had a penumbra, and the fourth spot was surrounded by
a space of very brilliant light.
    These spots I subsequently refer to as Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Moving with the rotation of the sun, the line of spots gradually became
horizontal, and at 12 o'clock (noon) they lay thus (see fig. I).
                                          Fig.  1.
    At   15 seconds    past 12 o'clock the first contact of the moon took place
 at the point marked A.          At 12h 24ra 20"-2 the contact was observed of
 the moon with the penumbra of spot No. 1 .
    At   12h 25m    25'-5 contact with left of No.     1 spot.
    At   1 2h 26m  58* the spot was completely covered.
    During all this time no vibrations or change of any kind was noticed in
 the magnetic needle.
    At 12h 44m 15" the moon's limb had advanced to the sun's centre.
    At l"    10m  4/'-5 spot No.      2 was passed,     and at lh 18m 6' spot No. 3
 was passed.
     All this time not the smallest magnetic change could be noticed.
     At lh 27m 22" the total eclipse took place, and lasted for 6 minutes and
  13 seconds    ; the first appearance of the sun's limb from behind the moon
 being at    1" 33m 35*.
     The spots reappeared      as follows  : —
                                  No.   1 at 1"    41m 12«

  and at   2h 52m   39,-8 the last contact of the edge of the sun and moon was
  noticed.
     During the 6m and 1 3" of total eclipse not the slightest change of any
  kind could be observed in the magnetic needle, nor did it move or vibrate
  in any way on the appearance of the solar spots.

 1868.]                       Total Eclipse of    the  Sun,                       88
    To complete the negative results of our magnetic observations, I            have
only to add that the officers who had           been   directed to watch the ship's
compasses report     that    they  could  not   detect the slightest movement of
any kind.
    I now proceed to describe the general phenomena of the eclipse ; and
in doing so I confine myself to copying from the rough notes               I took at
 Barram Point, and from the note-books of Capt. Reed and his officers,
also taken on the spot.          As the mail closes for Singapore to-morrow
morning, I have not time to arrange the materials before me in anything
like scientific order  ;   and the absence of any works of reference (we have
not even this year's supplement to the Nautical Almanac) renders me still
less able to do justice to the facts we collected.
    We were very fortunate in the weather. The day was bright and clear j
not a cloud was near the sun.           A few round white clouds that lay on
the horizon hardly moved.         There was a slight breeze from      W.S.W.
    The sea was breaking heavily on the shore, and it had a slight brownish
bluish tinge all over, except where the white breakers approached the land.
    The grove of Casuarina trees behind us had the same deep-green colour
which they always exhibit on a fine day in the tropics.
    A few swallows were skimming about high in the air. We also noticed
some dragonflies, butterflies, and a good many specimens of a large heavy
fly like a drone-bee.
    When we left the ship at 10 o'clock the barometer was 30-00 ; the
mean of the two thermometers in the deck chart-room (in the shade) was
85° ; the dry thermometer exposed to the sun was 91°, and the wet ther
mometer exposed to the sun was 83°-5.
    During the progress of the eclipse the barometer fell steadily. At 1 2h
0m 15", first contact, it was 29 98.
                        Atl2"26m       0' it fell to 29-96 in.

    The mean of the two thermometers in the             shade was  85°, without any
change whatever from 10 o'clock till the close of the eclipse. At the close
of the eclipse, 2" 62m 39"-8, it rose to 86°.
   The dry-bulb thermometer, hung in the sunlight, stood at 91° at the
first contact.
                                                                       g 2

   It thus appears that the thermometer fell from 91° to 85° as the moon
was covering the sun, and that it rose from 85° to 96° as the sun was re
appearing.
   The wet-bulb    thermometer fell from 80° 5 to 83° at the total eclipse,
and rose to 89° at the termination of the whole eclipse.
   Ten minutes before the total eclipse there seemed to be a luminous
crescent reflected upon the dark body of the moon *.
   In another minute a long beam of light, pale and quite straight, the
rays diverging at a small angle, shot out from the westerly corner of the
sun's crescent.    At the   same time     Mr. Ellis noticed a corresponding dark
band,  or shadow,     shooting    down from the east corner of the crescent
(%. 2).
                                                     Fig.  2.
  At this time the    sea assumed     a darker aspect,      and a well-defined green
band was seen distinctly    around the horizon.         The temperature had fallen

  1868.]                      Total Eclipse of the Sun.                           85
 and the wind had slightly freshened.          The darkness then     came   on with
 great rapidity. The sensation was as       if a thunderstorm    was  just about to
 break, and one was startled on looking up to see not a single cloud over
 head.     The birds, after flying very low, disappeared altogether.             The
 dragonflies   and  butterflies  disappeared,  and   the large  drone-like flies  all
 collected on the ceiling of the tent and remained at rest. The crickets
 and Cicadee in the jungle began to sound       ; and some birds, not visible, also
 began to twitter in the jungle.
     The sea grew darker, and immediately before the total obscuration the
 horizon could not be seen.
     The line of round white clouds that lay near the horizon changed their
 colour and aspect with great rapidity. As the obscuration took place
 they all became of a dark purple, heavy looking, and with sharply defined
 edges ; they then presented the appearance of clouds close to the horizon
 after sunset.     It seemed as if the sun had set at the four points of the
 horizon.
     The sky was of a dark leaden blue, and the trees looked almost black.
 The faces of the observers looked dark, but not pallid or unnatural.
    The moment of maximum darkness seemed to be immediately before
 the total obscuration    ;  for a few seconds    nothing   could be seen except
 objects quite close to the observers.
    Suddenly there burst forth a luminous         ring around the moon.        This
 ring  was  composed of a multitude of rays, quite irregular in length and in
 direction  ; from the upper and lower parts they extended in bands to a
 distance more than twice the diameter of the sun. Other bands appeared
 to fall towards one side ; but in this there was no regularity, for bands
 near them fell away apparently towards the other side.            When    I  called
 attention to this, Lieut. Ray said, " Yes, I see them ; they are like horses'
        " and
tails ;         they certainly resembled masses of luminous hair in complete
disorder.
    1 have said these bands appeared to fall to one side ; but I do not mean
that they actually fell or moved in any way during the observation.               If
the atmosphere had not been perfectly clear, it is possible that the appear
ance they presented would lead to the supposition that they moved ; but
no optical delusion of the kind was possible under the circumstances.
    During the second when the sun was disappearing, the edge of the
luminous crescent became broken up into numerous points of light.               The
moment these were gone, the rays I have just mentioned shot forth, and
at the same time we noticed the sudden appearance of the rose-coloured
protuberances.
    The first of these was about one-sixth of the sun's diameter in length,
and about one-twenty-fourth part of the sun's diameter in breadth.            It all
appeared at the same instant, as      if a veil had suddenly melted away from
before it.

86                       Governor Hennessy's Observations on the                      [Recess,
     It   seemed     to be a tower       of rose-coloured clouds.          The colour was most
beautiful       — more       beautiful
                            than any rose-colour     ever saw ; indeed I                      I
know of no natural object or colour to which it can be, with justice, com
pared.  Though one has to describe it as rose-coloured, yet in truth it
was very different from any colour or tint                 I
                                            ever saw before.
     This protuberance extended from the right of the upper limb, and was
visible for six minutes.
     In   five seconds after this was visible, a much broader and shorter                   pro
tuberance appeared at the left side of the upper limb.   This seemed to be
composed  of  two united  together.    In  colour and  aspect it exactly re
sembled the long one.
   This second protuberance gradually sank down as the sun continued to
fall behind the moon, and in three minutes it had disappeared altogether.
   A few seconds after it had sunk down there appeared at the lower cor
responding limb (the right inferior corner) a similar protuberance, which
grew out as the eclipse proceeded.  This also seemed to be a double pro
tuberance, and in size and shape very much resembled the second one ;
that      is,
           its breadth very much exceeded its height.
      In colour, however, this differed from either of the former ones.                      Its
left      edge was       a   bright blue, like     a   brilliant sapphire with light thrown
upon       it   ;   next to that was the so-called             rose-colour, and, at the right
corner,   sparkling ruby tint.
            a
   This beautiful protuberance advanced at the same rate that the sun had
moved all along, when suddenly      seemed to spread towards the left, until
                                              it
it ran around one-fourth of the circle, making      long ridge of the rose-
                                                                   a
coloured masses.    As this happened, the blue shade disappeared.
   In about twelve seconds the whole of this ridge vanished, and gave
place to    rough edge of brilliant white light, and in another second the
                a
sun had burst forth again.
      In the meantime the long, rose-coloured protuberance on the upper
right limb had remained visible and though   ;  seemed to be sinking into
                                                               it
the moon,    did not disappear altogether until the lower ridge had been
                    it
 formed and had been visible for two seconds.
    This long protuberance was quite visible to the naked eye, but its colour
 could not be detected except through the telescope. To the naked eye                         it
 simply appeared as    little tower of white light standing on the dark edge
                               a
 of the moon.
    The lower protuberance appeared to the naked eye to be notch of light       a
 in the dark edge of the moon — not     protuberance, but an indentation.
                                                   a
      In shape the long protuberance resembled  goat's horn.   a
   As    have not time

 content myself with inclosing to your Lordship two pages from my rough
 note-book, showing the sketches taken at the moment.

    Those who were looking    out for stars counted nine visible to the naked
 eye.
    One planet (Venus?) was very brilliant. Its altitude at lh 31m 0' was
 30° 32' (Carey's Government Sextant, no error), and its distance from the
 nearest limb of the moon was 37° 28'.       The altitude of the lower limb of
 the moon at lh 32m 0" was 66° 30'.
    On board the ' Rifleman ' the fowls and pigeons went to roost, but the
 cattle showed no signs of uneasiness ; they were lying down at the time.
     Whatever interest the foregoing observations may have for men of
 science,  I am happy to be able to report that Capt. Reed has added to his
 public services by seizing this opportunity for determining the exact lon
 gitude of Barram Point.
    Navigators have long been anxious to fix the precise longitude of some
 point along the coast of Borneo, and the event of yesterday has probably
 accomplished this.    When Capt. Reed's calculations have been finally re
 duced, he will, no doubt, communicate them to the head of his depart
 ment ; and in the meantime he has kindly undertaken to place in a cover,
 directed to your Lordship, the true time as worked out from the observa
 tions, so that the times given in this despatch may be corrected before the
 despatch is used.
    The time given in this despatch was taken from one of Parkinson and
Frodsham's Government pocket chronometers, No. 1 887.
    As I believe we were the nearest group of observers to the Equator, and
as the other conditions were unusually     favourable for our work,    I venture
to hope that even the inadequate and very unscientific        account     I have

of   science  in England.
     Before closing my despatch I received from Capt. Reed the error of the
chronometer-watch used for taking the time.                  It was fast on the mean
time at Barram Point          0h 4m   8'7.

                                        Governor of Labuan, and Consul-General
                                                   in the Island of Borneo.
     To the Right Honourable           Lord Stanley, M.P.,
           Secretary     of State for Foreign Affairs.
      [Note. — The phenomenon of the sun's crescent reflected on            to the disk
 of the moon would seem to have been something accidental, perhaps (if
 seen by the writer only) a mere ghost, depending on a double reflection
 between the glasses       of his instrument.   The figure represents the  " reflected"
 image as in the same position as the crescent itself, not reversed, indicating
 either a refraction or a double reflection.
      The slender beams of light or shade shooting out from the horns of the
 crescent    would seem to admit of easy explanation, supposing them to have
 been of the nature of sunbeams, depending upon the illumination of the
 atmosphere of the earth by the sun's rays.             The perfect shadow, or umbra,
 would be a cone circumscribing both sun and moon, and having its vertex
  far below the observer's horizon.            Within this cone there would be no
 illumination      of the atmosphere, but outside it a portion of the sun's rays
  would be scattered in their progress through the air, giving rise to a faint
  illumination. When the total phase drew near, the nearer surface of the
  shadow would be at no great distance from the observer ; the further
  surface would be remote.           Attend in the first instance to some one plane
  passing through the eye and cutting the shadow transversely, and in this
  plane draw a straight line through the eye, touching the section of the
  cone    which    bounds the shadow ; and then imagine other lines drawn
  through"    the   eye a little inside and outside this.        In the former case the
  greater part of the line, while it lay within the lower regions of the atmo
  sphere, would be in shadow, the only part in sunshine being that reaching
  from the eye to the nearer surface of the shadow ; but in the latter case the
  line would be in sunshine all along.           In the direction of the former line,
  therefore, there would          be  but little illumination arising from scattered
  light,   while in the direction        of the latter the illumination would, com
  paratively speaking, be considerable.           In crossing the tangent there would
  be a rapid change of illumination.              Now    pass  on to three dimensions.
   Instead of    a   tangent line we shall have       a tangent plane, and there will

of course be two such planes, touching the two sides of the cone                    respec
tively.    Each of these will be projected on the visual sphere into                a great
circle, a common tangent to the two small circles, which are the projections
of the sun and moon. In crossing either of these there will be a rapid
change of illumination (feeble though it be at best) which will be noticed.
According      as the observer mentally regards darkness as the rule and             illumi
nation as the feature, or illumination       as the rule and darkness as the feature,
he will describe what he sees as a beam or a shadow.               The direction of     these
beams or shadows given by theory, as just explained, agrees very well with
the drawing sent by Governor Hennessy, which does not represent the
left-hand beam so distinctly divided as it appears in the woodeut.
    The times mentioned in the above despatch have not been corrected for
 the error of the chronometer-watch.             In the following Tables, furnished by
 Staff Commander Reed, the corrected mean times alone are printed.                        The

    Sir, — In   my last letter from Stockholm I promised to send you, with
the returning naturalists, a detailed relation of the first scientific part of
the Swedish Arctic Expedition of 1868; but unfortunately our last coal-
ship, with which five of our fellow travellers, with the rich geological,
zoological, and botanical collections, made during this season in the arctic
regions, return to Tromso, and which gives us the last occasion of com
municating with Europe, leaves this harbour in some hours, and that makes
it impossible for      me to keep    my promise.     However,   a detailed report
will immediately be sent to you by one of the returning naturalists, Dr.
 Malmgren, a member also of the expeditions of 1861 and 1864. The
remaining part of our expedition will from here go, first, to Seven Island,
 and then (perhaps one of the first days of October), after having depo

    Sir, — I   beg to anticipate a more detailed communication by informing
 you   that,  after  a number of failures, which made the attempt seem hope
 less, I have this morning perfectly succeeded in obtaining and observing
 part of the spectrum of a solar prominence.
    As   a result  I  have established the existence of three bright lines in the
 following positions : —
       I. Absolutely coincident with C.
      II. Nearly coincident with F.
    III. Near D.
    The third line (the one near D) is more refrangible than the more re
 frangible of the two darkest lines by eight or nine degrees of Kirchboff's

    I have evidence that the prominence was a very fine one.
    The instrument employed is the solar spectroscope, the funds for the
 construction of which were supplied by the Government-Grant Committee.
 It is to be regretted that its construction has been so long delayed.

 IX. " On       a New Series    of Chemical Reactions produced           by Light."
        By John Tyndall, LL.D., F.R.S., &c.                 Received October 24,
        1868.
    I  ask permission of the Royal Society to draw the attention of che
 mists to a form or method of experiment which, though obvious, is,                 I
 am informed, unknown, and which,             I doubt not, will in their hands
 become    a new experimental     power.    It consists in subjecting the vapours
 of volatile liquids to   the  action of   concentrated   sunlight, or to the con
 centrated beam of the electric light.
                           Action of the Electric Light.
    A  glass  tube 2-8 feet long and of 2-5 inches internal diameter, frequently
employed in my researches on radiant heat, was supported horizontally.            At
one end of it was placed an electric lamp, the height and position of both
being so arranged that the axis of the glass tube and that of the parallel
beam issuing from the lamp were coincident.           The tube in the first experi
ments was closed by plates of rock-salt,          and subsequently by plates of
glass.
   As on former occasions, for the      sake  of distinction,  I will call this tube
the experimental     tube.
   The experimental tube was connected with an air-pump, and also with a
series of drying and other tubes used for the purification of the air.
   A number of test-tubes (I suppose I have used fifty of them in all) were
converted into Woulfe's flasks. Each of them was stopped by a cork through
which passed two glass tubes : one of these tubes (a) ended immediately
below the cork, while the other (6) descended to the bottom of the flask,
being drawn out at its lower end to an orifice about 0-03 of an inch in dia
meter.     It was found necessary to coat the cork carefully with cement.
   The little flask thus formed was partially filled with the liquid whose
vapour was to be examined ; it was then introduced into the path of the
purified current of air.
   The experimental tube being exhausted, and the cock which cut off the
supply of purified air being cautiously turned on, the air entered the flask

through the tube b, and escaped by the small orifice at the lower end of b
into the liquid.  Through this it bubbled, loading itself with vapour,
after which the mixed air and vapour, passing from the flask by the tube a,
entered the experimental                tube, where they were subjected to the action
of light.
   The power of the electricbeam to reveal the existence of anything within
the experimental tube, or the impurities of the tube itself, is extraordinary.
When the experiment is made in a darkened room, a tube which in ordi
nary daylight appears absolutely clean is often shown by the present mode
of examination to be exceedingly filthy.
  The following             are   some     of the results obtained with this arrange
ment    :   —
  Nitrite of amyl (boiling-point 91° to 96° C.). —The vapour of this liquid
was in the first instance permitted to enter the experimental tube while
the beam from the electric lamp was passing through it. Curious clouds were
observed to form near the place of entry, which were afterwards whirled
through the tube.
   The tube being again exhausted, the mixed air and vapour were allowed
to enter it in the dark.   The slightly convergent beam of the electric light
was then sent through    the tube from end to end. For a moment the tube
was optically empty, nothing whatever was seen within it ; but before a
second had elapsed a shower of liquid spherules was precipitated on the
beam, thus generating a cloud within the tube.         This cloud became
denser as the light continued to act, showing at some places a vivid iri
descence.
   The beam of the electric lamp was now converged so as to form within
the tube, between its end and the focus, a cone of rays about eight inches
long.  The tube was cleansed and again filled in darkness. When the
light   was sent through          it,
                           the precipitation upon the beam was so rapid and
intense that the cone, which moment before was invisible, flashed suddenly
                                         a
forth like solid luminous spear.
                a
   The effect was the same when the air and vapour were allowed to enter
the tube in diffuse daylight. The cloud, however, which shone with such
extraordinary radiance under the electric beam, was invisible in the ordinary
light of the laboratory.
   The quantity of mixed air and vapour within the experimental tube could
of course be regulated at pleasure. The rapidity of the action diminished
with the attenuation of the vapour.    When, for example, the mercurial
column associated with the experimental tube was depressed only five inches,
the action was not nearly so rapid as when the tube was full. In such cases,
however,         exceedingly interesting to observe, after some seconds of
                it   was
waiting,    thin streamer of delicate bluish-white cloud slowly forming
                a
along the axis of the tube, and finally swelling so as to fill it.

94                    Prof. Tyndall on a New Series of                    [Recess,
    When dry oxygen      was employed to carry     in the vapour, the effect was
the same as that obtained with air.
    When dry hydrogen was used as a vehicle,             the effect   was also the
same.
    The effect, therefore, is not due to any interaction between the vapour of
the nitrite and its vehicle.
    This was further demonstrated by the deportment of the vapour itself.
When it was permitted to enter the experimental tube unmixed with air or
any other gas, the effect was substantially the same.        Hence the seat of the
observed action is the vapour itself.
    With reference to the air and the glass of the experimental tube, the
beam employed in these experiments was perfectly cold.            It had been sifted
by passing it through a solution of alum, and through the thick double-
convex lens of the lamp.        When the unsifted beam of the lamp was em
ployed, the effect   was  still the  same ; the obscure calorific rays did not ap
pear to interfere with the result.
    I have taken no means to determine strictly the character of the action
here described, my object being simply to point out to chemists a method
of experiment which reveals         a new and beautiful    series of reactions ; to
them    I leave the examination     of the products of decomposition.      The mo
lecule of the nitrite of amyl is shaken asunder by certain specific waves of
the electric beam, forming nitric oxide and other products, of which the
nitrate of amyl is probably one.          The brown fumes of nitrous acid were
 seen to mingle   with the cloud within the experimental tube.
    The nitrate of amyl, being less volatile than the nitrite, could not main
 tain itself in the condition of vapour, but would be precipitated in liquid
 spherules along the track of the beam.
    In the anterior portions of the tube a sifting action of the vapour occurs,
 which diminishes the chemical action in the posterior portions.           In some
 experiments the precipitated cloud only extended halfway down the tube.
 When, under these circumstances, the lamp was shifted so as to send the
 beam through the other end of the tube, precipitation occurred there also.
                                 Action of Sunlight.
   The solar light also effects the decomposition of the nitrite- of- amyl vapour.
 On the 10th of October I partially darkened a small room in the Royal
 Institution, into which the sun shone, permitting the light to enter through
 an open portion of the window-shutter.          In the track of the beam was
 placed a large plano-convex lens, which formed a fine convergent cone in
 the dust of the room behind it. The experimental tube was filled in the
 laboratory, covered with a black cloth, and carried into the partially darkened
 room.     On thrusting one end of the tube into the cone of rays behind the
 lens, precipitation within the cone was copious and immediate.         The vapour
  at the distant end of the tube was in part shielded by that in front, and

 1868.]                Chemical Reactions produced by          Light.                 95
was also more feebly acted on through           the divergence of the rays.       On re
versing the tube, a second and similar cone was precipitated.
                                Physical consider at ions.
   I sought to determine the particular portion of the white beam which
produced the foregoing effects.           When, previous to entering the experi
mental tube, the beam was caused to pass through a red glass, the effect
was greatly weakened, but not extinguished.              This was also the case with
various samples of yellow glass.          A blue glass being introduced, before the
removal of the yellow or the red, on taking the latter away augmented
precipitation occurred along the track of the blue beam.                Hence, in this
case, the more refrangible rays are the most chemically active.
   The colour of the liquid nitrite of amyl indicates that this must be the
case ; it is a feeble but distinct yellow : in other words, the yellow portion
of the    beam is most freely transmitted.        It is not, however, the transmitted
portion of any beam which produces chemical action, but the absorbed por
tion. Blue, as the complementary colour to yellow, is here absorbed, and
hence the more energetic action of the blue rays.                This reasoning, how
ever, assumes       that   the same   rays  are  absorbed    by the liquid and its va
pour.
   A   solution of the yellow chromate of potash, the colour of which may be
made almost, if not altogether, identical with that of the liquid nitrite of
amyl, was found far more effective in stopping the chemical rays than
either the red or the yellow glass.          But of all substances the nitrite itself
is most potent in arresting the rays which act upon its vapour.                 A layer
one- eighth of an inch in thickness, which scarcely perceptibly affected the
luminous intensity, sufficed to absorb the entire chemical energy of the con
centrated beam of the electric light.
   The close relation subsisting between a liquid and its vapour, as regards
their action upon radiant heat, has been already amply demonstrated *. As
regards the nitrite of amyl, this relation is more specific than in the cases
hitherto adduced       ;  for here the special constituent of the beam which pro
vokes the decomposition of the vapour is shown to be arrested by the
liquid.
    A question of extreme importance in molecular physics here arises : —
What is the real mechanism of this absorption, and where is its seat + ?
    I  figure, as others do, a molecule as a group of atoms, held to
gether by their mutual forces, but still capable of motion among them
selves. The vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage
of such molecules. The question now before us is this : — In the act of ab
sorption, is it the molecules that are effective, or is it their constituent
   »  Phil. Trans.  1864.
   t My    attention was very forcibly directed to this subject  some years ago by a con
versation with my excellent friend Professor Clausius.

 96                       Prof. Tyndall on a New Series        of           [Recess,
atoms   ?    Is the vis viva of the intercepted waves transferred to the molecule
 as a  whole,   or to its constituent parts ?
    The molecule, as a whole, can only vibrate in virtue of the forces exerted
between    it and its neighbour molecules. The intensity of these forces, and
consequently the rate of vibration, would, in this case, be a function of the
distance between the molecules.            Now the identical absorption of the
liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl indicates an identical vibrating
period on the part of liquid and vapour, and this, to my mind, amounts to an
experimental demonstration that the absorption occurs in the main within
the molecule.       For it can hardly be supposed, if the absorption were the act
of the molecule as a whole, that it could continue to affect waves of the
same period after the substance had passed from the vaporous to the            liquid
state.
    In point of fact the decomposition of the nitrite of amyl is itself to some
extent an illustration of this internal molecular absorption ; for were the ab
sorption the act of the molecule as a whole, the relative motions of its
constituent atoms would remain unchanged, and there would be no me
chanical cause for their separation.        It is probably the synchronism of the
vibrations of one portion of the molecule with the incident waves which
enables the amplitude of those vibrations to augment until the chain which
binds the parts of the molecule together is snapped asunder.
    The liquid nitrite of amyl is probably also decomposed by light       ;  but the
reaction,   if it  exists, is incomparably   less rapid and distinct than that of
the vapour.       Nitrite of amyl has   been    subjected to the concentrated solar
rays until it boiled, and it      has been permitted to continue boiling for a
considerable time, without any distinctly apparent change occurring           in the
liquid *.
    I anticipate wide, if not entire, generality for the fact that a liquid and
its vapour absorb the same rays.         A cell of liquid chlorine now preparing
for me will,    I imagine, deprive light more effectually of its power of causing
chlorine    and hydrogen to combine than any other filter of the luminous
rays.    The    rays which give chlorine its colour have nothing to do with this
combination, those that are absorbed by the chlorine being the really effec
tive rays.     A highly sensitive bulb containing chlorine and hydrogen in
the exact proportions necessary for the formation of hydrochloric acid was
placed at one end of the experimental tube, the beam of the electric lamp
being sent through it from the other.          The bulb did not explode when the
tube was filled with chlorine, while the explosion was violent and im
mediate when the tube was filled with air.              I anticipate for the liquid
chlorine an action similar to but still more energetic than that exhibited by
the gas.      If this should prove to be the case, it will favour the view that

       Production    of Sky-blue  by the decomposition    of Nitrite of Amy I.
     When the quantity of nitrite vapour is considerable, and the light in
 tense, the chemical     action is exceedingly rapid,   the particles precipitated
 being so large as to whiten the luminous beam.          Not so, however, when a
 well-mixed and highly attenuated vapour fills the experimental tube.          The
 effect now to be described was obtained      in the greatest perfection when the
 vapour    of the nitrite  was  derived from a residue of the moisture of its
 liquid, which had been accidentally introduced into the passage through
 which the dry air flowed into the experimental tube.
     In this case the electric beam traversed the tube for several seconds be
 fore any action was visible.      Decomposition then visibly commenced, and
 advanced slowly.      The particles first precipitated were too small to be dis
 tinguished by an eye-glass    ;  and, when the light was very strong, the cloud
 appeared of a milky blue.       When, on the contrary, the intensity was mode
 rate, the blue was pure and deep. In Briicke's important experiments on the
 blue of the sky and the morning and evening red, pure mastic is dissolved in
 alcohol, and then dropped into water well stirred.          When the proportion
 of mastic to alcohol is correct, the resin is precipitated so finely as to elude
 the highest microscopic power.        By reflected light, such a medium appears
 bluish, by transmitted light yellowish, which latter colour, by augmenting
 the quantity of the precipitate, can be caused to pass into orange or
 red.
    But the development of colour in the attenuated nitrite-of-amyl vapour,
 though admitting of the same explanation, is doubtless more similar to
what takes place in our atmosphere. The blue, moreover, is purer and
more sky-like than that obtained from Briicke's turbid medium.              There
could scarcely be a more impressive illustration of Newton's mode of re
garding the generation of the colour of the firmament than that here ex
hibited ; for never, even in the skies of the Alps, have I seen a richer
or a purer blue than that attainable by a suitable disposition of the light
falling upon the precipitated vapour.       May not the aqueous vapour of our
atmosphere act in a similar manner ? and may we not fairly refer to liquid
particles of infinitesimal size the hues observed by Principal Forbes over
the safety-valve of a locomotive, and so skilfully connected by him with the
colours of the sky ?
    In exhausting the tube containing the mixed air and nitrite-of-amyl
vapour, it was difficult to avoid explosions under the pistons of the air-
pump, similar to those which I have already described as occurring with
the vapours of bisulphide of carbon and other substances. Though the
quantity of vapour present in these cases must have been infinitesimal, its
explosion was sufficient to destroy the valves of the pump.

    Iodide of Ally I (boiling-point          101°  C). —Among     the liquids hitherto
subjected to the concentrated electric light, iodide of allyl, in point of rapidity
and intensity of action, comes next to the nitrite of amyl. With the iodide
of allyl   I  have employed both oxygen and hydrogen, as well as air, as a
vehicle, and found the effect in all cases substantially the same.                   The
cloud column here was exquisitely beautiful, but its forms were different
from those of the nitrite of amyl.          The whole column revolved round the axis
of the decomposing         beam   ;  it was nipped at certain places like an hour-glass,
and round the two bells of the glass delicate cloud-filaments twisted them
selves in spirals.        It also folded itself into convolutions resembling those of
shells.     In certain conditions of the atmosphere in the Alps              I have often
observed clouds of a special pearly lustre ; when hydrogen was made the
vehicle of the iodide-of-allyl vapour a similar lustre was most exquisitely
shown.       With a suitable disposition of the light, the purple hue of iodine-
vapour came out very strongly in the tube.
     The remark already made as to the bearing of the decomposition of
nitrite of amyl by light on the question of molecular absorption applies
here also    ;  for were the absorption the work of the molecule as a whole,
the iodine would not be dislodged from the allyl with which it is combined.
The non-synchronism            of iodine with the      waves  of obscure heat is illus
trated by its marvellous transparency to such heat. May not its synchronism
with the waves of light in the present instance be the cause of its divorce
 from the allyl ? Further experiments on this point are in preparation.
     Iodide of Isopropyl. — The action of light upon the vapour of this
 liquid is at first more languid than upon iodide of allyl ; indeed many
 beautiful reactions may be overlooked in consequence of this languor at the
 commencement.             After some minutes' exposure, however, clouds begin to
 form, which grow in density and in beauty as the light continues to act.
  In every experiment hitherto made with this substance the column of
 cloud which        filled   the experimental tube was divided into two distinct
 parts near the middle of the tube.               In one experiment a globe of cloud
 formed at the centre, from which, right and left, issued an axis which
 united the globe with the two adjacent cylinders.                 Both globe and cy
 linders were animated by a common motion of rotation.                      As the action
  continued, paroxysms of motion were manifested ; the various parts of
  the cloud would rush through each other with sudden violence.                    During
  these motions beautiful and grotesque cloud-forms were developed.                    At
  some places      the    nebulous mass would become ribbed so as to resemble
  the graining      of wood     ;   a longitudinal   motion   would   at   times generate
  in it   a series of curved transverse bands, the retarding             influence of the
  sides  of the tube causing an appearance resembling, on a small scale, the
   dirt-bands of the Mer de Glace.             In the anterior portion of the tube those
   sudden commotions were most intense ; here buds of cloud would sprout

forth, and grow in      a few seconds into perfect flower-like forms.                The most
curious appearance that         I
                          noticed was that of a cloud resembling a serpent's
head : it grew rapidly ; a mouth was formed, and from the mouth a cord
of cloud resembling a tongue was rapidly discharged. The cloud of iodide of
isopropyl had a character of its own, and differed materially from all others
that I had seen.    A gorgeous mauve colour was developed in the last
twelve inches of the tube ; the vapour of iodine was present, and it may
have been the sky-blue produced by the precipitated particles which,
mingling with the purple of the iodine, produced this splendid mauve.
As in all other cases here adduced, the effects were proved to be due to
the light ; they never occurred in darkness.
   I should like to guard myself against saying more than the facts war
 rant regarding the chemical effects produced by light in the following three
substances   ;  but the physical appearances are so exceedingly singular that
I   do not hesitate to describe them.

small Woulfe's flask, and carried into the experimental tube by a current

    Soon afterwards     a second cloud was formed five inches further down the
experimental tube.        Both clouds were united            by
                                                           slender cord of cloud of

the same     bluish  tint as themselves.
    As the action of the light continued, the first cloud gradually resolved
 itself into a  series of parallel disks of exquisite delicacy    the disks rotated
                                                                      ;
 round an axis perpendicular to their surfaces, and finally they blended to
 gether to produce screw surface with an inclined generatrix.

 resolved itself into   a   series    of strata resembling those of the electric dis
 charge.    After little time, and through changes which
                  a                                             was difficult to

 referred to.    Other cords and slender tubes           were afterwards formed, and
 they coiled themselves in spirals around and along the funnels.

ment of its particles.   The cord finally disappeared, while the funnels
melted into two ghost-like films, shaped like parasols.   The films were
barely visible, being of an exceedingly delicate blue tint ; they seemed
woven of blue air.       To compare them with cobweb or with gauze would
be to liken them to something infinitely grosser than themselves.
   In a second trial the result was very much the same. A cloud which
soon assumed the parasol shape was formed in front, and five inches lower
down another cloud was formed, in which the funnels       already referred
to were considerably sharpened.   It was connected as before by a filament
with the cloud in front, and it ended in a spear-point which extended 1 2
inches further down the tube.
   After many changes, the film in front assumed the shape of a bell, to the
convex surface of which a hollow cylinder about 2 inches long attached
itself.  After some time this cylinder broke away from the bell and formed
itself into an iridescent ring, which, without apparent connexion with
anything else, rotated on its axis in the middle of the tube. The inner
diameter of this ring was nearly an inch in length, and its outer diameter
nearly an inch and a half.
   The whole cloud composed of these heterogeneous parts was animated
throughout by a motion of rotation.     The rapidity of the rotation could be
augmented by intensifying the beam. The disks, funnels, strata, and con
volutions of the cloud exhibited at times diffraction colours, which changed
colour with every motion of the observer's eye.
   Moisture appeared to be favourable to the production of these ap
pearances ; and it hence became a question how far they were really pro
duced by the light : hydrobromic acid, even from its solution, fumes when
it comes into contact with the aqueous vapour of the air ; its residence
in water does not appear to satisfy its appetite for the liquid. The same
effect,              knows, is observed in the solution of hydrochloric
          as everybody
acid.  Might not, then, those wonderfully shaped clouds be produced by
an action of this kind, the presence of the light being an unnecessary
accident   ?
  The hydrobromic acid was permitted to enter the experimental tube
and remain in diffuse daylight for five minutes.    On darkening the room
and sending the electric beam through           it,
                                              the tube was optically empty.
Two minutes' action of the light    caused the clouds to appear, and they
afterwards went through the same variety of changes as before.
   No matter how long the hydrobromic acid was allowed to remain in the
tube, no action occurred until the luminous beam was brought into play.
The tube filled with the mixture of air, aqueous vapour, and hydrobromic
acid was permitted to remain for fifteen minutes      the dark. On send
                                                      in

minutes' action of the light developed the clouds as before.

the experimental tube, no diminution of its chemical energy was observed.
Permitting it to pass through a solution of hydrobromic acid, of the same
thickness, the chemical energy of the beam was wholly destroyed.             This
shows that   the vibrations  of the dissolved acid are synchronous with those of
the gaseous acid, and is a new proof that the constituent atoms of the
molecule, and not the molecule itself, is the seat of the absorption.
   Hydrochloric Acid. — The aqueous solution of this acid was also employed
and treated like the solution of hydrobromic acid.            I intend to invoke
the aid of an artistic friend in an effort to reproduce the effects ob
served during the decomposition, if such it be, of hydrochloric acid by
light. But artistic skill must, I fear, fail to convey a notion of them. The
cloud was of slow growth, requiring 15 or 20 minutes for its full develop
ment.     It was then divided into four or five sections, every adjacent two
of which were united by a slender axial cord. Each of these sections pos
sessed an exceedingly complex and ornate structure,       exhibiting ribs, spears,
funnels, leaves, involved scrolls, and iridescent fleurs-de-lis. Still the struc
ture of the cloud from beginning to end was perfectly symmetrical ; it was
a cloud  of revolution, its corresponding points being at equal distances from
the axis of the beam. There are many points of resemblance between the
clouds of hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid, and both are perfectly distinct
from anything     obtainable from the substances previously mentioned ; in
fact every liquid appears to have its own special cloud, varying only within
narrow limits from a normal type.         The formation of the cloud depends
rather upon its own inherent forces than upon the environment.               It is
true that, by warming or chilling the experimental tube at certain points,
extraordinary flexures and whirlwinds may be produced ; but with a per
fectly constant condition of tube, specific differences of cloud- structure are
revealed, the peculiarity of each substance stamping itself apparently upon
the precipitated vapour derived from its decomposition.
   When the beam before entering the experimental tube was sent through a
layer of the aqueous acid, thirteen minutes' exposure produced no action.
A layer of water being substituted for the layer of acid, one minute's ex
 posure sufficed to set up the decomposition.
   Hydriodic Acid. — The aqueous solution of this acid was also employed.
On first subjecting it to the action of light no visible effect was produced ;
but subsequent trials developed a very extraordinary one.            A  family re
semblance pervades the nebulae of hydriodic, hydrobromic,             and hydro
chloric acids.    In all three cases, for example, the action commenced
by the formation of two small clouds united by a cord ; it was very
slow,  and the growth       of the cloud in density and beauty very gradual.
The most vivid green and crimson that           I have yet  observed were exhi
bited by this substance in the earlier         stages  of the action.     The  de

velopment of the cloud was like that of an organism, from a more or
less formless mass at the commencement, to a structure of marvellous
complexity.           I  have seen nothing so astonishing as the effect obtained,
on the      28th     of  October,    with hydriodic acid. The cloud extended for
about 18 inches along the tube, and gradually shifted its position from the
end nearest the lamp to the most distant end.                        The portion quitted by
the cloud         proper    was filled by an amorphous haze, the decomposition
which was progressing lower down being here apparently complete.                              A
spectral cone turned its apex towards the distant end of the tube, and
from its circular base filmy drapery seemed to fall.                    Placed on the base of
the cone        was    an exquisite    vase,  from   the  interior  of which   sprung another
vase of similar shape ; over the edges of these vases fell the faintest clouds,
resembling spectral sheets of liquid.                 From the centre of the upper vase a
straight cord of cloud passed for some distance along the axis of the experi
mental tube, and at each side of this cord two involved and highly iridescent
 vortices were generated. The frontal portion of the cloud, which the cord
penetrated, assumed in succession the forms of roses, tulips, and sunflowers.
 It also passed through the appearance of a series of beautifully shaped
bottles placed one within the other.                 Once it presented the shape of a fish,
with     eyes,    gills, and feelers.     The light    was suspended      for several minutes,
and the tube and its cloud permitted to remain undisturbed in darkness.
On re-igniting the lamp, the cloud was seen apparently motionless within
the     tube    ;  much of its        colour had gone, but its beauty of form was
unimpaired.            Many of its parts were calculated to remind one of Gassiot's
discharges ;         but in complexity and, indeed, in beauty, the discharges would
not bear comparison with these arrangements of cloud.                       A friend to whom
I  showed the cloud likened it to one of those jelly-like marine organisms
which a film barely capable of reflecting the light renders visible.                        In
deed no other comparison is so suitable ; and not only did the perfect
symmetry of the exterior suggest this idea, but the exquisite casing and
folding of film within film suggested the internal economy of a highly
complex organism. The twoness of the animal form was displayed through
out, and no coil, disk, or speck existed on one side of the axis of the tube
that had not its exact counterpart at an equal distance on the other.                         I
looked in wonder at this extraordinary production for nearly two hours *.
     The precise conditions necessary to render the production of the effects
observed with hydrobromic, hydrochloric, and hydriodic acids a certainty
have not yet been determined.                  Air, moreover, is the only vehicle which
has been employed here.                 I hazard no opinion as to the chemical nature
of   these    reactions.      The    dry  acids,  moreover, I have not yet examined.
    * "  It  is as perfect as  if turned  in a lathe."   " It would
                                                                     prove exceedingly valuable
to pattern-designers," were remarks made by my assistants as they watched the experi
ment.      Mr. Ladd, who is intimately acquainted with the phenomena of the electric
discharge through rarefied media, remarked that no effect he had ever seen could compete
 in point of beauty and complexity with the appearance here imperfectly described.             I
mention this to indicate how the phenomena affected other eyes than mine.

            To the President, Council, and Fellows          of the Royal    Society.
     Gentlemen, — The time has arrived when        I must offer for your accept
ance a connected report      of the employment of the instruments intrusted to
me     for the special purpose of observing the late solar eclipse.
                                   1.   Plan of this Report.
    In framing this Report          I
                              propose in the first place to describe those in
struments sufficiently in detail to render unnecessary such explanations as
would otherwise be required in the course of my narrative, and then to
show the circumstances which preceded their actual employment on that
occasion.
                     2.   Description of Telescope and clockwork.
    The principal instrument is an equatorially mounted telescope, with a
lens of   inches aperture and 62 inches focal length.
             5                                              The mounting is
adapted to any latitude (except very low and very high ones), the polar
axis being a moveable tangent to the circular-arched roof of the chamber con
taining the clockwork. The latter, as well as the rest of the instrument, is by
Messrs. Cooke and Sons, of York, and    as understood from Mr. Cooke, of
                                                is,   I                                    a
somewhat novel description.      have not examined the mechanism closely,
                                        I
and therefore cannot describe itvery accurately but believe the peculiarity
                                                           ;   I
consists in the maintenance of continuous motion in fan-wheel, regulated by
                                                               a
a pendulum time-keeper acted on through       remontoir escapement, whereby
                                                      a
the irregularity of the surplus energy of the driving-weight, while     pre       is it
vented by the latter from interfering with the time-keeper at all,    modi           is
fied   in   its action on the tube by the former.           The    mean   rate of motion   is

 1868.]                          Solar Eclipse of 1868.                         103
 thus uniform      ; and though there is very perceptible irregularity in the actual
motion,     it  is not intermittent.   Thus, when the image of a star, for instance,
is brought       on the slit of the spectrum-apparatus, the spectrum is fitful in
appearance, if the slit is perpendicular to the direction of diurnal motion.
The mean motion may be easily regulated as in a pendulum-clock.                 The
motion is communicated by friction to the first of a series of wheels which
terminates in an endless screw working in the circumference of a large
toothed arc attached         to the hour-axis.     Motion imparted by hand to one
of these   wheels, grooved and provided for this purpose with an endless cord,
is thus communicated          directly to the tube without greater strain on the
clock    than is implied in overcoming the connecting friction.
                                    3. Its Mounting.
    The declination-axis terminates in a T-shaped head carrying two circular
 collars, in which the telescope-tube rests.         For convenience in mounting
and dismounting, these collars are attached to the T-head by nut and pins,
 so that they lift off with the tube, while the balance can be adjusted by
releasing their grasp of the tube when required. This is a great conveni
ence in a portable instrument.           The tube can be dismounted and taken
 indoors readily without assistance ; and the body of the instrument (which,
besides being far less easily handled, has cost hours of adjustment) may be
left under a suitable waterproof case when no observatory has been con
 structed.
                                       4. Its Stand.
    The stand is a strong wooden one, of remarkably firm construction, consi
 dering that it is of the three-legged portable kind.            Its upper surface
 is a stout brass annulus, on which the clock-chamber          rests  and rotates, if
 required, for adjustment in azimuth.          Two of the legs have foot-screws for
 adjusting the level and completing the adjustment for latitude.
                                 5.  Of the  Spectroscope.
    The spectroscope intended for use with the above telescope was con
 structed by Messrs. Simms, on a pattern or design supplied (I believe) by
 Mr. Huggins ; but its construction was too much delayed to allow of a
 practical     examination    of all its parts before packing.      It consists of a
 single   flint-glass    prism, of refracting angle 60°, contained in a cylin
 drical brass chamber, from which radiate three tubes in such directions
 as to fulfil the several purposes of (1) receiving the light to be analyzed,
 (2) delivering it after refraction and separation to the eye, and (3)
 admitting external light for reflection to the eye off the second surface
 of the prism. The first consists externally of a long connecting tube for
 insertion into the telescope in place of the ordinary eye-tube, where it is
 grasped in the focusing-slide. Internally it carries a smaller tube, carrying at
 one end a lens, and at the other, at the principal focal distance of the latter,
 a beautiful piece of workmanship by which a slit is obtained whose sides
                                                                          i 2

 approach each other equally.     Half the length of this slit may be obscured
 by  the  intervention of a right-angled prism, which reflects a side light
 through it if required.   The converging rays from the object-glass falling
 on the slit are admitted, while those which do not are stopped.   The former
 diverging again, as though from a luminous line, emerge from the next lens
 and fall on the prism as parallel rays, are independently refracted and dis
 persed in traversing      and after emergence are again condensed, but not

 of the above-mentioned tubes, and, forming                   a   spectrum in its focus, are
 viewed as such by an eyepiece.
    Means of measurement . — The direction of emergence defines the position
 in the spectrum  ; and the difference of direction   measured   isthe change         by
 of direction of the small telescope necessary to receive the several refracted
rays directly.    This change of direction           is   effected    and measured by a tan
gent screw, whose complete revolutions                are indicated          the march of a
                                                                               by
graduated scale (attached to the telescope-arm) over      circle marked on a
the circumference of the divided cylindrical head of the screw.   The posi
tion of the centre of motion of the telescope-arms,         should be said,it
though optically unimportant,    practically within the prism.

can be easily read     off by     a   very slight movement of the eye from the eye
piece.

curred in graduating the scale,    substituted one of my own making.
                                          I                                 As
I was fortunate in this,  may venture to describe how
                            I                             was effected.   The
                                                                          it
graduation required  was too fine for any  ink lines  could make  I     there              I
                                                                                           ;

                                                     ;        little ink, thesea
were instantly rendered visible.      then cut the card across the lines and
                                            I
glued the scale so  formed  over the old one with varnish, giving the whole                        a
dash of varnish for the sake of protection.   When dry                     I        was gratified to
find the graduation correspond well with the revolutions                   ;    for   it   was rather
a  delicate job, and did not suceeed without failures.
                      I
                  6.Graduated Scale in the Field of View.
   The third tube was intended to present in the field of view of the tele
scope last described, by external reflection off the second surface of the
prism, an illuminated image of photographed scale placed at one end of
                                           a

                                                a       The tube carries                           a
small moveable mirror outside. Upon this mirror was intended to be thrown
the light of small lamp, held n position by
              a                                  bent arm projecting from

the prism-chamber.     am sorry to say that this ingenious contrivance
                          I
proved, in my hands, more unsatisfactory than perhaps    should have done.it
As in not using   itdeparted from the letter of my instructions,
                      I                                           am in                I           a

       Reasons  for  discarding it. — In the first place, I never could with any
   kind of illumination train my eye to read the scale, partly because (whether
   from diffraction or irradiation) the image was never distinct, partly because
   the figures were illegible.     In the next place the little lamp was capricious ;
   either it refused to keep alight, or it boiled its own oil and melted off its
   handles, and ended by burning my fingers ! Thirdly, it was an additional
   weight at the eye-end of the telescope and involved a counterpoise when
   not in use, and an additional projection to be avoided in every movement
  — in the dark, —all implying additional distractions and sources of failure.
  Lastly, I found I could do very well without it — in the preliminary training
  which I underwent on examining the nebulas.              At the same time I must
  confess that   I made an oversight in trusting too much to the illuminating
  power of a hand-lamp, as will be apparent when I come to describe the
  actual eclipse-observations.
                         7. Smaller   Telescopes  and Polarizers.
      The  second   instrument supplied was an achromatic refractor of 3 inches
  aperture mounted with vertical and horizontal axes, the socket of the former
  being supported on a three-legged wooden stand, afterwards replaced by
  one of greater stability and more convenient height.          Two cells, containing
  a double-image prism and quartz plate, and the combination known as
  Savart's polariscope, respectively, were supplied for use with this telescope,
  but without any connecting adaptation.
                                8.  Hand Spectroscopes.
     The other instruments      were hand spectroscopes for direct vision, four     in
 number, which       I was directed to distribute according to circumstances.       It
 is needless to describe these       instruments, as they are well known ; but I
 must venture to correct a statement made at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic
 Society last December, that they have a magnifying-power of 8 or 10.                I
 do n't think they can be credited with a higher power than 3 ; and I was
 never able to recognize any of the peculiar characteristics of nebular or
 stellar spectra, the recognition of which might have been expected with the
 higher magnifying-power.
       9. Arrival in India and communication with Colonel Walker, R.E.
     Soon after my arrival in India        I communicated with Colonel Walker,
 with the object of receiving his instructions and of ascertaining whether he
 had decided on any plan, and, if not, to learn his views with reference to the
 assistance   I might    expect from the Survey Establishment.        The choice of
 a station of observation and the disposal of the instruments were also dis
cussed in the course of correspondence.
          10.   His Reply, and application to the Indian Government.
    Colonel Walker's action in this matter has been most gratifying.              He
immediately promised        me  the  assistance  of Lieut. ~W.  Maxwell   Campbell,

108                    Lieut.  J.  Herschel's Account    of the          [Nov. 19,
of the Bombay Engineers, one of the executive officers of our Department,
at that time engaged with myself and others in measuring a base-line in
the neighbourhood of Bangalore, for the polarization-observations or other
wise, as    I  might arrange with him.       He also placed at my future disposal
for the occasion the services of Lieut. Campbell's assistants, in case such
 should be required, at the same time presenting to the Indian Government
 an urgent proposal to give the     Royal Society's expedition both countenance
 and support.      I enclose a copy of the reply to this proposal, in which it will
 be observed that the Governor General in Council
                                                         " cordially approves," and
 " sanctions the necessary expenditure," and pledges the Government " to do
                                                                                    "
 everything in its power towards securing full and accurate observations
 on the occasion — a pledge fully redeemed by the ready assent given to
 more than one other application.          I am accordingly enabled to submit to
 your Society my present Report unaccompanied by any further appeal to
 your Treasurer.
         1 1.  Steps taken to procure local information     as to weather fyc.
      The local Governments were also applied to to give effect to the circula
  tion of a series of queries calculated to elicit local information as to probable
  climate at numerous points situated along the line of shadow.             This was
  the more necessary, as my position at Bangalore (in the very centre of the
  peninsula) seemed to give a so much greater range of choice.                In this
  respect   also a warm   interest was  evinced.  I wish I could   add that  the mass
  of correspondence which resulted was productive of an equal amount of
  valuable information.       The practical value was chiefly confined to extracts
  from rain-registers, the principal question relating to probable cloudiness or
  otherwise being perhaps necessarily replied to too vaguely to form legiti
  mate grounds for decision, owing in great measure to the fact that           August
  is one of the most uncertain months in the year, in that respect, in southern
  India.
      Rough notion of rain distribution across the peninsula in August. — On
   the whole, however, it appeared that across the whole width of the penin
   sula cloudy weather was to be expected at that season ; and there was
   therefore no choice but what        could be based   on rainfall.   The annexed
   diagram represents the impression (necessarily a vague one) remaining on
   my mind after considering the reports.        On the west coast anything up to
    25 inches a week has been recorded in August ; on the eastern slopes of

  1868.]                          Solar Eclipse    of 1868.                         109
  the western       Ghauts the fall     seems both smaller      and more regular, 6 to
  10 inches being the usual fall in the month of August. Further inland
  we come to a tract notorious for its dryness, several places, such as
  Gokak, Jamkandi, Bejapur, and others thereabouts, being favoured with
  occasional    showers only.        I attributed    this to the descent   into a lower
  and hotter     region of the prevailing       south-west current, the greater part
  of whose moisture had           been   deposited during the disturbance of strata
  caused by passing over the sudden barrier of the Ghauts.                  Beyond this
  again, eastwards, there is a gradual rise in the amount due in August,
  until towards the east coast the average fall is again 6 or 8 inches.
                                   12. Jamkandi selected.
    Jamkandi, the residence of           a native chief, was among the first to at
 tract   my    attention,    partly owing to the offers of assistance which were
 made in the name of the chief ; and this place was eventually selected
 for the advantages of climate which it appeared to offer.
         13. Distribution      of the Instruments.        Lieut. Campbell,  R.E.
    In the meantime the distribution             of the instruments was attended to.
 The smaller       telescope  with    polarizing eyepieces was made over to Lieut.
 Campbell with a copy of the
                                      " Instructions," in the full assurance that he
 would acquaint himself with the theory and practice necessary to turn them
 to account.      I annex a copy of his Report, the perusal of which will show
 that the instrument was in good hands.                It is much to be regretted that
 he was not permitted to give more practical evidence of the forethought
 which characterized his prepa
 rations.    I  am also sorry       that
he has not given a fuller descrip
tion of the ingenious contri
 vance which he designed and
constructed for the ready appli
cation of the analyzers to the
eyepiece. The annexed rough
sketch (from memory) may help
to give a correct idea of the contrivance.
    I apprehend that in the event of fair weather he would be able to
settle the question of polarity readily, and would have leisure to make use
of  a hand spectroscope as well.           One of these instruments also was there
fore made over to him.
                                14.   Captain Haig,      R.E.
    Colonel Walker had further consented to allow another of our executive
officers   (Captain Haig, R.E.) to leave his regular duties for a time if he
wished.      As he was stationed at Poona and could avail himself of the
railway   as  far as the border of the shadow's path,           I offered him, and he
accepted, the charge of another of the hand spectroscopes.

                  Captain Henry, Superintendent at Bombay.
  Lastly,      I communicated         with the   agents   of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company at Calcutta and Madras Bay, and eventually intrusted the remain
ing two      spectroscopes    to the latter    for employment on board two vessels,
outward- and homeward-bound,                 which would probably be on the track at
the right time.

                                          Spectroscopes.
   It was     necessary,     however, not only to distribute these instruments,         but
also to provide              being intelligently employed in unpractised
                          for their
hands.        I
            accordingly drew up a short memorandum with the object of
putting it into the power of those interested to understand as much of the
subject as seemed necessary, and of suggesting the probable appearances
which might be presented.      A copy of the pamphlet accompanies this
Report.
             1 7.    Examination    of Nelulee   as bearing on the main subject.
   While these arrangements were in progress I was myself engaged with
the equatorial in the examination of the southern nebulae, to which I de
voted as much time as the duties of my profession enabled me to do. The
weather was very favourable in March (towards the middle of which month
the base-line was completed), in April, and until the middle of May ; but
from that time until the latter end of June, when the instrument had to be
despatched, I hardly got a single observation, owing to the setting-in of
the south-west monsoon.    I congratulated myself on having been able to
use the fine nights we had had.   The results, showing the nature of the
spectra of about fifty nebula:, have been already communicated to your
Secretary ; there is therefore no occasion to enter into particulars on this
subject here, except as bearing on instrumental peculiarities not previously
touched upon, and as suggesting the probability that a considerable fami
liarity with the special kind of observation had been acquired, as well as
with the individual instrument.      Those who are acquainted with the spec
troscope   as applied to a  telescope will remember that it involves several
additional screws to be attended to, and that the finding of these mecha
nically in the dark is no inconsiderable perplexity until habit has taught
 the way.           But this by the way.
                          18. The Finder, and the trouble        it gave.
   The finder attached             to the telescope
                                         has a very low magnifying-power
 and decidedly bad definition            — so
                                   much so that even Saturn can scarcely be
 recognized   with it ; none but the most conspicuous nebula? and clusters
 are visible ; I have looked in vain for the planetary nebula in Lyra with
 it,though    was certainly in the field
                    it                   and of all the planetary nebulae in
                                                  ;

" risible  in finder."      It was therefore almost always necessary to find with
the principal, by the setting ; and afterwards either to exchange the light
eyepiece for the heavy spectroscope (removing at the same time a coun
terpoise) without disturbing the direction, if possible, or to take the bear
ings of the most conspicuous stars visible in the finder.       But as there never
was and never could be any certainty that in the act of insertion a disturb
ance sufficient to displace the image from the position the slit should oc
cupy would not take place, the latter method became the surest, if the most
troublesome.        [The connecting-tube, I should remark, cost me, literally,
days    of worry   and   grinding before I could induce it to slide in and out at
all.]    If after these precautions the result of a blind search was negative,
the whole had to be done de novo. What with removing and replacing the
 spectroscope, inserting eyepieces and counterpoises, setting the readings,
 searching in both finder and telescope, winding the driving-clock over and
 over again, in endless combination, all by the light of a bull's-eye lantern,
 perhaps without catching a single spectrum all night, I often found four
 or five hours' observing (?) more fatiguing than a long walk.
                                        I
     It may appear strange that did not replace the finder by a better
 telescope.     I can only say that India is not England, and Bangalore is not
 London.      The idea did not occur to me as a practical one, and I was ner
 vously afraid of making any alteration which might leave me worse off than
 I was. A bad finder was after all no great matter, for the eclipse and the
 nebulae could wait.                              I
                              At the same time wish now that my finder had
 been more serviceable as a telescope for I got ; but a poor sight of the eclipse
 with it.
                     19.   Further preparations, Observatory,   fyc.
     To return to my preparations.          In the utter absence of any precise
 knowledge of the appearances which would be presented, but anticipating
 a faint spectrum      as the most probable,     all my preliminary arrangements
  had in view as complete an exclusion of external light as practicable.         A
  wooden frame was constructed for an observatory with a revolving roof, the
  latter being covered with painted canvas. A large black curtain was pro
  vided, through the centre of which were to be passed the observing-end of
  the telescope and finder, and the declination-clamp and slow-motion screw.
  A   segment    of the octagonal observing-chamber      would thus be in a great
  measure protected from the light which might          be expected to enter the
  limited aperture in the roof.
                         20. The Expedition leaves Bangalore.
      The instruments, observatory, and camp-equipage started from Bangalore
   on the 7th of July, and reached on the 7th of August — a creditable march of
   390 miles in 31 days (including halts) in the height of the rainy season.
   My subsequent experience of the state to which so-called "made" roads
   may be reduced, in these parts of India, by a few days' rain, afforded grounds

for self-congratulation that the journey was accomplished as quickly as it
was.       I        on the 1st of August, and reached Jamkandi on the
               followed
morning of the 14th.    The journey was so exceedingly disagreeable a one
that I shall say no more about it.
                                   21.      Arrival at Jamkandi.
     By the evening of the 14th the observatory was put together and the
telescope      &c. ready for adjustment.
                                             22. Prospects.
     I   was surprised and considerably disappointed to learn that the weather
had been for some days past as cloudy as                  I
                                          found it. 1 had left heavy rain
behind me at Belgaum, and found none at Jamkandi certainly ; but the
sky was thick with passing cloud.                    I
                                      was told that it was quite unusual,
and that it could not last ; but by the morning of the 1 8th both Lieut.
Campbell and myself had made up our minds not to be disappointed (if
we could help            it), should   we be denied more than a few glimpses.
                         23. Bad weather not unusual at this season.
     I learned      afterwards     that at some time or other at that season a burst
usually takes place on the Ghauts, causing                    a   sudden and violent flood in all
the rivers, and that the influence of this extends beyond their limits and
occasions the fortnight of cloudy skies and scanty rainfall which such places
as Jamkandi enjoy once a year. This periodical flood had occurred be
tween the time of our camp's and our own arrival, and we were now expe
riencing the cloudy             season.       It   was very unfortunate,     but could hardly
have been foreseen.    Not only our own party,                        but others in the neigh
bouring district of Bejapur were unlucky.    Three days later the whole
aspect of the country was changed.   The rivers subsided ; the heat which
we had expected, but missed, began to make itself felt ; the villanous black
soil hardened   and the natives said confidently that their rainy season was
                     ;
past, and that the rivers would not rise again till next year.
                                 24. Lieut. CampbelFs Station.
     On the       1 7th Lieut. Campbell selected his position on a hill about a mile
distant.          We had agreed that the character of the clouds was such that a
greater separation was unnecessary, owing to their uniform distribution                      and
regular current.
                         25. Final preparations.
     I
     come at length to the more interesting part of my narrative.    The
three days and nights which preceded the event were occupied in adjusting
the polar axis, in examining every adjustment that could or could not
require     it,
           in exchanging the broad coarse pointer which     had used for       I
night work for    stout but sharp needle, in going over and over again
                         a                                                                     a
mental review of the probable appearances and the possible contingencies
which might arise. The three months' disuse, too, since had to give up theI

nebulse, made fresh exercise necessary. Among other things,                I concluded
not to alter the pendulum, long ago adjusted for sidereal time. The difference
of rate being only       1 in 365 for mean time (and 1 in 388 for solar time at
that date), the telescope would only gain on the sun by less than one
second during the 5% minutes of totality ; so that even supposing I
should wish to keep it directed on one and the same point the whole time,
the practical effect would only be that that point would move along the
slit by perhaps ^ part of its visible length (estimating that length, or
the width of the field, at 51). I mention this as the " Instructions
                                                                                " direct
the adjustment to apparent solar time.
                    26. Disuse    of the Barlow Lens accounted/or.
    In   one other     respect, too,    I   must plead guilty to a departure from
 the letter of those instructions, which hardly perhaps needs justifica
 tion  ;  I allude to the disuse of the Barlow lens.            My reason was prin
 cipally this, that its insertion keeps the observer some 6 inches further
 from the body of the instrument, and, besides involving a complete dis
 turbance of equilibrium, puts him out of reach of the declination screw —
 results which    I  could not but think had not been contemplated.             I should
 add that    I  was quite    confident    of the practicability of catching a promi
 nence, without having its image doubled in size, though I was by no
 means so sure that I could spare any of the light, which would be reduced
  one-fourth.
     27. Care in adjusting the Pointer during the approach              of the Moon.
     During the     advance   of the moon, and up to the last available moment, I
  paid particular attention to the collimation (I use the word in its true
  sense of aim) of the needle-point, being perhaps unnecessarily anxious to
  avoid my old difficulty of finding my object in the spectroscope.                  The
  sharp cusps were well suited to this purpose, and the sun-spots were
  good tests.      I had been fortunate in getting the pointer very exact, and
  was therefore not troubled with any collimation-error           to allow for.
                           28. Spectrum at the Moon's centre.
     While thus employed         I had occasion to remark that at the centre of the
  moon, some nine or ten minutes before totality, the intensity of the solar
  spectrum was much about the same as that of the full moon.
                            29. Measurement      of Solar Lines.
     Intensity of Spectrum of Limb at D. — The principal                solar lines were
  measured at intervals during the advancing eclipse.             A few minutes before
  totality, in   going over these lines for the last   time,  the slit being as wide as
  was allowable for full sunlight, i. e. very narrow,        I  recorded an increasing
  brilliancy   in the spectrum in the neighbourhood of         D,  so great in fact as to
  prevent any measurement of that line till an opportune cloud moderated the
  light. I am not prepared to offer any explanation of this. The clouds were

   arranged in two distinct strata, the lower one containing masses hurrying
    past with the monsoon-current at no great height, the upper consisting of
   light, thinly scattered cirri showing very little motion.             It is conceivable
   that the latter may have been obstinately interposed until the time when                 I
   remarked the recorded brilliancy ; but I cannot say that I should be satisfied
   with such    an explanation.

       Whiteness                        —
   crescent, as seen in the finder, was apparently intensified as it grew narrower.
   Possibly this was the effect of contrast with the darkening background ; for
   at this time   I began   to be annoyed by the appearance of five or six phantom
   crescents, which seemed to be trying to rival the legitimate one.           I  imagine   I
   was indebted to the dark glass for these apparitions            ; but  whatever    called
   them up, they most effectually confused the view of the closing scene ;
   whatever might otherwise have been seen at this stage was swamped in
   the confusion.
                     30. Restlessness during approach          of shadow.
      Up to within about        ten minutes   of totality I was every now and     then out
  side watching progress through           one or the other    of two smaller    telescopes
  of moderate power, one of which            I had borrowed from the chief, who in
  dulges a taste for the possession of English manufactures to an extraordi
  nary degree.       I noticed no marked inequalities of surface in the advancing
  limb, nor any bluntness of the cusps ; but I must allow that I was not in
  a sufficiently    composed state of mind to observe critically anything not
 bearing directly on the special problem before me.                I was impressed with
 a notion that everything must be subordinated, in my case, to the requisite
 freedom of attention when totality commenced, and was specially anxious
 to save my eyesight.          I studiously avoided looking at the sun except under
 cover of a cloud ; and though           I  had provided the telescopes with gradu
 ated smoked glasses,          I  was nervously afraid to look through them too
 long or too intently     —   all which can only be understood by referring to what
 has been said about the absence of any foreknowledge of the impending
 revelation.      My last view of external appearances showed nothing very
striking — a few      deeply neutral-tinted patches of sky in the zenith, and an
increasing gloominess in all directions, being all the phenomena whose im
pression has outlived the excitement of the shortlived minutes which
ensued.       I reentered the observatory, and retired behind my black curtain
to watch the event.
     3 1. Gentlemen,     I  have thus far endeavoured to lay before you, as far as
possible,    in  an   orderly manner, an outline of the preliminary arrange
ments for the employment of your Society's instruments, and a sketch of my
proceedings up to the hour of the eclipse.              If in so doing I have been un
necessarily tedious, I would ask you to remember that these few pages but
faintly represent the months of anxious study and preparation which have
passed since     I  accepted     the responsibility  involved in the charge of an ex

pedition deputed by the illustrious body 1 have now the honour of ad
dressing — a responsibility more engrossing, it may be, but not lessened, by
the specific but novel character of the proposed object of the expedition.
I proceed now to describe how far that object has been attained ; and here
I feel that I cannot       well indulge in too great       a   minuteness of detail.
            32. Relative positions     of Pointer, Slit, and           Sun's Limb.
   The spectroscope may be inserted, and employed with its slit in any di
rection perpendicular to the optical axis of the telescope. It is therefore
competent to the observer to place the slit perpendicular or tangential to
the sun's circumference at any point ; and there can be no doubt that, were
the observations conducted at leisure, it would be desirable to examine the
whole circumference         in both positions     ;   but the operation of turning the
spectroscope is not so very simple a one but that the advantages and disad
vantages of any such proceeding require to be well considered where time
is of the first importance.  I decided on employing the slit in one direction
only, that which corresponded with the diurnal motion.     It so happened
that this corresponded nearly with the direction of the relative motion of
the sun and moon, so that the widest part of the crescent could be made to
fall nearly perpendicularly across the slit. The needle (in the finder) and
its point accurately represented the direction and centre respectively of the
slit ; therefore, when the needle-point touched the sun's limb at the centre
of the crescent, a solar spectrum of definite width appeared in the field,
of which            (the right-hand) continued stationary, while the other
               one edge
                                                                    it,

decreasing visibly in width.

    About   a   minute's breadth remained.        A    few seconds        more and   it   would
vanish suddenly. Whatever spectrum the corona could show must then be

point, and in another instant             I

attributed       to haste and unsteadiness of hand, still more to the natural
difficulty of measuring intermittent glimpses ; but I am bound to confess
that these causes were supplemented by a failure less excusable.           I have
no idea how those five minutes passed so quickly ! Clouds were evidently
passing continually ; for the lines were only visible at intervals — not for one-
half the time, certainly — and not always bright ; but still ought to have          I
measured them all.      My               failure was in insufficient
                                                       illuminating power ;
but why, I cannot tell.              I
                           never experienced any difficulty of the kind with
the nebulae, which required that                   I
                                   should flash in light suddenly over and
over again.          I
               had found the hand-lamp the surest way ; but it failed me
here in great measure.     The red line must have been less vivid than the
orange ; for after a short attempt to measure                    it,
                                                     passed on to secure the

before the reillumination of the field told me that the sun had reappeared on
the other limb. These readings were called out, as those of the solar lines
had been, to my recorder    and was only afterwards that
                                    ;         it              compared them.     I
 I  need not dwell on the feelings of distress and disappointment which
I experienced on realizing the fact that the long-anticipated opportunity was
 gone, and, as       it    seemed        to me then, wasted.         I     seemed       to have       failed
 entirely.  Almost mechanically     directed the telescope to the bright limb,

 again awakened by the near coincidence, as it seemed, of the line F with

    1 consider        that there can be no question that the orange line was
identical with D, so far as the capacity of the instrument to establish any
such identity is concerned.
                                37.  Of the Blue Line     : doubtful.
    I   also consider that the identity of the blue line with F is not esta
 blished      ; on the contrary,       I  believe that the former is less refracted than
 F, but not much.
                              38.    Of the Red Line : uncertain.
    With regard to the              red line, I hesitate very much in             assigning an
 approximate place : B and C represent the limits                     ; it   might have been
 near C     ;   I doubt its being so far as B ; I am not prepared to hazard any
 more definite opinion about it.               Its colour was a bright red. This esti
 mate of its place is absolutely free from any reference to the origin of the
 lines C and       F.
                    39. Subsequent mental aberration : not unusual.
     It  is a fact not unworthy of notice that in all the accounts of eclipses,
 written soon after the event, which I have read, the record hurries rapidly
 to a close after the sun has reappeared ; the reason, no doubt, is that a
 reaction takes place after the excitement of witnessing the actual eclipse,
 and phenomena which might be noticed after, quite as well as before, pass
 unregarded on that account.                For my part I was surprised to find how
 utterly    indifferent    I  felt  to  the   appearance of things when I came out of
 my observatory.           I am almost ashamed to confess that I went straight to
 my tent, and tried to write down what I had seen, instead of going to the
 telescope to watch for what still might be seen.                 It never even occurred to
 me to remove        the  spectroscope     and  use the fine telescope I had at command.
                  40. Afterconsideration of the phenomena witnessed.
    I  have not quite exhausted the statement of my observations, though

 118                      Lieut.   J.  Herschel's Account of the              [Nov. 19,
what   f have    still  to state was rather the result    of subsequent reflection than
of actual cognizance        at the time.     I said that the prominence was situated
close  to  the  needle-point.        I estimate   its position as at the east point, a
few degrees to the left of the lowest, of the sun's limb.             Its form was that
of  a projecting      finger slightly curved to the southward, and its height
nearly 2'.      The slit was at right angles to the hour-circle, and therefore
perpendicular to the sun's limb at this point.                A vertical section (so to
speak) of the prominence was therefore admitted through the slit.                 It ap
pears, then, that the length of the lines corresponded with the height of the
prominence, being limited (as in the case of the spectrum of the section of
the crescent) on the one hand (the left) by the advancing moon's limb
at the centre of the field, and on the other by the natural summit of the
prominence, or flame, as we are now entitled to call it.
   Spectrum      of    Corona not seen.     — Beyond this summit the light of the
corona was free to enter         ; it  was also free to enter  with that of the flame   ;
but  I   saw   the spectrum of the latter only.            I thence conclude that the
spectrum of the corona was a faint solar one,             —  a conclusion quite in ac
cordance with the other characteristics of this phenomenon, such as the
radiated appearance and the evidence from polarity, indicating a central
source of light. With regard to the latter, it is clear that the light of the
corona is polarized in planes passing through the sun's centre (as the gist
of Lieut. Campbell's Report), and therefore that the corona shines mainly
by reflected light.        At the same time it is possible that the absence of a
spectrum of the corona at this particular spot may have been accidental.
I have since     heard that the corona was particularly feeble at this point.
I had no opportunity of studying the corona myself.                After first catching
sight of the eclipse in the finder, I never left the spectroscope but once,
when a long interval of cloudiness sent me to the finder to make sure.                 I
then caught a few seconds' glimpse again, and remarked a red blot (I
recognized no shape) of a prominence at about the north point, or rather
to the west of it.
41. Remarks        on the ease      with which the lines might        be measured, and
                          suggestions for future observations.
   I  have    now a few remarks to add which may be of use to future ob
servers,   if not of    any present value.       It is difficult to say what might or
might not have         been done but for the clouds ; but I am pretty certain
                                I
that (even labouring, as was, under the difficulty of bad illumination) not
only might all three lines have been satisfactorily measured, but time
would have sufficed for further examination.                  The course which that
examination should take is a question which it is of the highest importance
for an observer to decide on previously.              I believe I was right in using a
narrow slit to begin with, not anticipating such a totally dark field ; but            I
should not do so again ; or if I did, with the object of getting exact mea
sures of the three principal lines, I should be prepared to widen the slit

to look for faint ones, the positions of which I should estimate with re
ference to those three.         I should then direct the telescope at the brightest
part of the corona, taking very good care to prefer a part free from any
appearance of sierra, and if possible near the east or west points, so that
the slit might admit a vertical section.           Assuming that the corona does
not emit tosochromatic light — if I may be allowed to coin a word to indi
cate definite but unspecified colours, both in respect of number and tint
(or pitch) — of very distinct character, the spectrum of such a vertical slice
might indicate by its varying width that the light was not uniformly con
stituted.      Another point to be ascertained is whether all flames are con
stituted    alike.   This would require a more or less rapid glance at the
spectra of several.       I have spoken of " the three principal lines " because
J   saw no others.      I have, however, heard rumours of a greater number
 having been seen by other observers, whether of equal brilliancy or not
 I do not know ; but it inclines me to enforce the statement I have already
 made of " three vivid lines — no more," as seen with a narrow slit. 1 had
no suspicion whatever of the presence of any but those three ; and as I
 first saw them they were as sharp and bright as one could well wish to see.
 Whether the prominence which I looked at was the same as those in which
 more than three lines were seen        I  do not know.
        42. Lieut. CampbelFs Observations satisfactory in their result.
     The determination of the polarization-plane of the corona is as satisfac
 tory as can be desired, and Lieut. Campbell's account is so clear that I have
 little to say about   it.   It  is to be regretted that he did not see the effect of
 polarization all round     at the same     time, with a power low enough to in
clude the whole of the phenomena ;           but the view fortunately obtained with
the higher power remedies this in great measure by showing what would
have been seen at points 90° distant from that which he describes.
                 43. Results with Hand Spectroscopes unknown.
     With regard to the hand spectroscopes I have scarcely any report to
make.       Lieut. Campbell had no opportunity.          Capt. Haig has sent no re
port.     Neither have I heard anything of one of the two sent to sea. The
only    record  I have received is that of Capt. Rennoldson, of the ' Rangoon,'
P. & O. Co.'s Steam Ship, which I enclose.            He mentions having seen with
the spectroscope a prominence not seen by others with (I presume) ships'
glasses of greater power.          This is difficult to understand, except on the
supposition that the light of the corona was weakened by dispersion, while
that of the flame was not, or not in so great a degree.          Should it turn out
that the prominence he describes was a reality, it is barely possible that
the above explanation may be the true one ; in which case it suggests the
possibility of seeing the prominences with a heavy battery of prisms when
the sun is not eclipsed, especially if they are made of yellow glass ; nay,
even   of seeing them, without the help of dispersion, through a medium
calculated to stop all light but that of the sodium flame.

                                                     J. Herschel,      Lieut. R.E.
    Bungnloro, Sept. 1868.
                         LIEUT. CAMPBELL'S REPORT.
     "I   was deputed to accompany       Lieut. Herschel    on his expedition  to ob
serve the phenomena of the total eclipse, and to use the instruments sup
plied by the Royal Society for the observation of polarized light in the
 corona and red flames.
     "The instruments in question        were   as follows: — A telescope of 3-inch
aperture, mounted on a         rough double axis, admitting of motion in azimuth
and altitude by hand only, unaided by any appliance for clamping and
 slow motion.       The telescope was provided with three eyepieces of magni
fying- powers     27, 41, and 98 ; and with it were furnished two analyzers for
                                                          '
polarized light, viz. a double-image prism and a Savart's polariscope.'
     " The first gives two images of the object viewed, which, when polarized
 light   is present, become      strongly coloured with complementary tints, by
 whose changes, according to the position in azimuth of the analyzer, the
 plane of polarization may be found.
      " The second shows the presence of polarized light by the formation,
  across the image     of the object viewed, of coloured      bands, which    alter in
  arrangement and intensity according to the position of the polariscope with
  reference to the plane of polarization, and hence afford a means of arriving
  at a knowledge of the latter.
      "With    the former, slight polarization would probably be more readily
  recognized at a glance ; while with the latter the plane of polarization could
  be more easily and accurately determined.
      " To   carry these arms I had a pair of jointed arms constructed, so at
  tached by a collar and screw to the eye-tube of the telescope as to admit
  of the eyepiece being changed. Each arm carried one of the analyzers in
  a cell,   in which  a rotatory   motion could be given for analyzing purposes.
       "Either analyzer could in this       way be brought    instantly into position
   before the eyepiece of the telescope, or both could be turned aside and the
   telescope used by itself at pleasure.
       " Immediately behind the apparatus a circular piece of cardboard of
   about 12 inches diameter and neatly graduated was firmly attached to the
   eye-tube, and to each analyzer was affixed a long pointer by which its

azimuth could be referred to the graduations on the card circle, should
measures of position or change of azimuth appear desirable.
   "I   was also furnished with a hand spectroscope for direct vision.
    " The    point chosen for my station was on the northern slope of a low
range of hills, about 1£ mile W. by S. of Jamkandi.                       The flatness of the
hills on top offered no point from which an uninterrupted view could be
obtained in all directions        ;  and from my station I only had a view of the
northern half of the distant horizon over the plains extending in that di
rection for many miles, above the level of which I was raised about
200   feet,
    "Early     on the morning       of the 18th    I  proceeded to the spot, having pre
viously   sent up the instruments and a tent             for shelter in case of necessity.
    " At sunrise     the sky was beautifully clear, except in the northern horizon,
where there were low clouds lying over the river Kistna.                          There was a
gentle breeze from S.W. by W.                A little later light flocculent clouds began
to rise and form in an arch overhead from west to east, continuing to in
crease as the morning wore on ; then a light scud set in, and turned gra
dually into broken masses of thick dark clouds.
    " Before    the commencement of the eclipse               I   took observations for time
with a small theodolite, from which              I computed the error of my chrono
meter (a mean time one by M'Cabe) to be lh 14m 5o'-5 fait on local appa
rent time ; and by that quantity             I have accordingly corrected all observed
chronometer times in the statements of time which follow.
    "I observed       the first    contact, which took            place at 7b  45m   13« (local
apparent      time),   about    1 5°   from the vertex      l    after which   I watched    the
progress of the eclipse, and noted the times of occultation of three sun-
spots.     No. 1 was a large double ragged spot, No. 2 a small well-defined
one, No. 3 also double, but not so large or distinct as No. 1. After tota
lity I saw a fourth       spot very near the sun's limb.
   " During       the progress of the eclipse          I  observed no unevenness in the
moon's limb, nor any want of sharpness in the cusps, using magnifying-
power 27.
   " The following notes were taken on the spot : —
      At   first contact.    Sun very slightly obscured by clouds.
      At    8" 0m. Clouds thick, and gathering from S.W. and                       W.    Wind

      At   8h 10m. Clouds         overhead,    increasing        and thickening     and rising
         steadily from west.
      At   8h 20m.     Sky nearly entirely overcast            ;   clouds thickest   in neigh
         bourhood of sun.
      At   8" 25D.     A clear break.
      At   8" 30m.     I thought     I  could discern very faintly the dark limb of
         the moon beyond          that   of the sun ; and at this time, making allow
         ance    for the general cloudiness,         I did not perceive any        decrease  of
         light    on the landscape.

light) and extended beyond each cusp to a distance nearly, if not quite, 15'.

ascertained orally.]      The corona became vi
sible immediately after, between the dark limb of the moon and the bright
line.   The corona did not appear so bright as the line, the brilliance and
whiteuess of the light of which was most striking. This was seen through
a  highly smoked glass.         At this period, probably not more than          3 to 5
seconds     before totality ensued, a thick cloud shut out everything, and
the rest of the phenomenon was only seen fitfully through openings in the
clouds, for an aggregate period which         I   estimate at somewhat less than
half that of totality.
    "This alternate appearance and disappearance troubled             me greatly, and
gave rise to nervousness and excitement       ;  for owing  to   the imperfect mount
ing of my telescope I was apt to lose my place whenever the light was cut
off by clouds, and to waste the precious moments of clearness in finding it
again.
    " On   the first opportunity after the commencement of the eclipse I turned
on the double-image        prism with the eyepiece of 27 magnifying-power,
as recommended in the Instructions, which gave a field of about 45' dia
meter.      A most decided difference of colour      was at once apparent between
the two images of the corona ; but        I  could not make certain of any such
difference    in the case   of a remarkable  horn- like protuberance, of a bright-
red colour, situated about 210 degrees from the vertex, reckoned (as           I  have
done in all cases) with reference to the actual, not the inverted image, and
with direct motion.        I then removed the double-image prism and applied
the Savart's polariscope, which gave bands at right angles to a tangent to
the limb, distinct     but not bright, and with little, if any, appearance of
colour.      On turning the polariscope in its cell the bands, instead of appear
ing to revolve on their own centre, passing through various phases of
brightness, arrangement, &c., travelled bodily along the limb, always at
 right angles thereto, and without much change in intensity, or any at all in
 arrangement.
    "The point at which they seemed strongest was                 about 140° from the
 vertex, and I recorded them as black centred.
    " Believing    that with a higher power and a smaller field I should find it
 easier to fix my attention on one point     of the corona and observe the phases

 of the bands at that point,      I  changed eyepieces applying that of -1 1 power.
 With this eyepiece the first clear instant showed the bands much brighter
 than before, coloured, and as tangents to the limb at a point about 200°
 from the vertex ; but before         I could determine anything further a cloud
 shut out the view, and a few seconds later a sudden rush of light told that
 the totality was over, though it was difficult to believe that five minutes had
 flown by since its commencement.
     "I experienced a strong feeling of disappointment and want of success ;
 the only points on which        I  can speak with any confidence being as fol
 lows : — ( 1 ) When using the double-image prism, the strong difference of
 colour of the two images of the corona, and the absence of such difference
                                                                      '
 in the  case of the most prominent red flame.          (2) With the Savart's po-
             '
 lariscope the bands from the corona were decided ; with a low power they
 were wanting in intensity and colour ; excepting alternate black and white,
 making it difficult to specify the nature of the centre ; and their position
 was at right angles to the limb, extending over about 30° of the circumfe
 rence. When the polariscope was turned the bands travelled bodily round
 the limb without other change in position or arrangement, as if indeed they
 were revolving round the centre of the sun as an axis. With a higher
 power, when a smaller portion of the corona was embraced, the bands were
 brighter, coloured, and seen in a different position, viz. tangents to the
limb.
    "The     appearance observed with a low power seems exactly what might
be expected, supposing the bands to be brightest at every point when at
 right angles to the limb, in which case the bands growing into brightness at
each succeeding point of the limb would distract attention from those fading
away at the points passed over as the analyzer revolved.
    " After totality was over the clouds cleared away somewhat, and 1
 watched the eclipse till its conclusion,       noting the times of emersion of the
 spots and of last contact.
    " A light    shower fell at 9.30.
    " During     totality several stars and planets were seen by those who were
with   me  ;   and a fowl which I had placed near me, out of curiosity, was ob
served to compose itself to sleep.          It was at no time so dark as I had ex
pected : after the total phase had commenced I read the chronometer and
wrote notes in pencil without difficulty; and the light of a bull's-eye lantern
when thrown on my paper appeared somewhat dull.
    " The brilliance of the light of the corona when it burst out through the
openings in the clouds astonished me.            Also the very gradual decrease of
light before totality, and the wonderful         flood of light which followed the
instant of the sun's reappearance (though behind a cloud) were very
striking.
    " 1 was too much occupied in watching the position of the sun, so as not
to lose an instant of the precious intervals of clearness, to see much of the
general effect.        I had no opportunity of using the hand spectroscope.

scopes sent out by the Royal Society had been entrusted to Captain
Perrins ; but as his ship at the time of the eclipse was about 20 miles north
of the track of the total phase, he had no opportunity of using it for the
observations contemplated. He thus describes the appearance at the time
of greatest obscuration : —
    "That portion of the sun remaining uneclipsed consisted of a narrow
streak (in shape like a crescent) of its upper left limb, in size about ^ part
of its diameter. The light emitted from this was of a very peculiar de
scription and difficult to describe, being at the same time extremely bril
liant and yet most remarkably pale. The high sea running appeared like
huge waves of liquid lead, and the ghastly paleness of the light thrown
upon it and all around revealed a scene which, for its weird-like effect, it
would be as impossible to depict as it is to describe."
    The slender crescent showed in the spectroscope several dark lines, as
was to be expected.

   The weather     was cloudy throughout,      but the clouds were thin, so much
so as to allow two or three stars to be seen during the time of totality.
   The corona exhibited itself quite suddenly on the instant of first totality.
It presented the appearance of a golden-yellow brightness of no very in
tense  brilliancy. It disappeared as suddenly as it appeared, on the first
sign of the retiring sun.           The flames or prominences became visible
simultaneously     with  the  corona.

about 25° to the left    or  east of the lowest point, with a smaller green pro
minence, also in contact with the moon, a little distance to the east of it.

    Sir, — I  have the honour,      in continuation    of my letter of the 20th
ultimo, to inform you that       I   have this morning obtained evidence that
 the solar prominences are merely the expansion, in certain regions, of an
envelope which surrounds       the sun on all sides.        I  may add that other

I.  "Account of Explorations              by the Swedish      Arctic Expedition        at
        the close of the Season 1868, in a Letter to the President."                  By
        Professor A.      Nordenskiold.          Communicated by the President.
        Received November 20, 1868.
                                                             Troniso, October 23, 1868.
    Sir, —The       second geographical part of our expedition anchored a few
days ago in the harbour of Tromso, after a difficult and adventurous
autumn cruise of a month in the polar basin north of 80° lat. ; and as
these regions were never before visited in such a late season, I hope that our
observations will be of interest for the arctic men of Great Britain, as contri
buting to settle some points of the polar question recently much debated.
    According to the plan adopted for the Swedish Expedition, five of its
naturalists returned, in the middle of September, to Tromso with one of the
small ships that brought coal to our depot at Amsterdam Island, and the
                   ' Sofia,'
same day the                 with the remaining part of the expedition (consisting
of  v. Otter, Berggren, Nystrbm,         Palander, Lemstrom, and myself), steamed
northward      for Seven      Islands, where it was our intention to wait for a fa
vourable occasion to go further.             But finding these islands so surrounded
by   ice  that no   anchorage     was accessible, we were compelled to abandon this
plan and go directly northward, following a tolerably large opening in the
 pack.     After a cruise of some days among the ice we, on the 19th of Sep
tember, at     I7i°   long, east of Greenwich, reached 81° 42' N. Lat. ; but, as
may be seen by the adjoined photograph, the ice further northward was
 so closed that it was impossible even for a boat to advance.              We turned
 westward, in vain looking for another practicable opening.             Following the
 border of the pack, we were, on the 24th September, at a longitude of 2° W.
 already south of 79° lat., after often having passed fields of drift-ice covered
 with particles of earth, which seems to indicate that land is to be met with
 further northward. Despairing of finding the ice westward more favourable,
 and anxious to make a new survey later in the autumn of the position of
 the ice-field between 0° and 20° long., we returned to our coal-depot.
    North of 80° 30' the season was already far more advanced than one
 would presume from the observations at Spitzbergen during the first part
 of September. The temperature of the air being —6° to —8° (Centigrade)
 below zero, the surface of the sea was, when calm, covered by a layer of new
 ice more than an inch           thick ; and after sunset the obscurity, increased
 by   constant   intense   frost-rime,  made the sailing or steaming among the ice
 both uncertain and dangerous.            As the salt water has no maximum of den
 sity, the  freezing  of the  surface  overa depth of 1 000 to 2000 fathoms would be
 difficult to explain, were it not that the sea- water in the polar regions is by the
 melting of the ice and the heavy autumnal snowfalls less salt, and accordingly
 lighter, even when at a temperature lower than that of the layers beneath.
    The last week of September was employed in filling our coal-boxes and
 refitting our steamer for a new struggle with the ice.              During these days
 a strong easterly snow-storm prevailed, which made us hope to find the
 newly-fermed ice broken and the pack more dispersed than before.                    Our

 130 Nordenskiold on the Swedish Arctic Explorations of \868. [Nov.2G,
 intention                this favourable circumstance for making a last
              was to employ
 attempt to go northward, and if this should prove to be unsuccessful to
 winter at Seven Islands.  This plan was frustrated by an accident similar to
 that which happened to the expeditions of Buchan and Ross in 1818.
    The calm that during the summer prevails in the Arctic Sea gave way
after September 23rd to almost uninterrupted       stormy weather, which
caused such a violent and irregular sea on the border of the pack that it
was impossible to advance without exposing the ship to be instantly crushed
by the large rolling hummocks.       Consequently we were obliged to lay to
under the 81st parallel, waiting for better weather and a calmer sea. How
ever, everywhere on the surface of the sea large pieces of ice were scattered,
dangerous by their rolling movement, their hardness (the temperature was
 — 14° 5 Centigrade), and the obscurity that prevailed at night. During a
south-easterly storm on April 24 our steamer was so vehemently thrown
against such a hummock that a large leak ensued, which forced us to make
as soon as possible for land.   After hard work in keeping the steamer
afloat, we reached Amsterdam               Island, where the leak was provisionally
caulked so as to enable us           to reach a safer harbour in Kings Bay the follow
ing day.   Here we had the ship down, and the damage was repaired as well
as possible.
    October    12   we left    this harbour,       going   through    a large field of new
ice.    Evidently the      season was too far advanced          for further enterprises to
the    northward     ;        our steamer, having got two ribs broken, was
                         besides,
no longer strong enough    for a new encounter with the ice ; and as a wintering
only on Seven Islands could not be of an interest great enough to outweigh
the loss of time, privations, and dangers unavoidably associated with         we    it,
resolved to employ the yet tolerably open sea around the southern part of
Spitzbergen to make an attempt to reach Giles Land.     But being, at Thou
sand Islands, prevented             by
                           ice from penetrating further, we turned south
ward and reached Tromso,   April    after having at Beeren Eiland sustained
                                          1   9,
a severe storm, during which our steamer  was quite ice down     the waves  by
that washed over.
    During our cruize    the polar basin interesting observations were ob
                             in
tained on the temperature, currents, &c. of the sea, and   number of care
                                                                      a

1
   868.] Nordenskiold        on the Swedish    Arctic Explorations of 1 868.      131
favourable     season,   i. e.  the time be/ore the formution of new ice, no
vessel had as yet made such an attempt.            This was the aim of the Swedish
Expedition,     and  it found  —
    (1) That the polar sea is far more open in the autumn than at any other
season    of the year, but that even then the passage is soon stopped by dense
and impenetrable masses of broken ice.
    (2) That during the winter the polar basin is covered by            an unbroken
ice, and that the freezing of the surface begins as early as the end of Sep
tember.       From September 23 to October 1 2 we had almost every day,
either with the steamer or with boats, to cross new-formed ice.
    (3) That     an autumn cruise north      of 80|° lat. is attended with unusual
dangers, owing to the darkness and storms then prevailing, no ships being
able a long time to sustain a night storm among large rolling pieces of ice
and a cold of — 1 5° Cent.         If the ship has the good luck not to be more or
 less damaged by the constant unavoidable encounters with the ice mounts,
 it will  soon by the immediate freezing       of the washing   waves be  itself quite
covered and pressed down by ice.
    (4) The idea of an open and comparatively milder polar basin is quite
chimerical ; on the contrary, 20'-30' north of Spitzbergen a region of
cold seems to begin which no doubt stretches far around the pole.
     (5) The only plan to attain the pole, from which success can be expected,
is that adopted by most English arctic men, namely of going northward by
 sledges   in the winter either from Smith Sound or Seven Islands.

     Should you think it worth communicating this letter to the Royal
 Geographical Society, I beg you especially to inform its celebrated President,
 Sir R. Murchison, that besides other specimens interesting in a geological
 point of view (for instance, a mass of Miocene and coal plants, bones of
 Ichthyosaurus     ? &c),   we found a number      of large fish fragments, probably
 belonging to the Devonian age, in the red slate of Liebde Bay, constituting
 the overmost layer of what I in my 1 Geology of Spitzbergen
                                                                             '

 Hecla block- formation.       Accordingly Sir Roderick probably is right in sup
 posing that the deeper layers of this
                                              " formation " belong to the Silurian
 age.     The underlying crystalline plates are evidently Laurentian.

  serve the spectrum of the prominences with an instrument of small dis

persive powers, gave an account of the delays which had impeded the
construction of a larger one (the funds for which were supplied by the
Government-Grant     Committee early in 1867), in order that the coinci
dence     in time between     his results and those obtained by the Indian       ob
servers might not be misinterpreted.
  Details are given of the observations made by the new instrument, which
was received incomplete on the 16th of October.    These observations in
clude the discovery, and exact determination of the lines, of the prominence-
spectrum on the 20th of October, and of the fact that the prominences are
merely local aggregations of a gaseous medium which entirely envelopes
the sun.    The term Chromosphere is suggested for this envelope, in order
to distinguish it from the cool absorbing atmosphere on the one hand, and
from the white light-giving photosphere on the other.   The possibility of
variations in the thickness of this envelope is suggested, and the pheno
mena presented by the star in Corona are referred to.
    It
     is stated that, under proper instrumental and atmospheric conditions,
the spectrum of the chromosphere is always visible in every part of the
sun's periphery ; its height, and the dimensions and shapes of several pro
minences, observed at different times, are given in the paper.           One promi
nence, 3' high, was observed on the 20th October.
   Two of the lines correspond with Fraunhofer's C and F ; another lies
8° or 9° (of KirchhofFs scale) from D towards E.        There is another bright
line, which occasionally makes its appearance near C, but slightly less re
frangible than that line.    It is remarked that the line near D has no cor
responding   line ordinarily  visible in the solar spectrum.   The author has
been led by his observations to ascribe great variation of brilliancy to the
lines.   On the 5th of November a prominence was observed in which the
action was evidently very intense      ;   and on this occasion the light and colour
of the line at F were most vivid.          This was not observed all along the line
visible in the field of view of the instrument,        but only at certain parts of
the line which appeared to widen out.
   The author points out that the line         F invariably expands (that the band
of light gets wider and wider) as          the sun is approached, and that the C
line and the D line do not ; and he enlarges upon the importance of this fact,
taken in connexion with the researches of Pliicker, Hittorf, and Frankland
on the spectrum      of hydrogen   — stating   at the same time that he is engaged
in researcheson gaseous spectra which, it is possible, will enable us to de
termine the temperature and pressure at the surfaces of the chromosphere,
and to give a full explanation of the various colours of the prominences
which have been observed at different times.
   The paper    also     refers to certain bright regions in the solar spectrum
itself.

III.    "Extract from a Letter addressed by Chas. Babbage, Esq.,

        municated by Mr. Badbage.               Received November 26, 1868.
    " In
           reading the account of the great solar eclipse of last year (1851) I
was much struck by the description of the pink excrescences apparently
attached to the sun's disk, and connected with its spots (see Proceedings
of Royal Astronomical Society). They are only visible during a few
minutes in a total eclipse.        It occurred to me that it might be possible to
render them visible at other times by two different methods : —
    "  1st.  By placing     in  the focus of an equatorial telescope moved by
clockwork      an opake disk, equal to or a     little larger than the sun's image.
This would represent          a continuous total eclipse ; and if every known
means of excluding light were adopted, it might be possible to see those
faint pink objects, which are probably clouds raised by the eruption of
solar volcanoes.                              *
    "  2nd.   If this fail, it might yet be possible to render them visible by
 taking daguerreotype or photographic images.
    " It is really surprising that nobody has yet taken such images regularly,
for the sake of recording the solar spots and their changes.
    "  I have no clock-moving equatorial myself fit for these          observations,
             I
nor have time to spare for them.
    "  I cannot   persuade my countrymen that they are important, so you
 are at liberty to try them, or publish the plan on your side of the At
 lantic.
     " Mr.   Gould will probably have explained to you an old plan of mine
 for mapping zones of stars without moving the eye from the telescope."

    1868.]                       President's Address.                          135
       The President then addressed the Society     as follows : —
          Gentlemen,
    I have the satisfaction of now laying before you the second volume of
   the Catalogue of Scientific Papers.     The volume now completed carries on
   the list of titles in alphabetical order as far as G b a, inclusive.   The Li
   brary Committee, under whose superintendence the Catalogue is published,
   had hoped that the printing of the work would have made greater progress
   than it has done during the time that has elapsed since the appearance of
   the first volume ; but notwithstanding     their earnest endeavours to attain
   that object, they found that, with due regard to the careful revision of the
   press, the rate of printing could not be materially accelerated.
      In fulfilment of the understanding with Her Majesty's Government,
   explained in my Address last year, copies have been presented to various
   Scientific Institutions and individuals, according to a list drawn up by the
   Council, and approved by the Treasury.       It is gratifying to know that in
   the numerous letters of acknowledgment received in return, as well as
   more publicly through the press, the value of the work as an aid to
  scientific research has been warmly recognized.       As a special instance of
  this favourable expression of opinion,    I would refer to the ample notice of
  the book written by our Foreign Member, Hofrath W. Eitter v. Haidinger,
  of Vienna, and circulated by him in different parts of Europe.
      Already of the remaining copies 120 have been sold.
      My last year's Address contained an account of the proceedings of tho
  Committee of the Royal Society, which, at the request of Her Majesty's
  Government, had undertaken the reorganization and superintendence of
  the meteorological department of the Board of Trade.             The year that
  has since elapsed has been employed, 1°, In perfecting the instrumental
  arrangements, and the systematic working of the staff, at the seven British
 Observatories which have been supplied, under the Committee's direction,
 with continuously self-recording meteorological apparatus.         For this pur
 pose one or more of the staff of each Observatory has passed some days at
 the Central Observatory at Kew ; and the Observatories themselves have
 been visited, some by Mr. Scott, the Director of the Meteorological Office
 in London, and all by Mr. Stewart, the Superintendent of the Central
 Observatory, and also by Mr. Beckley, the Engineer of the Kew Establish
 ment.      By these means it is hoped that uniformity of action on thoroughly
well considered principles has been secured, and a considerable advance
made towards the systematic record of the meteorological phenomena over
the British Islands.       The monthly records are now beginning to be re
ceived at the Office in London with regularity from all the Observatories,
but have scarcely yet quite attained in all instances to that uniform accu
racy which it is hoped will be fully secured at the close of the present
     VOL.  XVII.                                                     L

year.    The means and the methods by which the facts thus considerately
and systematically obtained may be communicated to the public, in the
form which may be at once suitable for the study of the weather pheno
mena over the very limited territorial area of the British Islands — and may
at the same time contribute in the most satisfactory manner to the impor
tant investigations which are now in progress on the Continent of Europe
regarding the periodic and non-periodic variations — will be the next point
 to which the careful attention of the Committee will be directed.
    2°. In the branch of ocean meteorology the cooperation of several of
our leading oceanic steam companies has been secured; and a large number
of the commanders of their vessels are now actively engaged in the work
of observing.     Instruments have also been supplied to other masters of
vessels of our mercantile marine, care being always taken that the reci
pients are both competent to observe and willing to do so regularly and
accurately.     The zeal and judgment displayed by Captain Henry Toynbee,
the Marine Superintendent of the Office, in the selection of observers, has
already begun to bear fruit in the marked improvement in the quality of
 the information in the registers which are now received compared with
those which had previously accumulated in the office.         The discussion of
the material which has been thus collected and is still collecting is in pro
gress; but some time must elapse before a significant portion of the im
mense arrear can be advanced to such a stage as to afford a prospect       of its
speedy publication.      The staff of clerks is already fully occupied ; so that
the rate of progress cannot be much accelerated, unless the Committee
find themselves in a position to devote more funds to this object than they
 are at present able to do.     The special subject to which the attention of
 this department of tho office has been first directed, is the discussion of
information    respecting the district of the Atlantic Ocean comprised between
the parallels of 20° N. and 10° S., for which region it is in contemplation to
ascertain the conditions of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and vapour
tension, as well as the direction and force of wind, the character of the
weather, and the surface temperature of the sea.         These elements will be
discussed for spaces of a single square degree in area for the different
months.
    As regards the temperature of the surface of the sea (a subject so much
 dwelt on by the President and Council of the Royal Society in their letter
to the Board of Trade of February 22, 1855), a very valuable series of
monthly charts has been published by the Royal Meteorological Institute
of the Netherlands, exhibiting the temperature for each degree of latitude
for the North and South Atlantic Oceans, and for the Indian Ocean.          The
Committee considered that a conversion of the data in these charts into
British measures would be likely to be of immediate use to our own marine,
and they have accordingly directed that a set of charts should be prepared in
the first instance for the South Atlantic Ocean, exhibiting the Dutch results,
as well as those obtained from the British registers received by the meteo

 rological department of the Board of Trade under its former management.
 These latter, however, were only calculated for spaces of five degrees
 square.    In addition, some of the work left in an unfinished state by Ad
 miral Fitz Roy has been undertaken by the office at extra hours, and a
 series of wind-tables for the Atlantic have been ordered to be printed.     The
 discussion of general meteorological information for the Pacific seaboard of
 South America is in a state far advanced towards completion.
    3°. The system of telegraphic weather-intelligence,   described in my last
 year's anniversary address, has received a further development, and at
 present the Drum signal is hoisted at 97 British stations, to convey the
 intelligence of the existence of atmospherical disturbance in each case to
 such ports as may appear to the central office to be reasonably liable to be
 affected by it.   Similar intelligence has been telegraphed to Hamburg
 since February 1868 ; and in the course of last month Herr von Freeden,
 the Director of the newly established meteorological office in that city (tho
 Nord-deuteche Seowartc) , has informed the London office that the harbour
 authorities on the Elbe have resolved to hoist the Drum signal at Ham
 burg and Cuxhaven whenever intelligence implying probable danger shall
 be received from London.        In France also the ministry of the marine
has adopted, for tho present at least, the practice of telegraphing facts and
 not prophecies.
    In addition  to the telegraphic  communications   already referred to, the
London Office sends,      by special request, telegraphic intelligence of tho
existence of a certain amount of difference of barometric pressure between
two stations within a denned area, to Mr. Rundell (Secretary of the Under
writers' Association at Liverpool), and to the Dutch authorities.       The in
fluence which the distribution of atmospheric pressure exerts     on  the motion
of the air has been much dwelt upon by Dr. Buys Ballot, of Utrecht, and a
rule has beeu propounded by him for inferring the coming direction of the
wind from simultaneous readings of the barometer at different places. In
order to lay tho foundation of a systematic study of our weather, and, at
the same time, to test the truth of this rule, it has been the practice of our
meteorological office, for more than a year past, to prepare, and subject to
systematic discussion, daily charts of the meteorological condition over the
area embraced by the daily telegraphic reports which it receives, viz. the
British Islands and a portion of the nearer continental coasts.      The results
of this investigation are on the whole encouraging, and favour the hope that
with a more extended experience a real, if slight, advance will have been
made in this most intricate but interesting inquiry.
    The magnificent    but rare phenomenon of a total solar eclipse is not
more striking as a    spectacle than interesting in a scientific point of view,
from the precious opportunity it affords of gathering information, then
only to be obtained, which bears on the constitution of our great lumi
nary.    The corona which surrounds     the dark body of the moon must have
                                                                  l  2

  been seen from the earliest   times ; but what   does  it import ?  Has it its
  seat in our own atmosphere, or in an atmosphere of the moon, or in some
  thing surrounding the sun ? and, in the latter case, is it self-luminous, or
  does it shine by reflected light ?     What, again, is the nature of those
  singular rose-coloured luminous objects seen just outside the dark disk of
  the moon, which were first brought prominently into notice by the obser
  vers who watched the eclipse of July 7, 1842, and have subsequently been
  seen on the occasion of total solar eclipses ?
     Evidence bearing in an important manner on the true answers to these
  questions had already been obtained on the occasion of former total eclipses.
  In that of July 18, 1860, M. Prazmouski ascertained that the light of the
  corona was strongly polarized in a plane passing through the centre of the
  sun, while that of the prominences was un polarized. The fact of the polari
  zation discarded the hypothesis, sufficiently improbable on other grounds,
  that the corona belongs either to our own atmosphere or to a lunar atmo
  sphere (since in that case the light would bo reflected or scattered at an
  almost grazing incidence), and proved it to belong to the sun, and to shine
  mainly, if not wholly, by reflected light.     The absence of polarization in
  the light of the prominences proved that they are very probably self-
  luminous.    The elaborate photographic observations of Mr. Warren De La
  Eue on the same eclipse proved, by the motion of the prominences rela
 tively to the moon, that they belong to the sun, and showed that their light
 is remarkable for its actinic power.
     In the interval between this eclipse and that of the present year, a new
 method of research had sprung up, in the application of the spectroscope to
 the celestial bodies, and already, in the hands of Mr. Huggins, had revealed
 in many of the nebulas a constitution hitherto unsuspected. It was impor
 tant to apply this method of research to the red prominences. Should they
 give a continuous spectrum, the conclusion would bo that the matter of
 which they consist is probably in a solid or liquid condition, such as
 clouds formed by precipitation ; should the spectrum be one of bright
lines, we must conclude that they are glowing gas.
    To solve this important problem, independently of what might be done
by other scientific bodies or by individuals, the Royal Society procured an
equatorially mounted telescope, furnished with a spectroscope and clock-
movement.       With the sanction of Colonel Walker, R.E., Director of the
Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, this instrument was entrusted to
Lieut. John Herschel, R.E., who is attached to the Survey, and who,
being at the timo in England, had the advantage of instruction from so
skilful an observer as Mr. Huggins before his return to India. After his
return to India, Lieut. Herschel worked diligently at the spectra of the
southern nebulae, thereby at the same time making an important addition
to our knowledge, and practising for the approaching eclipse. Four direct-
vision hand-spectroscopes, intended for distribution to observers at dif
ferent stations, were also sent out, — partly that the occasion might not be

wholly lost in case clouds should prevent observations from being taken
at the principal station ; partly because a more rough and general view of the
whole phenomenon might reveal features which would be missed in a more
careful scrutiny of a particular part.      Another telescope, furnished with
analyzers for the examination of polarization, was also sent out ; for from
the shortness of the time at the disposal of an observer, it would be satisfac
tory that the results obtained, even by so skilful an observer as SI. Praz-
mouski, should be confirmed.
   The   observations   of the observers entrusted   with    these instruments
were greatly impeded by flying clouds, notwithstanding         which, however,
important work was done.         With the principal instrument, Lieut. Her-
schel ascertained that the spectrum of the prominences showed three
isolated bright lines — red, orange, and blue.    He had time to take a good
measure of the position of the orange line, which proved to be coincident
with D,   as nearly as the instrument could measure. Clouds prevented the
measure of the blue line from being equally good ; it proved, however, to
be   nearly  coincident with F, apparently a very little less refrangible.
With    one  of the hand-spectroscopes Captain Haig, B'E., observed the
spectrum of the red prominences to consist of two bands, "rose-madder"
and " golden yellow," corresponding, doubtless, to the "red" and " orange"
of Herschel. But besides these, just before the emergence of the sun, Capt.
Haig observed, " in the spectrum of the moon's edge," two well-defined
bright bands, one green and one indigo.        The seizing of this almost mo
mentary phenomenon, establishing as it does the existence of a thin enve
lope of glowing gas (unless, indeed, the constitution thus revealed were
merely local, and its occurrence just at the part of the sun first measured
were a mere matter of chance), proves the advantage of not neglecting the
use of a comparatively rough instrument intended for a general scrutiny
of the phenomenon.
   Of the remaining hand-spectroscopes, one was entrusted to Mr. Cham
bers, Director of the Bombay Observatory, but could not be used on ac
count of clouds, and two were placed in the hands of the commanders of
homeward-bound       steamers, belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental
                                                                     '
Steam Navigation Company.         Capt. Charles G. Perrins, of the Carnatic,'
who had charge of one, was unable to apply it to the intended observa
tions, as his ship was about 20 miles north of the track of the total
phase ; with the other, Capt. Eennoldson, of tho ' llangoon,' ascertained
the discontinuous character of the red prominences, and his observation
would    have been very valuable      had clouds prevented observations from
being taken on shore.
   The telescope furnished with analyzers was placed in tho hands of
Lieut. Campbell, R.E., who has fully confirmed the previous observation of
M. Prazmouski relative to the strong polarization of the light of the
corona.

account, resting on the observations of Capt. Tanner and Mr. Kero Laxu-
man, who were of his party, is their streaked character.               This had been
noticed before, in the eclipse of 1860.          Mr. Warren De La Rue, in speak
ing of the prominences, expressly mentions their structure ; and M. Cha-
cornac, who devoted himself to this object, has given a long description
of their appearance*, which, however, is a little difficult to follow for
want of a figure. The strong actinic power, the streaked character, and
 the bright-line spectrum of the prominences seem certainly to accord very
 well with the hypothesis in which they are regarded as gigantic aurora? —
 a view, however, which may be rendered less probable by the apparently
general prevalence over the sun's surface of a lower stratum of similar
 nature, of which the prominences are merely elevated portions.
    The great Melbourne Telescope was despatched to its destination in an
 Australian packet ('The Empress of the Seas'), which sailed from Liver
 pool on the 18th of July last ; and M. Le Sueur proceeded overland to
await its arrival. The micrometer and spectroscope which are to follow
are quite ready, and the photographic apparatus is also nearly ready, to be
 despatched to Melbourne.
   In June last the President and Council received from Dr. Carpenter and
Professor Wyville Thomson letters strongly recommending that the Zoo
logy of the Deqp Sea, especially in the North Atlantic Ocean, should be
more thoroughly and systematically examined than has hitherto been ac
complished, and requesting the intervention of the Royal Society with tho
Admiralty for the purpose of obtaining the services of a vessel, with proper
means and appliances for deep-sea sounding and dredging, to carry on a
systematic research, in the seas immediately north of our own island, for
a month      or six weeks in the approaching autumn           — and  tendering    their
own services to accompany the vessel.
   With the thoroughly efficient aid of the Hydrographer, Capt. Richards,
R.N., the ' Lightning,' surveying-ship, Staff-Commander May, was selected
and equipped expressly for this service ; and Dr. Carpenter and Professor
Thomson embarked in her on the 10th of August, at Stornoway.                     After
examining the      seas between Scotland and the Faroe Islands, the Light     '
      '
ning returned on the 9th of September to Stornoway, to land Professor
Thomson (whose presence was required elsewhere), and sailed again (this
time accompanied by Dr. Carpenter only) for a second, more westerly
cruise, which lasted until the 26th of September.
   A preliminary report of the results has been received from Dr. Car
penter, and will be read to the Society at an early evening meeting in the
present session ; I will only venture to anticipate the contents of this
^ery valuable report so far as to say that it will be found                   of very
high    interest  both in respect to the temperature of the             sea  at great

   The    report  strongly   recommends the continuation     and extension of
these researches — a recommendation       which  in due time will require and
receive the attention     of your Council, who may confidently anticipate
that should a further application to the Admiralty be deemed desirable it
will receive favourable consideration, and, if approved, will be secure of the
same cordial and invaluable      cooperation on the part of the Hydrographer
as that  which has    been enjoyed on this occasion.
   We have to rejoice in the safe return of the Swedish and North-German
Expeditions, engaged in the past summer in the endeavour to extend the
domain of Arctic Exploration to the north and to the west.         Though tho
limits previously attained have not been passed in either direction, much
valuable information has been obtained regarding the Natural History of
Northern Lands, as well as many important facts bearing on the Hydro
graphy of the Arctic Seas ; while an experience has been gained in Arctic
navigation, and habits acquired of surmounting the difficulties which it
presents, that may yield good fruit hereafter.
   The Arctic explorations of the Swedes included, from their commence
ment, the design of accomplishing such a preliminary survey of Spitz-
bergen as might solve the question of the practicability of the measure
ment of a degree of the meridian in that high latitude.       The idea of such
an undertaking having originated in this country and in this Society more
than forty years ago, it is natural that we should regard the steps taken
towards its accomplishment with a lively sympathy.       A sketch of what was
effected in 1861 and 1864 by MM. Chydenius, Diinor, and Nordenskiold,
communicated      to the Royal Society by Captain Skogman, of the Royal
Swedish    Navy, was printed in the Proceedings of December 1864. An
official and elaborate Report    has since been published (in Sept. 1866) by
the Royal Swedish        Academy, entitled " Forberedande Undersdkningar
rdrande Utfbrbarheten af en Gradmatning pa Spetsbergen
                                                                " (preliminary
researches touching the facilities for a measurement of a degree at Spitz-
bergen), by   MM. Diiner and Nordenskiold (Chydenius having unfortunately
died).    In  the  Map accompanying the Report the triangles are laid down
which connect the extremes of land, and comprehend an arc of about 4° 11'.
One of the objects contemplated by the expedition which has just returned
was, to examine the possibility of the extension of the arc to lands existing
to the north of the north-easternmost part of Spitzbergen — a question,
however, which cannot be regarded as yet perfectly solved, the northern
                           '
progress of the ' Sophia having been stopped by ice, which is described by
M. Nordenskiold as " consisting in part of fields of drift-ice, covered with
particles of earth, which seems to indicate that land is to be met with
further north."
   Should these preliminary researches and surveys eventuate in a Scandi

navian    arc-measurement    at Spitzbergen,  I need scarcely say with what
interest such an undertaking    would be regarded by this country and by its
Eoyal Society.
    With reference   to the operations   of the Committee, appointed at the
Nottingham Meeting of the British Association, for the Exploration of the
Tertiary Plant-beds of North Greenland, it was stated in my last Address
that a large collection of fossil plant-remains had been brought from
Greenland by Mr. Edward Whymper.
    The entire collection has been sent, for examination and description, to
Prof. Oswald Heer, of Zurich, who has already published a work, ' Flora
Fossilis Arctica,' containing the results of his examination of the fossils
brought at various times from Greenland and other parts of the arctic
regions and deposited in the museums of this country and of Denmark and
Sweden.
    The Committee, finding that their funds were exhausted, made a fresh
application to the Government-Grant Committee, and received an ad
ditional sum to defray the expense of carriage of the specimens to and
from Zurich.
    The collection was forwarded to Switzerland at the end of last year ;
and within the last week Prof. Heer has sent the description of the fossils
to London, with the view of submitting it to the Royal Society.
    The localities which were examined by Mr. Whymper were situated on
the shores of the Waigat, at two points on Disco Island, and at Atane-
kerdluk, on the mainland of Greenland.
    From Disco, whence specimens had only once been obtained before (by
Dr. Lyall), 14 species were procured.      Among them the occurrence of two
cones of Magnolia present the greatest interest, as they prove to us that
 an evergreen, such as Magnolia, could ripen its fruit at the high north lati
 tude of 70°.
    The collection from Atanekerdluk is especially rich, but this locality
 was well known before ; the number of species from it in this collection
 is 73. Among the most important of these are the flowers and fruit of a
 Chestnut, proving to us that the deposits which contain them must have
 been formed at different seasons, corresponding to the times of flowering
 and fruit of the Chestnut.
    The collection is not rich in animal remains; however, some insects
 have been noticed, as well as a freshwater bivalve, probably " Cyclas."
    The results of this expedition have been eminently satisfactory, whether
 we look to the number of new species discovered, or to the additional facts,
 confirmatory of previous determinations, which have been ascertained.
 This latter remark is of special importance when we find that the identi
 fication of a tree by means of its leaves has been supported by the sub
  sequent discovery of its flowers and fruit.

    Four of these are found in our own Bovey Tracey beds, which have
been already described by Prof. Heer in the ' Philosophical Transactions.'
Among these is Sequoia Couttsice, the commonest tree in the British
locality. Accordingly the age of the Greenland deposits has been fixed
beyond a doubt as Lower Miocene.
    The collection itself is expected to arrive in London shortly, when a
complete series of the specimens will be deposited in the British Museum,
in accordance with the terms prescribed by the British Association and the
Government-Grant Committee of the Royal Society.
    The redaction of the great scientific work, the Magnetic Survey of the
South Polar Regions — commenced in 1839, under the auspices and at the
expense of Her Majesty's Government — has been completed in the present
year by the presentation to the Royal Society, and the publication in the
Philosophical Transactions, of Maps of the three Magnetic Elements in
Southern Parallels, commencing in 30° south, and extending far beyond
the limits of ordinary navigation. These Maps are accompanied by Tables
containing the numerical coefficients to be employed in a revision of
' Gauss's General Theory,' at the intersection of every fifth degree of lati
tude and every tenth degree of longitude, between 30° south latitude and
the south terrestrial pole. The magnetical determinations of the Survey
correspond to the epoch 1842^.          Similar Maps for the corresponding
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, from 30° north latitude to the north
terrestrial pole, are in preparation, founded on a coordination of results
obtained by magneticians of all countries in the fifteen years preceding
and the fifteen years following the same mean epoch of 1842|, and reduced
to it. It is hoped that these Maps, with an accompanying Memoir, will
be presented to the Royal Society before the close of the present session.
There will then remain for subsequent completion the filling up (still for
the same epoch) of the space between the parallels of 30° north and 30°
south latitude, for which much preparation has been made in the assem
blage of materials, requiring only, for their coordination, the allotment of
the time needed for the due examination and treatment of so large a body
                        I
of materials. Should be so happy as to be able to complete this task also,
(my occupation in Terrestrial Magnetism has now extended, more or less,
over half a century,)   I venture to express a hope that the great work of
which the foundation will thus have been laid, viz. " tho Revision of the
Gaussian Theory, corresponding to a definite epoch in tho great cycle of
terrestrial magnetism," may, when a suitable time shall appear to have
arrived, be taken up and completed under the auspices of tho Royal
Society.
   Whilst on the subject of Terrestrial Magnetism,   I  may remark that, in
                            '
a recent   number of his      Wochcnberichte,'  Dr. Lamont has called the

144                                 Anniversary Meeting.                            [Nov. 30,
attention of magneticians to the probable occurrence of the epoch of max
imum of the magnetic disturbances at the end of the present year 1868, in
accordance with the hypothesis of a decennial period, and has noticed
the already great increase in the number of days of unusual magnetic
disturbance observed at Munich in the months of August, September,
and October last.     Coincidently with Dr. Lamont's experience in this
respect, the continuous records of the magnetometers at Kew have shown
larger and more frequent magnetic disturbances than usual ; and the
Photoheliographs, taken there on all days when the sun is visible, have
shown larger and more numerous groups of sun-spots.
  It may be worthy of remark in this connexion, that 1868 is the fourth
decennium since the occurrence of the first well-ascertained maximum of
magnetic disturbance ;          I
                         mean that which, resting on the authority of
Arago's admirable and systematic series of observations (1821-1830), has
been shown to have taken place in 1828 *.     It may be proper, however,
to   await the more decisive evidence which the years 1873 to 1879 may
afford, as to the preference to be given to either of the periods assigned
by different magneticians (respectively 10 and ll-fV years) as the dura
tion of this remarkable phenomenon, which appears to attest the simul
taneity of physical       affections of the sun and of the earth.              If   the decen
nial hypothesis be correct, 1873 will be the year of minimum, and 1878
that of maximum ;         if,
                          on the other hand, the period be one of 11 years
and     small fraction, 1873 should be the year of maximum, and 1878 the
        a
year  of  minimum     ;and the order of progression and sequence be reversed.
I     mentioned in my last year's Address that the operations of the
Bombay Observatory were delayed by the non-reception of the necessary
self-recording    magnetical and meteorological instruments of the best
modern construction.        I       am glad to be able to state on this occasion that
a    communication which        I     ventured   to make to Sir Stafford Northcote,
Secretary of State for India, had the immediate effect of removing the
difficulty which had intervened, and that advice has recently been received
of the safe arrival of these instruments at Bombay.   We may now con
fidently anticipate that, under the able  and zealous superintendence of
Mr. Chambers, the Bombay Observatory will speedily take place in the        a
first rank of institutions          specially devoted to these two branches of Phy
sical Science.
  A paper of considerable interest and importance, entitled " Scientific
Exploration of Central Australia," was presented to the Society in April
last.  The geographical and scientific researches of its author, Dr. Neu-

results, there can be no doubt of its producing a rich harvest in physical
geography and natural history, and as little doubt of the warm interest it
would command in the Scientific Societies of the mother country, espe

   I   proceed to the award of the Medals.
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Sir Charles Wheatstone, F.R.S.,
for his researches in Acoustics, Optics, Electricity, and Magnetism.
   The researches of Sir Charles Wheatstone in acoustics, optics, elec
tricity, and magnetism, numerous and important as they are, have already
taken their place as integral parts of science, and have become so com
pletely incorporated into its teaching that it willbe hardly necessary on
the present occasion to do more than enumerate the leading ones, in
recognition of which the Copley Medal has this year been awarded.
   The earliest of these researches in point of time were those connected
with acoustics ; and among these we may mention a paper on the trans
mission of sound through solid conductors, which (in 1828) describes the
means discovered by the author of transmitting musical performances to
distant places, where they are made audible by sounding-boards          through
the intervention of wires or wooden rods.
   His paper on the acoustic figures of vibrating surfaces was published in
the  '                              '
        Philosophical Transactions for 1832.      In this the laws of the for
mation of the varied and beautiful figures discovered by Chladni were
first traced.
   His subsequent invention of the Kaleidophone furnished him with an
elegant means of showing optically the coexistence of different forms of
vibrations in sounding bodies.
   His wave-machine      furnished    a still more complete method of demon
strating the composition of undulations       by mechanical means.
   In optics his contrivance of the Stereoscope and the Pseudoscope, and
his discussion of the modes in which binocular vision is effected, described
in the ' Philosophical Transactions     '
                                          for 1838 and 1852, were even more
ingenious and important,      as showing     us how wo obtain a perception of
solidity or relief, or of its reverse, by the simultaneous observation of two
plane images.
   Another ingenious optical invention was the Polar Clock, described to
the British Association at their Meeting in 1849.        This is an instrument

146                          Anniversary Meeting.                       [Nov. 30,
which indicates the time by means of the changes of polarization of the
blue light of the sky in the direction of the polo, founded on the discove
ries of Arago and Quetelet.
   In 1835 he communicated to the British Association a paper on the
Prismatic Analysis of the Electric Light, proving that the electric spark
from different metals presents for each a different spectrum, exhibiting a
definite series of lines, differing in position and colour from each other,
and thus enabling very small fragments of one metal to be distinguished
with certainty from all the others. This was a starting-point in a new
and fertile field of physical inquiry which has abundantly rewarded the
labours of subsequent investigators.
   But no series of his researches have shown -more originality and inge
nuity than those by which he succeeded in measuring the velocity of the
electric current and the duration of the spark.        The principle of the ro
tating mirror employed in these experiments,            and by which he was
enabled to measure time     to the millionth part  of a  second, admits of appli
cation in ways so varied and important that it may be regarded as having
placed a new instrument of research in the hands of those employed in
delicate physical inquiries of this order.
    Scarcely less valuable are the instruments and processes which Sir Ch.
Wheatstone devised for determining the constants of a voltaic circuit, in
cluding,   among others, the rheostat and the differential       resistance mea
surer (or Wheatstone's     bridge, as  it is usually called), which, in    one or
other of its modifications, is become an indispensable means of measuring
the resistance of telegraphic wires and cables, as well as for determining
electromotive forces.     The description of these methods is contained in a
                '                             '
 paper in the Philosophical Transactions        for 1843.
    But it is with the Electric Telegraph that the name of Sir C. Wheatstone
is in the public mind most completely identified ; and ever since the first
 messages were transmitted along the Great Western Railway by insulated
 copper wires enclosed in iron tubes, to the present day — when a network
 of copper wires insulated by means of caoutchouc is suspended across our
 public thoroughfares for the instantaneous transmission of intelligence,
 not merely from one district to another in our large towns, but from one
 continent and capital to another — Sir C. Wheatstone has not ceased to
 contribute the most important aid towards perfecting the means of electro-
 telegraphic communication.
    A bare enumeration of these various inventions would carry us beyond
 our limits on the present occasion.      In 1840 he devised a cable adapted
 for transmitting intelligence under the sea ; and it is to him that we arc
 indebted for the Alphabetic Dial Telegraph working without any clock-
 power, and in which a magneto-electric machine supplies the place of a
 voltaic battery.    These instruments were first used in the Paris and Ver
 sailles Railway in 1S46.
    A more recent invention is his High-Speed Telegraph, in which the

 1868.]                       President's Address.                          147
 messages, previously prepared on slips     of paper, are, by passing through
 a very small machine constructed somewhat on the principle of the Jac-
quard Loom, made to print the messages at the remote station, in the ordi
nary telegraphic characters, with a rapidity unattainable by the hand of
an operator.
   Allied to these inventions are others where electro-magnetism is the
motive power, as, for example, the electro-magnetic clock for telegraphing
time, a modification of which has since been employed to aid in deter
mining the longitude      of distant places ; also the Chronoscope, for mea
suring the velocity of projectiles or falling bodies.
   In this enumeration of his discoveries, inventions, and researches, we
have passed over many, such as        his speaking machine, the investigation
of Fessel's Gyroscope, his experiments in illustration of Foucault's proof
of the rotation of the earth, and others.
   More than enough, however, has been stated to justify the presentation
of the Copley Medal on this occasion to our eminent fellow-countryman.
      Sib Charles Wheatstone,
   I have the very agreeable duty of presenting to you this Medal, which
you will receive as a testimony of the sense so universally entertained by
your countrymen, and specially by the Fellows of the Royal Society, of the
high scientific merit and practical value of your many discoveries and
inventions, and of their varied applications.
   The Council has awarded a Royal Medal to the Rev. Dr. George Salmon,
Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Dublin, for his original
investigations    on Analytical Geometry, published in the Transactions of
the Royal Irish Academy and in the Philosophical Transactions, — and,
specially, for his solution of the problem of the degree of a surface reci
procal to a given surface — and for his researches in connexion with surfaces
subject to given conditions, analogous to those of Chasles in plane
curves.
   Besides    the original investigations  thus referred to, Dr. Salmon is the
author of a series of works on Conic Sections, on higher Plane Curves, on
Geometry ,of Three Dimensions, and on higher Algebra (the modern
Analysis), full of original matter of great value to the advanced mathe
matician,    and at the same      time adapted   to the   requirements   of the
student.    These works have become widely spread as text-books through
out Europe ; and the estimation in which they are held is attested by the
fact that they have already been translated into French, German, Italian,
and Russian.
       Dk. Salmon,
    I have the pleasure    of presenting  you this Medal    in testimony of the

high estimation in which your attainments and labours in the higher
branches of mathematics are held by the Royal Society.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace, in re
cognition of the value of his many contributions to theoretical and prac
tical zoology, among which his discussion of the conditions which have
determined the distribution of animals in the Malay archipelago (in a
paper on the zoological geography of that region, published in the
Proceedings of the Linnean Society for 1859) occupies a prominent place.
    The case may be briefly stated thus : —The strait separating the islands
of Baly and Lembok is only fifteen miles wide ; nevertheless the animal
inhabitants of the islands are widely different, the fauna of the western
island being substantially Indian, that of the eastern as distinctly Australian.
    Mr. Wallace has described, in a far more definite and complete manner
than any previous observer, the physical and biological characters of the
two regions which come into contact in the Malay archipelago ; he has
given an exceedingly ingenious and probable solution of the difficulties of
the problem, while his method of discussing it may serve as a model to
future workers in the same field.
    Another remarkable essay, " On the tendency of Varieties to depart
indefinitely from the Original Types," published in the Proceedings of tho
 Linnean Society for 1858, contains an excellent statement of the doctrine
 of Natural Selection, which the author, then travelling in the Malay ar
 chipelago, had developed independently of Mr. Darwin ; and, apart from
its intrinsic merits, this paper will always possess an especial interest in
the history of science, as having been the immediate cause of the publica
 tion of the ' Origin of Species.'
    Mr. Wallace's ability as an observer and describer of animal forms is
 shown in his numerous and valuable contributions to our knowledge of the
 animals, and especially the Pigeons, Parrots, and Butterflies, of the Ma
 layan region.
    It must not be forgotten    that a knowledge of the circumstances under
 which the majority of    these contributions to the higher branches of zoolo
 gical science were made must greatly enhance our respect for the author.
 Mr. Wallace has spent the greater part of his life amidst the exhausting
 and often dangerous fatigues of a traveller in tropical countries rarely ex
 plored by Europeans ; and some of his most valuable papers are dated
 from places which some might consider so little favourable          to study as
 Ternate and Sarawak.
        Mr. Wallace,
     I have the pleasure of presenting to you this Medal in recognition of
 the great merit of your researches both in practical and theoretical Zoology,
  carried out in countries where such pursuits are necessarily attended with
  more than usual difficulties and dangers.

1868.]                           President's Address.                             149
     The Rumford Medal has        been      awarded to   Mr. Balfour Stewart, for his
researches on the qualitative as well as quantitative relations between the
powers of emission and absorption of bodies for heat and light, published
originally in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, and now made
more generally accessible by the publication, in 1866, of his treatise on
heat.
     When                    within an opaque envelope which is kept at a
              a body is placed
constant temperature, it soon acquires the temperature of the envelope —
and that, whatever be the nature or form of the envelope or of the body.
The same is true if any number of bodies of different kinds be placed
within the envelope ; in the permanent state each of the bodies attains a
fixed temperature, the same as that of the walls of the envelope. The
equilibrium of temperature is not, however, of the nature of statical equi
librium; according to the theory by which Prevost so beautifully ex
plained the apparent radiation of cold, each body radiates heat all the
while, at a rate depending only on its nature and temperature, and not at
all on its environment ; and it is because the other bodies and the enve
lope are also radiating heat, and the first body absorbs a portion of tho
radiant heat thus falling upon        it,
                                      that its temperature remains unchanged.
The equality of radiation and absorption follows as simple corollary.
                                                               a
   It had long been known that rock-salt              remarkable for its trans
                                                         is
parency    for obscure radiant  heat.    According  to Melloni,  plate of rock-
                                                                     a
salt of the thickness of three or four millimetres transmits 92 per cent,
of heat-rays from whatever source. Now, on measuring by the thermo
pile the radiation from thin and thick plates of rock-salt, as well as from
 two or more plates placed one behind the other, all being heated up to             a
 definite temperature, Mr. Stewart found that the radiation from           thick
                                                                             a
plate, or from many plates, was, indeed, greater than from        thin plate or
                                                                      a
from     single plate,
          a            but that  the  difference was  not by any means  so great
as   it   ought to have been on the supposition that the heat radiated by the
hinder portion of     thick plate, or by the hinder plates of group, passed
                      a                                              a
through the front portion of      thick plate, or through the front plate of
                                  a                                                 a
group, as freely as obscure heat would have passed which was radiated by
lampblack or most other substances. It thus appeared that rock-salt at
any temperature      by no means transparent to heat radiated by rock-salt
                      is
of  the same  temperature — that      exerts

of the quality of those which       emits.
                                   it        This conclusion was confirmed by
using    plate of cold rock-salt as
          a                             screen by which to sift the heat-rays

proportion stopped was also sensibly greater when the source of heat was
a thin than when    was

screen, and therefore was transmitted by      it in greater proportion than the
heat which radiated    from  the front portion.
   Similar conclusions were obtained from experiments on glass and mica,
though the numerical results were not so striking, in consequence of the
comparatively great opacity of those substances for obscure radiant heat.
   It thus appeared, 1st, that the heat radiated by a body is not confined
to that which comes from the immediate neighbourhood of the surface,
but emanates from various, in the case of rock-salt considerable, depths ;
2ndly, that there is a relation between the quality of the heat radiated
and that absorbed by any given element of a body, and consequently by a
sufficiently thin plate of a body, of such a nature that the kind of heat
most freely radiated is also most freely absorbed.
   These results and others were comprehended            by Mr. Stewart in a
definite theory,    by means of his extension of Prevost's theory of ex
changes. According to this extension, the stream of radiant heat within
a uniformly heated enclosure is the same throughout in quality as well
as quantity ; i. e. the uniformity of radiation exists for eacJi hind of heat in
particular of which the total flux is made up.
   Few now can doubt the identity of nature of radiant heat and light :
and, accordingly, the application to light of the extension of Prevost's
theory was an obvious step.        This step was taken by Mr. Stewart, who
verified by experiment that which theory predicted — that a coloured glass
when heated, as compared with an opaque body glowing at the same tem
perature, gives out by preference rays of the kind which it absorbs, and
consequently tends to glow with a colour complementary to its own. For
a similar reason a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to the axis, when
heated, and viewed in a direction perpendicular to the axis, is seen to
glow with light which is partially polarized in a plane parallel to the axis.
   It is right to mention that, in regard to the extension of Prevost's theory
in its application to light, Mr. Stewart was slightly anticipated by Professor
Kirchhoff, whose brilliant application of the theory to the lines of the
spectrum has attracted general attention, whose researches, however,
had hardly, if at all, reached this country when Mr. Stewart's papers
were presented.      As regards Radiation, however, without specifying of
what kind, the priority in the extension of Prevost's theory belongs to
Mr. Stewart, whose papers on Heat were published before those of Professor
Kirchhoff, to whom, however, they were not known when he published
his earlier papers.
      Mr. Stewary,
   I have   particular pleasure in presenting to you this Medal, because it
will testify to you that all that really conduces to the advance of our
knowledge meets sooner or later with its due recognition — and because I
hope that this tribute to your earlier labours will be especially agreeable to
you now that you are engaged in work of high public value, but which
must necessarily leave you little leisure for such original researches.

I. " On the Phenomena of Light, Heat, and Sound accompanying
      the fall of Meteorites."     By W. Ritter v. Haidinger, For. Mem.
     R.S.    &c.   Received October 6, 1868.
     A   particular incident caused me to return to some portions of my earlier
studies in regard to meteors and meteorites.
     It was the fall of a meteorite at Kakowa on the 19th of May 1858
 that first induced me to bestow some more attention on this department of
 physical science.      A report on the subject I laid before our Imperial Aca
 demy of Vienna on the 7th of January, 1859. On the same day also gave      I
 the first list of the meteorites forming the meteorite collection in our Im
  perial Mineralogical Museum.        A series of reports on meteorites followed,
 as well as a number of catalogues of meteorites, in accordance with the
 growing riches of the collection, embracing from 137 to 236 numbers of
 localities preserved up to the date of July 1, 1867.
      But the studies relating to the recent fall of Ausson on the 9th of De
  cember 1 858, and the ancient fall of the meteoric iron of Hraschina, near
  Agram, on the 26th of May 1 751, others on the Cape meteorites of 1838,
  on those of Shalka, 1850, Allahabad, 1822, Quenggouk (Pegu), 1857,
  Assam, found 1846, Segowlee, 1853, St. Denis- Westrem, 1855, Ne
  braska, found 1 356, but particularly some studies relating to meteorites of
  Stannern, 1858, and of that most remarkable meteoric iron from Tula, dis
  covered in 1856 by Auerbach, all of them within the period of 1851 to
  I860, and then the fall of New Concord, 1860, and of Parnallee, 1857, had
  forcibly called upon me to draw up, as it were, a general rule of the nature
  and succession of events which probably might have taken place in the
   history of their existence, though in each particular case only fragments of
  that history came to our notice.

156                     W. R.     v. Haidinger on the Phenomena                 [Dec.  10,
    A    general survey of this kind I had the honour to lay before our Im
perial Academy on the 14th of March 1861, "On the nature of Meteorites,
relating to their composition and the phenomena of their fall"*.                  I felt.it
is true, that     I  had rather too boldly ventured to transgress the limits of my
former studies ; but at the same time, led on by the high interest connected
with the subject, I wished to gain some more publicity for it. As to England,
I was most kindly and effectively patronized by that energetic promoter of
meteoritic science my most honoured friend Mr. R. P. Greg.                       He laid a
notice of mine before the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, held that year at Manchester, and accompanied it with several
                                    f
 considerations of his own ; then, also, he kindly had the pages of the
 Philosophical Magazine opened for me, and presented me with an edition
 of separate copies of a memoir on the subject — nearly a translation, by my
 honoured friend Count A. F. Marschall, of my original communication to
 our Academy %.
      At the Meeting of German naturalists and physicians at Speyer, my
 honoured friend Dr. Otto Buchner kindly called the attention of the friends
 of this department of natural              science   to  my memoir, which had         been
 favourably mentioned in the reports.
      A note of mine, containing the leading views of my papers, was likewise
 laid by my honoured friend M. Elie de Beaumont before the Paris Aea-
 demie des Sciences         in their Meeting of September 9th, 1861, while I also
 sent a French translation by my excellent friend Count Marschall, together
 with     a copy of my original memoir § .
      Since that time, up to this day,           I  had frequently, in several communi
 cations on meteoritic subjects, had an opportunity to refer to these leading
 papers, and to support the views which they contained.                  Therefore I had
 every reason       to be astonished when         I read, in a recent work on meteorites
                                                                  "

     But    I  had still more reason to be astonished when              I  found   M. Daubree
 himself nearly upon the             same    level in his views respecting the origin of
light,     heat, and sound in the fall of meteorites.
     I  certainly heartily appreciate the high merit of my honoured friend M.
 Daubree, in regard both to his deep studies on meteorites and his eminent
success in forwarding the interests of the Paris Museum of Meteorites ; but
 I  at the same time may be permitted to consider my own views, as given in
 the memoirs quoted, as representing a scientific advance compared with the
statements of M. Meunier and those of M. Daubree himself in his last
memoir on the Orgueil fall f. Neither M. Daubree nor M. Meunier had
 refuted or even objected to my views ; they had only passed them over in
silence, doubtless because they had escaped their notice.
     But    I believe I am fulfilling a duty to scientific progress if             I endeavour
to place the discrepant and even contradictory views on these subjects to
gether, with the view once more to excite attention and recommend them
to further study on the part of the votaries of natural                   science  ; and  it was
with this view that         I prepared a new memoir, to be laid before            our Imperial
Academy in their approaching period of session, on the light, heat, and sound
accompanying the fall of meteorites.                  I begin with some of the statements
put     forth   by  M.   Daubree,    as taken   from      his memoir on Orgueil : —
     " Things go on as if the greater part of the mass of the meteor got out
 of our atmosphere, in order to continue its course, after having left us
some particles, the velocity of which, in consequence of the explosion, was
 reduced "J.          M. Daubree does not admit the arrival of groups or swarms
of meteorites as has been asserted §. " The carbonaceous meteorites con
 tradict the hypothesis that the heat of the meteorites is due to the loss of
their vis viva "\\. The sounds, detonations under the name of explosions,
 remain without explanation
     M. Daubree attributes to mere chance the situation of what he calls
 " scales,"     or  " ecailles   de meteorites,"        at the moment      of  an explosion,     if
they present certain particular            seams    of crust surrounding        their most ex-

tended surface, by which, being foremost, they forced their way through the
opposing atmosphere.           In regard to this position   I had long ago advanced
that it must have been a necessary result, while the rectilinear movement of
the meteorite was in the way of being checked, of part of the force having
been expended in producing a rotatory motion, perpendicular to the direc
tion of the course. This I did in particular, in a paper on the meteoric
iron of Hraschina, on the 14th of April 1859, then on an aerolite from
 Stannern on the 22nd of May 1862, and in other instances.
     The above-mentioned quotations of M. DanbreVs views are now compared
 with the successive periods of progress in the fall of meteorites, nearly in
 the same words as        I proposed them in 1861.
     In  the arrival of meteorites on our earth : —
     1.  Single or agglomerated fragments, in their cosmical course, come into
 contact with our globe.
     2. The fragments are arrested by the resistance of atmospheric air.
     3. Pressure,      in their   progress through the atmospheric air, elicits
 light and heat ; rotation ensues, and a melted crust is formed.
     4. The white-hot compressed air is spread out in the form of a fireball,
 closed up behind, and enclosing the fragment, or fragments, and           a vacuum-
 space.
      5. The cosmic course is at an end when the fragment, or the fragments,
 have been arrested by air.
      6. Light and heat are no longer generated ; the vacuum-ball will col
 lapse with a loud report, or several reports following each other.
      7.  The cosmic cold within the aerolite      assists in reducing the heat of  the
 melted crust.
      8. The meteorite falls down upon the earth like any other ponderous
  body, the hotter the better conducting material it consists of.
      In this way    I  believe it was my duty again to lay before the public the
  differences   of  the  views newly taken by M. Daubree from those which I
  hitherto had advocated.
      But while   I was    engaged in contrasting them      I found myself conspicu
  ously supported by a number of recent publications relative to the subject
  in question. In one of his own papers M. Daubree had to register the state
  ment of M. Leymerie, of Toulouse, who considered the fall of Orgueil as
  presenting not one meteoric mass          exploded, but a swarm of aerolites ar
  rived at the same moment.
      But above all, two reports of the fall of 30th January 1868, near Pul-
  tusk, both of them kindly presented to me by their respective authors,
  bore ample testimony in favour of a number of my theses, and enlarged them
  by deeper and more accurate investigation beyond what I formerly proposed.
      These are the memoir " On the Course of the Pultusk Meteorite
                                                                               " *, by

                     by Professor G. vom Rath, in Bonn.
      In both of them the most evident proofs are given of the actuality of a
swarm, consisting of a very great number of distinct aerolites, having en
 tered our atmosphere.
     The course       of the Pultusk meteor, according to M. Galle, met the hori
zontal line        under    an angle of 44 degrees at the place of dispersion, at a
height of 25-25 English miles, or 5£ German miles.                        After its movement
was checked, and the force of it expended in the development of light and
heat, how         would it have      been    possible that, as it would follow from M.
Daubree's supposition, the great mass of the meteor should have risen again
and left our atmosphere to continue its cosmical orbit ? Nor could such be
the case       with the Knyahinya meteor, which pounced upon our earth almost
from the        zenith of the place, the course making an angle only of 6 degrees
with the perpendicular.              But even the Orgueil meteor moved in a direction
meeting       the   horizontal    line at the point of dispersion under an angle of
about 1 1° 26', from which position it certainly could not rise again higher
up into the atmosphere, and still less leave it altogether.
     I availed myself of the circumstance that I had been gratified by several
honoured friends with a number of important publications closely connected
with the subject, to quote some appropriate passages.                     I would refer espe
cially to that grand 'Atlas of Charts of Meteor-tracks,' by Messrs. R. P. Greg
and A. S. Herschel \, together with the " Reports of Luminous Meteors for

Mr. A. S. Herschel's observations with the spectroscope,           we learn that the
condition    of the August meteors is exactly that of a flame of gas in a
Bunsen's    burner  freely charged with the vapour of burning sodium, or of the
flame of a spirit-lamp newly trimmed and largely dosed with a supply of
moistened salt {op. cit. p. 146). The idea of a diminutive fireball containing
the solid mass, although diminutive itself, surrounded by a luminous gaseous
case, including a vacuum, till the force of the movement is spent in heat and
light, may not be considered inadequate to the subject.

the Governor-General,       J.  Russell,  in behalf of the British Government,

earth's attraction upon shower-meteors, independently of Schiaparelli's
disquisitions relative to the same subject, and points out also the circum
stance that some of them may receive such a direction as to leave our solar
system altogether, while Dr. Galle insists upon the fact that the Pultusk
swarm must have entered it with an independent force of at least from 4£
to 7 English miles (1 to      \\ geographical miles).
    My original design was only to offer some appropriate remarks on the
subject of the phenomena of light, heat, and sound generated in and
accompanying the arrival of meteorites on the earth through our terrestrial
atmosphere ; but the different departments of natural science referring to
meteors and meteorites are of so manifold a nature, that I frequently was
obliged to advert to some of them in regard to which           I  should rather have
kept more on the reserve.        But the whole range of meteor- and meteorite-
science,   continually enlarging, more and more clearly presents itself in these
four grand sections : — 1st, the original formation of meteorites ; 2nd, their
 movement through cosmic space ; 3rd, their arrival through the atmosphere
 upon our earth ; and, 4th, the studies instituted on the objects themselves,
 which fall into our hands and are preserved in our museums.             To the third
 of these sections it is that my particular attention was directed.

     The diurnal variations of disturbance, both easterly and westerly, are
 found to be of definite and systematic character, and to be comparable with
 the same variations for other places ; the annual variation is not very
 regular, but the progression in the amounts of disturbance in different
 years accords well (with exception as to the incomplete year 1861) with
 the known character of the decennial variation.             The mean diurnal varia
 tion of    declination, as  well  as  its  semiannual inequality, is of the general
 character due to the latitude in which Bombay lies ; the progression from
 month to month in the annual variation of the diurnal variation is also di
 stinctly marked in all months except July.               A semiannual inequality is
 shown to exist in the      diurnal   variation  of declination whose times of oppo
 sition are the equinoxes.        It is found that this inequality not only exists,
 but has the same general character at five widely separated stations in the
 northern magnetic hemisphere, and also, with some modifications as to cha
 racter, at two stations having south magnetic latitude.           Its special charac
 teristics are   : —
      1st. That, as in the typical mean diurnal variation of declination, there
 is scarcely any change during the night hours, and that the main varia
 tion occurs during half the day, in this case between 1 8 hours and 6 hours,
 local astronomical time.
     2nd. That the range of variation           differs from about half a minute to
  nearly a minute of arc.
     3rd. That the hour of noon is that about which             the deviations due to
  this variation pass through zero, and on each side of which the inflexions
  of the representative curve are inversely, but, in respect to north latitude
  stations, symmetrically disposed.
     4th. The turning-points are         21  hours and 3 hours, the former being a
  maximum, and the latter a minimum for north latitude              stations from Ja
  nuary to June, and for south latitude stations from July to December ;
  and vice versd, for north latitude stations from July to December, and
  for south latitude stations from January to June. The solar-diurnal ine
  quality of declination, in the calculation of which all disturbances are in
  cluded, differs at no hour of the day by more than 0'-061 from the mean
  diurnal variation, which is calculated after the rejection of all observations
  disturbed to the extent of more than l'-4.
      The range of the diurnal variation of declination in different years is
   shown to be subject to a periodical variation, whose times of maxima and
   minima approach nearly to those of the maxima and minima of the decen
   nial period in the amount of yearly disturbance.
      The secular change of absolute declination is found for the years 1859 to

       Biddell Airy, Astronomer Royal. Received July 27, 1868.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The author states that the instruments employed are precisely the same
 which were used in the second part of the former investigation, from 1848
 to 1857, mounted in the same place, and treated in the same manner. In
 describing the treatment of the photographic curves, he first gives the
 number of days which have been omitted in different years ; because the
 character of the observations or curves was too disturbed to permit the
 usual treatment of the observations, or the drawing by hand of a pencil
 curve that would fairly represent the general course of the curve.
    The greatest numbers of omitted days occur in the years 1846, 1847,
  1848; 1851, 1852, 1853, 1854; 1859, 1860. As the estimate of the
 amount of irregularity has been made throughout by the same person, he
 considers that these years may be accepted as those in which the disturb
 ances were the greatest.     If they point to any cycle at all, it is one of 6 or
 6£ years.    These  days being   omitted, the ordinates of the pencilled curves
 on the other days were used as basis of all the following investigations.
 For the solar inequalities, they were treated by collecting the     measures  for
 every complete solar day, or for every solar hour bearing the same ordinal
 number, according as the annual or diurnal inequalities were the subject
 of inquiry ; but in all cases these quantities were next grouped by months,
 and the monthly means were taken.
    In the further treatment, the means of the monthly means of every
 complete day for all the months of the same name in the different years
 were taken and corrected for secular change ; the corrected numbers do
 not appear to indicate any sensible annual equation.          Then the means of
 the monthly means of every solar hour for all the months of the same name
 in the different years were taken, giving the diurnal inequalities on the
 mean   of years for the twelve   separate   months   ; and these present, for the
 declination   (north to west) and horizontal      force, for the period 1858 to
  1863, sensibly the same differences between the summer months and the
 winter months as those for the period 1848 to 1857. For the vertical-force

  164                      The Astronomer Royal on       the              [Dec. 10,
 curves also, the nodal passage in both periods is earliest in the summer
months ; but it is not quite certain whether the curves in autumn, in the
 period 1858 to 1863, are quite so bold as those in 1848 to 1857 ; the dif
ference,  however,   if any, is inconsiderable. After this, the monthly means
of every   solar  hour are taken through each year, giving the mean diurnal
 inequality of each year ; and here a very remarkable change is observable.
To explain this, it is necessary to refer to the former paper, where it is
 shown that the curves for diurnal inequality of the horizontal forces had
very slightly increased from 1841 to 1847, but had rapidly diminished
from 1848 to 1857, giving the smallest and most winter-like curves in 1856
and 1857.      Now it is found that from 1858 to 1863 the curves have in
creased, with a little irregularity in 1861, till they are sensibly as large as
 they were at first.    Thus —
                            1858   nearly resembles 1856
                            1859       „      „      1851
                            1860                     1850
                            1861                     1851
                            1862                    1847
                            1863                    1841
With regard to the diurnal inequality of vertical force, it appears that the
curves gradually increased in boldness to 1855, and have gradually dimi
nished to 1 862.     The nodal passages, it was remarked in the former paper,
had    been  much    accelerated in the hour of the day, from 1842 to 1857.
Now, from 1858 to 1863, the hours of nodal passages have been retarded,
till in 1863 they are again nearly        the same as in 1848.     In all  these re
markable changes there is no appearance of cycle.
    The author then proceeds to the treatment of lunar inequalities from
1848 to 1863.       The bases of their treatment were thus obtained: the
exact time of moon's transit was laid down on the time-scales of the
photographic sheet, and the intervals were divided into lunar hours, and a
new system of ordinates, corresponding to the lunar hours, was measured
to the pencil curves.      The system of grouping was precisely similar, mu
tatis mutandis, to that for the solar inequalities.      First, for the menstrual
inequalities.    The declination seems to exhibit a distinct lunar menstrual in
equality, with + maximum about the fifth day of lunation ; the horizontal
force seems to show a lunar semimenstrual equation with — maximum
 about the second day ; the vertical force shows nothing certain, proving
 only that, if there is anything, it is very small.      Secondly, for the luno-
 diurnal inequalities.     The luno- diurnal inequalities in declination and hori
zontal force on the mean of 1858 to 1863 agree so closely with those on
the mean of 1848 to 1857, as to leave no doubt of their existence and law
as luno-semidiurnal      inequalities, with no trace of luno-diurnal or other
inequality.
    Remarking the singular difference for different years which has presented

itself in the discussion of the solar inequalities, it appeared to the author
very desirable to examine whether there is any discoverable difference in the
lunar inequalities for the same years. The years were accordingly thus di
vided : —
         Large solar curves. .    1848 to 1852, 1859, 1860, 1862, 1863.
         Small solar curves..      1853 to 1858, 1861.
    On discussing  these,  it was found that in all cases the lunar  horary epoch
for the inequality was sensibly the same for years of large solar curves and
for years of small solar curves ; but the coefficient was different. The
value of the fraction

    The author remarks that it would seem possible to suggest two conjec
 tural reasons for this remarkable association in the time-law of changes of
 solar effect and lunar effect.     One is, that the moon's magnetic action is
 really produced by the sun's magnetic action ; and a failure in the sun's
 magnetic power will make itself sensible, both in its direct effect on our
 magnets and in its indirect effect through the intermediation of the moon's
 excited magnetism.       The other is that, assuming both actions (solar and
 lunar) to act  on our magnets    indirectly by exciting magnetic powers in the
 earth, which alone or principally are felt by the magnets, the earth itself
 may have gone through different stages of magnetic excitability, increasing
 or diminishing its competency to receive both the solar and the lunar action.
    The epochs of lunar inequality in western declination from north and in
 horizontal force to magnetic north are sensibly the same ; and the coeffi
 cients expressed in terms of horizontal force on the mean of all the years
 are sensibly the same, and equal to 0'00006 1 . The direction of the com
 posite disturbing force is therefore sensibly N.W. and S.E. magnetic, or
 (roughly) in the direction of a line from the Red Sea to the south of
 Hudson's Bay. It may be remarked in opposition to this that the solar
 diurnal action is mainly in the S.W. direction.
    The luno- diurnal inequality of vertical force on the mean of all the years
appears to consist of a luno-diurnal and a luno-semidiurnal        term.

       William Crookes, F.R.S. &c. Received June 27, 1868.
                                      (Abstract.)
   The measurement of the luminous intensity of a ray of light is        a problem
the solution of which has been repeatedly attempted, but with            less satis
factory  results than   the  endeavours     to  measure   the other radiant  forces.
The problem is susceptible of two divisions, the absolute and the relative
measurement of light.
   A relative photometer is one in which the observer has only to ascer
tain the relative illuminating powers of two sources of light, one of which
is kept as uniform as possible, the other being the light whose intensity is
to be determined.      It is therefore evident that one great thing to be aimed
at is an absolutely uniform source of light.       In the ordinary process of pho
tometry   the  standard   used   is a  candle, defined  by Act of Parliament as a
"sperm of six to the pound, burning at the rate of 120 grains per hour."
This, however, is found to be very variable, and many observers have alto
gether condemned the employment of test-candles as light-measures.
   The author has taken some pains to devise a source of light which should
be at the same time fairly uniform in its results, would not vary by keep
ing, and would be capable of accurate imitation at any time and in any
part of the world by mere description.           The absence of these conditions
seems to be one of the greatest objections to the sperm-candle.           It would
be   impossible for an observer on the continent, ten or twenty years
hence, from a written description of the sperm-candle now in use, to make
a standard which would       bring his photometric results into relation with
those obtained here. Without presuming to say that he has satisfactorily
solved all difficulties, the writer believes that he has advanced some
distance in the right direction, and pointed out the road for further im
provement.
   A  glass lamp is taken of about 2 ounces capacity, the aperture in the
neck being 0-25 inch in diameter ; another aperture at the side allows the
liquid fuel to be introduced ; this consists of alcohol of sp. gr. 0-805, and
pure benzol boiling at 81° C, which are mixed together in the proportion
of five volumes of the former and one of the latter. The wick-holder
consists of a platinum tube, and the wick is made of fifty-two pieces of
platinum wire, each 0-01 inch in diameter.          The flame of this lamp forms
a perfectly shaped cone, the extremity          being sharp, and having no ten
dency  to  smoke  ; without   flicker   or movements   of any kind, it burns when
protected from currents of air at a uniform rate of 136 grains per hour.
   There is no doubt that this flame is very much more uniform than that
of the sperm-candle sold for photometric purposes. Tested against a
candle, considerable variations in relative illuminating power have been
observed ; but on placing two of these lamps in opposition, no such varia
tions have been detected.

1868.]                  of the Luminous Intensity of Light.                          167
    The instrument       devised    for measuring the relative intensities of the
standard and other lights is next described ; it has this in common with
that of Arago described in 1833, as well as with those described in 1853
by Bernard, and in 1854 by Babinet, that the phenomena of polarized
light are used for effecting the desired end*.           But it is believed that the
present arrangement is quite new, and it certainly appears to answer the
purpose in a way which leaves little to be desired.             The instrument cannot
be described without the aid of drawings which accompany the original
paper, but its mode of action may be understood by the following descrip
tion.
     The standard lamp being placed on one of the supporting pillars which
 slide along a graduated stem, it is moved along the bar to a convenient
 distance, depending on the intensity of the light to be measured.                   The
light to be compared is then fixed in a similar way on the other side
 of the instrument.        On looking through the eyepiece two brightly lumi
 nous disks will be seen, of different colours.        One of the lights must now be
 slid along the scale until the two disks of light, as seen in the eyepiece, are
 equal in tint.     Equality of illumination is easily obtained ; for, as the eye
 is observing two adjacent disks of light which pass rapidly from red-green
 to green-red, through a neutral point of no colour, there is no difficulty in
 hitting this point with great precision.            Squaring the distance between
 the flames and the centre will give inversely their relative intensities.
     The delicacy of this instrument is very great. With two lamps, each
 about 24 inches from the centre, it is easy to distinguish a movement of
 one of them to the extent of one-tenth of an inch to or fro,and by using
 the polarimeter an accuracy exceeding this can be attained.
     The employment of a photometer of this kind enables us to compare
 lights of different colours with one another.            So long as the observer, by
  the eyepiece alone, has to compare the relative intensities of two surfaces
  respectively illuminated by the lights under trial, it is evident that, unless
  they are of the same tint, it is impossible to obtain that absolute equality
  of illumination in the instrument which is requisite for a comparison.               By
  the unaided eye one cannot tell which is the brighter half of a paper disk
 illuminated on one side with a reddish, and on the other with a yellowish
  light ; but by using the photometer here described the problem becomes
  practicable.     When the contrasts of colour are very strong (when, for
  instance, one is a bright green and the other scarlet) there is difficulty
  in estimating the exact point of neutrality ; but this only diminishes the
  accuracy of the comparison, and does not render it impossible, as it would
  be according to other systems.
     * Since writing the above, I  have ascertained that M. Jamin had previously devised
  a photometer in which    the principle adopted in the one here described is employed,
  although it is carried out in a different and, as   I  believe, a less perfect manner. —

our inquiries have been, in all essential particulars, fully as satisfactory as
we had ventured to anticipate.     The lateness of the date at which the Ex
pedition started (its departure from Stornoway having been necessarily de
layed until August 1 1th), and the consequent limitation of the time during
which deep-sea dredging would be likely to be practicable, precluded the
idea that the present inquiry could be more than tentative, anything like
a systematic exploration of the Marine Zoology of the area we proposed to
traverse being scarcely to be expected.     In point of fact, during the four
weeks which elapsed between our first departure from Stornoway and our
return to it on September 9th, only nine days were available for dredging in
the open ocean ; and on only four of these were we on a bottom exceed
ing 500 fathoms [914 metres] in depth ; and in our second cruise of a
week's duration, we only dredged once. Yet, as will hereafter appear, we
have been enabled, by this very limited amount of work, not only to add
many new and interesting facts to science, in regard both to the Physics and
the Animal Life of the Ocean ; but also to correct serious errors which have
been sanctioned by high authority, and to lay a definite foundation for more
extended inquiries directed towards the solution of various general questions
of the highest importance.
    5. On the day after our first departure from Stornoway (August       1
                                                                           2) we
were met by a breeze from the N.E., so strong that, although a sounding
was obtained in lat. 59° 20' N. and long. 7°5'W., which indicated a depth
of  at least 500 fathoms [914 metres],   with  a minimum temperature     of 49°
 [9°-4 Cent.], the temperature of the surface-water being 54|° [12°-5 Cent.],
any attempt to dredge was out of the question.
    6. This breeze lasted with considerable force for three days, during
 which, being compelled to lie-to under canvas, we drifted to the northward
 of the deep water; our first soundings after its abatement (August 15th)
 giving depths of 229 and 1 64 fathoms [4 1 9 and 300 metres] respectively,
 with a minimum temperature of 48° [8°'9 Cent.], the temperature of the
 surface-water being 54° [12°-2 Cent.].    As we were then approaching the
 Faroe Banks, we considered it expedient to devote a couple of days to the
 examination of the distribution of Animal Life at these comparatively mode
 rate depths, and then to proceed to the Faroe Islands, reserving the deeper
 water for our return voyage.
    7.  The   average depth of the Faroe Banks is about 60 fathoms [110
 metres],    and their minimum temperature was found to be about 50°
 [10°,0 Cent.] when the temperature of the surface was 53° [ll°-6 Cent.].
 The character of the Marine Invertebrate Fauna of this region exhibited
 the admixture of British and of Boreal      types, which might be expected
 from its temperature and geographical    position, the former decidedly pre
 dominating.      The common Ophiocoma rosula of our own shores (Ophio-
 thrix fragilis of Miiller and Troschel) presents itself in very great abund
 ance,   and probably  furnishes  an important   part of the food of the Cod
 which frequent these banks.

    8. We reached Thorsaven on the morning of August 1 7th ; and, as the
weather was then fine, we applied ourselves without delay to the explora
tion of the Fiords in its vicinity, using for this purpose the boats of the
country, with native boatmen, whose knowledge of the tides and currents
was indispensable to us.          Unfortunately the weather again became so unfa
vourable as to prevent us from extending our inquiries to more distant loca
lities, at the same time that the low state of the barometer rendered it in
expedient to put to sea again for the prosecution of our special object *.
We found, however, that the Shells of the straits and fiords of the Faroes
had been carefully collected by Sysellman Miiller, who has long been in
the habit of availing himself of the opportunities for dredging afforded
by his official visits to different parts of the group ; and that a List
of the Mollusca found in them has been recently published by Dr.
O. A. L. Morch f. The result of our own dredgings, taken in connexion
with the information obtained from these sources, leads us to believe that
further exploration in this locality is not likely to bring out facts of any
special interest.       The tides and currents in the Straits between the islands
are so strong as to render the deepest parts of the mid-channels (in which
alone could any novelty be anticipated) an unsuitable habitation for Marine
Invertebrata      ; and in the long narrow fiords which extend from these between
the elevated ridges of Trap that traverse the interior of the islands the
water is seldom of any considerable depth, and probably contains a large
admixture of fresh water from the almost continuous rainfall which here
prevails.      The general character of the Marine Zoology of the Faroes, as
of their adjacent banks, seems to be just what might be expected from
their position on the border between the British, Scandinavian, and Boreal
provinces.
     9.   At the first indication of improvement in the weather,        we  left Thors
aven on the 26th        of August, with the intention of reaching the deep chan
nel     which  we    expected to find lying E. and W., between the North of
 Scotland and the Faroe Banks, as soon as possible, and of exploring this
 channel as completely as we might be able. At the end of our first day of
steaming southwards, however, we encountered a gale from the S.W.,
 in the course of which the barometer fell to 29 inches, and which was
  severe enough to do much damage to our ship ; and it was not until
 the afternoon of August 29th that, after lying-to for nearly three days
 under      canvas    and   drifting to the    N.E., we     were   able   to  obtain a
 Sounding in lat. 60° 45' and long. 4° 49'. This gave us a depth of 510
 fathoms [933 metres]; and the two thermometers sent down with the
    * We learned on our return home that heavy gales had been experienced at this date
 in British seas.

the temperature of the surface-water being 52° [11°- 1 Cent.].
   10. This very remarkable indication      was fully confirmed the next
morning, when we sounded again in lat. 60° 7' and long. 5° 21', and
found the depth to be 500 fathoms [914 metres], and the minimum
temperature, as given by the mean of three thermometers * (showing
31i° [-0°-2Cent], 32° [0° Cent.], and 33° [0°-5 Cent.] respectively), to
be 32°-2[0°-lCent.], the temperature of the surface-water being 51° [10°-5
Cent.].
   11. We here for the first time had an opportunity of working our
Dredge at this great depth, and found no difficulty in doing so. The
                                 ; and it is important
bottom consisted of sand and stones                    to remark that
the same kind of bottom was met with in all our subsequent soundings
and dredgings in the "cold area" (§§ 12-14). — As might have been
anticipated from the extraordinary reduction of the Temperature, there
proved to be a comparative scantiness of Animal life ; and of the forms
which did present themselves, several belonged to the Boreal Fauna.
Still there were examples of several different groups ; and there was
not that predominance of low forms which some have supposed to cha
racterize the Fauna of great depths.  Indeed the Rhizopoda, of which
we   afterwards                 extraordinary development at the like
                      encountered      an
depth, but in a much warmer temperature, were almost entirely absent.
It is worthy of note that a specimen of Astropecten of a bright red
colour came up adherent to the dredge-line at a distance of 250 fathoms
[457 metres] from the dredge, about 1200 fathoms [2195 metres) of line
being out.    As this animal is entirely unprovided with swimming-organs,
and was found to be of such specific gravity as to sink immediately when
placed in a jar of sea-water, it can scarcely have been taken up anywhere
else than from the sea-bottom          ;    and   if   this be admitted,   it is obvious that
at least 250 fathoms [457 metres] of the dredge-line must have been lying
on that bottom.    Not only on many subsequent occasions did Ophiurida
come up on the like part of the dredge-line, but in our last dredging
(§ 19), from        a depthof 650 fathoms [1189 metres], there came up at
tached to     it,at    adistance of about 50 fathoms [92 metres] from the
dredge, two pieces of         Siliceous Sponge, which most assuredly could not
                              a
have been drawn from any other source than the sea-bottom                     f,
                                                                            and which
included many small living Ophiurida.
  * It had been our intention to make careful comparison of each of these Thermometers
                                           a
with an accurate standard on our return, and thus to have determined with greater pre-
cision the temperatures they respectively indicated; but two of them were unfortunately
lost ina  subsequent Sounding     (§
                                   19).
 t    From this it   isobvious that the Dredge-rope, so far from buoying up the Dredge,
must effectually assist in sinking it, especially when the rope has been solidified        by
previous repeated immersions at great depths.       find the specific gravity of portion of

which had now become of most unexpected interest ; but we were able on
the morning of September 1st to obtain a Sounding, in lat. 60° 10' and
long. 5° 59', which fully confirmed our previous observations.  The depth
was here 550 fathoms [1006 metres], and the minimum temperature in

Sounding gave us a depth of only 170 fathoms [311 metres] ; but even at
this depth we found, with a surface-temperature of 52° [1 1°- 1 Cent.], a
minimum temperature, indicated by the mean of two thermometerst (which
stood at 41£° and 42° respectively), of 41 J° [5°-4 Cent.],— that     about 6°                is,

     15. The weather again occasioned for two days an interruption in our
dredging; and it did not even permit the use of the proper deep-sea
sounding-apparatus.        But a sounding was taken on Sept. 5th, in lat. 60° 30'
and long. 7° 16', with the ordinary deep-sea lead, which showed that there
was no bottom at 450 fathoms [822 metres], and gave a minimum tempe
 rature, indicated by the mean of two thermometers (which marked 33° and
 35^° respectively), of 33]° [0°7 Cent.], the surface-temperature being 50°
 [10°-0 Cent.].
      16. It was then considered expedient to shape our course in a southerly
 direction ; and on the morning of September 6th we found ourselves in lat.
 59° 36' and long. 7° 20'.        Here a very careful Sounding gave a depth of
 530 fathoms [969 metres] ; and the minimum temperature indicated by the
 mean of three thermometers (which registered 47°, 47|°, and 47|° re
 spectively)    was  47j° [8°-5 Cent.], the surface-temperature              being 52|°
  [ll°-4   Cent.].   This result    fully  confirmed    that obtained  by  our  first less
 satisfactory   sounding   in   nearly   the   same   locality  (§ 5),  which    the low
 temperatures subsequently obtained with such uniformity in like depths
  elsewhere had led us to doubt. — We were able on this day to obtain several
  good casts of the Dredge, the results of which proved of extraordinary
  interest.   The bottom consisted of a bluish-white tenacious mud, con
  taining but a small admixture of the Globigerince so abundantly obtained
  by previous soundings from various parts of the sea-bottom of the
  North Atlantic. Imbedded in this mud there came up an extraordinary
  collection of Siliceous Sponges, of new and most remarkable forms ;
  and with these was associated the Hyalonema Sieboldii, which appeared
  to us clearly referable to that Family.               The Rhizopods found in this
  mud were      scarcely less interesting ; for besides numerous specimens
  of the typically triradiate Rhabdammina abyssorum (?), presenting a
  varied range of forms, another large group of gigantic coarsely arena
   ceous   bodies presented themselves, of the most varied shapes, appa
  rently referable to the Astrorhiza limicola* as their fundamental type,
   together with a large and perfect living specimen of Cristellaria, closely
   resembling that common in the Sicilian Tertiaries, and a Cornuspira of
   extraordinary size.    With these lower forms, our dredgings on this bottom
   brought up a considerable variety of higher types, Zoophytes, Echinoderms,
   Mollusks, and Crustaceans; among which may be mentioned, as of special
   interest, two specimens of Rhizocrinus, the small Apiocrinoid whose recent
   discovery by M. Sars on the coast of Norway (see Appendix) may be
   considered as having furnished a principal "motive" of our expedition,
   and a living Oculina prolifera, of which we had on previous occasions
    brought up only dead and worn specimens. — We thus obtained evidence of

the existence,   not of a degraded or starved-out residuum of Animal life, but
of a rich and varied Fauna, including      elevated as well as humble types, at a
depth of 530 fathoms [969 metres].           This Fauna was essentially British
in its general character, but included several types hitherto found only
near the coast of Norway. Since it presented itself on the southern border
of the deep channel intervening between the North of Scotland and the
Faroe Banks, these types must henceforth be considered to appertain equally
to the British province.
     1 7. As it was necessary for us to continue our course towards Stornoway,
we were not able to prosecute further inquiries in this interesting locality,
 as we should otherwise have been most glad to do ; and on the morning          of
 September 7th, in lat. 59° 5' and long. 7° 29', a Sounding gave the com
 paratively small depth of 189 fathoms [345 metres].               We found the
 minimum temperature, indicated by the mean of three thermometers (re
 spectively marking 49^°, 49|°, and 49|°), to be here 49|° [9°-8 Cent.], the
 surface-temperature being 52° [ll0, 1 Cent.]. Here our Dredge brought
 up almost exclusively the ordinary types of the northern shores of Scot
 land, the chief features of interest being the great abundance of Cidaris
papillata, and the occurrence of Antedon celticus (Comatula celtica of
 Barrett), numerous specimens of which had been previously obtained off
 the coast of Ross-shire by Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys. As we approached the
 land, the contents of the dredge became altogether barren of animal life,
 probably on account of the "scour" of the strong currents and tides of
 this locality, and the stony character of its bottom.        In the Minch (the
 channel between the Island of Lewis and the mainland) the dredge again
 brought up a considerable number of well-known North British forms ; and
 at one of our casts it came up full of mud, sticking in which was an extra
 ordinary number of living specimens of Pennatula.
     18. We arrived at Stornoway on the afternoon of September 9 ; and
 here Prof. Wyville Thomson was obliged to leave us, in order to attend
 the Meetings of the Commission on Science and Art Instruction, of which
 he is a member.      As, however, the weather presented an unusually settled
 aspect, and as the results we had already obtained led me strongly to
 desire an opportunity of examining both the Temperature and the Animal
 life of waters still deeper than any we had hitherto sounded, it was thought
 by Captain      May and myself that, notwithstanding          the lateness of the
 season,   it would   be  worth  while   to venture another      short cruise in a
 westerly direction, where we knew, from soundings previously taken, that
 a depth exceeding 1000 fathoms (1829 metres) is to be met with. — After
 refitting our ship and our dredging-apparatus at Stornoway, we left that
 harbour for a second time on September 14, and proceeded in a N.W.
 course, with the view of finding, in the latitude of the region which
 had given us a temperature of 32° [0° Cent.] at a depth of 500 fathoms
 [914 metres], but at some distance to the westward, still deeper water,
 and possibly a still lower temperature (the freezing-point of sea-water being

 1868.]                      on Deep-sea Dredyings.                        175
27°' 4 [— 20,55 Cent.]), and of then running southwards until we should
find ourselves over the deep valley between the Western Hebrides and the
Rockall Bank. In this valley we hoped, from our previous success in work
ing the Dredge at upwards of 500 fathoms, to be able, if weather should
permit, to demonstrate the practicability of examining by its means the
distribution of Animal life at twice that depth.
    19. After a very fine run of 140 miles in a N.W. direction from the Butt
of Lewis, we took a Sounding on the morning of Sept. 15 in lat. 59° 59',
long. 9° 15', and found at 650 fathoms [1189 metres] a bottom of bluish-
white unctuous mud, very like that from which we had brought up the
Siliceous Sponges (§ 16).        The minimum temperature here indicated by
the mean of three thermometers (registering 45°, 46°, and 47£° respec
tively) was 46° [7°-7 Cent.], the surface-temperature being 53° [ll°-6
Cent.]. As it was thus evident that we were in the warm, not in the cold
area of bottom-temperature, we proceeded about 60 miles still further to
the N.W., and on the morning of Sept. 16 we sounded in lat. 60° 38' and
long. 11° 7'. The depth was here 570 fathoms [1043 metres] ; and the
scoop   of the Sounding-apparatus     brought up an almost pure Globigerina
sand.    The  minimum     temperature indicated by two thermometers (regis
tering 46|° and 47^° respectively) was 47° [80,3 Cent.], the surface-tem
perature being 52°. — Still looking for deeper water and a lower temperature,
we proceeded about 50 miles further in the same direction ; and on the
afternoon of that day took another Sounding in lat. 61° 2' and long.
12° 4', which gave a depth of 650 fathoms [1 189 metres].        On this occa
sion our Sinker      and three Thermometers    were unfortunately lost by the
parting of the line in winding-up,    so that we did not ascertain either  the
nature   of the bottom or the minimum temperature       ; but as we had now
reached a latitude    far north of that of the cold depths we had previously
traversed (being    nearly that of the southern end of the Faroe group), we
deemed it inexpedient to proceed further in this direction ; and a cast of
the Dredge was therefore taken at this point, the depth being greater by
 120 fathoms than any at which we had previously worked it. We found
no difficulty in this operation, notwithstanding that the dredge was loaded
with about 2|-cwt. [127 kilog.] of whitish grey mud, of peculiar viscidity,
brought up from a depth (3900 feet) nearly equal to the height of the
highest mountains in Great Britain.        At some 50 fathoms [92 metres]
from the dredge, two whitish tufts were seen on the dredge-rope ; and
these proved to consist of portions of a Siliceous Sponge, quite free from
the mud with which all the specimens previously obtained had been infil
trated.    As it is obvious that these specimens must have been detached by
the dredge-rope in its passage over the surface of the mud (§ 11), it seems
clear that these Sponges, in part at least, project above that surface, which
the infiltrated condition of those previously obtained had caused us to
doubt.    On separating the different parts of the large mass of mud brought
up by the dredge, we found it to be everywhere traversed by fibres, which

176                  Dr. Carpenter's Preliminary Report                           [Dec. 17,
proved to be long siliceous Sponge-spicules ; and our subsequent examina
tion of these has shown them to be the root-fibres of Sponges, the bodies
of which have a siliceous framework of very different structure. As it thus
appears that these Siliceous Sponges, when growing on the surface of the
mud, send root-fibres (so to speak) far and wide into its substance, the idea
previously suggested by Prof. Loven *, that the elongated flint-rope of
Hyalonema Sieboldii is in reality the mud-imbedded stem, supporting the
Sponge with which it is connected, instead of being implanted in the
Sponge and supported by it (which is the commonly received opinion),
seems the more likely. This idea is thought probable by Prof. Wyville
Thomson, who has already paid great attention to the whole group t, and
by whom all the new forms we have obtained will hereafter be fully described.
— Entangled among the fibres of the Sponge were found several small Ophio-
comce,   Polyzoa, Crustacea, and tubicolar Annelida, the tubes of the last
being for the most part composed of Globigerince cemented together, fre
quently in a most regular and beautiful manner.       The only living testa
ceous Mollusk that presented itself was a small specimen of Terebratula
cranium. Imbedded in the mud were found a specimen of Kophobelemnon
Miilleri (a type allied to Pennatula) in full life, and two headless stems
of Rhisocrinus, the perfectly fresh aspect of which leads me to believe
that they must have grown on the spot, and have been mutilated in the
sifting of the mud in which they were imbedded.       This mud contained a
considerable proportion (about 60 per cent.) of Globigerina, together
with some remarkably large Biloculince and other Milioline forms—
The general character of this Fauna obviously bore a close relation to
that of our previous dredging in a similar bottom ; and though we can
not positively affirm the Temperature of that bottom to be the same,
yet we have not merely the evidence of a previous Sounding in a locality
not far removed from      it,
                          but also that of Sounding subsequently taken in
                                                a

which we hoped, from soundings previously made and recorded, to be able
to extend our inquiries to greater depths ; but unfortunately a breeze had
now set in from the N.E., which was strong enough to prevent us not
only from dredging but even from sounding ; and this breeze freshened
on the night of Sept. 19 to a gale, which made it prudent to seek the
shelter of the land by running to the eastward. Notwithstanding a partial
abatement on the afternoon of the next day, it was considered by Capt.
May that, having due regard to the uncertain aspect of the weather, to the
state of the barometer, and to the season of the year, as well as to the fact
that the time assigned by the Admiralty for our remaining at sea was on
the point of expiring, it would not be prudent to hold on as we were, for
the slight chance of being able to accomplish our object.    Our course was
therefore directed to Oban, which we reached on the afternoon of
Sept. 21 *.

the same line of inquiry.

Sabine, who was a member of that Expedition, has been kind enough
to furnish me with the following more ample particulars of this occur
rence : — "'The ship sounded in 1000 fathoms, mud, between one and
two miles off shore (lat. 73° 37' N., long. 75° 25' W.) ; a magnificent
Asterias caput-medusce was entangled by the line and brought up with
very little damage. The mud was soft and greenish, and contained spe
cimens of Lumbricus tubicola.'   So far my written journal ; but I can
                        recollection, that the heavy deep-sea weight had

water.  The Starfish had been entangled in the line so little above the
mud, that fragments of its arms, which had been broken off in the ascent
of the line, were picked out from amongst the mud."
   It hence seems indubitable that the Asterias (Astrophyton) and the
Tubicolar Annelids were brought up from          the bottom   ;   and the only doubt

 that can fairly be thrown upon the value of this observation has reference
 to the precise depth indicated by the Sounding, this having been made
 according to the old method now abandoned as unreliable.                  The circum
 stances under which this sounding was taken, however, render it probable
 that the actual depth     was not much less than that recorded.
     In another Sounding, in calm water, and with a smooth sea (lat. 72° 23'
 N., long. 73° 7' W.), a depth of 1050 fathoms was obtained with great
 precision  ;  and a small Starfish was found attached to the line below the
 point marking 800 fathoms.
     The subsequent explorations of Prof. Edward Forbes *, on which he
 founded the opinion that a zero of animal life would be found at 300 fathoms
  [548 metres], did not themselves go deeper than 230 fathoms [420 metres] ;
 yet his high authority on questions of this nature caused his opinion to be
 very generally adopted, alike by Zoologists, Physical Geographers, and Geo
 logists.
     The fallacy of Prof. E. Forbes's assumption, however, was demon
 strated by the results of Dredgings carried on in Sir James Ross's Antarctic
 Expedition, at depths of from 270 to 400 fathoms, which yielded evi
 dence of great abundance and variety of Animal life between those depths.
 Dr. J. D. Hooker has kindly placed in my hands some extracts from
 his Journal, which give much fuller particulars of these results than are to
 be found in Sir James Ross's Narrative t.
     On the 28th of June, 1845, the ill-fated Mr. Harry Goodsir, who was a
 member of Sir John Franklin's expedition, obtained in Davis's Straits, from
 a depth of 300 fathoms, " a capital haul, — Mollusca, Crustacea, Asterida,

     I am not aware that between this date and that at which the researches
 of MM. Sars commenced, any Dredging            was carried on at depths exceeding
 those now specified    ; and the additions to our knowledge of the Life of the
 deep sea,  with one remarkable exception to be presently noticed (p. 182), were
 made through the instrumentality of the improved Sounding-apparatus,

with on      the spot on which it drops.           This method of examination must
obviously be very inferior to Dredging in collecting-power ; nevertheless
it has yielded some very important results.
     In the year 1855, Prof. Bailey (of West Point, U.S.) published a " Mi
croscopic Examination of Deep Soundings from the Atlantic Ocean"*,
between lat. 42° 4' and 54° 1 7' North, and long. 9° 8' and 29° 0' West, and at
depths of from 1080 to 2000 fathoms.                  He stated that " none of these
soundings contain a particle of gravel, sand, or other recognizable Mineral
matter ; and that they are all made up of the shells of Globigerince and
 Orbulince, with a fine calcareous mud derived from the disintegration of
those shells, containing a few siliceous skeletons of Polycystina and spi
cules of Sponges."         Connecting these results with those furnished by pre
vious Soundings in the western portions of the Atlantic, Prof. Bailey in
 ferred that with the exception of a spot near the bank of Newfoundland,
 in which the bottom at 175 fathoms was found to be made up of
 quartzose sand without any traces of organic forms,
                                                                       " the bottom of the
 North Atlantic Ocean, so far as examined, from the depth of about
 60 fathoms to that of 2000 fathoms, is literally nothing but a mass of mi
 croscopic shells;" and he explicitly likened this deposit to the Chalk of
 England and the Calcareous Marls of the Upper Missouri. After stating
  that examination of samples of ocean-water, taken at different depths in
  situations in close proximity to the places where the soundings were made,
 yielded no trace of Foraminifera, he concludes with the following ques
  tions : — " Do they live on the bottom at-the immense depths where they
  are found, or are they borne by submarine currents from their real habitat ?
  Has the Gulf-stream any connexion, by means of its temperature or its cur
  rent, with their distribution
                                     "                               Prof. Bailey does not
                                   ?    Upon   these questions
  seem ever to have given a decided opinion ; although              he   inclined to the be
  lief that the Globigerince and Orbulince had not lived on the bottom where
  they were found, but had either been transported thither by currents, or had
  lived nearer the surface of the sea, and had fallen to the bottom after death.
  On the other hand, Prof. Ehrenberg, to whom specimens of these Sound
  ings were forwarded, expressed his conviction (based on the condition of
  the organic substance contained in the cavities of the shells) that these
  Foraminifera     had lived on the bottom from which they were brought up.
      Similar conclusions regarding the extensive diffusion of Globigerince over
  the deep-sea bottom of the North Atlantic were drawn by Prof. Huxley
  from his examination of the Soundings brought up by Lieut. -Commander
  Dayman, from depths of from 1700 to 2400 fathoms f.                         Of the whole
  mass of the fine muddy sediment of which these soundings consisted, it is
 estimated by Prof. Huxley that 85 per cent, consisted of Globigerince ;
  5  per cent, of other Foraminifera, of, at most, not more than four or five

species;   and the remaining 10 per cent, partly of Siliceous organisms
 (Diatoms and Polycystina), partly of mineral fragments, and partly of
the very minute granular bodies designated by Prof. Huxley Coccoliths.
These granules he described as apparently consisting of several concentric
layers surrounding a minute clear centre, and looking at first sight some
what like single cells of the plant Protococcus ; but as they are rapidly
and completely dissolved by dilute acids, their composition cannot be
organic. With reference to the question whether the Globigerince actually
live at these    depths, Prof. Huxley says,        "The balance of probabilities
seems to me to incline in that direction.          And there is     one circumstance
which weighs strongly in my mind.              It may be taken as a law that any
genus of animals which is found far back in time is capable of living
under a great variety of circumstances as regards light, temperature, and
pressure.    Now the genus Globigerina is abundantly represented in the
                                            "
Cretaceous epoch, and perhaps earlier           (op. cit. p. 67).
    The results obtained by Prof. Bailey and Prof. Huxley, in regard to the
prevalence of Globigerince over a large part of the sea-bottom in the North
Atlantic Ocean, were confirmed and extended by the observations of Dr.
Wallich, made during the voyage of the 'Bull-dog' in 1860; and as he was
able to examine the condition     of the Globigerince when freshly brought up,
his testimony furnishes an important corroboration of Prof. Ehrenberg's
conclusion.     " The Globigerina," he says *, " have never been detected
free-floating in any number in deep, or forming deposits in shallow
 waters ; a considerable proportion of those met with in deep-sea deposits
 exhibit every appearance of vitality ; and their maximum development is
 associated with the presence of the Gulf-stream, but only through the
 operation of collateral conditions prevailing at great depths below the
 current itself."   But in addition, the ' Bull-dog' sounding-line brought up
 a cluster of Ophiocomce attached to a portion of it which had lain on the
 bottom at a depth of 1260 fathoms ; and Globigerina were found, with other
matters, in their stomachs. Further, in various localities, at depths ranging
from 871 to 1913 fathoms, tubes of small Tubicolar Annelids were brought
up ; and some of these were found to be composed of Globigerina-shells
 cemented together, whilst others were made up of an admixture of Sponge-
spicules and minute Calcareous debris.          Lastly a living Serpula, Spirorbis,
 and  a group of Polyzoa were brought up from a depth of 680 fathoms,
 and a couple of living Ampldpod Crustacea from a depth of 445 fathoms.
 " Taking into consideration the arguments adduced to prove that the con
 ditions which prevail on the deep-sea bed are not incompatible with the
 maintenance of animal life, and the extreme improbability that the crea
 tures heretofore discovered at great depths are merely exceptional or acci
 dental examples, it will,  I think, be conceded that the presence of a living
 Fauna in the deeper abysses of the ocean has been fully established" f.

universal assent of Naturalists.          It is still urged* that the Globigerince lived
at or near    the  surface,     and  that   they only fell to the bottom after death.
And it has been thought by many to be more probable that the Ophiocomce
had been entangled by the Sounding-line during either its descent or its
ascent through the water, than that they had lived on the bottom.                         Our

abundance of living Globigerince and Ophiocomce entangled in the recesses of

Sponges, the statements of Dr. Wallich with regard to these animals,
which    I  had always myself regarded as probable, may now be considered
as   put beyond reasonable question t.
    The general bearings of the facts thus brought to light, together with
those furnished by the earlier observations of Sir John Ross and others,
are fully and ably discussed by Dr. Wallich ; but I must content myself
with the following citation of his conclusions, referring to his Treatise for
the arguments on which they rest : —
    " Basing my arguments, then, on two facts which               I venture to hope are
unequivocally proved in the preceding pages, namely that highly organized
creatures have been captured in a living condition at depths vastly exceed
ing those to which animal life had previously been supposed to extend, and
that their presence, when captured, cannot be regarded as an accidental or
exceptional phenomenon, it has been my endeavour to establish the follow
ing important propositions : —
    " I. The conditions prevailing           at great depths, although differing ma
terially from those which prevail near the surface of the ocean, are not in
compatible with the maintenance of animal life.
    " II. Assuming        the doctrine of single specific centres to be correct, the
occurrence of the same species in shallow water and at great depths proves
that it must have undergone the transition from one set of conditions to
the other with impunity.
    "III.    There is nothing        in the nature of the conditions prevailing             at
great depths to render it impossible that creatures originally, or through
acclimatization, adapted to live under them should become capable of living
in shallow water, provided the transition be sufficiently gradual ; and hence
it is possible that species^ now inhabiting shallow water may at some an
terior period have been inhabitants of great depths.

   t  I had myself    accepted Dr. Wallich's inference in regard to the Ophiocoma on the
following    grounds : — first, because, having often kept Ophwcomm in an aquarium for
 several weeks together,   I  never saw them swim, and do not believe that they are capable
of moving in any other way than by crawling over a solid surface; and second, because
I  know it to be their habit to cluster round a rope lying along the bottom they fre
quent, — the first  I  ever saw alive having been obtained for me by the Harbour-master
of Plymouth, who sank a rope in a part of the Sound which he knew to be frequented
by them, and drew it up again after some hours, covered with Ophiocoma.

    " IV. On      the one hand the conditions prevailing near the surface of the
 ocean render it possible for organisms to subside after death to the greatest
depths, provided every portion of their structure is freely pervious to fluid.
On the other hand, the conditions prevailing at great depths render it im
possible for organisms still constituted to live under them to rise to the
surface, or for the remains of these organisms after death to make their
appearance in shallow water.
    "V.    The discovery of       even a single     species   living normally    at great
depths warrants the inference that the deep sea has its own special fauna,
and that it has always had it in ages past ; and hence that many fossili-
ferous strata, heretofore regarded as having been deposited in comparatively
shallow water, have been deposited at great depth" *.
    In 1861 the very important fact was made public by M. Alphonse
Milne-Edwards f, that when the Submarine Telegraph-cable between
Sardinia     and Algiers was taken up for repair, several living Polyparies
and Mollusks were attached to portions of it which had been submerged
to a depth of from 2000 to 2800 metres, or from 1093 to 1577 fathoms.
Of    these,  some     had been previously considered very rare, or had been
altogether unknown; whilst others were only known in a fossil state
as belonging to the Fauna of the later Tertiaries of the Mediterranean
 basin.
    In the Swedish Expedition to Spitzbergen in 1861, a compact mass of
clay was brought up from 1400 fathoms by the

the temperature of the interior of which was found to be 32°-5 [0°-3 Cent.],
the temperature of the surface-water being 390-2 [4° Cent].                   "Notwith
standing this low degree of warmth, there were found several marine
animals of different types and classes — amongst others a moderately large
Polyparium, probably belonging to the Hydroid class, a bivalved Mussel,

colours   "J.
    Of the very important researches which have              been subsequently carried
on by    Prof. Sars of Christiania and his Son, we knew little more, when we
proceeded on our own cruise, than is stated in Prof. Wyville Thomson's
letter (Appendix).         But I have since learned from the recently published
Report    §,  which    Prof.  Sars has been good enough to transmit to me, that
their Dredgings have ranged between 200 and 450 fathoms, and that no
fewer than 427 species have been collected within this range, which he
classifies as follows : —

    Shortly after our return, I learned that an exploration of the deep sea
 by means of the Dredge had been very successfully commenced by Count
Pourtales, in connexion with the United States Coast Survey ; and I have
since received from Mr. Alexander Agassiz the following account of its
results : — " He has dredged to 500 fathoms along quite a line of sections
between Florida and Cuba; and under this pressure of nearly 100 atmo
spheres he has found Echini, Starfishes, Ophiuridans, Crinoids, Corals,
many kinds of Crustacea, Annelids, Mollusca, Molluscoids, and, in fact,
 a Fauna      as  plentifully represented         as  along the most populous of our
 marine shore-fauna.          It has been decided to send Mr. Pourtales again this
winter    ; and with his former experience and additional equipment, we may
look for grand results.          The facilities placed at his disposal are very great ;
as his dredging-work        is done in connexion with regular soundings carried
 on by the Survey of the Gulf-stream commenced by Mr. Bache and pro
 secuted by his successor Prof. Pierce"*.
    Our own Dredgings, which have extended to a depth of 650 fathoms,
 are  still the deepest of which I have any knowledge.                 They were accom
 plished without any serious difficulty, and with results fully as satisfactory
 as those of ordinary shore-dredging.                And I have no doubt that similar
 dredges, worked by adequate engine-power, would answer equally well at
 those far greater depths, our knowledge of the living inhabitants of which
 has been hitherto limited (with the notable exception of the Mediterranean
    * A fuller notice of  these results    will be found in Silliman's Journal for November
 1868, and Annals of Nat.    Hist. Jan.   1869.

184                       Dr. Carpenter's Preliminary Report                  [Dec. 17,
cable, p. 182) to the few forms that have been brought up by the              Sounding-
apparatus*.
    I. The      collective results of these recent Dredgings have conclusively
established the justice of the inference formerly drawn by Dr. Wallich from
the more restricted data he had collected, as to the existence of a varied and
abundant submarine Fauna, at depths which have been generally supposed
to be either altogether azoic, or occupied only by Animals of very low type.
And     a complete disproof has thus been furnished           of the doctrine, against
which Dr. Wallich argued with great force, that           a certain amount     of bathy-
metric pressure must be prejudicial,        if not  absolutely fatal, to higher forms
of Animal life.
    In much that       has been put forward upon this subject, two important con
siderations have been altogether ignored : —first, that pressure will not act
upon an Animal whose body entirely consists of solid and liquid parts, in
the same manner as it acts upon one that includes air-cavities ; and second,
that as fluids press equally in all directions, an Animal immersed at any
depth is just as free to move one part upon another, as it would be if living
near the surface.           The right point from which to look at this subject has
long appeared to me to be the condition of a drop of water, conceived as
carried down from the surface to a depth (say) of 1100 fathoms [2012
metres], at which the pressure will be about 200 atmospheres, or 3000 lbs.
 [1360 kilogr.] upon the square inch.              Let it be conceived that this drop
is inclosed in a pellicle       of the thinnest possible membrane, fitted only to
separate     it  from   the  surrounding medium, but having in itself no power of
resistance.        Now it is obvious that this drop would maintain its form,
whatever this may have originally been, entirely unchanged, being neither
flattened-out into a plane, nor reduced to a sphere, by pressure to any
amount which acts upon it equally in all directions ; while its bulk will
only undergo reduction, under a pressure of 200 atmospheres, to the extent
of   less   than one-hundredth.         Next, let us suppose, instead of a drop of
water contained within a pellicle, a particle of the semifluid "sarcode" of
which the body of a Jtbizopod is composed ; in which the more liquid
interior (endosarc) is contained by a more tenacious external layer (ecto-
sarc), the contractility of which gives rise to cont;nual changes of form,
 that are subservient to the movement of the creature from place to place,
 and also to the ingestion of its food.           Now, it will be obvious to any one
 who follows out the law of fluid pressure in its application to an Animal of
this simple constitution, that so long as these changes of form do not
involve a change of bulk, pressure to any amount exerts no antagonizing
influence ; so that its movements can be performed with the same freedom
on the ocean- bottom as they can be near the surface.               And, further, even
    * It is reported  that the Swedish Expedition, which has recently returned from Spitz-
bergen,    has brought up a considerable number and variety of animals from depths of
2000 fathoms and upwards ; but whether these were obtained
                                                                  by the Dredge or by the

1868.]                         on Deep-sea Dredgings.                            185
when the bulk of the body is augmented by the ingestion of solid or liquid
particles (say the reception of a zoospore of a Protophyte as food, or the
filling of the "contractile vesicle" with water from without, which seems
to be a sort     of respiratory process), just as much pressure will be exerted
by    the   superincumbent liquid in forcing those particles into the body as is
exerted upon the exterior of the body in resisting its distension ; so that
here, again, the influence of that pressure will be practically nil. —        If  the
actions of any purely aquatic Animal of more complex structure be looked
at from the same point        of view,  I am persuaded that it will be found that
they are not practically interfered with by fluid pressure to any amount, —
such pressure not having any tendency to alter either the general form of
the body, or the shape of its softest and most delicate parts, and not inter
fering in the least either with the movements of these parts one upon
the other, or with the circulation of fluid in their interior, or with those
molecular changes which are concerned in their nutrition.
     II. The results we have obtained fully justify the confident expectation
 we had formed and expressed (see Appendix), on the basis afforded by
 the observations      of M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards on the Mediterranean
 Cable, and by the results of the dredgings of M. Sars, jun., that the
 systematic exploration of the Ocean-bottom, at depths much greater
 than are usually to be found near land, would bring to light many forms
 of Animal life, either altogether         new to science, or hitherto supposed
 to be limited to particular localities, or known only as belonging to a Geo
 logical epoch supposed to have terminated.          For one and the same cast of
  the dredge, in the singularly productive locality specified in § 16, brought
 up specimens of the highest interest belonging to each of these categories ;
 so that if we had been able, by remaining there even for a few days, to
 work this ground thoroughly, a much larger addition might have been
 fairly expected from this one spot, — still more, therefore, if the inquiry
 should be extended over that much wider area in which, as will presently
 appear, the like conditions prevail.         For it must have been a strangely
 fortunate      accident   that brought    together into our dredge     so  remark
 able     a collection   of Vitreous Sponges and gigantic        Rhizopods    (many
 of them altogether new, and the rest known only as inhabitants of very
  distant localities, — with the Rhizocrinus previously obtained only in one
  spot more than 600 miles off), if these were not diffused tolerably abun
  dantly as well as widely ; and the probability that they are so rises almost
  to a certainty, when it is borne in mind that the next dredgefull that was
  obtained from a bottom          similar both in character and in temperature,
  though at a depth of 1 20 fathoms greater, and at a distance of 200 miles
  in a straight line, showed distinct evidence of the prevalence of similar
 types (§ 19).
       III.  Our researches have conclusively established the existence of a
   minimum Temperature* at least as low as 32° [0° Cent.] over a considerable
     * It is obvious that any error in our Thermometers, arising from the pressure of

area, where the depth was 500 fathoms [9 14 metres] and upwards;                  notwith
standing that the *ur/aee-temperature varied little from 52° [11°-1 Cent.],
alike in this region and in neighbouring areas of similar depth, in which the
minimum temperature was only a few degrees beneath that of the surface.
The current doctrine in regard to deep-sea temperatures may be considered
to be that expressed by Sir J. Herschel (Physical Geography, 1861, p. 45)
in the following terms : — " In very deep water all over the globe a uniform
temperature of 39° Fahr. [4° Cent.] is found to prevail, while above the
level, when that temperature is first reached, the ocean may be considered
as divided into three great regions or zones — an equatorial and two polar.
In the former of these, warmer, in the latter colder, water is found-at the
surface.     The lines of demarcation are of course the two isotherms of 39°
mean annual temperature."             This doctrine, which is more fully and ex
plicitly set forth by Dr. Wallich ('The North-Atlantic Sea-bed,' 1862,
pp. 98, 99), rests, I believe, chiefly on the temperature-observations made
in Sir James Ross's Antarctic Expedition, which were not inconsistent with
the prevalent belief that «ea-water, like fresh water, has its maximum
density at this temperature, and that consequently water at 32° or 33°
cannot underlie water at 39°.           Several instances, however, had been pre
viously   recorded,   in which  temperatures below 39° had been observed. Thus
 Lieut. S.   P. Lee, of the United States Coast Survey, in August 1847 found
37° below the Gulf-stream,        at the depth  of   1000 fathoms [1 829 metres],        in
lat. 35°  26' N. and long. 73° 12'W.; and Lieut. Dayman found the tempe
rature   at  1000 fathoms [1829 metres] in lat. 51° N. and long. 40° W. to
be 32° 7' [0°-4 Cent.], the surface-temperature being 54°-5 [12°-5 Cent.]*.
 "At the very bottom of the Gulf-stream," says Lieut. Maury (Physical
Geography of the Sea, 1860, p. 58),
                                           " when its surface-temperature was 80°
[26°-6 Cent.], the deep-sea thermometer of the Coast Survey has recorded a
temperature as low as 35° [l°-6 Cent.]. These cold waters doubtless come
down from the north to replace the warm waters sent through the Gulf-
stream to moderate the cold of Spitzbergen ; for within the Arctic Circle the
temperature at corresponding depths off the shores of that island is said to
be only one degree colder than in the Caribbean Sea, while on the shores of
Labrador and in the Polar Sea the temperature of the water beneath the
ice was invariably found by Lieut. De Haven at 28° [ — 2°-2 Cent.], or 4°
below the melting-point of freshwater ice.            Capt. Scoresby relates that on
the coast of Greenland, in latitude 72°, the temperature of the air was 42°
[5°-5 Cent.], of the water 34° [1°-1 Cent.], and 29° [-l°-6 Cent.] at the
depth of 118 fathoms       "t.     That there is   no  Physical improbability in        the
100 atmospheres   to which their bulbs were subjected,  would prevent them from record
ing  a minimum   as low as the actual minimum ; and    it seems to us not at all improbable
that the actual minimum may have been from 2° to 4° lower than the recorded
minimum. — In any renewal of the inquiry, it will be of course desirable that the
Thermomctric apparatus used should be specially protected from this source of error.

 existence of a stratum of sea-water at a temperature of 32° or even 28°
below a stratum at 39°, is evident from the fact (which has been experimen
tally established beyond question *) that Sea-water, in virtue of its saline
 impregnation, contracts continuously down to its ordinary freezing-point,
 which is below 28° Fahr.                 And the existence of such strata, even in
 Equatorial regions, has been regarded by high scientific authorities                          f   as
 proving the existence of deep currents bringing cold water from Polar Regions
 to replace the warmer water that is continually flowing, as (notably) in the
 Gulf-stream, from the Equatorial towards the Polar Regions, as well as to
make good the immense loss which is constantly taking place by evapo
ration from the surface of Tropical seas %.                To such an under-current, pro

cold water flowing from the Polar regions towards the Equator.                  The following well-
known experiment clearly illustrates the manner of this movement.                A glass vessel is to
be filled with water with which some powder has been mixed,               and is then to be heated
at bottom.     It will soon be seen, from the motion of the particles of powder, that cur
rents are set up in opposite directions through the water.            Warm water rises from the
bottom, up through the middle of the vessel, and spreads over the surface, while the
colder and therefore heavier liquid falls down at the sides of the glass.              Currents like
these must arise    in  all water-basins,  and even   in  the oceans,   if  different parts of their
surface are unequally     heated.     The water that is cooled in the polar regions sinks and
travels  from the poles towards the equator, pushing away the warmer and lighter liquid
from the bottom of the sea; itself to give way in turn, as it gets warm, to the colder
 water that follows after it.      This continual flow of the water from the cold zones is re
placed in a twofold manner.        The warm water of the tropical sea3, since it is the lightest,
must spread itself north and south over the surface of the ocean, and thus gradually losing
its heat, be carried to the polar regions.      Between the tropics, too, evaporation goes on
most vigorously, and a great part of the vapours        formed  fall again in rain and snow only
in higher latitudes."

     Of its northern limit we are not able to give any account ; but about
 50 miles to the southward we found the temperature at the same depth
 to be 15° higher [8°-3 Cent.] ; and since the like temperature showed
 itself  at even greater depths           to the westward,    between     lat.  59° 59' and
 60° 38', and inferentially        (§    19) as far north as 61° 2', at a distance      of 1 75
 miles from the most westerly point to which we traced this cold area,                        it
 may be presumed that this area was as limited in a westerly as we found                      it
 to be in a southerly direction.             Here, therefore, within a short distance of
 the Northern Coast of Scotland, an opportunity is presented for determining
 with great precision the physical conditions of two opposing currents, hav
 ing a difference of temperature of at least 15°.              In such determination it
  of 1800 fathoms    and upwards, the surface-temperature     being 75°.     It seems impos
 sible  to account  for this fact on any other hypothesis than that of a deep current from
  the Antarctic Polar region, which must have maintained this extremely low temperature
 throughout the vast course it has had to traverse.

 18G8.]                          on Deep-sen Dredgings.                             189
would be very desirable to ascertain whether the minimum temperature is
that of the bottom (a point of fundamental importance as regards the dis
tribution of Animal life), or whether it is that of some intermediate stratum.
The deep-sea Sounding-apparatus with which we were provided only al
lowed the attachment of the Thermometers to the extremity of the line ;
and it is possible, of course, that their minimum may represent, not the
temperature of the sea-bottom, but that of some higher stratum.                   Inde
pendently, however, of the physical improbability (for the reason already
stated) that Sea-water at 32° should overlie water of any higher temperature,
which would be specifically lighter than itself, we have the evidence afforded
by our Sounding in 170 fathoms (§ 13) within the cold area, that the tem
perature descends progressively with the depth ; at first (as elsewhere ob
served) more rapidly, afterwards more slowly.               And as this shallow bank
is of very limited extent, and the bottom in its neighbourhood must
become rapidly deeper, a careful examination of the bottom-temperature of
its inclined sides at different depths would furnish satisfactory data on this
point.
    IV. A general comparison of the Faunae of the different localities which
we had the opportunity of examining seems to warrant the conclusion that
the distribution of the Animal life of the seas beyond the Littoral zone* is
more closely related to the temperature of the water than to its depth. The
predominance of North British types, not merely on the southern but on the
northern side of the deep valley which separates the Faroe Banks from the
coast of Scotland, and in theioarwareaof the valley itself, the slight admixture
of exclusively Scandinavian or Boreal forms even as far north as the Faroe
Islands, the larger admixture of these on the shallow bank in the cold current,
the still greater proportion of Boreal forms in the deeper and yet colder waters
of that current, and (in most striking contrast with this) the presence of
forms hitherto known only as inhabitants of the warmer temperate seas at the
like depth in the warm area not many miles off, — all indicate the intimacy of
the relationship between Geographical distribution and Temperature.                The
existence of Boreal types in the midst of an area whose surface-temperature
is 52° [1   1°-1  Cent.], and whose bottom-temperature,         even at 500 fathoms'
 [914 metres] depth, is generally 47° or 48° [8°-3 or 8°-8 Cent.], is obviously
a phenomenon parallel          to the occurrence of Alpine plants at a high eleva
tion on mountains within the tropics ; and as every Botanist would regard
such occurrence as having no relation to elevation per se, but only to eleva-
   * The distribution of marine Animal life in the Littoral zone is affected by a great
number of conditions, which place it in altogether a different category from that of t he
deeper seas.    I am very glad to find our views on this point in harmony with those of
 my friend Mr.     J. Gwyn Jeffreys.

tion as affecting Temperature, so it is obvious that, with the evidence w e are
enabled to present of an abundant and varied Fauna at a depth of even 650
fathoms [1189 metres], the Zoologist is fully justified in attributing the far
different character of the Fauna we encountered at 500 fathoms [914 metres]
with a Temperature of 32° [0° Cent.] to that remarkable reduction. —
Further, although the nature of the bottom has doubtless an important
influence on the Animal life which it sustains, yet this very condition,
 as will presently appear, is itself dominated in great degree by Tem
perature.
    V. The results of our Dredgings fully confirm the indications afforded by
the specimens of the bottom previously brought up by the Soundings already
noticed, in regard to the existence, on the sea-bottom of large areas of the
North Atlantic, of a stratum of "calcareous mud," partly composed of living
 Globigerince, partly of the disintegrated materials of the shells of former
 generations, and partly of the
                                          " coccoliths " of Prof. Huxley
                                                                          (loc. cit.) and
 the  " coccospheres " of Dr. Wallich           *, with a greater or less admixture of
 other constituents.        And they further indicate that the prevalence of this
 deposit is connected with a bottom-temperature of 45° and upwards,
 which, in latitudes above 56°, can scarcely be attributed to any other influ
 ence than -that of the Gulf-stream.               The examination which Prof. Hux
 ley has been good enough to make of the peculiarly viscid mud brought
 up in our last dredging at the depth of 650 fathoms [1189 metres], has
 afforded him a remarkable confirmation of the conclusion he announced at
 the recent Meeting of the British Association, that the coccoliths and
 coccospheres are imbedded in a living expanse of protoplasmic substance, to
 which they bear the same relation as the spicules of Sponges or of Radiolaria
 do to the soft parts      of those animals.        Thus it would  seem that the whole
 mass   of this mud    is penetrated by a       living organism of   a type even lower,
 because    less  definite, than that of Sponges and Rhizopods ; and to this
 organism     Professor   Huxley has given the name of Batfiybius f. In what
 manner the materials for its protoplasm, as for that of the Globigerince which
 usually accompany it in larger or smaller proportion, are obtained, is a most
 perplexing problem.          All the evidence we at present possess in regard to
 the alimentation of Rhizopods, leads to the belief that, in common with
 higher Animals, they depend upon the Organic Compounds previously ela
 borated by Vegetative agency under the influence of the light and heat of
 the Sun.      But every form of Vegetable life that is visible to the naked eye
 seems entirely wanting at great depths in the ocean : and although this
 deposit is found by the Microscope to contain the siliceous loricm of Diatoms,
 yet these do not present themselves in anything like the abundance that
 would be required for the nutrition of so large a mass of Animal life as that

represented by the Globigerina-^Ws ; and there appears good reason to
regard them as rather representing Diatoms which have lived at or near the
surface, and have only subsided to the bottom after death, than organisms
which habitually live and grow in the ocean-depths.                            It may be that the
Bathybius        (which bears a very striking resemblance to the Rhiiopod-like
mycelium of the Myxogastric Fungi) has so far the attributes of a Vege
table, that it is able to elaborate Organic Compounds out of the materials
supplied by the medium in which it lives, and thus to provide sustenance
for the Animals         imbedded in its midst.              But to whichever of these two
 Kingdoms         we refer it, there seems adequate reason for regarding this
Bathybius        as one of the chief instruments whereby the solid material of
 the Calcareous mud which it pervades is separated from its solution                                      in
 the ocean-waters        *.
     In connexion with this subject it may                  be suggested, as a subject well
worthy of experimental inquiry, to what depth the Actinic rays penetrate
 Sea-water in sufficient intensity to produce an appreciable effect on a highly
 sensitive surface.          Certain it is that among the Animals brought up from
 great depths, bright colours are not wanting.                        This was noticed by Dr.
 Wallich      in the case of the Ophiocomce brought up from 1260 fathoms.
And not only did the Astropecten, which came up on our dredge-liue from
 500 fathoms, at once attract attention by its bright orange-red hue, but
 the small Annelids which inhabited the Siliceous Sponge brought up from
 650 fathoms were             distinguished    by the vividness of their red or green
 coloration.

large area was marked out by our Dredgings at the extreme distance of
200 miles, and by several         intermediate
                                        Soundings   and the variations in

its character corresponded closely with those which present themselves in
different parts of the same stratum of Chalk.
   VII. But besides confirming the views already promulgated, as to the
complete dependence of this Calcareous deposit on the enormous develop
ment of low forms of Organic Life, our researches also show that the area
over which this deposit      is  being formed      ispeopled       by
                                                                   variety of higher

able manner to the Cretaceous epoch.      Thus among Mollusca we have two
Terebratulidce, of which one at least (Terebratulina caput-serpentis) may be
certainly identified with  Cretaceous species, whilst the second {Waldheimia
                            a
cranium) may be   fairly regarded as representing,      not lineally descended
                                                              if
from, another of the types of that family so abundant in the Chalk. Among
Echinoderms     we have the  little Rhizocrinus, that carries us back to the
Apiocrinite tribe which flourished in the Oolitic period, and was until lately
supposed to have had its last representative in the Bourgetticrinus of the
Chalk, to which the Rhizocrinus presents many points of remarkable cor
respondence*.     Among Zoophytes, the Oculina we met with in           living       a
state seems generically allied to    Cretaceous type (O. explanata of Miche-
                                       a
lin). And the remarkable abundance of Sponges, which not improbably
                     from the protoplasmic substance that enters largely
derive their nutriment
into the composition of the calcareous mud wherein they are imbedded
(p. 190),  is preeminently conspicuous feature of resemblance. — We can
                a
scarcely doubt that    more systematic examination of the remarkable
                         a
Formation     atpresent in progress would place in    still stronger light
                                                                   a
the relationship of its Fauna to that of the Cretaceous period, since the
specimens which our few dredgefuls contained can only be considered as                      a
mere sample of the varied forms of Animal life which this part of the
Ocean-bottom sustains.  And     our notion of the intimacy of this rela

tionship should be confirmed           by

what seems on general grounds highly probable, that the deposit of Globi-
gerina-mud has been going on, over some part or other of the North-Atlantic
sea-bed, from the Cretaceous epoch to the present time (as there       much          is
reason to think that     did elsewhere in anterior Geological periods), this

       VIII. It     can be scarcely necessary to point         out in detail those various
    important applications of the foregoing conclusions to Geological Science,
   which will at once occur to every Geologist who endeavours to interpret
    the past history of our globe by the light of the changes it is at present
   undergoing.        But this Report would not be complete without some notice
   of these.  —    In the first place, it may, I think, be considered as proved
   that no valid inference can be drawn from either the absence               or the scan
   tiness of Organic Remains          in any unmetamorphosed            sedimentary rock,
   as to the depth at which          it  was deposited.         So far from the deepest
   waters being azoic, it has been shown that they may be peculiarly rich
   in Animal life.       On the other hand, comparatively shallow waters may
   be almost azoic, if their temperature be low or their currents be strong ;
   and thus even littoral formations may show but few traces of the life that
  might be abundant on a deeper bottom at no great distance. — Again,
  it has    been shown that two deposits may be taking place within a few
  miles of each other, at the same depth and on the same geological horizon
  (the area of one penetrating, so to speak, the area of the                    other),  of
  which the Mineral character and the Fauna are alike different,               — that dif
  ference being due on the one hand to the direction                of the current which
  has furnished their materials, and on the other to             the temperature of the
  water brought by that current.             If  our "cold area" were to be raised
  above the surface, so that the deposit at present in progress upon its bot
  tom should become the subject of examination by some Geologist of the
  future, he would find this to consist of a barren Sandstone, including frag
  ments of older rocks, the scanty Fauna of which would in great degree bear
  a Boreal     character    (§ 11); whilst if       a portion      of our "warm area"
 were elevated at the same time with the
                                                    " cold  area," the Geologist would
 be perplexed by the stratigraphical continuity of a Cretaceous forma
 tion, including not only an extraordinary abundance of Sponges, but a
 great variety of other Animal remains, several of them belonging to the
 warmer Temperate region, with the barren Sandstone whose scanty Fauna
 indicates a widely different       climatic    condition,   which he would naturally
 suppose to have prevailed at a          different period.      And yet these two con
 ditions have been shown to exist simultaneously, at corresponding depths,
over wide contiguous areas of the sea-bottom ; in virtue solely of the fact
that one area is traversed by an Equatorial and the other by a Polar cur
rent f. Further, in the midst of the land formed by the elevation of the
     * I think it due to my valued Colleague to state that this hypothesis (which I myself
fully accept) entirely originated with him, having been foreshadowed in his first com
munication to me on the subject (Appendix).
     t It may be said that the asserted existence of theso Currents is a mere hypothesis,
until an actual movement of water in opposite directions has been substantiated.     13ut,
as Prof. Buff has pointed out (p. 187, note), the existence of such deep currents is a

194                  Dr. Carpenter's Preliminary Report                     [Dec. 17,
"cold area," our Geologist would find a hill some 1800 feet high, covered
with a Sandstone continuous with that of the land from which it rises, but
rich in remains of Animals belonging to a more temperate province (§ 13) ;
and might easily fall into the mistake of supposing that two such different
Faunae, occurring at different levels, must indicate two distinct climates
separated in time, instead of indicating, as they have been shown to do,
two contemporaneous but dissimilar climates, separated only by a few
miles horizontally, and by 300 fathoms vertically. — It seems scarcely pos
sible to exaggerate the importance of these facts, in their Geological and
Palaeontological relations, especially in regard to those more localized
Formations     which   are   especially    characteristic    of the later Geological
epochs.     But even in regard to those older Rocks, whose wide range
in space and time would seem to indicate a general prevalence of similar
conditions, it may be suggested whether a difference of bottom-tem
perature, depending upon deep oceanic currents, was not the chief de
termining cause of that remarkable contrast between the Fauueeof different
areas   in the same     Formation,      which is      indicated   by the abundance
and   variety of the Fossils of one locality,             and their scantiness and
limitation of type in another; as is seen, for example, when the "Pri
mordial Zone
                 " of Barrande is
                                        compared with its equivalent in North
Wales. — Further, in the case of those Calcareous deposits which owe their
very existence to the vast development of Organisms that possessed the
power of separating Carbonate of Lime from the ocean-waters, temperature
may be pretty certainly assumed to be the chief condition, not merely of
the character of the Animal remains which those formations may include,
but of the very production of their solid material.
   IX. How important a light is thrown by the facts we have brought into
view on those changes in the Marine Fauna of any particular area, which
cannot be referred to changes in its own geological condition, need scarcely
be pointed    out.   As there must have          been   deep   seas in all Geological
epochs, so there must have been varieties in Submarine Climate at least as
great as those we have discovered, depending upon those Equatorial and
Polar Currents whose existence has been shown to be a Physical necessity.
Hence it is obvious that since changes in the direction of such opposing
currents must have been produced by any upward or downward move
ment of the sea-bottom (as in the areas of elevation and subsidence
marked out by Mr. Darwin in our existing seas), a considerable modifica
tion, or even a complete reversal, of the Submarine Climates of adjacent
areas might have been consequent upon alterations in the contour of the
land, or in the level of the sea-bottom, at a great distance.            The effect of
such a modification of Temperature upon the respective Faunae of these
areas would probably      depend upon the rate and degree of the change.            If
necessary consequence of the difference of surface- temperature between Equatorial and
Polar waters ; and those who raise the objection aro consequently bound to offer some
other conceivable hypothesis on which the facts above stated can be accounted
                                                                              for.

rapid and considerable, it might cause the extinction over those areas of a
large proportion of the species which inhabited them ; whilst others would
migrate in the direction of the temperature most congenial to them, and
transfer to new localities those types which could no longer exist in their
previous habitats, — thus establishing the Colonies of M. Barrande.  If, on
the other hand,   such a change of Temperature were more gradual, the
greater part of the species constituting the Faunae of the areas over which
it occurred might adapt themselves to               it,
                                             undergoing such modifications
in  their structure and habits as might          be considered      sufficient to differen
tiate them specifically, whilst retaining         so many characters      of general simi
larity as to constitute
                            " representative     species
                                                           "   *.
     X. The ingenious suggestion of Dr. Wallichf that the nature of the Animal
life found on the sea-bottom may not unfrequently afford some clue to the
history of its changes of level, — his discovery at great depths of     type          a
(the Ophioeoma granulata)      which           is
                                          essentially littoral being indica
tive of slow progressive subsidence, — may be extended with some proba
bility to changes of submarine climate for where any species
                                                    ;                found        is
abundantly as     littoral form, its presence at great depths in the same
                  a
region would seem to indicate that the subsidence of the bottom has not
been attended with any considerable alteration of temperature, whilst its
absence on neighbouring parts of the same area may be fairly taken as
evidence    of such   a   change.
      The preparation ofdetailed list of the Species found in each locality,
                            a
with the depths from which they were brought up, furnishing the justifi
cation of the general statements made in this Report, has been kindly
undertaken      Professor Wyville Thomson, who will present

to which he has already given special attention. — shall myself lose no time

myself of the kind assistance of Professor Huxley, who has undertaken to

composition.

it    may be found not unworthy of the Royal Society                by

   Deab General Sabine, During a recent visit to Belfast, had tho op    I
portunity of examining some of the specimens (transmitted by Prof. Sara of
 Christiania to Prof. Wyville Thomson) which have been obtained by M. Sars,
jun., Inspector of Fisheries to the Swedish Government, by deep-sea dredgings
 off the coast of Norway. These specimens, for reasons stated in the enclosed
letter from Prof. Wyville Thomson, are of singular interest alike to the Zoologist
and to the Palaeontologist ; and the discovery of them can scarcely fail to excite,
both among Naturalists and among Geologists, a very strong desire that tho
zoology of the deep sea, especially in the Northern Atlantic region, should be
more thoroughly and systematically explored than it has ever yet been. From
        I
 what know of your own early labours in this field, I cannot entertain a doubt
 of your full concurrence in this desire.
    Such an exploration cannot bo undertaken           by private individuals, even
 when aided by grants from Scientific Societies.        For dredging at great depths,
 a vessel of considerable size is requisite, with a trained crew, such as is only
 to be found in the Government service.         It was by the aid of such an equip
 ment, furnished by the Swedish Government, that the researches of M. Sars
 were carried on.
    Now   as  there  are understood  to be at the present    time an unusual number
 of gun-boats and other cruisers on our northern and western coasts, which will
 probably remain on their stations until the end of the season, it has occurred to
 Prof. Wyville Thomson and myself, that tho Admiralty, if moved thereto by tho
 Council of thi. ' ioyal Society, might be induced to place one of these vessels at
 the disposal of ourselves and of any other Naturalists who might be willing to
 accompany us, for the purpose of carrying on a systematic course of deep-sea

 198                     Dr. Carpenter's Preliminary Report                [Dec. 17,
 dredging for a month or six weeks of the present summer, commencing early in
August.
    Though we desire that this inquiry should he extended both in geographical
 range and in depth as far as is proposed in Prof. Wyville Thomson's letter, we
 think it preferable to limit ourselves on the present occasion to a request which
will not, we believe, involve the extra expense of sending out a coaling-vessel.
 We should propose to make Kirkwall or Lerwick our port of departure, to ex
plore the sea-bottom between the Shetland and the Faroe Islands, dredging
around the shores and in the fiords of the latter (which have not yet, we be
lieve, been scientifically examined), and then to proceed as far north-west into the
 deep water between the Faroe Islands and Iceland as may be found practicable.
   It would be desirable that the vessel provided for such a service should be
 one capable of making way under canvas, as well as by steam-power; but as our
 operations must necessarily be slow, speed would not be required.       Considerable
labour would be spared to the crew if the vessel be provided with a " donkey-
          " that could bo used for
 engine                             pulling up the dredge.
    If the Council   of  the Royal Society should deem it expedient to prefer this
request to the Admiralty, I trust that they may further be willing to place at
the disposal of Prof. -Wyville Thomson and myself, either from the Donation
Fund or the Government-Grant Fund, a sum of £100 for the expenses we must
incur in providing an ample supply of spirit and of jars for the preservation of
specimens, with other scientific appliances.         We would undertake that the
choicest of such specimens      should  be deposited in the British Museum.
   I shall be obliged by your bringing this subject before the Council of the
Royal Society, and remain,
                                 Dear General Sabine, yours faithfully,
 The   President  of the Royal Society.                  William B. Carpenter.
           Prom Prof. Wyville Thomson, Belfast, to Dr. Carpenter, V.P.R.S.
                                                                      May  30, 1868.
   My dear Carpenter, — When I last saw you, I suggested how                 very im
portant it would be to the advancement of science to determine with          accuracy
the conditions and distribution of Animal Life at great depths in the        ocean ;  I
now resume the facts and considerations which lead me to believe that researches
in this direction promise valuable results.
   All recent observations tend to negative Edward Forbes's opinion that a
zero of animal life was to be reached at a depth of a few hundred fathoms.        Two
years ago, M. Sars, Swedish Government Inspector of Fisheries, had an oppor
tunity in his official capacity of dredging off the Loffoden Islands at a depth of
300 fathoms.      I visited Norway shortly after his return, and had an opportunity
of studying    with  his father, Prof. Sars, some of his results.  Animal forms were
abundant ; many of them were new to science ; and among them was one of
surpassing interest, the small Crinoid of which you have a specimen, and which
we at once recognized as a degraded type of the Apiocrinida, an order hitherto
regarded as extinct, which attained its maximum in the Pear-encrinites of the
Jurassic Period, and whose latest representative hitherto known was the Sour-
ffuctticrimts of the Chalk.      Some years previously, M. Absjornsen, dredging in
200 fathoms in the Ilardnngenjord,          procured several examples of a StarhVh
{lirisinga) which seems to find its nearest ally in the fossil genus Protaster.
These observations place it beyond a doubt that animal life is abundant in the

1868.]                         on Deep-sea    Dredgings.                       199
ocean    at depths varying from 200 to 300 fathoms, that the forms at these great
depths differ greatly from those met with in ordinary dredgings, and that, at all
events in some cases, these animals are closely allied to, and would seem to be
directly descended from, the fauna of the early Tertiaries.
  I    think the latter result might almost have been anticipated ; an probably
further investigation will add largely to this class of data, and will give us an
opportunity of testing our determination of the zoological position of some fossil
types by an examination of the soft parts of their recent representatives.      The
main cause of the destruction, the migration, and the extreme modification of
Animal types, appears to be change of climate, chiefly depending upon oscilla
tions of the earth's crust. These oscillations do not appear to have ranged, in
the northern portion of the Northern Hemisphere, much beyond 1000 feet since
the commencement of the Tertiary epoch. The temperature of deep water
seems to be constant for all latitudes at 30° ; so that an immense area of the
North Atlantic must have had its conditions unaffected by Tertiary or Post-ter
 tiary oscillations.
     One or two other questions of the highest scientific interest are to be solved
 by the proposed investigations : —
     1st. The effect of pressure upon Animal life at great depths.    There is great
 misapprehension on this point.        Probably a perfectly equal pressure to any
 amount would have little or no effect.        Air being highly compressible, and
 water compressible only to a very slight degree, it is probable that under a pres
 sure of 200 atmospheres, water may be even more aerated, and in that respect
  more capable of supporting life, than at the surface.
      2nd. The effect of the great diminution of the stimulus of Light. From the
  condition of the Cave Fauna, this latter agent probably affects only the deve
  lopment of colour and of the organs of sight.
      I have little doubt that it is quite practicable, with a small heavy dredge,
  and a couple of miles of stout Manilla rope, to dredge at a depth of 1000
  fathoms.    Such an undertaking would, however, owing to the distance, and the
  labour involved, be quite beyond the reach of private enterprise.     What I am
  therefore anxious for  is, that the Admiralty may be induced, perhaps at the in
   stance of tho Council of the Royal Society, to send       vessel (such as one of
                                                             a
  those which accompanied the Cable Expedition to take soundings) to carry out
  the research. I    should be ready to go any time after July and if you would
                                                                   ;
  take part in the investigation, cannot but believe that
                               I                            would give good results.
                                                            it
 I      would propose to start from Aberdeen, and to go first to the Rockall fish
 ing-banks, where the depth       moderate, and thence north-westward, towards
                                 is
 the coast of Greenland, rather to the north of Cape Farewell.   We should thus
 keep pretty nearly along    the isotherm of 30°, shortly reaching 1000 fathoms
 depth, where, allowing 1000 feet for oscillations in level, and 1000 feet for in
 fluence of surface-currents, summer heat, &c., we should still have 4000 feet of
 water whose conditions have probably not varied greatly since the commence
 ment of the Eocene epoch.

 of the Admiralty was approved : —
    My Lord, — TTam     directed to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords
 Commissioners    of the Admiralty, that the President and Council of the Royal
 Society have had under their consideration a proposal by Dr. Carpenter, Vice-
 President of the Royal Society, and Dr. Wyville Thomson, Professor of Natural
 History in Queen's College, Belfast, for conducting dredging operations at
 greater depths than have heretofore been attempted in the localities which they
 desire to explore — the main purpose of such researches being to obtain informa
tion as to the existence, mode of life, and zoological relations of marine animals
living at great depths, with a view to the solution of various questions relatin
to animal life, and having an important bearing on Geology and Palaeontology.
 The objects of the operations which they wish to undertake, and the course
 which they would propose to follow, as well as the aid they desire to ob
 tain from the Admiralty, are more fully set forth in the letter of Dr. Carpen
ter to the President, and that of Professor Thomson, copies of which        I herewith
inclose.
    The President and Council are of opinion that important advantages may
be expected to accrue to science from the proposed undertaking ; accordingly
they strongly recommend it to the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's
Government, and earnestly hope that the Lords Commissioners of the Admi

existence and zoological relations of marine animals at great depths, —a research
which you and the Council of the Royal Society strongly recommend in the
interests of science to the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Govern

         tents. — Part   II. Equine Remains." By Professor Owen, F.R.S.
         Received August 20, 1868.
                                        (Abstract.)
      In this paper the author       has  selected  the fossil remains of the Equine
  family as the subject    of the  second part   of his Description of the Cave of
  Bruniquel and its contents, which Cave, with the human remains, was de
  scribed in Part I. communicated to the Royal Society, June 9, 1864.
      He premises a definition of the several parts of the grinding-surface of
  the upper and lower molars and premolars in the genus Equus, homolo-
  gizing them with those in the corresponding teeth of Hipparion, Paloplo-
  therium, and Palceotherium.
     Next, referring to the want of figures of the natural size, or of any figures
  of the characteristic surface of the teeth of the molar series in the known
  species  of the existing Equines, the author gives a description thereof in
 the Horse (Equus caballus), Ass (E. asinus), Kiang (E. hemiconus),
 Quagga (E. quagga), Dauw (E. Burchelli), and Zebra (E. Zebra), indica
 ting by comparison their respective characteristics.          These descriptions are
 accompanied with drawings (of the natural size) of the working-surface of
 the dentition of each species, with lettered details of such surface in the
 teeth of both upper and under jaws.
     The Equine fossils from the Cave of Bruniquel are then described and
 compared with ench other, with the above-named existing species of Equus,
 and with previously defined fossil species of Equidce.             Two varieties in
 respect of size and some minor characters are pointed out in the Bruniquel
 series, of one of which figures (of the natural size) of the grinding-surface of
 the upper and lower molar series, and of the second variety, figures of the
 same surface of the upper molar series are given.
     The author, remarking that such evidences of mature and full-grown ani
 mals are rare from the Bruniquel Cave-deposits, selects evidence of certain
phases of dentition in the Cave Equines which lend aid in determining their
affinities ; these phases being illustrated by four drawings of the natural
 size.
     Of the various fossil teeth of Equidce with which those from Bruniquel
have been compared, the author finds the closest resemblance, approaching
to identity, in certain fossils from freshwater sedimentary deposits of Post-
pliocene or " Quaternary

of the lower jaw from this locality is given (of the natural size), showing
the characters of the canine and proportions of the diastema.      The close
conformity in the characters of the upper grinders of the Puy-de-D6me
fossils of deposit with those of the Bruniquel cavern enables the author to
dispense with figures of them.
    The sum of the several comparisons is to refer the above Equine fos
sils from sedimentary deposits and both varieties from the Bruniquel
cave to one and the same species              or well-marked   race belonging     to the
true Horses, or restricted genus Equus of modern mammalogists ; the in
dividuals of which race, with a small range of size, probably due to sex,
were less than the average-sized horse of the present period, but larger
than known existing striped or unstriped species of Asinus, Gray.
   Interesting testimony, confirmatory of the conclusion from the palaeon-
tological comparisons, is adduced from outlines of the heads of different in
dividuals of the Cave Equine when alive, neatly cut on the smooth sur
face    of   a   rib of the         discovered by the Vicomte de Lastic St.

Jal in 1 863, in his cavern at Bruniquel, under circumstances which indis
putably showed the work to have been done by one of the tribe of men
inhabiting the cavern and slaying the wild horses of that locality and
period for food.
  The author remarks that every bone of the Horse's                skeleton (and such
evidence had been obtained from about a hundred individuals              that had been
exhumed at the period of his second visit to Bruniquel, in February 1864)
had been split or fractured to gain access to the marrow.  The dental canal
and roots of the teeth had been similarly exposed in every specimen of
jaw.

   All the parts of a glacier do not descend with a common motion ; it
moves faster at its surface than deeper down, and at the centre of its sur
face than at its edges.   It does not only come down bodily, but with dif
ferent motions of its different parts ; so that if a transverse section were
made through          it,

 Agassiz, Forbes, and Tyndall.   There is a constant displacement of the par
 ticles of the ice over one another, and alongside one another, to which is
 opposed that force of resistance which is known in mechanics as shearing
 force.

                                          ice called
 sheared is brought into contact with another similar surface, it unites with
 it,so as to form of the two, one continuous mass.    Thus a slow displace
 ment of shearing,               by
                        which different similar surfaces were continually
 being brought into the presence and contact of one another, would exhibit
 all the phenomena of the motion of glacier ice.
    Between this resistance to shearing and the force, whatever   may be,                     it
 which tends to bring the glacier down, there must be     mechanical rela           a

 Well-known theorems serve to determine the work of the shear and the
friction of the bottom and side in terms of the same quantities. All the
 terms of the equation above referred to are thus arrived at in terms of
 known quantities, except the unit of shear, which the equation thus deter
 mines.    The comparison of this unit of shear (which      the greatest pos   is
 sible, in order that the glacier may descend by its weight alone) with the
 actual unit of shear of glacier ice (determined                     by
                                                     experiment), shows that
a glacier cannot descend               by
                            its weight only its shearing force   ; too great.        is
The true unit of shear being then substituted for its symbol in the equation
of condition, the work of the force, which must come in aid of its weight
to effect the descent            of the glacier,     is   ascertained.
     The imaginary            case to which these computations apply, differs from that
of   an actual glacier in the following respects. The actual glacier        not                is
straight, or of    uniform section and slope, and its channel
                          a                                         not of uni      is

actual glacier     greater than to the supposed one.
                         is                             But this being the
case, the resistance to shearing must be less, in order that the same force,
viz. the weight, may be just sufficient to bring down the glacier in the one
case, as  does in the other.

 shear necessary to its descent                  by its weight only in the natural channel
 must be less than that.
     A   second possible difference between                  the case supposed and the actual
 case    lies in this, that the velocities of the surface-ice             at different distances
 from the edge, and at different heights from the bottom, are assumed to be
 proportional to those distances and heights ; so that the mass of ice at any
 time passing through a transverse section may be bounded by plane sur
 faces, and have a trapezoidal                   form.      This may not strictly           be the case.
 All the measurements, however, show that if the                        surfaces        be not plane,
 they are convex downwards.  In so far therefore                        as the quantity             of ice
 passing through a given section in a day is different from what                               it is sup
posed to be, it is greater than it.   A greater resistance (other than shear
ing) is thus opposed    to each day's descent, and also a greater weight of
ice favours it ; but the disproportion is so great between the work of the
additional resistance to the descent, and that of the additional weight of
ice in favour    of   it,     certain that any such convexity of the trape
                            that   it   is

  A third difference between the actual glacier and the imaginary one, to
the computation of whose unit of shear the following formulae are applied,
is   this — that the formnloe
                           suppose the daily motion of the surface of the
glacier and the daily motion of its side to have been measured at the same
place, whereas there exist no measurements of the surface motion and the
side motion at the same place.                    The surface motion        used has been that         of
the Mer de Glace at Les Ponts, and the side motion that of the Glacier
du Geant at the Tacul — both from        the measurements of Prof. Tyndall.
This error again, however, tends to cause the unit of shear, deduced from
the case of the artificial glacier, to be greater than that in the actual one                          ;
for the Glacier du Geant moves more slowly than the Mer de Glace. The

therefore greater than         assumed in the computation to be, whence
                              it   is
follows, as in the last case, that the computed unit of shear greater than             is
the actual unit of shear.
  To determine the actual value of     (the unit of shear in the case of
                                                        p
ice) the following experiment was made.    Two pieces of hard wood, each
three inches thick and of the same breadth, but of which one was con
siderably longer than the other, were placed together, the surfaces of con
tact being carefully smoothed, and     cylindrical hole,
                                                     a      inch in diameter,1$
was pierced through the two.     The longer piece was then screwed down
upon     frame
         a      which  carried   pulley, over which
                                             a           cord passed to the

middle  of the shorter piece, which rested on                       the longer.             There were
lateral guides to keep the shorter piece from                       deviating      sideways when
moved on the longer.    The hole     the upper     in               piece being brought so as
accurately  to coincide with that in the lower,                     small pieces of ice were

thrown in, a few at a time, and driven home by sharp blows of a mallet on
a wooden cylinder.   By this means a solid cylinder of ice was constructed,
accurately fitting the hole. Weights were then suspended from the rope,
passing over the pulley until the cylinder of ice was sheared across. As
by the melting of the ice, during the experiment, the diameter of the
cylinder was slightly diminished, it was carefully measured with a pair of
callipers.
    1st experiment. — Radius of cylinder          -65625 in., sheared with 98 lbs.
   2nd   experiment. — Radius of cylinder-70312 in., sheared with 119 lbs.
   By the first experiment the shear per square inch, or unit of shear, was
72-433 lbs. ; by the second experiment it was 76-619 lbs.     The main unit
of shear of ice, from these two experiments, is therefore 75 lbs.
   Now it appears by the preceding calculations, that to descend by its own
weight, at the rate at which Prof. Tyndall observed the ice of the Mer de
Glace to be descending at the Tacul, the unit of shearing force of the ice
could not have been more than 1-3193 lb.*
  To determine how great a force, in addition                        to its weight, would be
necessary    to causethe descent        glacier of uniform section and slope,
                                        of   a
such as has been supposed in the calculations, let u represent, in inch-lbs.,
the work of that force in twenty-four hours.        Then assuming the unit of
shear (fi) in glacier ice to be 75 lbs., it follows, by the principle of virtual
velocities, that
                        w=94134000 + 1012560-2668400
                         = 92478160 inch-lbs. = 77065 13 foot-lbs.t
   This computation has reference to half only of the width of the glacier,
and to 23-25 inches of its length.   The work, in excess of its weight, re
quired to make a mile of the imaginary glacier, 466 yards broad and 140
feet deep, descend, as it actually does descend per twenty-four hours, is
represented by the horse-power of an engine, which, working constantly day
and   night, would yield this work, or by

   The surface of the mass of ice, on which the work u is required to be
done, in aid of its weight, to make it descend as it actually does, is
 124771-5 square inches.    The work required to be done on each square
inch of surface, supposing it to be equally distributed over
                                                                             it,

  * By   an experiment on the shearing of putty, similar to that which was made on the
shearing of ice, its unit of shear was found to vary from     lb. to
                                                                 1    lb?., according to its

and its consistency about the same,  it would descend       by

of any other force. It would not, however, be possible to walk on such ice.
t    Thus the work to be done in aid of the weight      thirty-four times the work of the
                                                       is

   These 6 1-76 foot-lbs. of work are equivalent to '0635 heat-units, or to
the heat necessary to raise -0635 lb. of water by one degree of Fahrenheit.
This amount of heat passing into the mass of the glacier per square inch
of surface per day, and reconverted into mechanical work there, would be
sufficient, together with its weight, to bring the glacier down.
   The following considerations may serve to disabuse some persons of the
idea of an unlimited reservoir of force residing somewhere in the prolon
gation of a glacier backward, and in its higher slopes, from which reservoir
the pressure is supposed to come which crushes the glacier over the obsta
cles in its way.
   Let    a strip    of   ice one square inch   in section, and   one mile in length,       in
the middle of the surface of the imaginary glacier, be conceived to be sepa
rated from the rest throughout its whole length, except for the space of one
inch, so that throughout its whole length, except for that one inch, its de
scent is not retarded either by shear or by friction. Let, moreover, this
inch be conceived to be at the very end of the glacier, so that there is no
glacier beyond it. Now it may easily be calculated that this strip of ice,
one inch square and one mile long, lying on a slope of 4° 52', without any
resistance to its descent, except at its end, must press against its end, by
reason of its weight, with a force of 1 94-42 lbs.   But the cubical inch of
solid ice at its extremity opposes, by the shear of its three surfaces, whose
attachment to the adjacent ice is unbroken, a resistance of 3 X 75 lbs., or
225 lbs.          That resistance stops therefore the     descent    of this strip of     ice,
one mile long, having no other resistance than this opposed to its descent,
by reason of its detachment from the rest*. It is clear, then, that it could
not have descended by its weight only when it adhered to the rest, and
when its descent was opposed by the shear of its whole length ; and the
same      may be proved of any number of miles of strip in prolongation of
this.     Also, with obvious modifications, it may be shown, in the same way,
to be true of any other similar strip of ice in the glacier, whether on the
surface or not, and therefore of the whole glacier.
   It results from this investigation that the weight of a glacier is insuf
ficient to account for its descent ; that it is necessary to conceive, in addi
tion to its weight, the operation of some other and much greater force,
which must also be such as would produce those internal molecular dis
placements and those strains which are observed actually to take place in
glacier ice, and must therefore be present to every part of the glacier as its
weight      is,
            but more than thirty-four times as great.
   * If, however, the glacier    were inclined at 35° 10', instead of 4° 52', anda  strip were
 detached   from its surface, as described above, it would equal the shear of one cubic inch
at its lower end,    if  were 300 yards long, and
                          it                        if the glacier were vertical, when it  was
172   8 yards long.

III.  Notes of   a  Comparison of the Granites of Cornwall and Devon

   The granites of Mourne are eruptive,              and can be proved to contain al-
bite as their second felspar.
   The granites of Leinster       are also eruptive     ; and although albite has never
yet been actually found to occur in them, its existence can be inferred with
considerable probability.
   During the past summer (1868)             I  have succeeded in proving that the
second felspar that occurs in the granites of Cornwall is albite.                   I found

    The granites of Cornwall and Devon, which have been frequently ex
 amined by me during the last sixteen years, appear all to contain the two
 felspars and the two micas above analyzed.         In a future communication I
hope to describe their composition in detail, and to give a comparison of
 this composition with that of the granites of Ireland.
    The following generalizations will be found, as I believe, capable of proof.
    (1) The granites of Ireland may be divided into two distinct classes,
marked by characters both geological and mineralogical.
    (2) The First Class of granites consists of Eruptive rocks, of ages vary
ing from the Silurian to the Carboniferous periods.         To this class may be
referred the granites of Leinster and Mourne, and the granites of Cornwall
and Devon.
    (3) The First Class of granites is characterized by the presence of ortho-
clase and albite, and by the absence of all the Lime Felspars.
    (4) The Second Class of granites consists of Metamorphic rocks, of un
known geological age, but probably subsequent to the Laurentian period.
To this class may be referred the granites of Donegal and Galway, and the
granites of Scotland, Norway, and Sweden.
    (5) The Second Class of granites is characterized by the presence of or-
thoclase and oligoclase, or Labradorite, or some other of the Lime Felspars,
and by the absence    of albite.

I. "On       the  Relation   of Hydrogen to Palladium."             By Thomas
       Graham, F.R.S., Master of the Mint. Received November 23,
       1868.
    It has often been maintained on chemical grounds that hydrogen gas is
the vapour of a highly volatile metal.      The idea forces itself upon the mind
that palladium with its occluded hydrogen is simply an alloy of this vola
tile metal, in which the volatility of the one element is restrained by its
union with the other, and which owes its metallic aspect equally to both
constituents.    How far such a view is borne out by the properties of the
compound substance in question will appear by the following examination
of the properties of what, assuming its metallic character, would have to be
named Hydrogenium.
    1.  Density. — The density of palladium when charged with eight online
hundred times its volume of hydrogen gas is perceptibly lowered ; but the
change cannot be measured accurately by the ordinary method of immer
sion in water, owing to a continuous evolution of minute hydrogen bub
bles which appears to be determined by contact with the liquid. However,
the linear dimensions of the charged palladium are altered so considerably
that the difference admits of easy measurement, and furnishes the required
density by calculation.    Palladium in the form of wire is readily charged
with hydrogen by evolving that        gas upon the surface of the metal in a
galvanometer containing    dilute   sulphuric acid as usual *. The length of
the wire before and after a charge is found by stretching it on both occasions
by the same moderate weight, such as will not produce permanent disten
tion, over the surface of a flat graduated measure. The measure was gra
duated to hundredths of an inch, and by means of a vernier, the divisions
could be read to thousandths.        The distance between two fine cross lines
marked upon the surface of the wire near each of its extremities was observed.
    Expt. 1. — The wire had been drawn from welded palladium, and was
hard and elastic.     The diameter of the wire         was   0-462 millimetre  ; its
specific gravity was 12-38, as determined with care.          The wire  was twisted
into a loop at each end and the mark made near each loop.                The loops
were varnished so as to limit absorption of gas by the wire to the measured
length between the two marks.           To straighten the wire, one loop was
fixed, and the other connected with a string passing over a pulley and
loaded with 1-5 kilogramme, a weight sufficient to straighten the wire
without occasioning any undue strain. The wire was charged with hydro
gen by making it the negative electrode of a small Bunsen's battery con
sisting of two cells, each of half a litre in capacity.      The positive electrode
was a thick platinum wire placed side by side with the palladium wire, and

extending the whole length of the latter within a tall jar filled with dilute
sulphuric acid. The palladium wire had, in consequence, hydrogen carried
to its surface, for a period of     \\ hour. A longer exposure was found not
to add sensibly to the charge of hydrogen acquired by the wire.            The wire
was again measured and the increase in length noted.               Finally the wire,
being dried with a cloth, was divided at the marks, and the charged por
tion heated in a long narrow glass tube kept vacuous by a Sprengel aspi
rator.    The whole occluded hydrogen was thus collected and measured ;
its volume is reduced by calculation to Bar. 760 millims., and Therm.
0° C.
    The original length of the palladium wire       exposed was 609- 144 millims.
(23-982 inches), and its weight 1-6832 grm. The wire received a charge of
hydrogen amounting to 936 times its volume, measuring 128 cubic centims.,
and therefore weighing 0-01147 grm.             When the gas was ultimately ex
pelled,  the  loss  as  ascertained by direct  weighing was 0-01164 grm.        The
charged wire measured 618-923 millims., showing an increase in length of
9-779 millims. (0 385 inch).         The increase in linear dimensions is from
 100 to 101 605, and in cubic capacity, assuming the expansion to be equal
in all directions, from 100 to 104-908.         Supposing the two metals united
without any change of volume, the alloy may therefore be said to be com
posed of

 The expansion which the palladium undergoes appears enormous if viewed
 as a change of bulk in the metal only, due to any conceivable physical
 force, amounting as it does to sixteen times the dilatation of palladium
 when heated from 0° to 100° C. The density of the charged wire is re
 duced, by calculation, from 12-3 to 1179. Again, as 100 is to 4-91, so the
 volume of the palladium, 0-1358 cubic centim., is to the volume of the
 hydrogenium, 0-006714 cubic centim.            Finally, dividing the weight of the
 hydrogenium, 0-01147 grm., by         its volume    in the alloy, 0-006714 cubic
 centim., we find
          Density of hydrogenium                                       l-708
    The density of hydrogenium, then, appears      to approach that   of magnesium,
  1 743, by this first experiment.
     Further, the expulsion of hydrogen from the wire, however caused, is
 attended with an extraordinary contraction of the latter.             On expelling
 the hydrogen by a moderate heat, the wire not only receded to its original
 length, but fell as much below that zero as it had previously risen above it.
 The palladium wire first measuring 609-144 millims., and which increased
  9 77  millims., was ultimately    reduced to 599-444 millims., and contracted
  9-7 millims.     The wire is permanently shortened. The density of the pal

  Indium did not increase,    but fell slightly at the same time, namely from
  12-38 to 12- 12, proving that this contraction of the wire is in length only.
  The result is the converse of extension by wire-drawing. The retraction
 of the wire is possibly due to an effect of wire-drawing in leaving the par
 ticles of metal in a state of unequal tension, a tension which is excessive
 in the direction of the length of the wire.        The metallic particles would
 seem     to become   mobile, and to right themselves in proportion as the
 hydrogen escapes ; and the wire contracts in length, expanding, as appears
 by its final density, in other directions at the same time.

 nesia (to make the flame luminous),        burns like a waxed thread when ig
 nited in the flame of a lamp.

contract nor expand, but remain of their proper volume on uniting.               Dr.
Matthiessen has shown that in the formation of alloys generally the metals
retain approximately their original densities*.
   In the first experiment already described, probably the maximum ab
sorption of gas by wire, amounting to 935-67 volumes, is attained.               The
palladium    may be charged with any smaller proportion of hydrogen by
shortening the time of exposure to the gas (329 volumes of hydrogen were
taken up in twenty minutes), and an opportunity be gained of observing if
the density   of the hydrogenium remains constant, or if it varies with the
proportion   in  which hydrogen enters the alloy.            In the following state
ment, which includes the three experiments already reported, the essential
points only are produced.

   If the first and last experiments only are compared, it would appear that
the hydrogenium becomes sensibly denser when the proportion of it is
small, ranging from I -708 to 2-055.           But the last experiment of the Table
it perhaps exceptional ; and all the others indicate considerable uniformity
of density.     The mean density of hydrogenium, according to the whole
experiments, excluding that last referred to, is 1-951, or nearly 2. This
uniformity is in favour of the method followed for estimating the density
of hydrogenium.

  The retraction of the wire therefore does not require the concurrence of
a high temperature. This experiment further proved that       large charge      a

   That particular wire, which had been repeatedly charged with hydrogen,
was    once more exposed        to   a   charge, for the purpose of ascer

taining whether or not its elongation under hydrogen might now be facili
tated and become greater in consequence of the previous large retraction.
No such extra elongation, however, was observed on charging the retracted
wire more     than once    ;    and the expansion continued                to be in the usual
proportion    to   the hydrogen          absorbed.           The final density of the wire
was 12- 18.
    The wire retracted     by   heat found to be altered in another way, which
                                         is
appears to indicate   a   molecular change.   When the gas has been expelled
by heat, the metal gradually loses much of its power to take up hydrogen.
The last wire, after  had already been operated upon six times, was again
                      it
charged with hydrogen for two hours, and was found to occlude only 320
volumes of gas, and in repetition of the experiment, 330-5 volumes. The
                           a
absorbent power of the palladium had therefore been reduced to about
one-third of its maximum.
    The condition of the retracted wire appeared, however, to                   be improved by
raiting  its temperature to full redness                by
                                             sending through                    it     an electrical

current from a battery.    The absorption rose thereafter to 425 volumes
of hydrogen, and in a second experiment to 422-5 volumes.
  The wire becomes fissured longitudinally, acquires a thready structure, and
is much disintegrated on repeatedly losing hydrogen, particularly when
the hydrogen has been extracted by electrolysis in an acid fluid.  The pal
ladium in the last case is dissolved by the acid to some extent.  The metal
appeared, however, to recover its full power to absorb hydrogen, now con
densing upwards of 900 volumes of gas.
  The effect upon its length of simply annealing the palladium wire by
exposure in a porcelain tube to a full red heat, was observed. The wire
measured 556-075 millims. before, and 555-875 millims. after heating ; or
a minute retraction of 0-2 millim, was indicated.  In a second annealing
experiment, with an equal length of new wire, no sensible change whatever
of length could   be discovered.  There is no reason, then, to ascribe the
retraction after hydrogen, in any degree, to the heat applied when the gas
is expelled. Palladium wire is very slightly affected in physical properties
by such annealing, retaining much of its first hardness and elasticity.
    2. Tenacity. — A new palladium wire, similar to the last, of which 100
millims. weighed 0-1987 grm., was broken, in experiments made on two
different portions of              by
                              load of 10 and of 10- 17 kilogrammes.

other portions of the same wire, fully charged with hydrogen, were broken
by 8-18, and       by
                 8'27 kilogrammes.     Hence we have—

  4. Magnetism. — It is given by Faraday as the result of all his experi
ments, that palladium is
                         " feebly but truly magnetic ;" and this element
he placed at the head of what are now called the paramagnetic metals.
But the feeble magnetism of palladium did not extend to its salts. In
repeating such experiments, a horseshoe electromagnet of soft iron, about 15
centims. (6 inches) in height, was made use of. It was capable of supporting
60 kilogs., when excited by four large Bunsen cells.     This is an induced
magnet  of very moderate  power.   The  instrument  was placed with its poles
directed upwards ; and each of these was provided with a small square
block of soft iron terminating laterally in a point, like a small anvil. The
palladium   under examination was suspended between these points in a
stirrup of paper attached to three fibres of cocoon silk, 3 decimetres in length,
and the whole was covered by a bell glass. A filament of glass was attached
to the paper, and moved as an index on a circle of paper on the glass shade
divided into degrees.              The metal, which
                                          was an oblong fragment of electrc -
deposited palladium,                     in

                                                  with its ends averted from
the poles of the electromagnet), the magnet  was then charged              by
                                                                  connecting

                   10° only, the magnetism acting against the torsion of
the silk suspending thread.    The same palladium charged with 604-6
volumes of hydrogen was deflected by the electromagnet through 48°,
when      it   set    itself   at rest.   The   gas being afterwards extracted, and the
palladium again placed equatorially between the poles,   was not deflected
                                                                     it
in the least perceptible
                      degree.   The  addition of hydrogen adds manifestly,
therefore, to the small natural magnetism of the palladium.       To have some
terms  of comparison,   the same   little mass  of electro-deposited palladium
was steeped in    solution of nickel, of sp. gr. 1-082, which
                       a                                           known to be
                                                                          is
magnetic.    The deflection under the magnet was now 35°, or less than with
hydrogen.     The same palladium being afterwards washed and impregnated
with    solution of protosulphate of iron of sp. gr. 1-048, of which the
        a
metallic mass held 2-3 per cent. of its weight, the palladium gave    deflec       a
tion of 50°, or nearly    the same   as with  hydrogen.     With    stronger   a
solution of the same salt, of sp. gr. 1-17, the deflection was 90°, and the
palladium pointed axially.
   Palladium in the form of wire or foil gave no deflection when placed in
the same apparatus, of which the moderate sensitiveness was rather an
advantage in present circumstances      but when afterwards charged with
                                                  ;
hydrogen, the palladium uniformly gave       sensible deflection of about 20°.

A previous  washing  of  the wire or foil with hydrochloric acid, to remove
any possible traces of iron, did not modify this result.   Palladium reduced
from the cyanide and also precipitated                    by
                                             hypophosphorous acid, when

1869.]                   of Hydrogen   to      Palladium.
   It appears to follow that hydrogenium is magnetic, a property which
is confined to metals and their compounds.  This magnetism is not per
ceptible in hydrogen gas, which was placed both by Faraday and by
M. E. Becquerelat the bottom of the list of diamagnetic substances.            This
gas is allowed to be upon the   turning-point      between   the paramagnetic and
diamagnetic classes.    But magnetism is so liable to extinction under the
influence of heat, that the magnetism of a metal may very possibly disappear
entirely when it is fused or vaporized, as appears to be the case with
hydrogen in the form of gas.  As palladium stands high in the series of
the paramagnetic metals, hydrogenium    must be allowed to rise out of
that class, and to take place in the strictly magnetic group, with iron,
nickel, cobalt, chromium, and manganese.
   5. Palladium with Hydrogen at a high Temperature. — The ready per
meability of heated palladium by hydrogen gas would imply the reten
tion of the latter element by the metal even at a bright red heat. The
hydrogenium must in fact travel through the palladium by cementa
tion, a molecular process which requires time. The first attempts to
arrest hydrogen in its passage through         the red-hot   metal were made
                                                                        by
transmitting hydrogen gas through a metal tube of palladium with a vacuum
outside, rapidly followed by a stream of carbonic acid, in which the metal
was allowed to cool. When the metal was afterwards examined in the usual
way, no hydrogen   could be found in it.  The short period of exposure to
the carbonic acid seems to have been sufficient to dissipate the gas. But
on heating palladium foil red-hot in a flame of hydrogen gas, and suddenly
cooling the metal in water, a small portion of hydrogen was found locked up
in the metal.   A volume of metal amounting to 0'062 cubic centim., gave
0-080 cubic centim. of hydrogen ; or, the gas, measured cold, was 1 '306 times
the bulk of the metal.  This measure of gas would amount to three or four
times the volume of the metal at a red heat.            Platinum   treated   in the
same way appeared also to yield hydrogen, although the quantity was too
small to be much relied upon, amounting only to 0 06 volume of the metal.
The permeation of  these metals by hydrogen appears therefore to depend on
absorption, and not to require the assumption of anything like porosity in
their structure.
   The highest velocity of permeation observed was in the experiment where
four litres of hydrogen (3992 cub. centims.) per minute passed through a
plate of palladium 1 millim. in thickness, and calculated for a square metre
in surface, at a bright red heat a little short of the melting-point of gold.
This is a travelling movement of hydrogen through the substance of the
metal with the velocity of 4 millimetres per minute.
   6. Chemical Properties. — The chemical properties of hydrogenium also
distinguish it from ordinary hydrogen.       The palladium alloy precipitates
mercury    and  calomel from a solution  of the  chloride of mercury without
any disengagement of hydrogen ; that     is,hydrogenium decomposes chloride
of mercury, while hydrogen does not. This explains why M. Stanislas
                                                                    r2

220       Prof. Cayley on        the   Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces.         [Jan. 14,
Meunier failed in discovering the occluded hydrogen of meteoric iron, by
dissolving the latter in a solution of chloride of mercury ; for the hydrogen
would be consumed, like the iron itself, in precipitating mercury.         Hy
drogen (associated   with  palladium) unites    with chlorine and iodine in the
dark, reduces a persalt of iron to the state of protosalt, converts red prussiate
of potash into yellow prussiate, and has considerable deoxidizing powers.
It appears to be the active form of hydrogen, as ozone is of oxygen.
   The general conclusions which appear to flow from this inquiry are, that
in palladium fully charged with hydrogen, as in the portion of palladium
wire now submitted to the Royal Society, there exists a compound of
palladium  and hydrogen in a proportion which may approach to equal
equivalents*.  That both substances are solid, metallic, and of a white
aspect.     That the alloy contains about 20 volumes of palladium united with
a volume of hydrogenium ; and that the density of the latter is about 2, a
little higher than magnesium to which hydrogenium may be supposed to
bear some analogy.       That hydrogenium has a certain amount of tenacity,
and possesses     the electrical conductivity of a metal.    And finally, that
hydrogenium takes its place among magnetic metals.         The latter fact may
have   its bearing upon   the appearance of hydrogenium   in meteoric iron, in
association with certain other magnetic elements.

best thanks to Mr. W. C. Roberts for his valuable cooperation throughout
the investigation.

Order into Species, in reference to the presence or absence of Singular Points,
and the reality of their Lines," Phil. Trans, vol. cliii. (1863) pp. 193-241.
But the object of the Memoir is different. I disregard altogether the ulti
mate division depending on the reality of the lines, attending only to the
division into (twenty-two, or as I prefer to reckon                      it)

1869.]     On the Blue Colour of the Sky, and the Polarization      of Light. 223
IV. "On       the  Blue Colour of the Sky, the Polarization of Sky
      light, and on the Polarization of Light by Cloudy matter gene
      rally."    By John Tyndall, LL.D., F.R.S.               Received December
      16, 1868.
   Since the communication of my brief abstract "On a new Series of Che
mical Reactions produced by Light," the experiments upon this subject
have been continued, and the number of the substances thus acted on
considerably augmented.         New relations have also been established be
tween mixed vapours when subjected to the action of light.
   I now beg to draw the attention of the Royal Society to two questions
glanced at incidentally in the abstract referred to, — the blue colour of the
sky, and the polarization of skylight.        Reserving the historic treatment of
the subject for a more fitting occasion,        I would merely mention now that
these questions constitute,    in the opinion of our most eminent authorities,
the two great standing enigmas of meteorology.          Indeed it was the interest
manifested in them by Sir John Herschel, in a letter of singular speculative
power, that caused me to enter upon the consideration of these questions
so soon.
   The apparatus with which I work consists, as already stated to the
Society, of a glass tube about a yard in length, and from 2\ to 3 inches
internal diameter.     The vapour to be examined is introduced into this tube
in the manner described in my last abstract, and upon it the condensed
beam of the electric lamp is permitted to act until the neutrality or the ac
tivity of the substance has been declared.
   It has hitherto been my aim to render the chemical action of light upon
vapours visible.    For this purpose substances have been chosen, one at least
of whose products of decomposition under light shall have a boiling-point so
high that as soon as the substance is formed it shall be precipitated. By
graduating the quantity of the vapour, this precipitation may be rendered
of any degree of fineness, forming particles distinguishable by the naked
eye, or particles which are probably far beyond the reach of our highest
microscopic powers.
   I have no reason to doubt that particles may be thus obtained whose
diameters constitute but a very small fraction of the length of a wave of
violet light.
   In all cases when the vapours of the liquids employed are sufficiently
attenuated, no matter what the liquid may be, the visible action commences
with the formation of a blue cloud.         I  would guard myself at the outset
against all misconception as to the use of this term.            The blue cloud to
which   I here refer is totally invisible in ordinary daylight.      To be seen, it
requires  to be surrounded   by   darkness,  it only being  illuminated  by a pow
erful beam of light.    This blue cloud differs in many important particulars
from the fmest ordinary clouds, and might justly have assigned to it an in
termediate position between these clouds and true cloudless vapour.

  224                Prof. Tyndall      on the  Blue Colour    of tlte Sky,       [Jan. 14,
     With this explanation, the term " cloud," or " incipient cloud,"              as I pro
 pose    to employ      it, cannot,   I think, be misunderstood.
      I had been endeavouring to decompose carbonic acid gas by light. A
 faint bluish cloud, due it may be, or it may not be, to the residue of some
 vapour      previously employed, was formed in the experimental tube.                    On
 looking     across    this cloud through a Nicol's prism, the line of vision being
 horizontal, it was found that when the short diagonal of the prism was ver
  tical, the quantity of light reaching the eye was greater than when the long
  diagonal was vertical.
     When     a plate     of tourmaline was held between the eye and the bluish
 cloud, the quantity of light reaching the eye when the axis of the prism
 was perpendicular to the axis of the illuminating beam, was greater than
 when the axes of the crystal and of the beam were parallel to each other.
     This was the result all round the experimental tube. Causing the crystal
 of tourmaline to revolve round the tube, with its axis perpendicular
 to the illuminating beam, the quantity of light that reached the eye was
 in all its positions a maximum.              When the crystallographic axis was par
 allel to the axis of the beam, the quantity of light transmitted by the crystal
 was a minimum.
     From the illuminated bluish cloud, therefore, polarized light was dis
 charged, the direction of maximum polarization being at right angles to the
 illuminating beam ; the plane of vibration of the polarized light, moreover
 was that to which the beam was perpendicular*.
     Thin plates of selenite or of quartz, placed between the Nicol and the
bluish cloud, displayed the colours of polarized light, these colours being
most vivid when the line of vision was at right angles to the experimental
tube.       The plate of      selenite  usually employed was a circle, thinnest at the
centre, and augmenting uniformly in thickness from the centre outwards.
When placed in its proper position between the Nicol and the cloud, it ex
hibited a system of splendidly coloured rings.
     The cloud here referred to was the first operated upon in the manner
described.        It may, however, be greatly improved upon by the choice of
proper substances, and by the application in proper quantities of the sub
stances chosen.            Benzol, bisulphide of carbon, nitrite of amyl, nitrite of
butyl, iodide of allyl, iodide of isopropyl, and many other substances may be
employed.         I   will   take  the nitrite of butyl as illustrative of the means
adopted to secure the best result with reference to the present question.
     And here it may be mentioned that a vapour, which when alone, or
mixed with air in the experimental tube, resists the action of light, or shows
but a feeble result of this action, may, by placing it in proximity with an-
    * I  assume here that the plane of vibration   is perpendicular to the plane of polariza
tion.    This is still an undecided point ; but the probabilities are so much in its favour,
and it is in my opinion so much preferable to have a physical image on which the mind
can rest, that I do not hesitate to employ the phraseology       in the text. Even should
the assumption prove to be incorrect, no harm will be done by the provisional use of it.

other gas or vapour, be caused to exhibit under light vigorous, if not violent
action.     The case is similar to that of carbonic acid gas, which diffused in
the atmosphere resists the decomposing action of solar light, but when
placed in contiguity with the chlorophyl in the leaves of plants, has its mo
lecules shaken asunder.
    Dry air   was permitted to bubble through the      liquid nitrite of butyl until
the experimental tube, which had been previously exhausted, was filled
with the mixed air and vapour.          The visible action of light upon the mix
ture after fifteen minutes' exposure was slight. The tube was afterwards
filled with half an atmosphere of the mixed air and vapour, and another
half atmosphere of air which had been permitted to bubble through fresh
commercial hydrochloric acid.         On sending the beam through this mixture,
 the action paused barely sufficiently long to show that at the moment of
 commencement the tube was optically empty.              But the pause amounted
 only to a small fraction of a second, a dense cloud being immediately pre
cipitated upon the beam which traversed the mixture.
    This cloud   began   blue, but the advance     to whiteness was so rapid as
almost to justify the application        of the term instantaneous.       The dense
cloud, looked at perpendicularly to its axis, showed scarcely any signs of
polarization.     Looked at obliquely the polarization was strong.
    The experimental tube being again cleansed and exhausted, the mixed
air and nitrite-of-butyl vapour was permitted to enter it until the associated
mercury column was depressed               of an inch.    In other words, the air
and vapour, united, exercised a pressure not exceeding            of an atmosphere.
Air passed through a solution of hydrochloric acid was then added till the
mercury column was depressed three inches.           The condensed beam of the
electric light passed for some time in darkness through this mixture.
 There was absolutely nothing within the tube competent to scatter the
 light.    Soon, however, a superbly blue cloud was formed along the track
of the beam, and it continued blue sufficiently long to permit of its thorough
examination.       The light discharged from the cloud at right angles to its
own length was perfectly polarized.         By degrees the cloud became of whi
tish blue, and for a time the selenite colours obtained by looking at it nor
mally were exceedingly brilliant. The direction of maximum polarization
was distinctly at right angles to the illuminating beam.         This continued to
be the case as long as the cloud maintained a decided blue colour, and
even for some time after the pure blue had changed to whitish blue.             But
as the   light continued   to act the cloud became    coarser and whiter, particu
larly at its centre, where it at length ceased to discharge polarized light in
the direction of the perpendicular, while it continued to so at both its ends.
    But the cloud which had thus ceased to polarize the light emitted nor
mally, showed vivid selenite colours when looked at obliquely.            The direc
tion of maximum polarization changed with the texture of the cloud.            This
point   shall receive further  illustration  subsequently.
    A blue, equally rich and more durable, was obtained by employing the

stance here cited is representative.   In all cases, and with all substances,
the cloud formed at the commencement, when the precipitated particles
are sufficiently fine, is blue, and it can be made to display a colour rivalling
that of the purest Italian sky.   In all cases, moreover, this tine blue cloud
polarizes perfectly  the beam   which  illuminates         it,

  It   isexceedingly interesting to observe both the perfection and the decay
of this polarization. For ten or fifteen minutes after its first appearance the
light from  a vividly illuminated incipient cloud, looked at horizontally,               is
absolutely quenched             by  Nicol's prism with its longer diagonal vertical.

on  a  level with its axis, my assistant Mr. Cottrell occupying   similar      a
position behind the tube.    The short diagonal of the large Nicol was in the
first instanee vertical, the plane of vibration of the emergent beam being
therefore also vertical.   As the light continued to act, a superb blue cloud
visible to both my assistant and myself was slowly formed.     But this cloud,
so deep and     rich when looked at from the positions mentioned, utterly
disappeared      when looked at vertically downwards, or vertically upwards.
Reflection from the cloud was not possible in these directions.        When the
large Nicol  was  slowly turned round  its axis, the eye of the observer  being on
the level of the beam, and the line of vision perpendicular to          it,
                                                                    entire extinc
tion of the light emitted horizontally occurred where the longer diagonal of
the large Nicol was vertical.     But now vivid blue cloud was seen when

       Now,                        of skylight, the greatest stumblingblock
              as regards the polarization
has hitherto been that, in accordance with the law of Brewster, which
makes the index of refraction the tangent of the polarizing angle, the re
flection which produces perfect polarization would require to be made in
air upon air ; and indeed this led many of our most eminent men,
Brewster himself among the number, to entertain the idea of molecular
reflection.   I have, however, operated upon substances of widely different
refractive indices, and therefore of very different polarizing angles as ordi
narily defined, but the polarization of the beam by the incipient cloud
has   thus far proved itself to be absolutely independent of the polarizing
angle.    The law of Brewster does not apply to matter in this condition, and
it rests with the undulatory theory to explain why.    Whenever the preci
pitated particles are sufficiently fine, no matter what the substance form
ing the particles may be, the direction of maximum polarization is at right
angles to the illuminating beam, the polarizing angle for matter in this
condition being invariably 45°. This I consider to be a point of capital
importance with reference to the present question*.
  That water-particles, if they could be obtained in this exceedingly fine
state of division, would produce the same effects, does not admit of reason
able doubt.     And that they must exist in this condition in the higher
regions of the atmosphere is, I think, certain.     At all events, no other
assumption than this is necessary to completely account for the firmamental
blue and the polarization of the sky t.
   Suppose our atmosphere surrounded by an envelope impervious to light,
but with an aperture on the sunward side through which a parallel beam of
solar light could enter and traverse the atmosphere.      Surrounded on all
sides by air not directly illuminated, the track of such a beam through the
 air    would resemble that of the parallel beam of the electric lamp through
an     incipient cloud.  The sunbeam would be blue, and it would discharge
laterally light in precisely the same condition as that discharged by the                        in-
   * The difficulty referred to above is thus expressed by Sir John Herschel :— " The
cause of the polarization is evidently a reflection of the sun's light upon some
thing.   The question is on what?           Were the angle of maximum polarization 76°, we
should look    to water or ice as  the  reflecting body, however inconceivable the existence
in a cloudless atmosphere,   and  a  hot  summer's day of unevaporated molecules (particles        .')
of water.   But though we were once of this opinion, careful observation has satisfied us
that 90°, or thereabouts,  is
                           a  correct angle, and that therefore whatever be the body on
which the light has been reflected,  ifpolarized by   single reflection, the polarizing angle
                                                         a
must be 45°, and the index of refraction, which   the tangent of that angle, unity in other
                                                   is                                     ;

cipient cloud.        In fact the azure revealed by such a beam would be to
all intents and purposes that which I have called a " blue cloud" *.
    But,  as regards the polarization       of the sky ,we know that not only is the
direction of maximum polarization at right angles to the track of the solar
 beams, but that at certain        angular distances, probably variable ones, from
 the sun,   " neutral    points," or points, of no polarization exist, on both sides
of which the planes of atmospheric polarization             are at   right angles    to each
 other.
    I have made various observations upon this subject               which    I  reserve  for
the present ; but pending the more complete examination of the questiou
the following facts and observations bearing upon it are submitted to the
 Royal Society.
    The parallel     beam employed in these experiments tracked its way through
 the laboratory air exactly as sun-beams are seen to do in the dusty air of
 London. I have reason to believe that a great portion of the matter thus
floating in the laboratory air consists of organic germs, which are capable
of imparting     a perceptibly bluish tint to the air.        This air showed, though
far less vividly, all the effects of polarization obtained with the incipient
clouds.     The light discharged laterally from the track of the illuminating
beam was polarized, though not perfectly, the direction of maximum polari
zation being at right angles to the beam.
    The horizontal column of air thus illuminated was 18 feet long,, and
could therefore be looked at very obliquely without any disturbance from a
solid envelope.        At all points of the beam throughout its entire length the
light emitted normally was in the same state of polarization.                   Keeping the
positions of the Nicol and the selenite constant, the same colours were
observed throughout the entire beam when the line of vision was perpen
dicular to its length.
    I then placed myself near the end of the beam as it issued from the
electric lamp, and looking through the Nicol and selenite more and more
obliquely at the beam, observed the colours fading until they disappeared.
Augmenting the obliquity the colours appeared once more, but they were
now complementary to the former ones.
    Hence this beam, like the sky, exhibited its neutral point, at opposite
sides of which the light was polarized in planes at right angles to each other.
    Thinking that the action observed in the laboratory might be caused in
   * The opinion of Sir John Herschel, connecting the polarization and the blue colour
of the sky is verified by the foregoing results.  " The more the subject

of skylight] is considered," writes this eminent philosopher, " the more it will be found
beset with difficulties, and its explanation when arrived at will probably be found to carry
with it that of the blue colour of the sky itself and of the great quantity of light it
actually does send down to us." " We may observe, too," he adds, " that it is only where
the purity of the sky is most absolute that the polarization is developed in its highest
degree, and that where there is the slightest perceptible tendency to cirrus it is materially
impaired."    This applies word for word to the " incipient clouds."

some way by the vaporous fumes diffused in its air,    I had a battery and an
electric lamp carried to a room at the top of the Royal Institution.      The
track of the beam was seen very finely in the air of this room, a length of 14
or 1 5 feet being attainable.  This beam exhibited all the effects observed
with the beam in the laboratory.   Even the uncondensed electric light falling
on the floating matter showed, though faintly, the effects of polarization*.
  When the air was so sifted as to entirely remove the visible floating
matter, it no longer exerted any sensible action upon the light, but behaved
like     a vacuum.
     I
     had varied and confirmed in many ways those experiments on neutral
points, operating upon the fumes of chloride of ammonium, the smoke of
brown paper, and tobacco smoke, when my attention was drawn by Sir
Charles Wheatstone to an important observation communicated to the
Paris Academy in 1860 by Professor Govi, of Turinf. His observations
on the light of comets had led M. Govi to examine a beam of light sent
through a room in which was diffused the smoke of incense. He also ope
rated on tobacco smoke.              His first brief communication     stated   the fact of
polarization by such smoke, but in his second communication he announced
the discovery of a neutral point in the beam, at the opposite sides of which
the light was polarized in planes at right angles to each other.
   But unlike my observations on the laboratory air, and unlike the action
of the sky, the direction of maximum polarization in M. Govi's experi
ment enclosed a very small angle with the axis of the illuminating beam.
The question was left in this condition, and I am not aware that M. Govi
or any other investigator has pursued it further.
     I
   had noticed, as before stated, that as the clouds formed in the experi
mental tube became denser, the polarization of the light discharged at
right angles to the                                    of maximum pola

rization becoming oblique                 Experiments on the fumes of
                                      to the beam.
chloride of ammonium gave me also reason to suspect that the position of
the neutral point was not constant, but that it varied with the density of
the illuminated fumes.
     The examination of          these questions led to  the following new and re
markable results       : — the     laboratory being well filled with the fumes of in
cense,       and sufficient     time being allowed for their uniform diffusion, the
electric beam was sent through the smoke.       From the track of the beam
polarized light was  discharged, but the direction of maximum polarization,
instead of being along the normal, now enclosed an angle of 12° or 13° with
the axis of the beam.
     A neutral point, with complementary             effects at opposite sides   of   it,   was
also exhibited    the beam. The angle enclosed by the axis of the beam,

   The windows of the laboratory were now opened for some minutes, a
portion of the incense smoke being permitted to escape.                              On again
darkening    the   room     and   turning   on   the    beam,   the    line of  vision   to the
neutral point was found to enclose with the axis of the beam an angle of
63°.
   The windows       were again    opened for a few minutes, more of the smoke
being permitted        to escape.     Measured as oefore the angle referred to was
found to be 54°.
   This   process    was repeated    three additional times        ;  the neutral point was
found to recede lower and lower down the beam,                  the angle between a line
drawn from the eye to the neutral point and the axis of the beam falling
successively from 54° to 49°, 43° and 33°.
   The distances, roughly measured, of the neutral point from the lamp,
corresponding to the foregoing series of observations, were these : —

   At the end of this      series  of experiments the direction of maximum pola
rization had again become normal to the beam.
   The laboratory was next filled with the fumes of gunpowder.                          In five
 successive experiments, corresponding to five different densities of the gun
powder smoke, the angles enclosed between the line of vision to the neutral
point and the axis of the beam were 63°, 50°, 47°, 42°, and 38° respectively.
   After the clouds of gunpowder had cleared away the laboratory was filled
with the fumes of common resin, rendered so dense as to be very irritating
to my lungs.        The direction of maximum polarization enclosed in this case
an angle    of 1 2°,  or thereabouts, with the axis of the beam.            Looked at,    as in
the former instances, from a position near the electric lamp no neutral point
was observed throughout          the entire extent of the beam.
   When this beam was looked at normally through the selenite and Nicol,
the ring system, though not brilliant, was distinct.                  Keeping the eye upon
the plate of selenite and the line of vision normal, the windows were opened,
the blinds remaining undrawn.              The resinous fumes slowly diminished,
and as they did so the ring system became paler.                     It finally disappeared.
Continuing     to   look   along   the   perpendicular,      the   rings revived, but now
the colours were complementary to the former ones.                        The neutral point
 had passed    me  in its motion down the beam consequent upon the attenuation
of the fumes of resin.
   In the fumes of chloride of ammonium substantially the same results
were obtained as those just described.                 Sufficient    I  think has been here
stated to illustrate the variability of the position of the neutral point.                 The

   explanation of the results will probably give new work to the undulatory
   theory*.
      Before quitting the question of the reversal of the polarization by cloudy
   matter,   I  will make one or two additional observations.                Some of the
   clouds formed in the experiments on the chemical action of light are aston
   ishing as to form.       The experimental tube is often divided into segments
   of dense cloud, separated from each other by nodes of finer matter.
   Looked at normally, as many as four reversals of the plane of polarization
   have been found in the tube in passing from node to segment, and from
  segment to node.         With the fumes diffused in the laboratory, on the con
  trary, there was no change in the polarization along the normal, for here
  the necessary differences of cloud -texture did not exist.
      Further.     By  a  puff of tobacco smoke or of condensed steam blown into
  the illuminated beam, the brilliancy of the colours may be greatly augmented.
  But with different clouds two different effects are produced.             For example,
  let the ring system observed in the common air be brought to its maximum
  strength, and then let an attenuated cloud of chloride of ammonium be
  thrown into the beam at the point looked at ; the ring system flashes out
  with augmented brilliancy, and the character of the polarization remains
  unchanged.       This is also the case when phosphorus or sulphur is burned
  underneath the beam, so as to cause the fine particles of phosphoric acid
  or of sulphur to rise into the light.          With the sulphur-fumes the bril
 liancy of the colours is exceedingly intensified ; but in none of these cases
 is there any change in the character of the polarization.
     But when a puff of aqueous cloud, or of the fumes of hydrochloric
  acid, hydriodic acid, or nitric acid is thrown into the beam, there is a com
 plete reversal of the selenite tints.       Each of these clouds twists the plane of
 polarization     90°.    On   these  and  kindred   points experiments are still in
 progresst-
     The idea that the colour of the sky is due to the action of finely
 divided matter, rendering the atmosphere a turbid medium, through which
 we look at the darkness of space, dates as far back as Leonardo da Vinci.
 Newton conceived the colour to be due to exceedingly small water particles
 acting as thin plates.       Goethe's experiments in connexion with this sub
ject are well known and exceedingly instructive.            One very striking observa
 tion of Goethe's referred to what is technically called " chill
                                                                           " by
                                                                                painters,
 which is due      no doubt to extremely fine varnish particles interposed be

    * Brewster has proved the variability of the position of the neutral point for sky
light with the  sun's altitude.   Is not the proximate cause of this revealed by the fore
going experiments?
    t Sir John Herschel has suggested to me that this change of the polarization from
positive to negative may indicate a change from polarization by reflection to polarization
by refraction. This thought repeatedly occurred to me while looking at the effects ;
but it will require much following up before it emerges into clearness.

232                Prof. Tyndall on the Blue Colour           of the Sky,       [Jan. 14,
endeavoured to connect the colours of the sky with suspended water-vesicles,
and to show that the important observations of Forbes on condensing steam
could also be thus accounted for.              Bruecke's experiments on precipitated
mastic were referred to in my last abstract.              Helmholtz has ascribed the
blueness of the eyes to the action of suspended particles.                  In an article
written nearly nine years ago by myself, the colours of the peat smoke of
the cabins of Killarney* and the colours of the sky were referred to one
and the same cause, while a chapter of the " Glaciers of the Alps,"
published in 1860, is also devoted to this question.                    Roscoe, in con
nexion with       his truly beautiful experiments on the photographic power
of sky-light, has also given various instances of the production of colour
by suspended particles.            In the foregoing experiments the azure was
produced in air, and exhibited a depth and purity far surpassing any
thing that I have ever seen in mote-filled liquids.              Its polarization, more
over, was perfect.
    In his experiments       on fluorescence Professor Stokes had continually to
separate the light reflected from the motes suspended in his liquids, the
action of which he named " false dispersion," from the fluorescent light of
the same liquids, which he ascribed to " true dispersion."                   In fact it is
hardly possible to obtain a liquid without motes, which polarize by re
flection the light falling upon them, truly dispersed light being un-
polarized.      At p. 530 of his celebrated memoir-" On the Change of the
Refrangibility of Light,"           Prof. Stokes adduces        some   significant    facts,
and makes some noteworthy remarks, which bear upon our present subject.
He notices more particularly a specimen of plate glass which,                     seen   by
reflected light, exhibited a blue which was exceedingly like an                   effect  of
fluorescence, but which,          when properly examined, was found to be an
instance of false dispersion.            "It  often struck me," he writes, "while
engaged      in these    observations,     that when the beam         had a continuous
appearance, the polarization was more nearly perfect than when it was
sparkling, so as to force on the mind the conviction that it arose merely
from motesf.        Indeed in the former case the polarization has often appeared
perfect, or all but perfect.         It is possible that this may in some measure
have been due to the circumstance, that when a given quantity                  of light is
diminished in      a  given ratio, the illumination is perceived with more diffi
culty when the light is diffused uniformly, than when it is spread over the
same space, but collected into specks.               Be this as it may, there was at
least no tendency observed towards polarization in a plane perpendicular
   * I have sometimes quenched almost completely, by a Nicol, the light discharged
normally from burning leaves in Hyde Park. The blue smoke from the ignited end of a
cigar polarizes also, but not perfectly.
   f  The azure may be produced in the midst of afield of motes.     By turning the Nicol,
the interstitial blue may be completely quenched, the shining, and apparently unaffected
motes, remaining masters of the field.       A blue cloud, moreover, may be precipitated in
the midst of the azure.     An aqueous cloud thus precipitated reverses the polarization ;
but on the melting away of the cloud the azure and its polarization remain behind.

 to the plane of reflection, when the suspended particles became finer, and
 therefore the beam more nearly continuous."
    Through the courtesy of its owner,                          I
                                             have been permitted to see and
 to experiment with the piece of plate glass above referred to.    Placed in
 front of the electric lamp, whether edgeways or transversely, it discharges
 bluish polarized light laterally, the colour being by no means a bad imita
 tion of the blue of the sky.
    Prof. Stokes considers that this deportment may be invoked to decide
 the question of the direction of the vibrations of polarized light. On this
point      I
         would say, if it can be demonstrated that when the particles are
small in comparison to the length of a wave of light, the vibrations of
a ray reflected by such particles cannot be perpendicular to the vibra
tions of the incident light ; then assuredly the experiments recorded in
the foregoing communication decide the question in favour of Fresnel's
assumption.
     As                     all liquids have motes in them sufficiently nu
          stated above, almost
merous to polarize sensibly the light, and very beautiful effects may be
obtained by simple artificial devices. When, for example, a cell of dis
tilled water is placed in front of the electric lamp, and a slice of the
beam   permitted to pass through                      it,
                                    scarcely any polarized light      dis                          is
charged, and scarcely any colour produced with     plate of selenite. But      a
while the beam     passing through
                           is              bit of         it,

water above the beam, the moment the infinitesimal particles reach the
beam the   liquid sends forth laterally almost perfectly polarized light and                       ;
if the selenite be employed, vivid colours flash into existence.    A still more
brilliant result   obtained with mastic dissolved
                          is                      in   great excess of alcohol.
                                                                              a
     The       selenite        rings   constitute     an    extremely          delicate   test as to  the

        October 16, 1868.
                                     (Abstract.)
     The memoir of which the following is an abstract gives an account of
 some experiments made by the author with the object of determining the
 laws according to which heat travels by conduction through liquids.
     After pointing out the importance of the subject, and briefly recapitu
 lating the methods previously used and the results obtained by other ex
 perimenters, the
                     " Diathermometer " is described.
    This instrument, which may be employed for the examination of the
 thermal resistance or conducting power of solids as well as liquids, has the
 following form.      A hollow brass cone, having a platinum base, is screwed
 with its   apex   downwards   into a tripod-stand which rests upon adjusting
 screws. The apex of the cone is tubular, and carries a cock, through
 which passes a vertical glass tube graduated and dipping into water.
 The level of the water in the tube is nearly as high as the apex of the
 cone.    By means of a micrometer screw, a second cone, exactly similar
 and equal to the first, having its apex upwards, may be brought to any
 required distance from the lower cone.         The brass cones and their pla
 tinum faces are highly polished, and the latter are cleaned by washing
 successively with hot nitric acid, caustic soda, alcohol, and water.         The
 upper   surface  of the lower cone  is brought  into an  exactly horizontal posi
 tion, and the upper cone is lowered to any required distance from it.
 There is thus formed between the platinum faces a cylindrical interval
 of known height or thickness and diameter, and having its opposite faces
 parallel and horizontal.     This wall-less chamber receives the liquid whose
 thermal resistance has to be measured.        A liquid, introduced by means of
 a strangulated pipette of known capacity (equal, say, to the interstitial
 space when the cone-faces are 1 millim. apart) between the cones, remains
 there by means of its adhesion and cohesion.           A description is given of
 the method used to get a constant current of water of uniform and known
 temperature to pass through the upper cone. When such a current passes,
the platinum face of the upper cone becomes heated ; it communicates its
heat to the liquid in contact with it. The heat passes downwards through the
liquid, heats the upper surface of the lower cone, expands the air therein,
and depresses    the level of the water in the tube attached to the lower cone.
    A description is given of the most prominent sources of error of this
instrument,    and the means which were employed to eliminate them.            It
is concluded, from direct experiments (1st, by measuring the time required
for the production of the first heat-effect in the lower cone ; 2ndly, by show
ing the smallness of the difference caused by the introduction of ather-
manous disks), and from comparison with recent results of Magnus, that
the effect of radiation in all the cases tried is negligible if not nothing.
    By measuring resistance rather than        conductivity,   several sources of

  experimental error are eliminated.            If  the two cones are brought into
 actual contact, and water of a known temperature is led for a given time
  through the upper cone, a certain thermal effect is produced in the lower
 one.       If the cones be then separated, and a liquid be interposed between
 them, and       if water of the same temperature as before be led for the same
 time as before through the upper cone, a less thermal effect is produced.
  The difference between the two effects is a measure of the resistance of the
  liquid.      Results so obtained have to be corrected for the varying pressure
 to which the air in the lower cone is subjected as the water in the glass
 tube sinks.       To finds the absolute results in thermal units, we have to take
 into account the diameter of the surface of the lower cone, its capacity, and
 the specific heat of the air which is in it.
     The following are the chief results obtained : —
     (1) The connexion in the instance of water between the thickness and
  the time required for the first-heat effect.
     (2) The connexion between the temperature and the time required for
  the first-heat effect.      It is shown that hotter water conducts heat better
 than colder ; and that the hotter the conducting-water, the greater is the
 difference in rate.
      (3) The connexion between the entire quantity of heat passing in a
  given time and the thickness and temperature of the conducting-water.
      (4) The effect of the solution of various salts in altering the thermal
resistance of water.         Every salt tried was found, when dissolved in water,
to increase its thermal resistance. The author submits that the effect of the
dissolved salt is chiefly, perhaps wholly, due to the displacement of a portion
of the water by a substance having greater resistance, and to the modifica
tion in the specific heat of the liquid, caused by the introduction of the salt.
     (5) The resistance of the liquids in the following list was examined
 under precisely similar circumstances.            The thickness was in each case
 1 millim.        The initial temperature of the liquid was 20o,17C., and the
temperature-difference, AT, was 10°C.              That is, the platinum surface of
   te upper cone was maintained at 30°17C. The duration of the experi
ment in each case was 1'. The numbers show the specific resistance under
the above circumstances, that is, the ratio between the quantities of heat
arrested by the several liquids and that arrested by water.

      The observatories of Kew and
                                         Stonyhurst are not far apart, both being
  in England; the first in the
                                          county of Surrey (Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.,
  Long. 0° 18' 47" W.), and the second in the

  General Sabine) that magnetic
                                     disturbances are of a cosmical nature,
 cannot evidently expect any                                                         we

      This is no doubt approximately true, but
                                                      nevertheless there is on cer

 great ease, inasmuch as the

                                                 subject is one of much interest,

                             appear to exhibit, superposed upon a
which is mainly cosmical, a                                               disturbance
                                 comparatively small effect, which appears to

                                                   unworthy of investigation.

         It would appear from these groups that generally, and on an average,
     the excess of Stonyhurst over Kew in declination disturbances varies with
     the abruptness of the disturbance, being great when the disturbance is very
     abrupt.
         It  is hoped that on some future occasion          further results, derived from      an
     intercomparison of         these curves, may be presented to the Society.

              at Lisbon       during two, three, or several days."                 By Senhor
              Capello, of the Lisbon Observatory. Communicated by Bal
              four Stewart, LL.D. Received October 28, 1868.
         Any    one who carefully examines the magnetograph               curves must often
     notice that there are, during periods of disturbance, synchronous move
     ments of the needle during corresponding hours for two, three, or more
     days.
          In  some cases the repetition is only in two or three parallel movements,
     in others there are true periods of some hours in duration.
         The repeated periods are not entirely similar, their phases being in
     general so modified that in some cases their identity can only be recog
     nized by a very minute investigation.
         The same periods, when repeated, have not always the same total dura
      tion ; nor do they recommence at the same precise hour, but sometimes
     earlier, and sometimes later, the differences varying from a few minutes to
     two or three hours.
          There is also to be remarked in the repeated disturbances a tendency to
     modify in form, or to level their peaks and hollows, or, on the contrary, to
     augment the angular forms.





  1809.]      of some periods of Declination Disturbance at Lisbon.          239
     We also   see  that the greatest number of repetitions belong to the night
  hours,   that is to say, those hours when the movements of the needle
  are easterly.    In the morning hours there do not appear      to be any  well-
 marked repetitions.
     I append examples chosen from the five years complete (July 1863 to
 June 1868) of the declination curves of the Observatory at Lisbon (see
  Plates  V. & VI.).
     A greater number of     cases might   be quoted, but those   I have chosen
 are sufficient  for our purpose.
     Meanwhile I must mention that, in the majority of instances, where no
 relation apparently exists between one disturbance and the disturbances of
 the days preceding and following, the disturbances are generally violent.
     There are twenty-four examples, fifteen of which show repetition on two
  days, eight on three days, and one only where the curve appears repeated
 for four days.
     In order that the identity may be easily recognized, I have placed the
 curves with their corresponding periods vertical, the hours being marked
 on each curve.
     It appears that all the facts exhibited in these examples agree with the
 cosmical theory ; the cause (existing in the sun or in space) appears to
 continue sometimes during two, three, or several days without undergoing
 remarkable transformations.
     The repetition, being sometimes earlier, sometimes later, seems also to
 indicate that the cause possesses a proper movement ; the cause persists,
 but only comes again into operation when the earth by its diurnal rotation
is placed in a similar position or conjunction to that of the preceding days.
    It  would be very curious to analyze the photographs of the sun so as to
 see  if there were any spots in the days of the examples, and if these spots
remained without sensible alteration during the days when the disturbances
remained so similar.

                            Remarks by B.    Stewart.
    I  have compared Senhor Capello's curves      with the corresponding traces
of the declination at Kew, and it would appear that the Lisbon disturb
ances are almost invariably reproduced at Kew at the same time, only to a
greater extent. It would further appear that the same amount of similarity
which the various Lisbon curves exhibit is also exhibited in the corre
sponding Kew curves.
    Opinions may differ with regard to the strength of the evidence exhi
bited by Senhor Capello in support of the peculiar action of the disturbing
forces of which he is an advocate.          It would appear to me that the
strongest point in favour of the hypothesis is not so much the repetition
of a single disturbance as the repetition of a complicated disturbance in
most if not all of its sinuosities.     Several examples of this occur in these
diagrams.

     History.     — During
                      many years after the invention of the barometer and
the consequent discovery of atmospheric pressure, the boiling-point of a
liquid was defined to be the temperature at which its evaporating tendency
is equal to the common pressure of the atmosphere, or the lowest tempera
ture at which its vapour can have the elasticity of common air.
   About the middle of the last century it was noticed by several distin
guished Fellows of this Society that the boiling-point of water under a
constant pressure varies within certain limits, according to the depth to
which the thermometer is plunged into the boiling liquid.
     In the Report                   published in the Transactions for 1777,
                          on Thermometers
it   was stated that the steam from boiling water fairly represents the atmo
spheric pressure ; and it was recommended that, in determining the boiling-
point, the water be boiled in a metal vessel constructed so as to allow the
bulb, and nearly the whole of that part of the stem that contained mercury,
to be surrounded by the steam.
   In the fine experiments undertaken by Dalton, Watt, Robison, Southern,
and others for determining the pressures of saturated steam at different
temperatures above and below the standard boiling-point, it was noticed
that if a minute portion of soda or of some salt soluble in water, and not
capable of rising in vapour with   be allowed to ascend to the top of the
                                                 it,
mercury, the column rises, thereby indicating     diminished pressure of
                                                                  a
steam.   The adhesion of the soda to the water tends to restrain the water
from evaporating, and thus the steam-emitting tension of solution of soda
                                                                       a
is measurably less than that of pure water at the same temperature.
   In 1785 Achard* showed                   by
                                   number of experiments that the boiling-

metallic than in glass vessels.   He also noticed that                if,
                                                           while water was

   In 1812, and again in 1817, Gay-Lussac* noticed Achard's experiments on
the effect of the vessel on the boiling-point,                     and of metal turnings, charcoal
powder, and pounded glass in lowering it.                           He supposed the boiling-point
to vary in different vessels according to the nature of their surfaces, and
that the variation depends both on the conducting-power of the material
for heat and on the polish of the surfaces. When water is boiling in a
glass vessel, the temperature is higher than in a metal one ; but if a few
pinches of iron-filings be put in, the boiling goes on as in a metal vessel.
Without this aid the water boils in bursts, the steam having to overcome
the cohesion or viscosity of the liquid, and its resistance to change of state.
The adhesion of the liquid to the vessel must also be a force analogous to its
viscosity.        The    use      of platinum  is recommended for preventing soubresauts.
   In      1825    Bostockf            noticed that ether in a matras over a spirit-lamp
boiled at     1   12°   F.   ;    but in a test-tube put into hot water it did not begin to
boil under        150°, and on one occasion 175°.             Bits of cedar-wood put into
the ether made it boil at 110°;                      the wood was covered with bubbles until
(according to Bostock) having discharged all its air, it became inactive and
sank.   Bits of quill, feather, wire, pounded glass, &c. also lowered the
boiling-point considerably.   A thermometer plunged into the ether pro
duced bubbles many degrees below the point at which ebullition took place
when the thermometer was not inserted                          :   this effect soon ceased
                                                                                  but by       ;
alternately plunging                  the thermometer into the ether and removing     the               it,
bubbles were produced at each immersion.
   LegrandJ  in 1835 also referred bursting ebullition and soubresauts to
the absence of air in the liquid.  Many salts prevent soubresauts others,                      ;
such as the neutral tartrate of potash, favour them.
   In 1842 Marcet§ considered that iron, zinc, and other substances tend
to depress the boiling-point, because they have    less molecular adhesion
                                                                        a
for water than glass has.  If the vessel be coated with  thin layer of sul       a
phur, gum-lac, or any similar substance that has no sensible adhesion for
water, the temperatures      of the water and of the steam are alike.        The
boiling-point  varies  in flasks of  different kinds of glass, and  in the  same
flask at different times.     In    flask used for holding sulphuric acid the
                                                 a
boiling-point  of  pure  water  was  106° C.   These variations are referred to
molecular changes on the surface of the glass.

242           Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Action of Solid Nuclei         [Jan. 21,
suspended in hot oil are said to have been raised to from 1 10° to 178° C.
without boiling ; but the moment they were touched with a solid they burst
into steam.   Porous bodies acted best because, it is said, they carried down
air to the globules.
     Such is a very brief notice of a few of the numerous memoirs that have
been published on the subject of boiling. The writers are all more or less
disposed to adopt the following conclusions: —      that liquids boil with
                                                    (1)
difficulty, or produce only sudden flashes of steam, as soon as the air which
had been dissolved in them is expelled by heat ; (2) that those liquids that
have the weakest affinity for air, such as sulphuric acid, alcohol, ether, &c.,
boil with the greatest difficulty ; (3) that the adhesion of the liquid to the
vessel, and the mutual cohesion of its own molecules, cause the liquid to
boil in bursts, and produce soubresauts ; (4) that the action of solid sub
stances in preventing soubresauts is by carrying down air.
   My object in introducing a new set of experiments on boiling is (1) to
show the action of solid nuclei in liberating vapour from liquids at or near
the boiling-point    ; (2) to define the conditions under which soubresauts
take place ; and    (3) to show what is the best remedy for the same.
   Definition. — A liquid at or near the boiling-point is a supersaturated
solution of its own vapour, constituted exactly like soda-water, Seltzer-water,
champagne, and solutions of some soluble gases.
   Action of Nuclei. — If the above definition be admitted, the behaviour of
solid substances  in liberating vapour on some occasions, and remaining
"inactive" on others, becomes clear. If the solid be chemically clean, the
solution of vapour will adhere to it as a whole, and there will be no libe
ration of vapour.  If, on the contrary, the solid be unclean, the adhesion
between the vapour and the solid will remain the same as before, while the
adhesion between the liquid and the solid will be more or less diminished,
according to the nature of the impurity and the liquid operated on ; and
hence there will be a separation of vapour.
  But not only is it necessary to distinguish    bodies as chemically clean or
unclean, but also as porous or compact.         The same force by which one
volume of charcoal absorbs 98 volumes of ammoniacal gas, enables charcoal
and some other porous bodies, when thrown into a boiling liquid, to sepa
rate the vapour from         it,
                         and thus to act as most efficient nuclei.
   The liquids operated on were water, alcohol, ether, wood-spirit, naphtha,
carbonic disulphide, benzole, paraffine oil, oil of turpentine, rosemary, and
a   few other essential oils.
   The liquids with low boiling-points are convenient for illustrating the
phenomena in question. Any one of them in tube about one-third or one-
                                                a
half filled may be raised to the boiling-point by putting the tube into hot
water contained     insix- or eight-ounce German flask standing on the ring
                         a
of  aretort-stand.  The tube should fit loosely into the neck, and rest on
the bottom of the flask.    In reheating the water small spirit-lamp flame
                                                     a
may be applied, not directly under the tube, but on one side of it, the

 1869.]           in liberating Vapour from Boiling Liquids.                    243
 object being to keep the liquid in the tube at or near the boiling-point, but
 not actually boiling.       The temperature of the liquid in the tube may be
  taken from time to time, and the thermometer, when not in use, may be kept
 in a tall narrow glass containing a little of the liquid under examination.
     Carbonic disulphide, from its low boiling-point, gives off vapour with
  facility, and is consequently well adapted to show the action of solid nuclei.
 When the tube was placed in the hot water, a quantity of dense white
 vapour ascended from the surface of the liquid to the top of the tube ; but
 instead of overflowing it condensed in copious tears, which fell back into
 the liquid and caused a strong descending current.           On touching the sur
 face of the liquid with the end of a brass wire, violent ebullition set in, the
 bubbles rising to near the mouth of the tube.             The boiling ceased alto
 gether as soon as the wire was removed ; but when the surface was touched
 with a strip of paper, it set in as violently as before.
     Now in these two experiments no air could have been carried down, since
 the surface only was touched, and the boiling continued only while the solid
 was kept in contact with such surface.           Iron wire also liberated vapour
abundantly.       The end of a glass rod was active at two small points, libe
rating from each a rapid stream of bubbles, the remaining portions being
 clean, or having soon become so by the action of the hot liquid, since glass
 is readily cleansed    by liquids near the boiling-point.
     But it is said that rough bodies are most favourable to the liberation of
 vapour.      The hot carbonic disulphide was touched with a rat's-tail file,
 and it produced furious boiling. The file was then held in the flame of a
 spirit-lamp, and while hot placed in the upper part of the tube, so that it
might cool down to about the temperature of the liquid, and yet be shel
tered from the air.        On touching the surface of the disulphide with the
end of the file, there was no liberation of vapour ; and the file was slowly
passed to the bottom of the liquid, but still there was no action.          The file
was now taken out and waved         in the air ; on reinserting it into the liquid,
there was a burst of vapour arising from some mote or speck of dust caught
by the file from the air.       The file was quickly cleaned by the liquid, and
it became inactive as before. It was again taken out and waved in the air,
and on once more putting it into the liquid boiling set in again.
    A tube containing ether was put into the hot-water bath ;            it quickly
reached the boiling-point, and two specks in the tube became active in
discharging rapid streams of bubbles.            Specks of this kind nre often
powerful as nuclei in separating gas from soda-water &c, and in causing
the sudden crystallization of supersaturated saline solutions.         Such specks
in the bottoms of flasks, beakers, and retorts are powerful nuclei in sepa
rating vapour from a liquid during the boiling.            The vapour seems to be
generated by these points, and to proceed from them to the surface in
rapidly enlarging bubbles. These specks consist of iron, carbon, or some
other material which is not so readily cleaned as the glass, or they present
a porous point to the vapour.

244                 Mr. C. Tomlinson      on the Action        of Solid Nuclei           [Jan. 21,
     As the temperature of the water-bath fell, the ether in the tube                        ceased
to give off bubbles of vapour.    A small pellet of writing-paper was now
thrown in : the liquid boiled up furiously, the paper being much agitated,
when suddenly it sank as if dead, and all vapour-giving action ceased.  It
had become, in fact, chemically clean. The paper was removed and a brass
wire passed to the bottom of the tube, when the whole liquid boiled up
briskly during a few seconds ; when, the wire becoming chemically clean,
all action ceased, except from a point near the bottom of the wire, which
continued to pour off a fine stream of bubbles during some minutes.  The
wire was now taken out and filed, in order to get rid of this nucleus. On
returning it to the tube the ether boiled up as before, the handling and
filing having made the whole immersed surface unclean ; but the ether soon
cleaned       it,
             and   became inactive
                        it           but the active point was not only not
                                                ;
got rid of, but there were now two points rapidly discharging vapour.
These points are probably portions of porous dross entangled with the
metal.  During these experiments the ether was maintained at about 96°,
and   it   boiled only when       a   solid nucleus was introduced.
   Methylated          spirit was raised to about
                                            78°.      piece of flint that had
                                                         1        A
long been exposed to the air was put into the tube       gave off vapour from
                                                                   ;   it
its surface in abundance. The   flint was taken  out and  broken, and the two
fragments were returned to the spirit. The newly fractured surfaces, being
chemically clean, were quite inactive, not   single bubble of vapour appear
                                                         a
ing on them,  while the outer surface continued  to give off vapour as before.
A strip of slate gave off vapour from number of points in both surfaces
                                                     a                                           ;
it   was split into two strips and replaced              in the hot liquid     ;   the old surfaces
were active as before, but the fresh surfaces were perfectly inactive.  Mica
and selenite do not answer well for these experiments.      In the specimens
tried, air containing dust had been dragged in in patches between the
plates these, when newly split and put into soda water, showed consider
          ;
able portions that were chemically clean in the midst of unclean patches.
   The action of nuclei can be well exhibited in oils with high boiling-points,
such as the essential oil of turpentine, rosemary, &c.      When the oil                         is
boiling in   tube
                a over    spirit-lamp,
                                 a       strip of slate

may be introduced before the lamp      removed, so as to prevent the oil from
                                                is
being chilled.   If, now, the lamp be taken away, vapour will pour off from
the unclean surface of the slate during some minutes, while the freshly
fractured surface will be quite inactive.                                                             ,
     The behaviour of nuclei,         as thus far described,       isthe same as for super
saturated saline and gaseous solutions.     A                 chemically clean nucleus will
not separate either the salt or the gas from solution                chemically unclean
                                                                       ;   a
nucleus will do so immediately            it   comes in contact with the solution.

accepted,     and     it   be admitted that solid nuclei behave             in the   same manner
under the same conditions in separating salt, or gas, or vapour from solu

               is                                                          ?

1869.]           in liberating Vapour from Boiling Liquids.                   245
    It has been maintained      that air is a powerful nucleus in separating salt
from a supersaturated solution, that it is the air alone, as carried down by
the solid, that acts as a nucleus in separating gases from solution, and that
if  air be absent from a liquid it cannot boil, because there is nothing for
the vapour to expand upon.
    I  have shown in former experiments that, in the case of supersaturated
saline solutions, air is not a nucleus ; but that when it appears to be so, it
is merely acting the part of a carrier of some chemically unclean mote or
speck of dust.       I have also shown that masses of air may be introduced
into soda-water without any separation of the gas, provided the conditions
of chemical purity be observed. A wire-gauze cage, for example, full of air
can be lowered into soda water without producing any discharge of gas into
the cage, or any separation of gas from the surface of the cage, so long as
it is chemically clean ; when unclean, there is an abundant separation of
gas from the surface     of the cage, but the enclosed air remains purely  passive
all the time.
    A similar result may be obtained in the case of a liquid at or near the
boiling-point, if precautions be taken to raise the cage to the temperature
 of the liquid before introducing it.
    The    cage used in these   experiments was smaller than that used in the
 soda-water experiments.       It was five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and an
inch and      a half in length, and made of fine iron-wire gauze, such as is
 used by millers in bolting meal.       Two of these cages were prepared.      One
was cleaned by being put into boiling spirits of wine ; it was rinsed in clean
 water, and so held in the steam of pure water boiling in a test-tube, so that
 the cage and the enclosed air might be adjusted to the temperature of the
 water. The cage was gently lowered into the water the moment the spirit-
 lamp was withdrawn.       There was no escape of vapour ; there was no violent
 boiling up, which must have ensued had air been a nucleus. But here was
 a mass of air in the midst of the liquid, and yet the steam did not expand
 into it. The openings into the cage must have been very much larger than
 the diameter of the globules of air which are supposed always to be present
 when a liquid is boiling, and yet there was no separation of vapour.         This
 clean cage was    removed,  and the other cage, just as  it had left the hands  of
 the maker, was held in the steam of the water of the same tube, and the
 moment the lamp was removed gently lowered into the water.                 It was
 instantly and completely covered with bubbles of steam ; but there was no
 expansion of steam into the cage, and no escape upwards either of steam or
 of air.
     A good result was obtained with paraffine oil boiling at 320°. While
 the cage was being lowered, it became filled about one-half with the liquid,
 but when completely submerged there was no action whatever. But, per
 haps,   it may  be said that the  liquid was now so far below the boiling-point
 as to be incapable of giving off vapour to any nucleus, clean or unclean.
 To test this, a small pellet of paper was thrown in ; the liquid immediately

246           Mr. C. Tomlinson         on the Action     of Solid Nuclei        [Jan.   21
began to seethe audibly,       and it continued to give off vapour during more
than two minutes, the paper pellet resting during the latter part of the
time on the top of the cage.          Similar good results were also obtained with
oil of turpentine.      The cage was also lowered into naphtha, and some of
the other low boiling liquids, and whenever there was an escape of vapour,
 it could always be referred to some unclean portion of the cage.                  Care is
 required   in lowering    the   cage,   so as  to expand   the  air ; for unless  this  be
 properly done, there may be a violent burst of air when the cage is near
 the bottom of the tube.
    It really does seem to me that too much importance has been attached
 to the presence of air and gases in water and other liquids as a necessary
 condition of their boiling.          Cold water dissolves only one-fiftieth of its
 volume of nitrogen, and one twenty-fifth of its volume of oxygen, and these
 small quantities must be reduced to an almost inappreciable amount in hot
 or boiling water ; and yet some observers represent boiling water purged
 of air as reabsorbing it eagerly while still boiling.              The only function I
 should assign to air would be that of diminishing somewhat the cohesive
 force of the liquid molecules.          If  the tube be of narrow bore and chemi
 cally clean, or becomes so by the action of the liquid, adhesion has some
influence in raising the boiling-point. But the mode of heating the liquid
is of still greater importance in this respect, as is evident in De Luc's ex
periments, and was well brought out in Bostock's.                    In the latter case
ether in a matrass over a spirit-lamp, boiled at 1 1 2°; but in a test-tube in hot
water at 150° and even      1 75°  F.     The difference in the conditions of heating
has doubtless been regarded as too evident to be insisted on ; and yet it is
of great importance in studying the conditions under which the boiling-
point of a liquid becomes raised.           When the vessel is placed over a flame,
that part in contact with         the  flame   is heated, or tends to become heated,
much more strongly than the rest of the vessel.                   This produces active
convective currents,     the   effect   of  which   is  to loosen the cohesion of the
particles, and so allow vapour to form more easily.               When the water once
begins   to assume   the  elastic form, it does so from the overheated part of the
vessel in contact with the flame.          In a clean glass vessel containing distilled
water placed   o ver a spirit-lamp, no air-bubbles form, either on the sides or on
the clean thermometer.          They appear on the bottom surface only, playing
about and disappearing upwards until the water is at about 160°. At
about 1 80° small steam-bubbles are given off from the bottom heated sur
face with a crackling noise ; they rise rapidly, expand, and disappear before
reaching the surface ; and until they succeed in doing so, the convective
currents are active.       When the bubbles reach the surface and discharge
steam into the air, the whole column in broken up, cohesion is overcome,
and the boiling is maintained, while the liquid gradually disappears. Such
is the process of boiling in a vessel heated by a flame from below. When,
however, all that part of the vessel (such as a test-tube) that contains
 liquid is put into a hot bath, the whole column is equably heated, or

1869.]            in liberating Vapour from Boiling Liquids.                     247
rather the top of the column is a little more heated than the bottom (since the
upper layers of hot water are at a higher temperature than the lower ones),
and the effect of this is that there are no convective currents ; cohesion is
diminished by expansion, not by convection.                The whole column being
thus about equally heated        at  the same moment, vapour cannot form at one
part in preference to another, except at the surface ; but the whole column
of liquid goes on expanding under an increasing temperature until, becom
ing more and more supersaturated with its own vapour, the increasing
elastic force suddenly overcoming pressure, cohesion, and adhesion, there
is a sudden burst of vapour.          Or before this disruption takes place, if the
surface be touched with a chemically unclean solid, the vapour adhering
to it and thus set free, starts the vapour-giving action, just as touching a
cold supersaturated saline solution starts crystallization, and the action
once begun is propagated.
    If, however, the tube containing the ether &c.           be not chemically clean,
if there   be minute specks and points in the glass (as there often are) all but
invisible to the naked eye, and these be porous or not chemically clean,
vapour will stream from them long before the temperature of disruption is
attained, and there will be no disruption at all.            These points and specks
account for many anomalous cases of crystallization which occur in operat
ing with supersaturated saline solutions, and which puzzled Lowel and
other observers.        We may have, for example, two tubes apparently pre
cisely alike, cleaned in the same manner, containing a hot filtered solution
of the    same salt,   of the same strength, and exposed to the same cooling
influence.      One of the solutions in cooling will suddenly become solid,
while the other will remain liquid, and continue so during weeks and
months.        On examining the solidified solution, it will be found that crys
tallization has been promoted by a minute speck or point at some part of
the tube, no matter where, and from this point, as from a centre, proceed
fine crystalline needles radiating in all directions.
    Soubresauts.    — Liquids which      render the surface of the vessel in which
they    are boiled or distilled chemically clean, thereby favour the production
of soubresauts, or jumping ebullition.             This is a mechanical action which
does not seem to have been             sufficiently explained.     Thus Gay-Lusaac
 says,
         " When     the liquid is above the boiling-point, it is in a forced state :
instantly    a  burst  of vapour is formed, the liquor is thrown out, and the
vessel itself raised."
    But why should the        vessel   be raised  ? The burst of vapour follows    an
 upward motion along the line of least resistance, which, so far from raising
 the vessel, has a precisely contrary effect.         It produces an equal reaction
in a downward direction, tending to force the vessel further into the ring
 of the retort-stand, or other support, and it         is the rebound from this that
 causes the vessel to rise.      If proof be required of the truth of this explana
 tion, it can easily be supplied by suspending, by means of an india-rubber
 line or a bit of elastic, a tube containing crystals of sodic sulphate and a

 248           Mr. C. Tomlinson      on the Action    of Solid Nuclei    [Jan. 21,
  Tery little water.    If  the flame of a spirit-lamp be applied to the bottom
  of the tube, the crystals soon fuse and throw down a portion of the anhy
  drous salt, which is highly favourable to the production of soubresauts.
  If the  tube be suspended against an upright surface, with a mark opposite
  the mouth, it will be easily seen that every burst of steam is accompanied
  by a violent downward jerk.
     In order to mitigate or prevent this bumping ebullition, it has long been
 the practice to introduce into the retort or other vessel, a few angular
 pieces of solid matter, metallic being the best — such as platinum-foil, silver,
 copper, or platinum-wire or filings, fragments of cork or torn cartridge-
 paper.     Faraday   names    these   substances    "promoters of vaporization,"
 without explaining their action      ; and he remarks that if any one of these
 substances be     suddenly introduced,
                                            " it is probable that the consequent
 burst of vapour would be so instantaneous and strong as to do more harm
 than the bumping itself" *.          This is precisely the action of an unclean
 solid introduced into a supersaturated gaseous solution, or in the case of a
liquid at or near the boiling-point, into a supersaturated vaporous solution.
    When sand, fragments of glass, or other non-metallic substances are
 used for preventing bumping, they facilitate the escape of vapour only so
long as they are unclean ; but as siliceous bodies are readily cleansed by
 the action of boiling water and other boiling liquids, they often aggravate
 the evil.     For example, two ounces of distilled water containing a little
sand    from the sand-bath, were boiled in a six-ounce German flask over a
spirit-lamp.      The boiling proceeded briskly without any kicking. The
lamp was removed and the flask left to cool.           Next morning the lamp was
again put under the flask, when the water boiled with such violent kick-
ings as to endanger the safety of the vessel.          The sand had become che
mically clean during the first boiling.            If sand, cleaned by means of
sulphuric acid and much rinsing, be added to water in the first instance,
the kickings set in at once.       Similar results were obtained with fragments
of glass ; when chemically clean, they serve to enlarge the adhesion surfaces,
instead of the vapour-giving       surfaces,  and so increase the resistance to be
overcome.
    With respect to the action of metals, there is no advantage in making
them sharp-pointed, nor in having their surfaces rough ; only, in the latter
case, unclean vapour-giving substances are apt to lodge in the rough lines,
or between the teeth, and so far a file or other rough body may be of ad
vantage.      Metal filings are also liable to collect dust and specks of dirt,
which act as nuclei.       The following experiment shows the action of clean,
as compared      with unclean iron-filings. A flask cleaned by means of sul
phuric    acid contained four ounces of distilled water, which boiled at 215°.
Some iron-filings that had long been kept in spirits of wine were thrown in.
There was a good deal of kicking, and the temperature oscillated between
213^° and 213^°.           Some unclean filings were thrown in, and the effect

   An experiment with mercury may perhaps be of interest. The metal
was cleaned by being repeatedly shaken up with dilute nitric acid ; and after
standing some time under          portion was drawn off from the bottom.

               would have been dangerous to have entirely covered the
bottom with the metal  for, as was, the bursts of vapour were of an ex

                                                             was going      on,   a
dirty mercury was added to the flask, and, although the quantity was not
more than one-sixth of that previously added, the effect was remarkable.
Instead of the uneasy, kicking, jerking bursts, the whole instantly changed
into  brisk, easy, soft boiling, rapid volleys of steam-balls being given off
       a
by the metal, breaking up the mass of water, while the temperature re
mained steady at 212$,°.
   It will thus be seen that the vitreous and metallic bodies employed in
these experiments, as also the bits of paper, shavings of cedar-wood, &c.,
are efficient as nuclei only so long as they are chemically unclean. When
clean they become inactive as

of its powers. It may be transferred from one liquid to another, from
ether to alcohol, from alcohol to water, and from water to oil of turpentine
without ceasing to perform useful work in setting vapour free, making the
ooiling soft and        easy, and preventing soubresauts*.         The   same remark ap

250              Mr. C. Tomlinson       on the Action      of Solid Nuclei     [Jan. 21,
far above the surface.        As in the     case   of charcoal and coke, the liberation
of vapour is confined to the solid nucleus, no part of the flask giving off
visible vapour.       The following data show the influence of the solid upon the
temperature. Five ounces of distilled water in a clean flask boiled at 213££°.
A   small lump of platinum sponge was held in the flame of a spirit-lamp and
then put into the flask.          The temperature subsided to 212^°, and re
mained so for some time.          A second small piece of sponge was similarly
heated and put into the flask ; it was as active as the former piece in libe
rating vapour, but there was no further depression of temperature.                    The
water was now allowed to get cold ; and on again applying the spirit-lamp
there was a good deal of loud explosive bumping, until the water was near
 200°, when the platinum sponge began to give off steam and the boiling be
came soft and regular.
    I  have not the command of apparatus for determining the volume of
 vapour absorbed by platinum sponge, charcoal, &c. at given temperatures ;
 but it would not be difficult to do so by one or other of the contrivances
 made by Dalton and Gay-Lussac             in determining the elasticity of the va
 pours of liquids at the boiling-point.           It would also be interesting to study
the action of nuclei on liquids heated above the pressure of one atmosphere.
    Meerschaum is also an active nucleus. A bit of this substance was thrown
into a tube filled about one-third with newly distilled oil of turpentine
which boiled at about 310°.            The whole tube became filled with bubbles;
 and long after the lamp was removed the nucleus continued to liberate nu
 merous streams of bubbles, an effect that is common to all porous bodies
 tried    in  these   experiments,     but   more remarkable       in some    cases than
 others*.
    A fine-grained pumice-stone        cleaned    in nitric acid, and another   piece not
 cleaned, were both very active in giving off vapour from liquids.              As in the
 case of charcoal and meerschaum, they soon sank to the bottom of the ves
 sel, unless buoyed up by the         steam while the lamp was burning under the
 flask, and continued to pour off vapour so long as the liquid was at or near
 the boiling-point. When the water was below 100°, the flask was put under
 the receiver of an air-pump and the air exhausted ; the water soon boiled,
 and the pumice was as active as before in liberating vapour.
     Chalk, plumbago, and platinum balls are all active promoters of vapori
 zation.
     In the absorption of gases by charcoal, Saussure found that, if a piece of
 charcoal impregnated with one gas were introduced into another gas, a por-
    * Illustrations were frequently afforded in these experiments of the different action
 of a clean as compared with an unclean     surface.   In the experiment in hand, in order
 to take the temperature of the boiling turpentine, the thermometer-bulb and part of the
 stem were made chemically clean; but having on one occasion to leave the thermometer
 in the tube, its bulb was made to rest on the bottom, so that about an inch and a half
 of the stem that had not been made chemically clean became immersed.         This portion
 was instantly covered with minute beads of vapour, so as to give it a frosted appearance,
 exactly distinguishing the clean from the unclean portion.

 tion of the absorbed        gas might either be driven out or     further condensed. A
 somewhat similar action may be noticed by transferring a piece of charcoal
 from one boiling liquid to another.               For example, a small piece of well-
 burnt charcoal from the centre of a lump was held in the flame of a spirit-
 lamp until it was red-hot, and so put into boiling water.                 It was not very
 active at first, but it soon became so, and continued so as long as the heat
  was kept up.         After about half an hour's action the charcoal was taken out,
  dried in a cloth, and put into boiling turpentine ; here it was amazingly
 active, and continued           so during     some  minutes after the lamp had been
 removed.        The charcoal      was dried on filtering-paper     and put into spirits of
 wine   ;  it was     now much less active than fresh charcoal would have been             ;
 and in ether its activity was still more diminished.              The charcoal was next
 put into hot water, and it at once started into activity ; it was far more
 vigorous      than clean charcoal is in water under any of the circumstances
 that have come under my notice. The charcoal was doubly active, not
 only from its porosity, but also from its want of chemical purity. On this
 latter account charcoal          that has been used in boiling turpentine is singu
 larly   active   in   boiling  water.       And this sufficiently accounts for the fact
 noticed by Dufour, that when globules of water in hot oil came into con
 tact with the thermometer or the sides of the vessel, they at once exploded
 into steam ; but I believe the globules of water were in the spheroidal state
 in all the cases of very high temperature cited by him.
     The diminished activity of charcoal and other porous bodies depends on
 the order in which they are introduced into liquids of different boiling-
 points.      If transferred from a liquid with a high into one with a low boil
 ing-point, the charcoal is more or less inactive, its absorptive powers being
 already satisfied ; but if transferred from a liquid with a low into one with
 a high boiling-point its activity is increased, not only by the expulsion of
 the liquid absorbed, but also by the want of chemical purity that accom
 panies the process. Thus meerschaum or coke that is very active in tur
 pentine becomes inactive when transferred to spirits of wine ; but after a
 time a single point in the solid may become active, and produce a rapidly
rising inverted cone of vapour that has a very striking effect.
     Conclusions. — The conclusions to which the foregoing details seem to
lead are : —
     (1) That     a  liquid  at or near the    boiling-point is a supersaturated solution
of its own vapour.
    (2) That a solid non-porous             nucleus either is or is not efficient in libe
rating    vapour, according as        it is chemically  unclean or clean.
    (3) That      as porous bodies do not become inactive, the proper nucleus for
liberating vapour in the operations of boiling and distilling liquids, and for
preventing soubresauts, is charcoal, coke, or some other porous body.

College, to perform some experiments for me.            The following    are selected
from his results.
    1.  A glass flask with a wide neck was filled about one-third with distilled
water l it was boiled over a gas-burner, rapidly weighed, and replaced over
the burner.       After boiling twenty minutes, it was weighed again. The
flask was once more filled to the original quantity, and some bits of coke
were added    ;   it was boiled and weighed as before, the gas-flame remaining
unaltered all the time.
    Results. — Water     boiled away in the first trial (water only) 995 grains,
in the second trial (with coke) 1 130 grains.
    Ratio of products, as 100 : 1 13-6.
    2. Water was made to distil freely from a still, and the quantity col
lected in fifteen minutes was weighed.          A few pieces of coke were then
added to the water in the still, and the distillate          collected again during
fifteen minutes.
    Results. — Distillate from water only, 293 grains      ;  from water with coke,
310 grains.
    Ratio of products, as 100 : 10.V8.
    3. A similar trial was made with common wood-charcoal ; but the vessel
having been made much cleaner by the action of the first boiling, the water
boiled irregularly, with bumping.          The addition of the charcoal made the
boiling tranquil and regular.

        Luteine and the Spectra of Yellow Organic Substances con
        tained in Animals and Plants.             Received   November 11, 1868.
    1.  Name. — Various parts of animals and plants contain a yellow crystal-
lizable substance which has hitherto not been defined, and to which, from
its prominent property,        I                        "
                                 assign the name of luteine."
    2.   Occurrence. — It    occurs normally in the corpora lutea of the ovaries
of mammals, in the serum of the blood, the cells of the adipose            tissue, and
the yellow fat of the secretion of the mammary gland, or butter ; in mam
mals it occurs abnormally in ovarian tumours and cysts, and in serous
effusions.       It is a regular ingredient of the yelks of the eggs of oviparous
animals.       In the vegetable world it is observed in seeds, such as maize ; in
the husks and pulps of fruits, such as anatto ; in roots, such as carrots ;
in leaves, such as those of the coleus ; and in the stamina and petals of a
great variety of flowers.
    3. Properties. — Luteine is easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloro
form, but is insoluble in water.         It is soluble in albuminous liquids, such as
the contents of ovarian cysts and the serum of the blood.              All these solu
tions are yellow ; but the chloroform             solution when concentrated has an
orange-red colour.
    4. Spectrum. — The spectrum of these solutions is distinguished by great
brilliancy of the red, yellow, and green part, and by three absorption-bands,
which are situated in the blue, indigo, and violet part of the spectrum.
The positions of the absorption-bands               vary a little with the different
 solvents.

microscopic, yellow when  thin, orange to  red when   thick, and have no
resemblance to any other known animal or vegetable substance.
   6. Reactions. — Luteine combines with few substances, mercury-acetate
being perhaps the only ordinary reagent by which                it is immediately and
completely precipitated,        as a yellow deposit.     Mercury-nitrate produces a
yellow precipitate, which on standing becomes            white.  Nitric acid poured
over the crystals produces a blue colour, which  immediately passes into
yellow.   The blue is not produced when nitric acid is added to either
alcohol, chloroform, or ether solution, but appears with the solution in
acetic acid and disappears again rapidly.
   7.     Affinity    for Fats. — In
                              the corpora lutea luteine is deposited in gra
nules, which become the darker and larger the older the corpora grow.
In the yelks of eggs it also exists in granules ; and when extracted from
any of these bodies it is always mixed with a considerable amount of an
oily fat which contains cerebrine, and neutral fats, amongst them a peculiar
fat containing phosphorus,         like cerebrine.     In butter after clarification it
is found dissolved.
   8. Affinity for Albumen. — On the other hand, luteine has great attrac
tion to albumen, and can only with difficulty be extracted from serum or
the fluid of ovarian cysts.
   9.     Luteine in Vegetables. — In vegetable matters luteine is contained in
such a form that a clear watery solution cannot easily be obtained.       All
vegetable matters, however, readily yield their luteine to alcohol, and form
by proper treatment clear solutions.  In maize, luteine is accompanied by
fats which are somewhat similar to those of eggs.
   10.     Type      of new Spectra. —The spectrum of luteine is the type of the
spectra of a series of bodies which are probably chemically identical ; but
not all yellow vegetable, animal, or chemical products are identical with
luteine.
   11.     New Spectra like that of Luteine.         —The     yellow-coloured     matters
of the following plants present the spectrum of luteine, or one closely re
sembling it: — (1) Crocus or saffron (stamina); (2) Helianthus annuus
(flower) ; the petals of the following plants — (3) Leontodon taraxa
cum,      (4) Leontodon       (yarietas   ?),   (5) Gazania    elegans,    (6) Marigold

 elegans, (32) Allamanda Hendersonii ; (33) the root of the common
 carrot, Daucus carota ; (34) the seeds of Indian corn, Zea mays. The
  extracts of the berries of the following plants also give the luteine spec
 trum : — (35) Anatto ; (36) Asparagus ; (37) Physalis Alkekengi
                                                                            (outer
 shell and inner berry) ; (38) Solanum dulcamara ; (39) Solanum capsi-
 castrum; (40) Cyphomandra betacea ; (41) Crateegus crus-galli; (42)

     12. Uncertainty.   — In  several of these matters only two absorption-bands
 are   with certainty distinguished.       The third, clearly observable e.g. in
 the extract from the common marigold, requires further researches with
 more powerful light.
     13. Yellow Bodies with one Band. — The yellow principles contained in
 yellow-wood or fustic, in the flowers of the Calceolaria of ornamental
 gardens, and in the yellow faeces of sucking infants, show but one absorp
 tion-band, in the blue.
     14.  Uranium Salts. — The yellow solutions of uranium salts exhibit two
 absorption-bands in the blue, which are very different from any of the above
 bands.
     15. Spectra   of Yellow   Bodies   with continued Absorption of Blue. —A
 great number of yellow substances, amongst them some of the most im
 portant dye-stuffs, show spectra with continued absorption of blue, indigo,
 and violet, without any bands.           On dilution the absorption gradually
 recedes towards violet.      To this class belong (1) Rhamnine, from French
 berries;   (2) Luteoline,  from weld; (3) Quercitrine, from extract of quer
 citron or fluorine; (4) Turmeric; (5) Picric, and (6) Purree, or Indian
 yellow; the orange-coloured solution of the petals of (7) Coreopsis lanceo-
 lata, (8) Helichrysum bracteatum ; the light-yellow solution of (9) Viola
 lutea, (10) Acacia decurrens, (11) Helianthus macrophyllus (?), (12)
 Berberis Darwinii (?), (13) Gnaphalium fcetidum.
     16. Luteine not identical with Hematoidine or Cholophceine. — Luteine
 differs entirely from hematoidine on the one, and from cholopheeine on the
other hand, and ought not, and after the elucidation of its spectral pheno
 mena cannot, any longer be confounded with either of them.
     17. Error of Stadeler and Holm. — The bodies described by Holm and
 Stfideler under the name of hematoidine are not hematoidine, but luteine.
     18. Robin's Hematoidine is Cholopheeine. — The bodies described by Va-
lentiner, and by Robin, Riche, and Mercier, under the name of hematoidine,
are not hematoidine, but cholophaeine or bilirubine.
     19. Hematoidine     peculiar. — Hematoidine      is a useful expression for
certain microscopical crystals and amorphous          bodies occurring in effused
blood, the substance of which has not as yet been chemically isolated or
defined.
    20. Luteine leads to new morphological views. — The discovery of the
identity of luteine from corpora lutea of mammals with that from yelks of
eggs   will probably lead   to a revision  of the present doctrines regarding the

homologies of the various parts of the ova of
birds and lower animals.      Chemically the corpus luteum is the homologue
of the yelk, genetically it is nearly so ; but its use and destiny are totally
different.

Officer of the Privy Council.

 II. "On      Hydrofluoric    Acid."        By G. Gore, F.R.S.            Received
                              November 14, 1868.
                                    (Abstract.)
                       A. Anhydrous Hydrofluoric Acid.
    This paper contains a full description of the leading physical and che
 mical properties of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, and also an account of
 various properties of pure aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The author obtained
 the anhydrous acid by heating dry double fluoride of hydrogen and potas
 sium to redness in a suitable platinum apparatus (shown by a figure ac
 companying the paper), and states the conditions under which it may be
 obtained in a state of purity.
    The composition and purity of the anhydrous acid are shown and care
 fully verified by various methods of analysis, both of the double fluoride
 from which it was prepared and of the acid itself ; and particulars are given
 of all the circumstances necessary to insure reliable and accurate results.
 Nearly all the operations of preparing, purifying, analyzing, and examining
 the properties of the acid were conducted in vessels of platinum, with lu
 tings of paraffin, sulphur, and lampblack ; articles of transparent and
 colourless fluor-spar were also employed in certain cases.          Nearly all the
 manipulations   with the acid were  effected while  the vessels containing it were
 immersed in a strong freezing-mixture of ice and crystallized chloride of
 calcium.
    The pure anhydrous acid is a highly dangerous substance, and requires
 the most extreme degree of care in its manipulation.          It is a perfectly co
 lourless and transparent liquid at 60° Fahr., very thin and mobile, extremely
 volatile, and densely fuming in the air at ordinary temperatures, and ab
 sorbs water very greedily from the atmosphere.          It was perfectly retained
 in platinum bottles, the bottle having a flanged mouth with a platinum
 plate secured with clamp-screws, and a washer of paraffin.

1869.]                Mr. 6. Gore on Hydrofluoric Acid.                        257
    A  number of attempts were made, finally with success, to determine the
molecular volume of the pure anhydrous acid in the gaseous state, the acid
in these cases being prepared by heating pure anhydrous fluoride of silver
with hydrogen in a suitable platinum apparatus over mercury.           Particulars
are given of  the  apparatus employed    and  of  the manipulation.   The   results
obtained show that one volume of hydrogen, in uniting with fluorine, pro
duces not simply one volume of gaseous product as it does when uniting
with oxygen, but two volumes, as in the case of its union with chlorine.
The gaseous acid transferred to glass vessels over mercury did not corrode
the glass, or render it dim in the slightest degree during several weeks, pro
vided that moisture was entirely absent.
    The author concludes that the anhydrous acid he has obtained is destitute
of oxygen, not only from the various analyses and experiments already re
ferred to, but also, 1st, because the double fluoride from which it was pre
pared, when fused and electrolyzed with platinum electrodes, evolved
abundance of inflammable gas at the cathode, but no gas at the anode, al
though oxides are by electrolysis decomposed before fluorides ; 2nd, because
the electrolysis of the acid with platinum electrodes yielded no odour of
ozone, whereas the aqueous acid of various degrees of strength evolved that
odour strongly ; and, 3rd, because the properties of the acid obtained from
hydrogen and fluoride of silver agree with those of the acid obtained
from the double salt.      He considers also that the acid obtained from pure
fluor-spar and monohydrated sulphuric acid heated together in          a platinum
retort is free from oxygen and water.
    The specific gravity of the anhydrous      liquid acid was several times de
termined, both in a    specific-gravity bottle of platinum, and also by means
of   a platinum float submerged     and weighed in the acid. Concordant and
reliable results were obtained ; the specific gravity found was 0-9879 at
55° Fahr., that of distilled water being= 1-000 at the same temperature.
    The anhydrous acid was much more volatile than sulphuric ether. Its
boiling-point was carefully determined in a special apparatus of platinum,
and was found to be 67° Fahr.         Not the slightest sign of freezing occurred
on cooling the acid to —30° Fahr. (= — 34°-5 C.) ; and it is highly probable
that its solidifying temperature is a very great many degrees below this.
Its vapour-tension at 60° Fahr. was also approximately determined, and
was found to be =7-58 lbs. per square inch.           On loosening the lid of a
bottle of the acid at 60° Fahr., the acid vapour is expelled in a jet like
steam from a boiler ; this, together with the low boiling-point, the extremely
dangerous and corrosive nature of the acid, and its great affinity for water,
illustrates the very great difficulty of manipulating with it and retaining it
in a pure state. Nevertheless, by the contrivances described, and by placing
the bottles in a cool cellar (never above a temperature of 60° Fahr.), the
author has succeeded in keeping the liquid acid perfectly, without loss and
unaltered, through the whole of the recent hot summer.
    The electrical relations of different metals &c. in the acid were found to

be as follows at 0°       Fahr.   : —zinc,  tin, lead, cadmium, indium, magnesium,
cobalt, aluminium,         iron, nickel, bismuth, thallium, copper, iridium, silver,
gas-carbon, gold, platinum, palladium.
    Numerous experiments were made of electrolyzing the anhydrous acid
with anodes of gas-carbon, carbon of lignum-vitae and of many other kinds
of wood, of palladium, platinum, and gold. The gas-carbon disintegrated
rapidly   ;  all the kinds of charcoal flew to      pieces quickly ; and the anodes of
palladium, platinum, and gold were corroded without evolution of gas. The
acid with a platinum anode conducted electricity much more readily than
pure water ; but with one of gold it scarcely conducted at all. These elec
trolytic experiments presented extreme difficulties, and were conducted
in a platinum apparatus (shown by a figure) specially devised for the
purpose.       The particulars of the conditions and results obtained are de
scribed     in    the   paper.      Various mixtures of the anhydrous acid with
monohydrated nitric acid, with sulphuric anhydride, and with monohy-
drated sulphuric acid were also electrolyzed by means of platinum anodes,
the particulars and results of which are also described.
    To obtain an idea of the general chemical behaviour of the pure anhy
drous acid, numerous substances (generally anhydrous) were immersed in
separate    portions of the acid in platinum cups, kept at a low temperature
         — 20 °
(0°  to            Fahr.). The acid had scarcely any effect upon any of the me
talloids or noble metals ; and even the base metals in a state of fine powder
did not cause any evolution of hydrogen.              Sodium and potassium behaved
much the same as with water.              Nearly all the salts of the alkali and alka
line-earth     metals produced strong chemical action.            Various anhydrides
(specified) dissolved freely.          Strong aqueous hydrochloric acid produced
active effervescence.        The alkalies and alkaline earths united strongly with
the acid.      Peroxides gave no effect. Numerous oxides (specified) produced
strong   chemical      action, some of them dissolving.       Some nitrates were not
chemically affected ; others (those of lead, barium, and potassium) were
decomposed. Fluorides generally were unchanged ; but those of the alkali-
metals and of thallium produced different degrees of chemical action,
those of ammonium, rubidium, and potassium uniting powerfully.                  Nume
rous chlorides were also unaffected, whilst those of phosphorus (the solid
one  only), antimony (the perchloride), titanium, and of the alkaline-earth
and alkali metals, were decomposed with strong action, and generally with
effervescence.        The chlorates of potassium and sodium were also decom
posed with evolution of chloric acid ; the bromides of the alkaline-earth
and alkali metals behaved like their chlorides.               Bromate of potassium
rapidly set free bromine. Numerous iodides were unaffected ; but those of
the alkaline-earth and alkali metals were strongly decomposed, and iodine
(in some cases only) set free. The anhydrous acid decomposed all carbonates
with effervescence,         and those of the alkaline-earth and alkali metals
with violent action.          Borates of the alkalies also produced very strong
action.       Silico-fluorides of the alkali metals dissolved with effervescence.

1869.]                Mr. G. Gore on Hydrofluoric Acid.                         259
All  sulphides, except those of the alkaline-earth and alkali metals, exhi
bited no change ; the latter evolved sulphuretted hydrogen violently.
Bisulphite of sodium dissolved with effervescence.       Sulphates were variously
affected.    The acid chromates of the alkali metals dissolved with violent
action to blood-red liquids, with evolution of vapour of fluoride of chro
mium.      Cyanide of potassium was violently decomposed, and hydrocyanic
acid set free.   Numerous organic bodies (specified) were also immersed in
the acid   ; most  of the solid ones were quickiy disintegrated.          The acid
mixed with pyroxylic spirit, ether, and alcohol, but not with benzole ; with
spirit of turpentine it exploded, and produced        a blood-red  liquid.    Gutta
percha, india-rubber,       and nearly all the gums and resins were rapidly
disintegrated and generally dissolved to red liquids.          Spermaceti, stearic
acid, and myrtle wax were but little affected, and paraffin not at all.
Sponge was also but little changed.        Gun-cotton, silk, paper, cotton-wool,
calico, gelatine, and parchment were instantly converted into glutinous
substances, and generally dissolved.        The solution of gun-cotton yielded
an inflammable      film   on evaporation    to  dryness.     Pinewood     instantly
blackened.
    From the various physical and chemical properties of the anhydrous acid,
the author concludes that it lies between hydrochloric acid and water, but
is much more closely allied to the former than to the latter.           It is more
readily liquefied than hydrochloric acid, but less readily than steam ; like
hydrochloric acid it decomposes all carbonates ; like water it unites power
 fully with sulphuric and phosphoric anhydrides, with great evolution of
heat.    The fluorides of the alkali metals unite violently with hydrofluoric
acid, as the oxides of those metals unite with water ; the hydrated
fluorides of the alkali metals also, like the hydrated fixed alkalies, have a
 strongly alkaline reaction, and are capable of expelling ammonia from its
salts.    It may be further remarked that the atomic number of fluorine lies
between that of oxygen and chlorine ; and the atomic number of oxygen,
added to that of fluorine, nearly equals that of chlorine.
                         B. Aqueous Hydrofluoric Acid.
    Under the head of the aqueous acid the author enumerates the various
 impurities usually contained in the commercial acid, and describes the
modes he employed         to  detect and estimate them, and to estimate the
amount of      H F in it.    The process employed by him for obtaining the
aqueous acid in a very high degree of purity from the commercial liquid,
is also fully described.     It consists essentially in passing an excess of sul
phuretted hydrogen through the acid, then neutralizing the sulphuric and
hydrofluosilicic acids present by carbonate of potassium, decanting the
liquid after subsidence of the precipitate, removing the excess of sul
phuretted     hydrogen by carbonate of silver, distilling the filtered liquid
in   a leaden retort with a condensing-tube of platinum, aud, finally,
rectifying.

260                                Mr. G. Gore              on a momentary                      [Jan. 28,
     The      of cold upon the aqueous acid was briefly examined, the result
           effect
being that a comparatively small amount of hydrofluoric acid lowers the
freezing-point of water very considerably.
    The chemico-electric series of metals &c. in acid of 10 per cent, and in
that of 30 per cent, were determined.         In the latter case it was as
         —
follows : zinc, magnesium, aluminium, thallium, indium, cadmium, tin,
lead, silicon,       iron,        nickel,        cobalt,mercury, silver,
                                                            antimony,   bismuth,
copper, arsenic, osmium, ruthenium, gas-carbon, platinum, rhodium, pal
ladium, tellurium, osmi-iridium, gold, iridium. Magnesium was remark-
ablyjunacted upon in the aqueous acid.     The chemico-electric relation                                    of
the aqueous acid to other acids with platinum was also determined.
  Various experiments of electrolysis of the aqueous acid of various degrees
of strength were made with anodes of platinum.         Ozone was evolved,
and, with the stronger acid only, the anode was corroded at the same
time.   Mixtures of the aqueous acid with nitric, hydrochloric, sulphuric,
selenious, and phosphoric acids were also electrolyzed with a platinum
anode,     and the results are described.
         III. "    On a momentary Molecular Change in Iron Wire."
                By G. Gore, F.R.S. Received November 14, 1868.
  Whilst making                       of heating a strained iron wire to red

became quite cold.

 at the other end to the hook       L  (see fig, 2).   The cylindrical binding-
 screw   I  has a hook by which it is attached to the loop M (fig. 2) . N is
 an axis suspended delicately upon centres,      and carrying a very light index
 pointer O. The hook L and loop M are separate pieces of metal, and move
 freely upon an axis, P (fig. 2). The distance from the centre of the axis
 N   to that  of P is 12-72 millimetres (=0-5 inch), and to the top of the
 index pointer 25-45 centimetres ( = 10-0 inches) ; every movement hori
 zontally, therefore, of the loop M is attended by a movement, twenty times
 the amount, of the top of the pointer. Q is a screw for supporting the axis
 N. I have found it convenient to put the zero-figure of the index towards
 the left-hand side of the index-plate.    R is a separate piece of wood fitting
 into a rectangular hole in the base board ; it carries a graduated rule, S, for
 measuring the length of the wire to be heated, and is easily removed, so
 that the wire may, if necessary, be heated by means of a row of Bunsen's
 burners.    The rule T is used when measuring the amount of strain. U is
 a vertical stud or pin of brass (of which there are two) for limiting the
 range of movement of the pointer O.
    In using this apparatus, a straight wire or ribbon, H, of a suitable length
and thickness was inserted, the index pointer brought to 0 by adjustment
of the sliding-wire G, and a suitable amount of strain (varying from less
than two ounces to upwards of twenty) put upon the wire by adjusting the
sliding hooked wire E.      One pole of a voltaic battery, generally consisting
of six Grove's elements, was connected with the binding-screw C, and the
other pole then inserted in the mercury-cup of B. As soon as the needle
O attained a maximum or stationary amount of deflection, the battery-wire
was suddenly removed from       B, and the wire allowed to cool.     The move
ment of the needle O was carefully watched both during its movement to
the right hand and also during its return, to see if any irregularity of motion
occurred.
    Wires of the following metals and alloys       were employed  : —palladium,
platinum, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, cadmium, zinc, brass, german-
silver, aluminium, and magnesium ; metallic ribbon was also employed in
certain cases.
    In these experiments the thickness and length of the conducting-wire or
ribbon had to be carefully proportioned to the quantity and electromotive
power of the current, so as to produce in the first experiments with each
metal only a very moderate amount of heat ; thinner (and sometimes also
shorter) wires were then successively used, so as ultimately to develope
sufficient heat to make the metal closely approach its softening or fusion-
point.     The battery employed consisted in each case of six Grove's cells,
each cell containing two zinc plates
                                          3| inches wide, and a platinum plate
3 inches wide, each     immersed about 5 inches in their respective liquids.
The amount of tension imparted by the elastic band required to be care
fully adjusted    to the cohesive   power of each metal ; if the stretching
power    was   too weak, the phenomenon sought for was not clep.rly deve

loped   ; and  if too great, the wire was overstretched or broken when it
approached the softening-point.       The amount of strain imparted was ap
proximately measured by temporarily substituting the body of a small
spring balance for the hooked wire F. The heated wire must be protected
from currents of cold air.
    With wires of iron 0-65 millimetre       thick (size " No. 23") and 21 "5
centimetres long, strained to the extent of 1 0 ounces or more, and heated
to full redness, the phenomenon was clearly developed. As an example, the
needle of the instrument went with regularity to 18-5 of index-plate; the
current was then stopped     ; the needle instantly retreated to 1 ~r 75, then as
quickly advanced to 19-75, and then went slowly and regularly back, but
not to zero. If the temperature of the wire was not sufficiently high, or the
strain upon the wire not enough, the needle went directly back without ex
 hibiting the momentary forward movement.           The temperature and strain
required to be sufficient to actually stretch the wire somewhat at the higher
temperature.      A higher temperature with a less degree of strain, or a
greater degree of strain with a somewhat lower temperature, did not deve-
lope the phenomenon.        The wire was found to be permanently elongated
on cooling.     The amount of elongation of the wire during the momentary
molecular change was usually about            part of the length of the heated
 part of the wire ; but it varied in different experiments ; it was greatest in
amount when the maximum degrees of strain were applied.               The mole
cular change evidently includes a diminution of cohesion at a particular
temperature during the process of cooling ; and it is interesting to notice
that at the same temperature during the heating-process no such loss of
cohesion (nor any increase of cohesion) takes place ; a certain temperature
 and strain are therefore not alone sufficient to produce it ; the condition
of cooling must also be included.        The phenomena which occur during
cooling are not the exact converse of those which take place during heating.
    The phenomenon of elongation of iron wire during the process of cool
ing evidently lies within very narrow limits       ; it could only be obtained
 (with the particular battery employed)     with  wires  about 21-5 centimetres
 (=8^ inch) long, and about 0-65 millimetre ( = Nos. 22 & 23 of or
 dinary wire-gauge) thick, having a strain upon them of 10 ounces or
upwards    ; with  a weaker battery the phenomenon could only be obtained
by employing a shorter and thinner wire.
    The experiment may easily be verified in a simpler manner by stretching
an iron wire about l-0 millimetre diameter between two fixed supports,
keeping it in a sufficient and proper degree of tension by means of an
elastic band, then heating it to full redness by means of a row of Bunsen's
burners, and, as soon as it has stretched somewhat, suddenly cutting off the
source of heat.      In some experiments of this kind, with a row (42 centi
metres long) of 21 burners and a row (76 centimetres long) of 43 burners,
and the wire attached to a needle with index-plate, as in the figure, con
spicuous effects were obtained   ; but the momentary elongation was relatively

 much     less (in one instance ^s of the length of the heated part) than
 when a battery was employed, apparently in consequence of the wire being
 less intensely heated.
    A large number of experiments were made with wires of palladium, pla
 tinum, gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, cadmium, zinc, brass, german-silver,
 aluminium, and magnesium (wire and ribbon), diminishing the length and
 thickness of the wire in each case, and adjusting the tension until suitable
 temperature and strain were obtained ; but in no instance could a similar
 molecular change to that observed in iron be detected.                   Palladium and
 platinum wires of different lengths, thickness, and degrees of strain were
 examined at various temperatures, up to that of a white heat ; but no irre
 gularity of cohesion, except that of gradual softening at the higher tempera
 tures, was observed   ; they instantly contracted with regular action on stopping
 the current.     Several gold wires were similarly examined at different tem
 peratures up to that of a full red heat ; no irregularity occurred either
 during heating or cooling ; but little tension (about 4 ounces) was applied,
on account of the weak cohesion of this metal.                Wires of silver similarly
examined would only bear a strain of about 2 ounces, and a temperature
of feeble red heat visible in daylight ; no irregularity of elongation or con
traction occurred during heating and cooling.                By employing exactly the
proper temperature and strain, a very interesting phenomenon was ob
served ; the wire melted distinctly on its surface without fusing in its inte
rior, although the surface      was most exposed        to the cooling influence    of the
air  ; this occurred without the wire breaking, as it would have done if its
interior portion had melted ; the phenomenon indicates the passage of the
electricity by the surface of the wire in preference to passing by its inte
rior. Wires of copper expanded regularly until they became red-hot ; they
then contracted slightly (notwithstanding              the strain applied to them),
probably in consequence of a cooling effect of increased radiation produced
by the oxidized surface, as a similar effect occurred with brass and german-
silver*.     On stopping the current the wire contracted without manifest
irregularity. Wires of lead and tin were difficult to examine by this method,
on account of their extremely feeble cohesion and the low temperature at
which    they softened:     wires about 1-63 millimetre         diameter, 25-5 centi
metres    long (with a strain upon them of about one ounce), were employed ;
no irregularity was detected. Wires of cadmium from l-255 millimetre to
 1-525 millimetre thick, and 24-2 centimetres long (with a strain of two
ounces), exhibited a slight irregularity of expansion at the lower tempera
tures ; they elongated, and also cooled, with extreme slowness, more slowly
than those of any other metal.           Wires of zinc exhibited a slight irregu
larity of expansion, like those of cadmium            ; the most suitable ones were
about 25 centimetres long and 1-2 millimetre in diameter, with a strain
of 10 ounces.       Wires of brass and german-silver, when heated to redness,

           supposition does not agree with the results obtained with iron wire, which also
oxidizes freely.

behaved like those of copper in expanding regularly until a maximum was
attained, and then contracting slightly to a definite point whilst the battery
remained connected ; on stopping the current they contracted without irre
gularity.       When examined at lower temperatures, with a greater degree
of strain, no irregularity      was observed.     Various wires of aluminium were
examined      ; the most suitable was one 0-88 millimetre         thick,   20-4 centi
metres long, with a strain of 1 2^ounces-; no irregularity was observed at
any temperature below redness ; aluminium expanded and cooled very
slowly, but less so than cadmium. Various wires and ribbon of magnesium
were also examined below a red heat, but no irregularity              of cohesion,  ex
cept that due to gradual softening by heat, was detected.
     All the metals examined exhibited gradual loss of cohesion          at the higher
temperatures      if a suitable  strain was  applied  to develope it.   It is probable
that if the fractions of time occupied by the needle in passing over each
division of the index were noted, and the wire perfectly protected from
currents of air, small irregularities of molecular or cohesive change might
be detected by this method ; cadmium and zinc offer a prospect of this
kind.
     This molecular change would probably be found to exist in large masses
of wrought iron as well as in the small specimens of wire which I have
examined, and would come into operation in various cases where those
masses are subjected to the conjoint influence of heat and strain, as in
various engineering operations, the destruction of buildings by fire, and
other cases.

       Heat."      By G. Gore, F.R.S.          Received November 14, 1868.
     I have devised the following apparatus for demonstrating a relation of
current electricity to magnetism and heat.
     A A, fig. 3, is a wooden base, upon which is supported, by four brass
clamps, two, B, B, on each side, a coil of wire, C ; the coil is 6 inches long,
 1
   1  inch external diameter, and       f of an inch internal diameter, lined with
a   thin glass tube ; it consists of 18 layers, or about 3000 turns of insulated
copper wire of 0-415 millim. diameter (or size No. 26 of ordinary wire-
gauge) ; D is a permanent bar-magnet held in its place by the screws E, E,
and having upon its poles two flat armatures of soft iron, F, F, placed edgewise.
Within the axis of the coil is a straight wire of soft iron, G, one end of
which     is held fast by the pillar-screw     H, and the other by the cylindrical
binding-screw I ; the latter screw has a hook, to which is attached a vul
canized india-rubber band, J, which is stretched and held secure by the
hooked brass rod K and the pillar-screw L.               The screw H is surmounted
by    a small mercury      cup for making connexions with one pole of a voltaic
 battery,    the  other  pole of the battery being secured to the pillar-screw M,

the cylindrical  binding-screw        I            with
                                          by a copper wire
                                                         a  middle flattened
portion O to impart to it flexibility.  The two ends of the fine wire coil
are soldered to two small binding-screws at the back ; those screws are but
partly shown in the sketch, and are for the purpose of connexion with a
suitable galvanometer.     The armatures F, F are grooved on their upper
edges, and the iron  wire lies in these grooves in contact with them ; and
to prevent the electric current passing through the magnet, a small piece
of paper or other thin non-conductor is inserted between the magnet and
one   of the armatures. The battery employed consisted of six Grove's ele
ments (arranged in one series), with the immersed portion of platinum plates
about 5 inches by 3 inches ; it was sufficiently strong to heat an iron wire
l-03 millim. diameter and 20-5 centims. long to a low red heat.
   By making the contacts of the battery in unison with the movements of
the galvanometer-needles, a swing of about 1 2 degrees of the needles each
way was obtained.    The galvanometer was not a very sensitive one ; it con
tained 192 turns of wire.     Similar results were obtained with a coil 8
inches long and        inch diameter containing 16 layers, or about 3776
                       l.{

a 6-inch coil consisting of 40 layers, or about 10,000 turns of wire 0-10
millim. diameter, also with several other coils. The maximum effect of             1   2
degrees each way   with six Grove's cells in one series was obtained when the
wire became visibly red-hot, and this occurred with an iron wire -03 millim.
                                                                       1

                                                  8
distant from the coil.    A reversal of the direction of the battery current
did not reverse or perceptibly affect the current induced in the coil but      ;
by reversing the poles of the magnet, the direction of the induced current
was reversed. On disconnecting the battery, and thereby cooling the iron
wire, reversed direction of induced current was produced.

coil by continuously heating the iron wire.        In several experiments, by
employing twelve similar Grove's elements as a double series of six intensity,
an iron wire 1-56 millim. diameter was made bright red-hot ; and by keeping
the current continuous until the galvanometer-needles settled nearly at zero,
and then suddenly disconnecting the battery, the needles remained nearly
stationary during several seconds, and then went rapidly to about 10 : this
slow decline of the current during the first few seconds of cooling was
probably connected with the
                               " momentary molecular change of iron wire "
during cooling which     I  have described in the preceding paper.        The
irregularity of movement of the needles did not occur unless the wire
was bright red-hot, a condition which was also necessary for obtaining the
molecular change.
   The direction of the current induced by heating the iron wire was found
by experiment to be the same as that which was produced by removing
the magnet from the coil ; therefore the heat acted simply by diminishing
the magnetism, and the results were in accordance with, and afford a
further confirmation of, the general law, that wherever there is increasing
or decreasing magnetism, there is a tendency to an electric current in a
conductor at right angles to it.

       By Professor Owen, F.R.S.        Received November 17, 1868.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The author, referring to his previous paper on the Equine fossil remains
from the cavern of Bruniquel, finds, in the preliminary illustrations of the
dental characters of existing species of the Horse-kind, the requisite and
much-needed basis of comparison for the determination of other fossils of
the Solidungulate group, and he devotes the present paper to the elucidation
of those which have reached him from Central and South America.
   He commences by referring to the type-specimens of teeth, from two
localities in South America, on which he founded the species E. curvidens,
describing it (in 1840)
                         " as one coexisting with the Megatherium, Toxodon,
&c. in that continent, and which had become extinct at a prehistoric period."
   He then proceeds to describe more complete evidences of the dentition
of   an   allied extinct Horse   discovered   by Don    Antonio del Castillo,
mining engineer, in newer Tertiary deposits of the Valley of Mexico.
Besides repeating the originally described characters of the curvature of

 the grinder, with a certain resemblance of enamel-pattern to the grinding-
 surface of the E. curvidens, they show a greater degree of curvature of the
 alveolar series of the upper jaw, with corresponding greater convergence of
 the right and left molar series toward the fore part of the palate, than in
 any previously described species of Equus.
    Deciduous teeth of the Equus conversidens from the same deposits of the
 Valley of Mexico are described.        Having determined these corroborative
 and distinctive characters of aboriginal and now extinct American horses,
 the author remarks,      " It is unlikely, seeing the avidity with which the
 Indians of the Pampas have seized and subjugated the stray descendants
 of the European      horses introduced    by the Spanish 'Conquistadors' of
 South America, and the able use the nomad natives make of the multitu
 dinous progeny of those war-horses at the present day, that any such
 tameable Equine should have been killed off or extirpated by the ancestors
 of the South-American aborigines."         If, therefore, the fossil Equine teeth
 do belong, as the author deems that he has proved, to a species distinct
from Equus caballus, Linn., " the circumstances of their discovery, and the
fact of the extinction of such (curvident and conversident) species of Horse
would point to some other cause than that of man's hostility to so useful an
animal, and such doubt as to extinction          by human means may then be
extended to the contemporaries      of the Equus curvidens and E. conversidens,
viz. Megatherium, Mylodon, Toxodon, Nesodon, Macrauchenia, Glyptodon,
Mastodon, &c."
    The author next proceeds to describe fossil teeth from the upper and
lower jaws, discovered by Don A. del Castillo in the same deposits of the
 Valley of Mexico, and referable to a third species of Equus, viz. Equus
 tau, Ow. Finally the author proceeds to the description of some fossil
upper molar teeth from Pampas deposit, in the bed of a brook falling into
the " Arroyo Negro
                        " near
                                  Paysandi, Monte Video, showing characters
more decisively distinct from any other known species of Equus than have
hitherto been described.
   The  degree   of curvature of the upper molar teeth     exceeds that in Equus
curvidens, and equals that in Toxodon ; and the specific name " arcidens "
is accordingly proposed for this aboriginal American species of Horse.
It is compared with so much of the characters as have been given by Dr.
Lund of his Equus neogceus and E. principalis from Brazilian caverns ; «nd
the differences from all other Equines which these species and the E.
arcidens agree in presenting lead the author to view them as having, like
the Hippotherium of Kaup, formed a generic group in the Equidce, for
which he proposes the name Hippidion.
   The fossil teeth of     H.  arcidens were found associated with remains of
Megatherium and Glyptodon in the above-named locality ; the specimens
were transmitted and presented to the British Museum
                                                                 (in 1867) by the
Hon. W. G. Lettsom, Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Monte Video.

       Received November 19, 1868.
    In the present paper        I beg leave to communicate to the Royal Society
some experiments made          for the purpose of testing the views which I have
lately* advanced respecting the constitution of the mustard-oils and the
sulphocyanic ethers isomeric with them.             These experiments were exclu
sively performed in the ethyl-series.         Not only is ethylamine much more
 readily prepared     than   the  methyl-base, but the elucidation of the meta
 morphoses examined was not unfrequently facilitated by the selection of
 compounds for the construction of which the material had simultaneously
 been taken from the monocarbon- and dicarbon- series.
    Action of Hydrogen in condicione nascendi           upon  Ethylic Mustard-oil.
    I have, in the first place, examined this reaction, because experiments
performed by M. Oeserf have already supplied some information on the
behaviour of allylic mustard-oil under analogous conditions.
    On adding zinc and hydrochloric acid to an alcoholic solution of ethylic
mustard-oil an evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen becomes at once percep
tible ; it soon diminishes, but continues for several days.                In the several
stages of this process the gas evolved was examined for carbonic acid ; but
not a trace of this gas could be detected. As soon as the evolution of sul
phuretted hydrogen has ceased, the liquid is found to contain a large
quantity of fine white needles ; when submitted to distillation, it yields the
same body, which, passing over with the vapour of water and alcohol, col
lects in the form of white crystals upon the water in the receiver.                If the
residue be now allowed to cool, an additional quantity of the crystalline
compound is deposited. Analysis and examination of the properties of these
 crystals have identified them with the substance            generated     by the action
of sulphuretted      hydrogen upon methylic         aldehyde J,    to which I assigned
the formula

stating at the same time that a higher molecular weight might possibly be
found to belong to this sulphaldehyde of the methyl-series.
    On adding strong soda-lye to the liquid containing chloride of zinc, from
which the crystals      have been separated, until the oxide at first precipitated
is redissolved, a strongly alkaline layer collects on the surface of the solu
tion, which may be considerably augmented by the intervention of a small
quantity of alcohol.        This layer was removed and separated from adhering
soda by distillation.       When the very volatile distillate was saturated with

hydrochloric acid and mixed with perchloride of platinum, the well-known
hexagonal tables of the ethylamine-platinum-salt  were at once deposited.
The mother-liquor was found to contain a second salt, much more soluble
both in water and alcohol, which      was precipitated    by ether.    By recrys-
tallization it was obtained in magnificent orange-red needles,      which on ana
lysis exhibited the composition of the platinum-salt of methyl-ethylamine.
   The interpretation of these observations presents no difficulty. There
are obviously two parallel reactions to be distinguished.        In the first place
(and this is doubtless the principal reaction) there are     two molecules of hy
drogen inserted at the place in which the two compounds of ethylic mus
tard-oil are joined together — this insertion giving rise to the formation, on
the one hand, of ethylamine, the mother-compound of the mustard-oil, and
on the other hand, of methylic sulphaldehyde, the hydrogen-derivative of
bisulphide of carbon.

Or the substance, under the powerful influence of hydrogen, splits in an
other place ; three molecules of hydrogen penetrate into the fragment of
the bisulphide, and the products of this secondary and subordinate trans
formation are methyl-ethylamine and sulphuretted hydrogen.

with hydrocyanic acid. By the hydrate of sodium large quantities of sul
phuretted hydrogen and ethyl-mercaptan were fixed; the two metallic
salts,lastly, retained some ethylic mercaptan and ethylic sulphide.  The
gas collected in the gas-holder was transmitted once more through lime-
water and sodic hydrate, and then passed over layer of incandescent oxide
                                                 a

thus produced, proving that the hydrogen contained carbonated gas, which

1869.]        Ethylic Mustard-oil and Sulphocyanide of Ethyl.                 271
   On distilling the liquid, when the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen
has ceased, there are evolved, together with a small quantity of the latter
gas, ethylic mercaptan, sulphide and, under certain conditions, even bisul
phide of ethyl, these     several compounds being easily recognized by their
special    reactions.   The   residue, when heated with hydrate of sodium,
disengages abundant quantities of ammonia, and also an appreciable amount
of methylamine.
    If  these varied results be taken into consideration, the action    of nascent
hydrogen upon sulphocyanide of ethyl would appear to be a very compli
cated process.       The principal transformation of the body is nevertheless
extremely simple.       Here, again, the point of junction of the two components
of sulphocyanide of ethyl is the vulnerable part.        A molecule   of hydrogen
entering at this point, between the sulphur and the carbon, the compound
separates into hydrocyanic acid on the one hand and ethylic mercaptan on
the other.
All   the other products     belong to secondary reactions.      In contact with
hydrogen, hydrocyanic       acid is converted into methylamine.

    Action of Hydrogen in condicione nascendi upon Allylic Mustard-oil.
    According to the experiments of M. Oeser already quoted, the mustard-
 oil par excellence, when submitted to nascent hydrogen, would appear to
 undergo a transformation different from that of its ethylic congener.          M.
 Oeser represents the metamorphosis of the allyl-compound           by the follow
 ing equation    : —
                                                   N + HaS+COa.
                    °cf' } N+2HaO=C^}
     This equation, however, obviously represents no reduction process ; the
 nascent hydrogen has no share in this reaction, which is simply accomplished
 under the influence of the elements of water.
     To clear up this anomaly, the experiments      above described were repeated
 in the allyl-series.    On treating mustard-oil with zinc and hydrochloric
 acid, an abundant      evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen was observed, but
 (under the conditions, at all events, in which I repeatedly performed this
 experiment) the gas did not contain a trace of carbonic acid ; on the other
 hand, large quantities of the sulphaldehyde of the methyl-series were inva

riably obtained.    If the spirit which is employed in dissolving the mustard-
oil to be reduced   be dilute,   a fine crystallization of the sulphaldehyde is
frequently observed after the lapse of a few hours.      Together with this
compound allylamine is generated in large proportion.     The principal reac
tion is thus seen to be exactly the same as with ethylic mustard-oil.

The sulphuretted hydrogen would therefore likewise belong to a secondary
reaction. Vainly, however, have I endeavoured to trace in the mother-
liquor of the allylamine-platinum salt the existence of the platinum com
pound of a second base — of methyl-allylamine for instance ; though working
on a rather large scale, I was unable to detect even a trace of such a com
pound.    The origin of the sulphuretted hydrogen, however, could not be
doubtful.   In the gas evolved during the reaction, a large amount of a
gaseous   hydrocarbon (very probably marsh-gas) was present, as could be

doubtful —  evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen in torrents, copious sepa
ration of sulphuretted methylic aldehyde, in the residue ammonia and me-
thylamine.    The reaction is not without interest, since the hydrosulpho
cyanic acid liberated by the hydrochloric acid exhibits the principal meta
morphosis both of mustard-oil and the isomeric sulphocyauide of ethyl.

Simultaneously, however, another reaction takes place, which up to the
present moment    Ihave not yet been able to elucidate.  Together with

allylamine there is formed a second liquid base having a very high boiling-
point, which yields an amorphous platinum-salt.                It remains behind as an
oily layer, not volatilizable with the vapour of water, when the product of
the action of hydrochloric acid upon mustard-oil,              for the purpose of puri
fying the allylamine, is distilled with soda.
               Action of Sulphuric Acid upon Ethylic Mustard-oil.
    Dilute sulphuric     acid acts like water and hydrochloric            acid.   Highly
characteristic,    however, is the behaviour       of ethylic mustard-oil towards
concentrated sulphuric acid.         The   two  liquids mix with considerable evo
lution of heat, and after a few moments a powerful disengagement of gas
takes place, which, if the reaction be promoted by the application of heat,
may be increased to explosive violence.           The gas evolved is inflammable,
and burns with a blue flame.          It has a peculiar odour, essentially different
from that of bisulphide of carbon, or of sulphuretted hydrogen ; from the
latter it differs, moreover, by its having no action upon lead-paper.               These
are the characteristics of sulphoxide of carbon, lately discovered byvonThan.
The residue contains sulphate of ethylaminc.

    In contact with water, more especially in the               presence of an alkali,
sulphoxide    of  carbon   is converted   into  carbonic    acid  and sulphuretted hy
drogen.     Treatment of ethylic mustard-oil with concentrated sulphuric
acid thus enables us to arrest halfway the transformation which is accom
plished under the influence of water.
           Action of Sulphuric Acid upon Sulphocyanide of Ethyl.
    Dilute sulphuric acid     acts but slowly upon sulphocyanide          of ethyl ; con
centrated acid, on the other hand, attacks the compound with great energy,
powerful evolution of heat and disengagement of carbonic and sulphurous
acids taking place.      On distilling the liquid after addition of water, sulphu
retted ethereal products are volatilized ; the deep-brown residue, when treated
with lime, yields abundance of ammonia. In the presence of these observa
tions, it appeared very probable that the action of sulphuric acid resembled
that of water and of hydrochloric acid, and that in this case likewise the ethyl-
group was eliminated in combination with sulphur.
    Interesting   experiments on the action of sulphuric acid upon sulpho
cyanide   of   ethyl, lately communicated to the Chemical Society of Berlin*
by Messrs. Schmitt and Glutz, have indeed verified this assumption ; but
these experiments have proved, moreover, that the reaction, exactly as in
the case of the transformation of ethylic mustard-oil, is capable of stopping
 at an intermediate stage, inasmuch as the above-named chemists have suc
 ceeded in isolating from the products        of the reaction     a compound isomeric

since two molecules of mercaptan contain the elements of one molecule of
sulphide of ethyl and one molecule of sulphuretted hydrogen, the final
products of decomposition of sulphocyanide of ethyl by water and by
hydrochloric and sulphuric acids are virtually the same.

 est basse, à niveau fort inégal et tourmenté ; souvent elle ne dépasse pas
 les saillies de la photosphère.         Les protubérances ne paraissent être que

I. "On       the Structure     and Development of the Skull of the Com
        mon Fowl (Gallus domesticus)."                By W.      Kitchen Parker,
        F.R.S. Received November 25, 1868.
                                     (Abstract.)
    In a former paper (Phil. Trans. 1866, vol. clvi. part 1, pp. 113-183,
plates 7-15) I described the structure and development of the skull in the
Ostrich tribe, and the structure of the adult skull of the Tinamou — a bird
which connects the Fowls with the Ostriches, but which has an essentially
struthious skull.

278        Mr.W. K.Parker       on the Structure and Development       of [Feb. 11,
    That paper was given as the first of a proposed series, the subsequent
 communications to be more special (treating of one species at a time) and
 carrying the study of the development of the cranium and face to much
earlier stages than was practicable in the case of the struthious birds.
    Several years ago Professor Huxley strongly advised me to concentrate
my attention for some considerable time on the morphology of the skull of
the Common Fowl       ;   that excellent advice was at length taken, and the paper
now offered is the result.
    A full   examination of the earlier conditions of the chick's skull has cost
me much anxious labour ; but my supply of embryonic birds (through the
kindness of friends) * was very copious, and in time the structure of the
early conditions of the skull became manifest to me.
    The earliest modifications undergone by the embryonic              head are not
given in this paper : they are already well known to embryologists ; and
my purpose is not to describe the general development of the embryo, but
merely the skeletal parts of the head.
    These parts are fairly differentiated from the other tissues on the fourth
day of incubation, when the head of the chick is a quarter of an inch
                                                               " first stage." The
 (3 lines) in length ; this in my paper is termed the
next stage is that of the chick with a head from 4 to 5 lines in length, the
third 8 to 9 lines, and so on. The ripe chick characterizes the " fifth
stage   ;" and then   I  have worked out the skull of the chicken when three
weeks,    two  months,   three  months, and from six to nine months old, the
skull of the aged Fowl forming the " last stage."
    During all this time (from their first appearance to their highly consoli
dated condition in old age) the skeletal parts are undergoing continual
change, obliteration of almost all traces of the composite condition of the
early skull being the result — except where there is a hinge, for there the
parts retain perfect mobility.
    Here it may be remarked that although the Fowl is only an approach
to what may be called a typical Bird, yet its skull presents a much greater
degree of coalescence of primary centres than might have been expected
from a type which is removed so few steps from the semistruthious Tina-
mou, a bird which retains so many of its cranial sutures.
    The multiplicity of parts in the Bird's skull at certain stages very accu
rately represents what is persistent in the Fish, in the Reptile, and to some
degree    in certain Mammals      ; but the skull at first is as simple as that of a
Lamprey      or a Shark,   and, in  the Bird above all other Vertebrates, reverts in
adult age to its primordial simplicity — all, or nearly all, its metamorphic
changes having vanished and left no trace behind them.
   Although in this memoir         I have no business with the Fish, yet all along
I  have worked at the Fish equally with the Bird, the lower type being
taken as a guide through the intricacies of the higher ; and here the Car-
   * Dr. Murie is especially to be thanked for his most painstaking kindness in
                                                                                 this
respect.

1869.]                     the   Skull of Gallus domesticus.                          279
tilaginous and the Osseous Fishes          are never   fairly out of sight.     The Rep
tile, and especially the Lizard, has        heen less helpful to me, on account of its
great specialization.
     On the fourth day of incubation the cranial part of the notochord is two-
thirds the length of the primordial skull, but it does not quite reach the
pituitary body ; it lies therefore entirely in the occipito-otic region. The
fore part of the skull-base extends horizontally very little in front of the
pituitary space ; this arises from the fact that the "mesocephalic flexure"
has turned the "horns of the trabecular
                                                   "  under the head.     Thus at this
stage    the nasal, oral, and    postoral  clefts are all seen on  the under    surface of
the head and neck of the chick.            At this time the facial arches     have begun
 to chondrify    ; but only the quadrate, the Meckelian rod, and the lower
 thyro-hyal are really cartilaginous ; the other parts are merely tracts of
thickened blastema or indifferent tissue.
     In the second   stage an orbito-nasal septum has been formed          ;  the " horns
 of the trabecule
                      "  have become      the   " nasal alae," and an azygous bud of
 cartilage has grown downwards between them ; this is the "praenasal" or
 snout cartilage ; it is the axis of the intermaxillary region.              At the com
 mencement of this second stage the primordial skull stands on the same
 morphological level as that of the ripe embryo of the Sea-turtle ; at the end
 of this stage it has become struthious ; and now parosteal tracts (the an
 gular, surangular, dentary, &c.) appear round the mandibular rod.
                        I
     In this abstract shall not trace the changes of the skull any further,
 but conclude with a few remarks on the nomenclature of certain splints,
 and as to the nature of the great basicranial bones.
     Some years ago     I found that certain birds (for instance the Emeu) pos
 sessed an additional maxillary bone on each side ; knowing that the so-
 called   " turbinal "  of the Lizard and Snake was one of thejmaxillary series,
 I set myself to find the homologies of these splints. Renaming the rep
 tilian bones " praevomers," on account of their relation to the vomer, and
 supposing the feeble maxillaries of the Bird to represent them, I considered
 that the true maxillaries were to be found in those newly found cheek
 bones of the Emeu and some other birds.
     After discussion with Professor Huxley I have determined to drop the
 term "praevomer," and to call the supposed turbinal of the Lizard "septo-
 maxillary," and the additional bone in the Bird's face " postmaxillary."
     In many Birds, but not in the Fowl, the " septo-maxillary " is largely
 represented — not, however,        as a  distinct osseous piece, but as an outgrowth
 of the true maxillary.
     With regard     to the basicranial bones,      I have now satisfied myself that
 the   " parasphenoid " of      the Osseous Fish and the Batrachian          reappears in
 the Bird as three osseous centres        — all true " parostoses,"     as in the single
 piece of the lower types     ;  these three pieces are, the
                                                               " rostrum " of    the basi-
 sphenoid and the two
                            " basitemporals."
     These three centres rapidly coalesce to form one piece, the exact counter

part of the Ichthyic and Batrachian bone ; but just as this coalescence
begins, ossification proceeds inwards from these
                                                          " parostoses," and affects
the overlying cartilage, the cartilage of the basisphenoidal region having no
other osseous nuclei.      This process of the extension inwards of ossification
from a splint-bone     to a cartilaginous    rod or plate    I  have already called
"   osseous  grafting"*.
    In my former paper the basisphenoidal           " rostrum "   and   " basitempo-
rals
      "  were  classed  with the endoskeletal bones      ; they will in the present
paper be    placed in the parosteal category, in accordance with their primor
dial condition.
    By the careful following out of     these and numerous      other details  I have
corrected and added to my previous knowledge            of the early morphological
conditions of the Bird's cranium, and at the same time, I trust, have con
tributed to an enlarged and more accurate conception of the history and
meaning of the Vertebrate skull in general.

        Communicated by      BalPour Stewart, LL.D.             Received February
        2, 1869.
    Before   I  give a short account of the observations and the results de
duced from them, I beg to express in the first place my best thanks to Dr.
Balfour Stewart, Director of the Kew Observatory, who, having heard of
my desire to take the dip at different places, was so kind as to lend me an
instrument from the Kew Observatory, — also to James Glaisher, Esq.,
                                                                    I
F.R.S., &c., who furnished me with a tripod-stand, which found to be of
great use to me on some stations.
    I may also remark that, having other duties to perform in obedience to
instructions from the Russian Government,           I  could only devote a portion
of my time to the observations of dip.
    The instrument I had from Kew Observatory was one of Barrow's Dip-
Circles, furnished with two 3|-inch needles in the form generally used at
the Observatory.       The Dip-Circle used had been in use for some time at
the Kew Observatory, until, it having been ascertained that one of its needles
was somewhat deteriorated, it was replaced with that now in use.
    Before I left Kew Observatory I was aware that one of the needles was
not as good as might be desired ; but as Mr. Stewart bad no other circle
suitable for my purpose, I considered it desirable to take this circle.
    The observations were made according to the instructions of Lieut.-
General Sabine, given in the ' Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.'
    The following Table I. shows the results of the observations with the
 circle from Kew ; in it the name of station and the date of observation are

         At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,              I  took more observations with
     one needle than the other        ; and the reason for that was, I found that this
     needle,   A,,   gave two distinctly   different    positions     :  for instance, at times

1869.]            Lieut. Elagin's Determinations                 of   the   Dip.            283
dips were found which differed from those obtained at other times about
seven minutes, whilst the other needle, Aa, gave more uniform and satis
factory results ; and this is also the reason I preferred to take the sepa
rate means for each needle, and then means of both needles, and to give
to them equal weights, notwithstanding the number of observations is
greater in one case than the other.   The cause of needle A, giving dif
ferent positions must be most probably in the axis of the needle, not in
the agate plates ; otherwise both needles would indicate the same difference.
                                                                 I
   Having given the results of my observations, think it desirable to state
the precautions I took to obtain the best results. First of all, whilst at
the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, where I was for several months study
ing the several instruments in the magnetic department, through the kind
ness of the Astronomer Royal and Mr. Glaisher, I had made myself well
acquainted with the necessary care in those observations ; besides, I several
times visited the Kew Observatory, through the kindness of Dr. Balfour
Stewart, and took some observations of dip.    At all times my first efforts
were directed to have a firm support ; next, to accurately levelling the
instrument; third, to see that the agate plates were clean, that the axis of
the    needle was also   clean and tested by the use                 of cork, that   the needles
were free from dust and damp, their ends being passed in and out of cork,
and their surfaces wiped with wash-leather ; and in damp weather increased
attention was paid to everything ; but, as a rule, observations were not
made    at such times    ;       care   was also had       determining the magnetic
                                                            in
meridian corresponding,              and in all cases several readings were taken in
every position.
  The results of observations of dip with local instruments at different
places were as follows       :   —
   Kew Observatory, monthly observations of dip with an instrument
No. 33 Circle, of the same pattern I had made by Barrow ; the length of the
needle is about     inches.
                   3-J       To compare No. 33 Circle with the Circle bor
rowed from Kew,    I     made        simultaneous        observations   ;   the mean from six
observations with two needles             gave       for No. 33 Circle=68° 2,-l°, aud for
the Circle Ihad from Kew 68°        this result being l'-6 larger.

   Royal Observatory, Greenwich. — Observations of dip are made frequently
with Mr. Airy's dip instrument, described in the yearly volumes of ob
servations at the Royal Observatory.      Six needles of three different
lengths are observed         on the same instrument              ;   the results derived from
each   separate   needle seldom differ more than five minutes in the year.                   I
took from the Royal Observatory observations the mean of the determined
dip for the period from 1st July to 30th September, which was= 67° 56'-                     1   5,
derived from twenty-seven observations, and nearly corresponds to the
time  of my observations. The dip obtained from my observations with
Kew Circle was =67°58'-88, being 2'-73 larger.

 by the English makers Troughton and Simms ; two needles about 8 inches
 long are observed, and the observations are made in the usual manner,
 in the magnetic meridian.        The dip is observed at the beginning of each
year, in the month of March or April ; thus for the year 1868 there was
 one observation made with two needles the 30th of March, and the dip
 obtained was 67°              The 5th of September Professor Quetelet's son,
 according to my wish, was so kind as to observe the dip, and obtained
 almost the same result (that is, 67° 11''0), whilst from observations with
 the Kew Circle I obtained the dip =67° 6'-77, being 4'-2 smaller.
     Utrecht   Meteorological Department.       —The     observations  were made
 with an instrument not differing much from instruments of this class
 formerly used in England.          It was constructed by Olland, a maker at
 Utrecht ; the dip is observed every fortnight, in the middle and at the end
 of each month, with two needles about 8 inches in length. The results of
 the separate needles are very close to one another, and the dip is generally
 observed about     9  o'clock    in the morning.      Simultaneous observations
 were made by Mr. H. Welers Bethink and myself, each observing his own
 instrument.     The dips obtained are as follows : —
       With the Observatory instrument. . . .         67° 4 7'' 7
       With the Kew Circle                            67° 43'3, being 4'-4 less.
     Vienna Meteorological Department. — The Dip Circle was made by Rep-
 sold, and a description of it is given in the 'Magnetische und meteorologische
 Beobachtungen zu Prag bei Karl Kreil, sechster Jahrgang, vom Januar
 bis 31. December 1845.'        The instrumentis provided with eight needles,
 whose lengths are about 9 inches each ; the axis of the needle is perforated,
 and can be turned round the centre of the needle through a definite angle ;
 each dip is deduced from        eight separate  sets  of observations, by turning
 each time the axis of the needle through an       angle of about 45°. The sepa
 rate results derived in this way differ sometimes about 1° from each other,
 and the means for separate needles differ in some cases about 20' ; so that
 the determinations of dip with this instrument are very uncertain, whilst
the labour to obtain a pretty good result is very great ; at the same time a
 single determination with one of the Barrow's Circles gives a result nearer
to the truth.     I must say here that the present Director of the Meteoro
logical Institution in Vienna, Professor Yelynak, was so pleased with the
instrument    I had from Kew, that he asked me to order one for him of
 Mr. Barrow.
    The   mean  result derived from the observations from January 1 to Sep
 tember 18, 1868, is =63° 32'06 ; the result obtained with the Kew Circle
is 63° 38'-80,   being larger by 6'-   7.
    Munich. — Regular observations of absolute dip        are not made at the Ob
 servatory.    The last determined dip was in 1866, in September, and was
  64° 16'-8.   The dip for the present time is deduced from the variation of
 horizontal force and the constant relation between it and the dip as found
  by Dr. Lamont from a large series of observations ; according to this the

dip for September 1868 is 64° 10'-9. The observed dip with the Kew
Circle is 64° 7'- 7, being smaller by 3'-2.
   Paris. — The observations of dip at the Observatory are made with an in
strument of Gambey regularly three times every day — that      at   o'clock                                 is,       9

ment gives   only the variations of dip.   To determine the absolute dip,                                                     a

    These observations were conducted by the authors in order to learn
with minuteness the fluctuations of the temperature in health.    They
were performed on persons of different ages, and were in many instances
continued through the night and day.
  The temperature was noted every hour, and on many occasions much
more frequently.

    . The daily variation of the temperature.
   2. The effects of food on the temperature.
   3. The effects of cold baths on the temperature.
   4. The effects of hot baths on the temperature.
   From their observations and experiments the authors have drawn the
following conclusions —             :
   The average maximum temperature of the day in persons under 25
years of age    9'J°-1 Fahr.
                    is          of those over 40, 98° Fahr.

from that of young persons ; for in the former the diurnal fall occurs at
any hour, and not, as is the case with young persons, during the hours of
night.
  Concerning the influence of food on the temperature of the body the
authors have concluded that none of the diurnal variations is in any way
caused by the food we eat.
     The experiments               conclusion are very numerous.
                                 to prove this                         Some
were made with the breakfast, others with the dinner and tea ; but all point
to the conclusion just stated.
     This important question                  is very   fully discussed in the section devoted
to it.
   By cold baths both the surface of the body and the deep parts were
lowered in temperature.   The temperature of the surface was in some
instances reduced to 88°Fahr. ; but the heat so soon returned to all parts
as to show that the cold bath is                   of very little            use as a refrigerator    of the
body.
   The cold bath produced no alteration in the time or amount of the
diurnal variation. This began at the same hour, and reached the same
amount as on those days when no bath was taken.
  By hot-water or vapour baths the heat of the body could be raised very
considerably. Thus, t>n some occasions, when using the general hot bath,
the temperature under the tongue was noted to be between                                      103° and 104°
Fahr., a fever temperature.
  The body being heated considerably                              point at which combus
                                                                above     the
tion could maintain              it,   it   was then shown with what rapidity heat may be
lost, simply       by
                radiation and evaporation.                           The particulars of these results
are given in the paper.
  The experiments tend to prove that hot baths in                               no way affect the     diurnal
variation of the temperature.

          Received      February 11, 1869.
      For some time past
     1.                                     we have been engaged                in   a   careful examination
of the spectra of several                   gases and vapours under varying                    conditions    of
pressure and temperature, with     view to throw light upon the discoveries
                                                 a
recently made bearing upon the physical constitution of the sun.
   Although the investigations are by no means yet completed, we consider
it desirable to lay at once before the Royal Society several                                  broad conclu
sions at which we have already arrived.
     It   will   be recollected that one              of   us   in   a   recent communication to the
Royal Society pointed out the following facts —                          :
  i. That there      continuous envelope round the sun, and that
                        is   a                                                                         in   the

spectrum of this envelope (which has been named for accuracy of descrip
tion the "chromosphere ") the hydrogen line in the green corresponding
with Fraunhofer's line F takes the form of an arrowhead, and widens from
the upper to the lower surface of the chromosphere.
   ii. That ordinarily in a prominence the F line is nearly of the same
thickness as the C line.
     iii. That sometimes in                                 F
                                             line is exceedingly brilliant,
                                      a prominence the
and widens out so as to present a bulbous appearance above the chromo
sphere.
  iv. That the   F line in the chromosphere, and also the C line, extend
on to the spectrum of the subjacent regions and re- reverse the Fraunhofer
lines.
  v. That there is a line near D visible in the spectrum of the chromo
sphere to which there is no corresponding Fraunhofer line.
   vi. That there are many bright                lines visible in the ordinary solar spec
trum near the sun's edge.
     vii. That        a new line sometimes makes its appearance in the chromo
sphere.
     2.    It   became obviously, then,        of primary importance —
   i. To study the hydrogen spectrum very carefully under varying con
ditions, with the view of detecting whether or not there existed a line in the
orange,         and
     ii.   To determine the        cause to which the thickening        of the   F   line   is   due.
   We have altogether failed to detect any line    the hydrogen spectrum
                                                                in
in the place indicated,  e. near the line
                                i.           but we have not yet completed
                                                     D ;
all the experiments we had proposed to ourselves.
   With regard to the thickening of the   line, we may remark that, in the
                                                     F
paper by MM. Pliicker and Hittorf, to which reference was made in the
communication before alluded to, the phenomena of the expansion of the
spectral lines of hydrogen are fully stated, but the cause of the phenomena
is   left undetermined.
     We have convinced          ourselves     that this widening out     is   due to pressure,
and not appreciably,          if   at all, to temperature   per   se.
  3. Having determined, then, that the phenomena presented   the    line         by         F
were phenomena depending upon and indicating varying pressures, we were
in   a    position                          pressure operating in
                       to determine the atmospheric                promi               a
nence, in which the red and green lines are nearly of equal width, and in
the chromosphere, through which the green line gradually expands as the
sun   is    approached*.
   With regard to the higher prominences, we have ample evidence that the
gaseous medium of which they are composed exists in                condition of ex
                                                                         a
cessive tenuity, and that at the lower surface of the chromosphere itself the
pressure    very far below the pressure of the earth's atmosphere.
                is
           Will not this enable us ultimately to determine the temperature?

    The bulbous appearance of the F line before referred to may be taken
 to indicate violent convective currents or local generations of heat, the
 condition of the chromosphere being doubtless one of the most intense
 action.
    4. We will now return for one moment to the hydrogen spectrum.       We
 have already stated that certain proposed experiments have not been carried
 out.        We   have postponed them in consequence of a further consideration
 of       the fact that the bright line near D has apparently no representative
 among the Fraunhofer lines.      This fact implies that, assuming the line to
 be a hydrogen line, the selective absorption of the chromosphere is insuffi
 cient to reverse the spectrum.
    It is to be remembered that the stratum of incandescent gas which is
 pierced by the line of sight along the sun's limb, the radiation from which
stratum gives us the spectrum of the chromosphere, is very great compared
with the radial thickness of the chromosphere itself; it would amount to
something under 200,000 miles close to the limb.
      Although there                             of the non-reversal of the
                         is another possible explanation
D line, we reserve our remarks on the subject (with which the visibility of
the prominences on the sun's disk is connected) until further experiments
and observations have been made.
      5.   We   believe that the determination   of the above-mentioned facts leads
us necessarily to several important modifications of the received theory of
the physical constitution of our central luminary — the theory we owe to
Kirchhoff, who based it upon his examination of the solar spectrum. Accor
ding to this hypothesis, the photosphere itself is either solid or liquid, and
it is surrounded by an atmosphere composed of gases and the vapours of
the substances incandescent in the photosphere.
     We find, however, instead of this compound atmosphere,            one which gives
us nearly, or at ail events mainly the spectrum of hydrogen ; (it is not, how
ever, composed necessarily of hydrogen alone ; and this point is engaging our
special attention ;) and the tenuity of this incandescent atmosphere is such
that it is extremely improbable that any considerable atmosphere, such as
the corona has been imagined to indicate,lies outside  — view .cmgthened
                                                            it,   a      si
by  the fact that the chromosphere bright lines present no appearance of
absorption, and that its physical conditions are not statical.
   With regard to the photosphere itself, so far from being either solid       a
surface or    liquid ocean, that
                a                    cloudy or gaseous or both follows both
                                    it   is
from our observations and experiments.             The   separate   prior observations
of both of us have shown —     :
      That
     i.       gaseous condition of the photosphere
                a                                      quite consistent with
                                                            is
its continuous spectrum.    The possibility of this condition has also been
suggested         by
               Messrs. De La Kue, Stewart, and Loewy.
     ii.   That the spectrum of the photosphere contains bright lines when the

     iv. That occasionally photospheric matter appears to                            be injected into the
chromosphere.
   May not these facts indicate that the absorption to which the reversal
of the spectrum and the Fraunhofer lines are due takes place in the
photosphere itself or extremely near to                       it,

                                               is   strengthened    the con                   by
sideration that otherwise the newly discovered bright lines in the solar
spectrum itself should be themselves reversed on Kirchhoff's theory? this,
however,     not the case.
              is            We do not forget that the selective radiation of
the chromosphere does not necessarily indicate the whole of its possible
selective absorption    but our experiments lead us to believe that, were any
                               ;
considerable quantity of metallic vapours present, their bright spectra would
not be entirely invisible in all strata of the chromosphere.

     For many years Mr. Butler                  has had the opportunity             of examining very
many rubies, sapphires, and diamonds, and has                                 taken advantage of   in it
forming  most interesting collection, cut and mounted as microscopical
           a
objects. He had very carefully studied the included fluid- cavities, and
ascertained many curious facts.    Mr. Sorby had for some time paid much
attention to the microscopical structure of crystals, and published paper*                      a
in which he showed that their microscopical characters often serve to
throw much light on the origin of rocks. Mr. Butler therefore placed the
whole of his collection            in    Mr. Sorby's hands for careful examination,                  and   it
was decided that    paper should be written by the two conjointly

gate the law    of the expansion of the very interesting fluid met with in the
cavities of sapphire.
    In describing the various facts, it will be well to consider them in rela
tion to the following general principles : —
    (1) The structure of the various minerals as mere microscopical objects.
    (2) The physical characters of the fluid-cavities, as throwing light on the
 origin of the minerals.
    (3) The influence of some included crystals on the structure of the sur
rounding mineral.
                                         Sapphires.
    By far the most interesting objects contained in sapphires are the fluid-
cavities.    Their occasional presence has been already noticed by Brewster*,
who met with one no less than about            ^ inch long, two-thirds full of a liquid
which expanded so as to fill the whole cavity when heated to 82° F. (28° C).
 He thought the liquid was less mobile than that described by him in topaz,
and could not see a second liquid in the cavity.              Though many thousand
sapphires have been examined by the authors, no such large cavity has
been found ; but several have been met with about tV inch in diameter ; the
greater number are far less, and some are very minute ; and they seem to
contain only the liquid which expands so much when warmed.                       The size
of the included bubble varies much, according to the temperature.                  At the
ordinary heat of a room it is sometimes equal to one-half of the capacity
of the cavity, whereas in other cases the cavity is quite full. This is espe
cially the case with the very small cavities, and is to some extent due to
the forced dilatation of the liquid.          But if we only take into consideration
the larger cavities, the temperature required to expand the fluid so as to
fill them certainly varies from 20° to 32° C. (68° to 90° F.), and this not
only in different crystals, but also, to a less extent, in the same specimen. As
illustrations of the form of such cavities, we refer to Plate VII. figs. 1, 2, 3,
and 4, the extent to which they are magnified being shown in each case.                At
the ordinary temperature the bubble           in  the cavity shown by fig.     1 is about
one-half its diameter, but disappears entirely at 30° C.             By carefully mea
suring the size of the cavity in various positions, and comparing it with the
diameter of the bubble at 0° C., it appears that the liquid expands from
 100 to 152 when heated from 0° to 30°           C. Fig. 2 is a tubular cavity, and
shows in a very excellent manner the boiling of the liquid when it cools
after having been made to expand to fill the whole space.               At the ordinary
temperature the liquid occupies only about half the cavity ; but when heated
in a water-bath to 32° C, it fills it entirely.             No bubble is formed until
the temperature has fallen to 31° ; and then innumerable small bubbles are
suddenly formed, which rise to the upper part and unite ; but instead of
the liquid merely contracting by further cooling, it still continues to boil
for some time, as represented in the drawing.                Two other large cavities

contained in the same specimen also behave in the same manner, and
become full and suddenly boil at almost absolutely the same temperature,
as that figured.     We need scarcely say that such cavities are extremely
rare, and are very remarkable even when merely looked upon as microsco
pical objects, independently of their interest in connexion with physics.
 Fig.  3 is a tubular cavity   of  more irregular  form, and is interesting on ac
count of there being two plates of the sapphire projecting into the cavity
so as to nearly divide it into three portions. At the ordinary temperature these
partitions prevent the passage of the bubble from one part to the other ;
but by breathing on the object through a flexible tube, the slight increase of
temperature expands the liquid so as to make the bubble small enough to
pass into the next compartment ; and a repetition of the process causes it
to pass into that at the other end. Such plates projecting into the cavities
are very common      ; and it is requisite to pay attention to this fact, since
otherwise they might easily be mistaken for crystals of some other substance
included in the cavity, which, if they ever occur, must be extremely rare,
since no decided case has come under our notice.
    In examining sections of sapphire cut in      a plane more or less parallel to
the principal axis of the crystal, the double refraction is so strong that two
images of every object lying at any depth below the surface are seen, in such
a manner as to make them very confused.             This may  be avoided by using
polarized light without an analyzer, and arranging the plane of polarization
so as to coincide with one of the axes of the crystal.         High powers may
 then be used with perfect definition ; and they show many small cavities,
 sometimes    of most irregular forms, like fig.    4 ; and very often their sides
 are so inclined that they totally reflect transmitted light, and appear black
 and opake.     In some specimens most of the cavities have lost their fluid.
    Besides fluid-cavities, there are many small crystals of other minerals
included in sapphires, but not so many as in rubies.           The most striking
 are small plate-like crystals, often of triangular form, with one angle very
 acute. They are very thin, and give the colours of thin plates ; so that
 when viewed by reflected light they look something like the scales from a
 butterfly.    Seen  edgewise,    they appear as mere black lines, and are ar
 ranged parallel to the three principal planes of the sapphire, as shown by
 fig. 5.    These small crystals and the minute fluid-cavities cause many
 sapphires to appear milky by reflected, and somewhat brown by trans
 mitted light ; and being arranged in zones related to the form of the crys
 tal, they often show, as it were, lines of growth.
                                        Rubies.
    Though the ruby and        the   sapphire are of course essentially the same
 mineral, yet their structure is in many respects as characteristically different
 as their colour.     The number of the fluid-cavities in rubies is far less, and
 the larger cavities are very rare, and only contain what appears to be water
 or a saline aqueous solution, as is shown by the amount of expansion when

  294            Messrs. Sorby and Butler           on the  Structure of    [Feb. 18,
  the specimen is heated to the temperature of boiling water. Those con
 taining a similar fluid to that included in sapphires do occasionally occur ;
  and when they are minute, they are extremely interesting, since they show
  the spontaneous movement of the bubbles to greater perfection than any
 mineral that has come under our notice.               This is perhaps to some extent
 due to the nature       of  the  liquid,   which    is  more mobile than the saline
 aqueous    solutions   contained in the cavities of the quartz of granite and
 syenite.    It is manifestly a molecular movement analogous to that seen in
 all matter when very minute particles are suspended in a liquid, so as to
 allow freedom of motion ; and the rapidity of the movement is certainly
 dependent on the size of the particles.            It is not seen to advantage if the
 diameter of the bubbles is more than t u \ 0 u of an inch ; but when it is about
 zirhro they move to and fro in the most surprising manner, with such rapi
 dity that the eye can scarcely follow them.
     The number of small crystals of other minerals included in rubies is often
very great. There must be at least four different kinds ; but it would be
 difficult to determine what minerals they all are.            Some are very well cha
 racterized octahedrons, variously modified ; and, as shown by fig. 5, their
 planes are very generally arranged parallel to planes of the ruby, and to
 the small plate-like crystals already mentioned in describing sapphire.
These octahedrons have no influence on polarized light, and in general form
 and character correspond so closely with spinel that it seems very probable
that they are that mineral.         For some time we thought they were angular
fluid-cavities filled with liquid ; but when cut across in the sections they
are clearly seen to be solid, though less hard than ruby.                Many of the
other included crystals are of such very rounded forms that, if it were not
 for their action on polarized light, they might easily be mistaken for cavi
ties filled with some fluid. Most of these rounded crystals are colourless ; but
 some are   of more or less dark orange-red colour, and are certainly not the
 same   mineral   as the colourless or the octahedral crystals ; and in all proba
 bility the thin and flat are a fourth kind. Occasionally alternating plates
of ruby with their axes in different positions gave rise to a beautiful series of
coloured stripes when examined with polarized light.
                                          Spinel.
    The ruby spinels from Ceylon sometimes contain fluid-cavities which
differ in a striking manner from those of any other mineral that has come
under our notice. One of these is shown in fig. 7. They are to a great extent
filled with a yellow substance, indicated by the shading, which seems to be
either a solid or a very viscous liquid.          It incloses transparent, sometimes
well-defined cubic crystals, which have no action on polarized light; trans
parent, prismatic, or plate-like crystals, which strongly depolarize it ; and
black opake crystals, either in larger pieces or mere grains.             The rest of
the cavity is in each case about one-third full of a colourless liquid, which
seems to contract on the application of heat, because it passes entirely into

vapour, as occurred in some of the cavities in topaz described by Brewster.
In this change it must expand about six hundred times less than wh en
water passes into steam.         Spinel also incloses crystals of several other
minerals which we have not yet been able to identify.
                                     Aquamarina.
    The most striking peculiarity of this mineral is the occurrence of num
bers of fluid-cavities containing two fluids and a vacuity, as shown bv
fig. 6.
                                       Emerald.
    Some   of the    specimens   which    we have   examined are so full of fluid-
cavities that they are only partially transparent.              They differ entirely
from those already described, and contain only one liquid, which does not
sensibly expand when warmed.            In all probability this is a strong saline
aqueous solution, since the cavities also inclose cubic crystals, as shown
by fig. 8, which dissolve on the application of heat, and recrystallize on
cooling.     On the whole, therefore, these cavities are very similar to those
found in the quartz of some granites, and in some of the minerals found in
blocks ejected from Vesuvius, as described in Mr. Sorby's paper on the
microscopical structure of crystals, already referred to.
                                      Diamond.
    Few, if any, of the specimens of diamond that have come under our notice
 contain objects similar to those which, in the opinion of Goppert*, are evidence
 of its having been derived from vegetable remains, but we have been able to
 study to great advantage some facts which do not appear to have presented
 themselves to either Goppert or Brewster.          We have examined twenty-one
 objects similar to the two described by Brewster, in his paper in the Trans
 actions of the Geological Society t; and this has enabled us to clear up some
 of the difficulties to which he alludes, and has led us to propose a different
 explanation.      He thought that the black specks, which were surrounded
 by a black cross when examined with polarized light, were minute cavities ;
 but at the same time he admitted that they were so small that it was not
 possible to say whether they contained a fluid or were empty. Judging from
 what we have seen of such small examples, we consider it impossible to say
 whether they are cavities or inclosed crystals ; but fortunately we have
 met with several of such a size and character that it was quite easy to see
 that they were crystals.       Fig. 9 is a most excellent example of this fact.
 The form    is clearly that of a crystal, and it depolarizes light very powerfully.
 Its refractive power    must  be very much less than that of diamond ; for the
 inclined planes totally reflect the transmitted light, and thus look quite
 black, as shown in the figure.       It is this circumstance which causes many
 smaller inclosed crystals to appear like mere black specks.

296               Messrs. Sorby and Butler             on the   Structure of     [Feb. 18,
  Brewster has shown that the irregular depolarizing action of diamond is
analogous to that of an irregularly hardened gum ; and this much inter
feres with the perfection     of   the black crosses seen round the inclosed crys
tals, and sometimes                                  Still, as a general rule,
                         even neutralizes this action.
a   black cross    is seen
                      ;          described
                             and, as        by Brewster,   when examined by
means of a plate of selenite which gives the blue of the first order, the tints
of the sectors in the line of its principal axis are depressed in the same
manner     as   when such a black cross           is    produced by the compression of
glass — thus proving that the inclosed crystals              have exerted a pressure on
the surrounding diamond.     We, however, do not imagine that the crystals
have increased in size, but that probably they have prevented the uniform
contraction of the diamond, which,       already mentioned, must have been
                                            as
very irregular, even where no such impediment was present.       A few of the
crystals inclosed in rubies give rise to similar black crosses, as shown by
fig. 1 1 ; and we are informed      by Professor Zirkel that his brother-in-
law Professor Vogelsang has prepared a thin section of a specimen of
partially devitrified glass, which also shows black crosses round the inclosed
crystals.
   Brewster   suggested that this phenomenon in diamond was due to the
elastic force of an inclosed gas or liquid, and compared it with what is
seen in the case of some cavities in amber.    We, however, find that the
optical character of the crosses seen round the undoubted cavities in
amber is the very reverse of that in the case of diamond, and cannot be
explained by the mere mechanical action of an included elastic substance,
but is similar to the change to a crystalline state which has occurred over
the whole external surface, and on both sides of cracks passing from it
inwards.
  The optical properties, however, are not the only evidence of contraction
round crystals inclosed in diamond ; for actual cracks are often seen to pro
ceed from them.     These present the striped appearance shown in fig. 10,
owing to more or less perfect total reflection from their waved surface.
The same kind of phenomenon may be seen in sapphire, and still better in
spinel, as shown by figs. 12 and 13. Sometimes there is a system of radia
ting cracks nearly in one plane, terminating in a transverse crack which
surrounds the whole, as in fig. 12 ; and in other cases there are various
complicated wavy cracks in different planes, as in fig. 13.  There seems
to be some connexion between this structure and the nature of the in
cluded minerals    for round some kinds it is very common, but round others
                     ;
very rare or quite absent ; and it appears probable that it may be referred
to unequal contraction in cooling from a high temperature ; and, if so, the
results would  necessarily depend on             of circumstances.

been observed by Mr. David Forbes*, and may, we think, be explained in
a similar manner.
    The crystals formed in blowpipe beads kept hot for some time over the
lamp, also furnish good illustrations of these facts. Phosphate of zirconia
is deposited in cubes from a borax bead to which much microcosmic salt
has been added     ;  and when examined with the microscope whilst cooling,
cracks like those described in diamond and spinel are seen to be formed
round many of the crystals, which are evidently due to the crystals con
tracting less than the surrounding material.              On the contrary, the long
prisms of borate of baryta deposited from solution in borax are seen to
separate from the borax on cooling, and to be filled with transverse cracks,
like those in schorl inclosed in quartz, which is clearly owing to their con
tracting more than the borax.
                              Fluid-cavities in general.
    Before   discussing the nature of fluid-cavities in connexion with the
origin of the various minerals, we think it best to describe the remark
able properties of the liquid included in the sapphire, and to point out
what it seems to be.           Brewster, in his paper on the fluid-cavities in
topazt, says    that  the   more   expansible liquid contained in them expands
 one-fourth its size, when heated from 50° to 80° F, or thirty-one and a
 quarter times as much as water ; and, as already stated, he found that the
fluid in sapphire expands about one-half when heated to 82° F. Though
this amount of expansion is very remarkable, yet, when the relative
expansion at various temperatures is examined, it will be seen to be still
more remarkable.         Very fortunately the tubular cavity in sapphire, shown
by fig. 2, is most admirably fitted for experiment.            Mere inspection shows
that its general diameter is very       uniform   ; and   that   it is really so can be
proved by causing the liquid to pass from one end to the other ; for at
 1 7i° C. the length of the column of liquid was                 of an inch, whether
it  was at the end A or B.        The total effective length of the cavity is
    The specimen inclosing this cavity was fastened to a piece of glass, and
 this was fixed in a beaker containing water, supported so that the cavity
was in the focus of the microscope under a low power.                 The temperature
 was raised very slowly, and was maintained for some minutes at each parti
 cular degree at which it was thought desirable to measure the volume of
 the liquid ; and this was usually repeated over and over again when the
 heat was both rising and falling, so as to obtain as accurate a result as
possible.    In making the measurements with the micrometer, care was
 taken to allow for the tapering ends of the cavity and the curved surface
 of the liquid.      The results are given in degrees Centigrade.               Though
 the expansion below 30° was very great, compared with that of any other
known substances except liquid carbonic acid and nitrous oxide, when the

temperature rose above        30° it was so very extraordinary that it was not
until after having performed      the experiment over and over again that Mr.
 Sorby felt confidence in the results.        This will not be thought surprising
 when we state that from 31° to 32° the apparent expansion of the liquid
is no less than one-fourth of the bulk it occupies at 31°; the length of
 the column      increasing   for that    single degree from             to -f^ inch.
This is about 780 times as great as the expansion of water would be, and
 even 69 times as much as that of air and permanent gases.                  It was not
 possible to ascertain the amount of expansion above 32° C., because the
cavity was quite filled at that temperature.             If the expansion increase at
the same increased rate, the liquid would soon occupy several times as much
space; but it seems very probable that before then it would pass into the
state of gas.     At all events it appears as if this enormous rate of expansion
indicated a close approach to a fresh physical condition.               The following
Table gives the results of the experiments ; and it has been found, by drawing
them as   a curve, that their general relations indicate that there cannot be
any serious error ; but at the same time, considering all the circumstances,
they must only be looked upon as tolerably good approximations to the
truth.

    The apparent expansion of the liquid is doubtless to some extent in
creased by the condensation of the gas, as the space occupied by it is
diminished.      When in the highly expanded condition this liquid appears
to be remarkably elastic.        Berthelot has shown, in his paper on forced
dilatation *, that the force with which liquids adhere to the interior of a glass
tube is sufficient to prevent      their   contraction     to   the normal volume,  if
they have been heated so as to expand and quite fill the tube, and then
cooled to a temperature below that requisite t l fill it.             This fact must
always be borne in mind in studying fluid-cavities, and explains why the
bubbles, as it were, hesitate to return, and then make their appearance with
a sudden start.       Such a forced dilatation is very remarkable in the case
described   ; for though it was requisite to raise the temperature to 32° C. to
fill the cavity, no vacuity was formed until it fell to 31°; and therefore it
seems as   if the  force of cohesion were sufficient to stretch it to considerably

 more than its normal bulk, even perhaps to the extent of one-fifth or one-

 volume would be about four times that of the cavity, — which in any case

liquid carbonic acid, when heated from 0° to 30°, expands from 100 to 145.
One of the experiments described above showed that the liquid in sapphire
expands from 100 to 152; and the other from 100 to 150, which               the                 is

 however, lie between one-half and one-third.         Cagniard-Latour * found
 that when ether and other liquids sealed up in small strong tubes, with a
 certain space left empty, were heated, they expanded very much, and sud
 denly passed into the state of vapour.   The temperature, pressure, and vo
 lume at which this change took place varied very considerably.    Ether ex
 panded to nearly double its volume, and passed into vapour at about 200° C,
with      an elastic force    of 37 or   38 atmospheres.        Alcohol expanded to about
three times its volume, and passed                  into vapour at about 260° C., with an
elastic force of 1 1 9 atmospheres ; whereas water appeared to expand to
nearly four times its volume, and required a temperature near that at which
zinc melts (328° C, Daniel). When in this highly expanded state, the
liquids were very mobile, and seemed much more compressible than under
other circumstances ; for they did not burst the tube, if too much had been
sealed up in    until after their normal volume would have been decidedly
                     it,
greater than its capacity. No one could fail to see that these phenomena
have much in common with what occurs at      lower temperature in the case

of the liquid inclosed in sapphire, and that they are of great importance
in connexion with the origin of fluid-cavities.    Since they become full of
liquid at comparatively low temperature,
                a                               was not unreasonable to sup
                                                              it
pose that the minerals in which they occur must have been formed where
the heat was scarcely above that of the atmosphere   but these facts seem       ;
to show that the occurrence of such fluid-cavities quite reconcilable with is
a very high temperature     for   ; obvious that
                                         it   is    at                if,

     If
      the same principles could be applied in the case of water, we should
be led to infer that      could not exist in

deduced from the fluid-cavities in some volcanic rocks.     In that case, ac
cording to Cagniard-Latour,     the liquid when condensed would occupy
only one-fourth part of the cavity, and    would scarcely be likely to con

consideration should certainly be borne in mind in studying volcanic action                                  ;
and   itpossible that some cavities now containing water may have been

present when the crystals were formed, but penetrated into the fluid-cavities
 at a subsequent period, and either filled vacant spaces, or removed and re
placed the material of glass cavities, as suggested by Vogelsang *.              In the
specimens    which we have examined, each of the cavities contains what is
no doubt an aqueous saline solution, and, as shown by fig. 8, one or more
cubic crystals, probably chloride of potassium, which dissolve on the appli
cation of heat, and are deposited again on cooling.             These cavities are thus
analogous to those met with in the quartz of some granite, and in the mi
nerals of blocks ejected from Vesuvius ; and it seems difficult, if not impos
sible, to explain them except by supposing that a strong saline solution
was caught up by the mineral at the time of its formation.               In some cases
the amount of such saline matter is so great in comparison to the liquid,
that a high temperature would be requisite to make it all dissolve.                   It
also seems probable that, if water could penetrate into such crystals, it would
soon be lost when they were           kept dry.     This certainly occurs in some
soluble salts,    especially those containing combined water, and in some
minerals of loose texture ; but we have never seen evidence of it when
fluid-cavities   are completely inclosed in hard and dense substances like
quartz or emerald. Though in some instances the size of the bubbles does
not bear a uniform relation to that of the cavities, yet in many cases the
general proportion is very similar in each specimen ; and the exceptions can
easily be explained by supposing that occasionally small bubbles of gas
were caught up along      with the water, or that there         was  some variation   in
either temperature or pressure during the growth of the crystal ; all of
which conditions were discussed in Mr. Sorby's paper already referred to.
    We have not had the opportunity of studying many examples of cavities
which    contain two fluids, probably water and liquid carbonic acid, and
therefore forbear to say much about them.               According to Brewstert the
temperature at which those in topaz become full corresponds very closely
with what we have observed in the case of sapphire, so that the carbonic
acid might     have been inclosed either as a highly dilated liquid, or as a
highly compressed gas; but since the other liquid has deposited crystals
which dissolve on the application of heat J, it seems most probable that the
water was caught up in a liquid state, sometimes perhaps holding a con
siderable amount of carbonic acid in solution as a gas.
    On the whole, therefore, the various facts described in this paper seem to
show that ruby, sapphire, spinel, and emerald were formed at a moderately
high temperature, under so great a pressure that water might be present in
a liquid state.    The whole structure of diamond is so peculiar that it can
scarcely be looked upon as positive evidence of a high temperature, though
not at all opposed to that supposition.          The absence of fluid-cavities con
taining water or a saline solution does not by any means prove that water

depends     so much on their nature.           At the    same time     the   occurrence     of
fluid-cavities      containing what seems to be merely liquid carbonic acid is
scarcely reconcilable with the presence of more than a very little water
in either a liquid or gaseous form.            We may here say that we do not agree
with those authors who maintain that the curved or irregular form of the
fluid-cavities is proof of the minerals having been in a soft state, since               ana
logous facts are seen in the case of crystals deposited from solution.

II. " Note         on a Method of viewing the Solar Prominences without
        an Eclipse."        By William Huggins, F.R.S.               Received February
        16, 1869.
    Last Saturday, February           13, 1 succeeded   in seeing a solar prominence         so
as to distinguish        its form.      A  spectroscope was used     ;  a narrow    slit  was
inserted after the train of prisms before the object-glass of the little tele
scope.      This slit limited the light entering the telescope to that of the
refrangibility of the part of the spectrum immediately about the bright                   line
coincident with C.
    The slit of the spectroscope was then widened sufficiently to admit
the form of the prominence to be seen.                  The spectrum then became so
impure that the prominence could not be distinguished.
    A great part of the light of the refrangibilities removed far from that of
C  was then absorbed by a piece of deep ruby glass.                 The prominence        was
 then distinctly perceived, something of this form.

     Dear Sir, — I        have the pleasure to subjoin a few additions              to my
former list of Southern Nebulae spectroscopically examined.
    The observations extend from the 24th October to the 20th November.
     I will first enumerate those of which no trace of a spectrum of any kind
has been detected, and which, I can with confidence state, have no other
than a continuous spectrum.            I am enabled to do this for the following
reason — that even when the jaws of the slit were entirely removed, so as
to command a perfectly free field of view (in which stellar spectra were
frequently recognized), no light from these objects was visible.                 That no
doubt might remain as to the justice of this conclusion, three faint plane
tary nebulae were looked at in the same way, and were more or less easily
recognized as spots of light in the spectroscopic field.              It is much to be
regretted that I did not long ago make the experiment ; had I done so I
should unquestionably have saved myself many tedious hours lost in vain
searching.         The following may safely be erased from a list of nebulae to be
examined for evidence of a        " linear"  character   :—

nevertheless included, because it is certain they have no visible spectrum.
   t The same remark applies to these ; they were twice examined.
   The brackets denote that the objects are so near each other that one observation
sufficed  for both.

                the slit repeatedly.         On the first occasion    the  spectrum was
                described as       " linear, but faintly  seen   ; not certainly seen in
                presence       of the central star.       When the latter is put out,
                the spectrum becomes broadly continuous, with monochro
                matic light across it."          On the next it was, " To-night          I
                could trace no lines.          There   is ample light, but it is not
                '
                   linear,' though certainly confined principally to the neigh
                bourhood of the position of the ordinary lines.                The spec
                trum in any case occupies nearly the width of the field, and
                is not much less in length."              On a third occasion I noted
                that I could       " barely trace any lines, while there is a broad
                patch of spectral light on either side, which is certainly not
                due to the stellar centre."         The trace of lines is confirmed
                on a fourth occasion.
   I think  I am justified      in saying that we have here a nebula of a class
or description    intermediate between those which show a clear continuous
spectrum only, and those which show bright lines only.                 Not that the ap
parent  character    of  these   two    extremes is necessarily absolute ; it is far
more probable that the non-appearance in either, of the distinguishing
characteristic of the other, is relative only.          Indeed there are not wanting
instances of nebulae whose place in a series would be short of the latter
extreme.    For instance, —

No. 4964. "Extremely            remarkable;     a planetary     nebula;    very bright;

                line    I  find has been noted by Mr. Huggins.
   And the great nebula of Orion appears to be of the same order. I have
 examined this nebula repeatedly of late, because on the first occasion of

 looking     at  No. 1185 I had appended a remark that "the principal nebula
 shows a great deal         of continuous light on this side," an observation which
 seemed      to require confirmation.             The following extracts from my note
 book must speak for themselves              : —

     There is nothing very remarkable in the presence either of an additional
line or of a continuous spectrum ; but as this nebula has been examined
very carefully in England without the detection of eithert, it appeared neces
sary to put both beyond question ; taken, too, in connexion with the very
 different character of its near neighbour, 1185, and with others in which
 the relative intensity of the two kinds of spectra varies in degree, it appears
 to break down, to a considerable extent, the barrier between " gaseous

 308              Separation of Ike Isomeric Amylic Alcohols.                 [Feb. 25,
II. "Note          on the Separation of the Isomeric Amylic Alcohols
        formed by Fermentation."                 By Ernest T. Chapman and
        Miles H. Smith.            Communicated         by Prof.    E. W. Brayley.
        Received January 14, 1869.
    At present we are acquainted with two amylic alcohols formed by fer
 mentation.      They were discovered by Pasteur, who observed that different
 specimens of amylic alcohol caused a ray of polarized light to rotate to dif
 ferent degrees.       He succeeded in devising a separation of these alcohols,
 which consisted in converting them into sulphamylates of barium and re-
 crystallizing these salts.       The one alcohol is without action on polarized
 light,   and  the  other   rotates it. This method of separation is beset with
 great practical difficulties, and has, we believe, only once been repeated,
 viz. by Mr. Pedler.        He gives no detailed account of the separation, but
 gives some of the leading properties of the alcohols.              He found that the
 rotating alcohol caused a ray of polarized light to rotate         1 7° with  a column
 of 500 millims. of liquid.
    The following are some examples of the rotations effected by eleven dif
ferent samples of amylic alcohol in a column of 385 millims.                 For compa
rison with Pedler's number, the observed numbers have been reduced in the
 second column to observations on 500 millims. : —

    If Pedler's number be absolutely correct, it follows that these specimens
of amylic alcohol contained from 15-9 per cent. as a minimum, to 38-2 as
a maximum of the rotating alcohol.              The boiling-points of the whole of
the samples lay between 131°-5 and 133°.
    We   have effected    the separation of these alcohols more simply.          If soda,
potash, chloride of calcium, or, apparently, any salt easily soluble in amylic
alcohol be dissolved in that alcohol at the boiling-point, and the saturated
solution    be distilled,  the non-rotating alcohol will be to a great extent re
tained and the rotating alcohol distils off.           The substance which appears
to lend   itself most conveniently to this operation is caustic soda.
    Amylic alcohol is boiled with excess of caustic soda ; when saturated,

the hot solution is decanted into a flask and distilled from an oil-bath, the
temperature of which may be allowed to rise to 200°.           The alcohol distils
off at first readily, after a while with greater difficulty ; finally the con
tents of the distilling flask solidify,   and it becomes    extremely difficult to
drive over any more amylic alcohol.        On now adding water      to the contents
of the flask and again distilling, amylic alcohol comes over of about half
the rotating power of the alcohol employed.         If the power of rotation be
very small, the reduction is considerably greater ; thus, operating on an
alcohol rotating l°-3 on the 385 millims., by one operation we have re
duced it to 0-3.     By a sufficient number of repetitions of the process, it
is possible to effect a separation of the alcohols, and very easy to obtain
considerable quantities of the non-rotating alcohol quite pure.            No valeri
anic acid is formed ; and the soda-solution remaining in the flask after the
operation is completed is barely coloured.
    The separation of the alcohols may also be effected by dissolving metallic
sodium in amylic alcohol, and distilling, &c., as above described, the re
sulting solution of amylate of soda in amylic alcohol. The process appears
to present no point of advantage over that with caustic soda.
    We shall shortly publish    a detailed account of differences in structure of
these alcohols,   together with a description of some of their principal deri
vatives.
 III.  "Note    on the Heat of the         Stars."   By William           Huggins,
                    F.R.S.     Received   February 18, 1869.
    In the summer of 1866 it occurred to me that the heat received on the
 earth from the stars might possibly be more easily detected than the solar
 heat reflected from the moon.       Mr. Becker (of Messrs. Elliott Brothers)
 prepared for me several thermopiles, and a very sensitive galvanometer.
 Towards the close of that year, and during the early part of 1867,           I made
 numerous observations on the moon, and on three or four fixed stars.                I
 succeeded in obtaining trustworthy indications of stellar heat in the case
 of the stars Sirius, Pollux, and Hegulus, though I was not able to mako
 any quantitative estimate of their calorific power.
    I had the intention of making these observations more complete, and of
 extending them to other stars.        I have refrained hitherto from making
 them known ; I find, however, that        I cannot hope to take up these re
 searches again for some months, and therefore venture to submit the ob
 servations in their present incomplete form.
    An astatic galvanometer was used, over the upper needle of which a
 small concave mirror was fixed, by which the image of the flame of a lamp
 could be thrown upon a scale placed at some distance.           Usually, however,
 I preferred to observe the needle directly by means     of  a lens  so placed that
 the divisions on the card were magnified, and could be read by the ob
 server when at a little distance from the instrument.   The    sensitiveness   of the

 instrument was made as great as possible by a very careful adjustment from
 time to time of the magnetic power of the needles.       The extreme delicacy
 of the instrument was found to be more permanently preserved when the
 needles were placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian during the
 time that the instrument was not in use.       The great sensitiveness of this
 instrument    was  shown   by the needles turning through 90° when two
 pieces of wire of different kinds of copper were held between the finger and
 thumb.     For the stars, the images of which in the telescope are points of
 light, the thermopiles consisted of one or of two pairs of elements ; a large
 pile, containing twenty-four pairs of elements, was also used for the moon.
 A few of the later observations were made with a pile of which the ele
 ments consist of alloys of bismuth and antimony.
    The thermopile was attached to a refractor of eight inches aperture.        I
 considered that though some of the heat-rays would not be transmitted         by
 the glass, yet the more uniform temperature of the air within the telescope,
 and some other circumstances, would make the difficulty of preserving the
 pile from extraneous influences less formidable      than  if a reflector   were
 used.
    The pile  a was placed  within a tube of cardboard, b ; this was enclosed
in a much larger     tube formed  of sheets of brown paper pasted over each
other, c. The space between the two tubes was filled with cotton-wool.
At about 5 inches in front of the surface of the pile, a glass plate (e) was
placed for the purpose of intercepting any heat that might be radiated from
the inside of the telescope. This glass plate was protected by a double tube
of cardboard, the inner one of which (d) was about half an inch in diameter.
The back of the pile was protected in a similar way by a glass plate (jr).
The small inner tube (A) beyond the plate was kept plugged with cotton
wool ; this plug was removed when it was required to warm the back of the
pile, which was done by allowing the heat radiated from a candle-flame to
pass through the tube to the pile.     The apparatus was kept at a distance
of about 2 inches from the brass tube by which it was attached to the
telescope by three pieces of wood (i), for the purpose of cutting off as
much as possible any connexion by conduction with the tube of the tele
scope.
   The wires connecting the pile with the galvanometer, which had          to be

 placed at some distance to preserve it from the influence of the ironwork of
 the telescope,     were covered with gutta percha, over which cotton-wool
 was placed, and the whole wrapped round with strips of brown paper.
 The binding-screws of the galvanometer were enclosed in a small cylinder
 of sheet gutta percha, and filled with cotton-wool.             These precautions
 were necessary, as the approach of the hand to one of the binding-screws,
 or even the impact upon it of the cooler air entering the observatory, was
 sufficient to produce a deviation of the needle greater than was to be
 expected    from the stars.
    The apparatus     was fixed to the telescope so that the surface of the ther
mopile    would   be   at the focal point of the object-glass.       The apparatus
 was allowed to remain attached to the telescope for hours, or sometimes for
 days, the wires being in connexion with the galvanometer, until the heat had
become uniformly distributed within the apparatus containing the pile, and
the needle remained at zero, or was steadily deflected to the extent of a
degree or two from zero.
    When observations      were to be made, the shutter   of the  dome was opened,
and the telescope, by means of the finder, was directed to a part of the sky
near the star to be examined where there were no bright stars.              In this
state of things the needle was watched, and if in four or five minutes no
deviation of the needle      had taken place, then by means of the finder the
telescope was moved the small distance necessary to bring the image of the
star exactly upon the face of the pile, which could be ascertained by the
position of the star as seen in the finder.       The image of the star was kept
upon the small pile by means of the clock-motion attached to the tele
scope.      The needle was then watched during five minutes or longer ; almost
always the needle began to move as soon as the image of the star fell upon
it. The telescope was then moved, so as to direct it again to the sky near
the star.      Generally in one or two minutes the needle began to return
towards its original position.
    In a similar manner twelve to twenty observations of the same star were
made.       These observations were repeated on other nights.
   The    mean   of  a number    of observations of Sirius, which did not differ
greatly from each other, gives a deflection of the needle of 2°.
   The observations of Pollux 1
   No    effect was produced on the needle     by Castor.
    Regulus gave a deflection of 3°.
   In   one observation Arcturus deflected the needle 3° in 15 minutes.
   The observations of the full moon were not accordant.            On one night a
sensible effect was shown by the needle ;      but at another time the indications
of heat    were  excessively small, and not sufficiently uniform to be trust
worthy.
   It should be stated that several        times anomalous indications    were ob
served, which were not traced to the disturbing cause.
   The results are not strictly comparable, as it is not certain that the

sensitiveness of the galvanometer was exactly the same in all the observa
tions, still it was probably not greatly different.
    Observations of the heat of the stars,   if strictly comparable, might be of
value, in connexion with the spectra of their light, to help us to determine
the condition of the matter from which the light was emitted in different
stars.
    I hope at a future time to resume this inquiry with a larger telescope,
and to obtain some approximate value of the quantity of heat received at the
earth from the brighter stars.

        By Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S.            Received January 2, 1869.
    On recently visiting    Mr. Kirkaldy's testing works, t he Grove, South-
wark,   I was much struck      with the appearances presented by      some  speci
mens of iron and steel        round  bars which    had been broken by torsion.
Some of them were broken right across, as nearly as may be in a plane
perpendicular to the axis of the bar.         On examining these I perceived
that they had all yielded through a great degree to distortion before having
broken.      I  therefore looked for bars of hardened steel which        had been
tested   similarly, and found many beautiful specimens in Mr. Kirkaldy's
museum.        These, without exception, showed complicated surfaces of frac
ture, which were such     as to  demonstrate, as part of the whole effect in each
case, a spiral fissure round the circumference of the cylinder at an angle
of about 45° to the length.       This is just what is to be expected when we
consider that if A B D C (fig. 1) represent an infinitesimal square on the
surface of a round bar with its sides A C and B D parallel to the axis of the
cylinder, before torsion, and A B D' C the figure into which this square
becomes    distorted just before rupture, the diagonal A D has become elon
gated to the length      A D', and the diagonal B C has become contracted to
the length B C, and that therefore there must be maximum tension cvery-

degrees   of        brass, copper, lead.

   Sealing-wax and hard steel bars exhibited the spiral fracture. All the
other bars, without exception, broke as Mr. Kirkaldy's soft steel bars,
right   across, in a plane perpendicular                     to the axis of the bar.    These expe
riments were conducted by Mr. Walter Deed and Mr.                                 Adam Logan in the
Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow ; and specimens of the
bars exhibiting the two kinds of fracture are sent to the Royal Society
along with this statement.    I also send photographs exhibiting the spiral
fracture of a hard steel cylinder, and the "shearing" fracture of a lead
cylinder by torsion.
   These experiments demonstrate that continued " shearing

one set of planes, of a viscous solid, developes in it a tendency to break
more easily parallel to these planes than in other directions, or that a viscous

                                 the specimens    Mr. Kirkaldy's museum  in
attracted my attention by their bearing on an old controversy regarding
Forbes's theory of glaciers.  Forbes had maintained that the continued
shearing  motion which his observations had proved in glaciers, must tend
to tear  them by fissures parallel to the surfaces of " shearing." The
correctness of this view for viscous solid mass, such as snow becoming
                                         a
kneaded into           a   glacier, or the substance of   formed glacier as

its way down           a   valley, ora   mass of debris of glacier-ice, reforming as                a
glacier after disintegration by an obstacle, seems strongly confirmed by
the experiments on the softer metals described above. Hopkins had argued
against this view, that, according to the theory of elastic solids, as stated
above, and represented by the first diagram, the fracture ought to be at
an angle of 45° to the surfaces of "shearing."    There can be no doubt of
the truth of Hopkins's principle for an isotropic elastic solid, so brittle
as to break        by
              shearing before    has become distorted through more than

sealing-wax and hardened steel which        have described.  I The various
specimens of fractured elastic solids now exhibited to the Society may be
looked upon with some interest,      only as illustrating the correctness of
                                                  if

     Since this paper was read the author has made several observations of
  the quantity of light transmitted by object-glasses, and determined the
 index of absorption in various specimens of glass.              The results of some of
 these are in accordance with the opinion expressed in the paper ; but
  others present a difference which is very satisfactory as indicating a sur
 prising progress in the manufacture of optical glass.                  The observations
 were made by means of Zollner's photometer.
     The following results were obtained for the intensity of the light trans

     Of  the above, a belongs to the      Armagh Observatory ; it is by one of the
 Dollonds, older than 1790, and is probably one of their first attempts at a
 triple combination,       b is the original object-glass of the Armagh circle ; it
 was made      by Tulley about 1828 ; the crown is greenish, and is supposed
 to be English ; the flint is believed to have been from Daguet. c was made
 for the author by Tulley in 1838 ; its glass is French, the crown is
 greenish, d is by Cauchoix ; the crown is greenish, and has probably a
 high n, but its mean thickness is only 0'39.              e is by Messrs. Cooke ; the
glass is Chance's,      /is    by Grubb, the glass Chance's : the very high trans
mission    of  this lens is   in  part due to the cementing of the adjacent sur
faces,    which, while it makes more difficult the correction of spherical
aberration, removes almost entirely the reflection at a surface of crown and
one of flint: the factor for this =0-9036 ; and if the I be multiplied by
this, we obtain 0-7806, nearly that of e, the difference being due to the
reflection at the film of cement, g is also by Grubb, and cemented ; the
glass is by Chance,        h is by Fraunhofer.
    On examining this Table the progressive increase in the light of the
object-glasses is evident.         The first two, which may be considered good
specimens     of the early acbromatics,      have less   illuminating-power than the
Herschelian reflector.        A   great advance was made by Guinand and those
who followed in his steps ; and a still greater one by Chance, whose glass
is nearly perfect as to colour and transparency.
    The same inference follows from the author's measure of the index of
                                                                         2 a  2

and this form is very convenient.              If a ray is incident on an isosceles

internal    reflection   at the base ;     and the length of the path of the light
within the glass,       and the loss by the two reflections, are easily calculated
from the known angle and refractive index.              The mean index       used in the
calculation was that of the line E.
     The results are given in the following Table, in which are introduced
 those given in the paper that they may be referred to at once ; and there is
 added to them one found in Bouguer's 'Traite d'Optique,' which seems
 trustworthy.

     No.  1  was shown to the author         in 1830 by Captain Kater, as the chef-
  d'ceuvre of the Glass-Committee          ; he used it as the small speculum of his
  Newtonian.        Afterwards it came into the possession of the late Lord
  Rosse, who made the above measures with Bunsen's photometer in 1848.
  It is English plate, greenish.
     Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 were measured by Mr. Grubb in 1857. No. 5 was a
 prism of 90°.        He does not remember its history ; but evidently it was of
  Chance's glass.
      No. 6 is described by Bouguer as " glace," 3 Paris inches thick. It
  ~
  was probably that of St. Gobain, which has probably not varied in compo
  sition, and its fi has been used in the computation.
      No. 7 consists of two prisms of 60°, which Mr. Gassiot, with his wonted
  kindness, intrusted to the author for some inquiries about the improvement
  of the spectroscope. They are by Merz, of glass which seems nearly iden
  tical with Faraday's dense glass, having a specific gravity of 5-1, and a
  mean ft = 1 -7664. It is very pellucid, but, like its prototype, has a yellowish
  tinge, probably given by the large proportion of lead. As Merz does not
  polish the base or ends of his prisms, the usual method could not be
  employed    ;   but the prisms were put together with the angles opposed, and
  a drop of olive-oil between, and the reflections allowed for.               The great

absorption is remarkable,            and apparently    cannot     be    explained   by the
colour of the glass.
   No. 8 is of 60°; its /t for E=l-620.    It is free from colour, and an
evident improvement on the earlier ones.
  No. 9, a prism of 90°, was given to the author by Dr. Lloyd for a small
mirror in the Newtonian form of the Armagh 15-inch reflector ; its ft for
E=l-6188.
   No.     10,   of   90°, was obtained by the late   Lord Rosse      to be similarly used
in his 3-feet Newtonian ; its p for E= 1-5321.
   No. 11, of 60°, obtained at Munich in 1837.                  For   these measures     the
ends were polished flat ; its p for        E=   1-6405.
  These three show considerable progress, and an object-glass made of
such materials would have a great power of transmission, though much
behind the following.
  No. 12 is of 90°.    Its glass is from Chance ; its p for E=l-6216.
  No. 13 is a cylinder 2-2 inches in diameter, and 4-3 long, which Mr. Grubb
obtained from Messrs. Chance for these measures ; its n for E = 1-5200.
  No. 14 is a cylinder got at the same time, 2-l inches in diameter and
4 -4  long ; its fi for E b 1 '61 26 ; the ends of both are polished flat, and they
are of wonderful transparency.
   If, as there is good ground for hoping, Messrs. Chance shall succeed in
manufacturing large disks of the same perfection as these two cylinders,
the author's comparison of the achromatic and the reflector must be
considerably modified.
   Assuming n=-02, he calculates that the aperture of an achromatic, of
focal length equal to 18 times the aperture, equivalent to a 4 -feet Newto
nian, is 35-435 inches.  This aperture would be diminished if the process
of cementing were found applicable to lenses of such magnitude.
   The author concludes with suggesting that, as very slight variations in the
manufacture of glass seem to make great changes in its absorptive power,
it would be prudent to examine the value of n in the disks intended for
lenses    of any importance.         This could   be done by polishing        a couple    of
facets on their edges, and need         not involve the sacrifice of many minutes.
II. " Note        on the Formation and Phenomena of        Clouds." By John
           Tyndall, LL.D., F.R.S.             Received January 25, 1869.
   It    is well known that when a receiver filledwith ordinary undried air is
exhausted, a cloudiness, due to the precipitation of the aqueous vapour
diffused in the air, is produced by the first few strokes of the pump. It                 is,
as might be expected, possible to produce clouds in this way with the
vapours of other liquids than water.
   In the course of the experiments on the chemical action of light which
have been already communicated in abstract to the Royal Society,         had        I
frequent occasion to observe the precipitation of such clouds in the experi
mental tubes employed          ;   indeed several days at   a   time have been devoted

318               On the Formation and Phenomena                   of   Clouds.         [Mar. 4,
solely to the generation and examination of clouds formed by the sudden
dilatation of the air in the experimental tubes.
   The clouds were generated in two ways : one mode consisted in opening
the passage between the filled experimental tube and the air-pump, and
then simply dilating the air by working the pump.        In the other, the
experimental tube  was connected with a vessel of suitable size, the passage
between which and the experimental tube could be closed by a stopcock.
This vessel was first exhausted ; on turning the cock the air rushed from
the experimental tube into the vessel, the precipitation of a cloud within
the tube being a consequence of the transfer.   Instead of a special vessel,
the cylinders      of the air-pump             itself were usually        employed       for    this
purpose.
     It                               off the residue of air and vapour after
          was found possible, by shutting
each act of precipitation, and again exhausting the cylinders of the pump,
to obtain with some substances, and without refilling the experimental
tube, fifteen or twenty clouds in succession.
  The clouds thus precipitated differed from                       each    other in luminous
energy, some shedding forth a mild white light, others flashing out with
sudden and surprising brilliancy. This difference of action  of course, to        is,
be referred to the different reflective energies              of the particles of the clouds,
which                                of very different refractive indices.
           were produced by substances

     Different                                                                                    ;
some melt away rapidly, while others linger for minutes in the experi
mental tube, resting upon its bottom as they dissolve like      heap of snow.a
The particles of other clouds are trailed through the experimental tube as
ifthey were moving through    viscous medium.

  Nothing can exceed the splendour of the diffraction-phenomena exhibited

source of illumination.    The differential motions introduced by friction
against the interior surface of the tube often cause the colours to arrange
themselves in distinct layers.
   The difference in texture exhibited by different clouds caused me to look
a little more closely than     had previously done into the mechanism of
                                   I

the bounding surfaces of which move in opposite directions when precipita
tion actually sets in. Every cloud-particle has consumed polyhedron of       a
vapour in its formation   and  ;    manifest that the size of the particle
                                       it   is
must depend, not only on the size of the vapour polyhedron, but also on
the relation of the density of the vapour to that of its liquid.    the                    If
vapour  were light, and the liquid heavy, other things being equal, the
cloud-particle would be smaller than      the vapour were heavy and the
                                                   if

 experiments ; the case of toluol may be taken as representative of a great
 number of others.    The specific gravity of this liquid is 0-85, that of
 water being unity ; the specific gravity of its vapour is 3-26, that of
 aqueous vapour being 0-6.      Now, as the size of the cloud-particle is
 directly proportional to the specific gravity of the vapour, and inversely
 proportional to the specific gravity of the liquid, an easy calculation proves
 that, assuming the size of the vapour polyhedra in both cases to be the
 same, the size of the particle of toluol cloud must be more than six times
 that of the particle of aqueous cloud. It is probably impossible to test this
 question with numerical accuracy ; but the comparative coarseness of the
 toluol cloud is strikingly manifest to the naked eye.                 The   case     is,   as
                                                                                            I        have
 said, representative.
   In  fact, aqueous vapour     without parallel in these particulars
                                     is              a                                           ;   it   is
 not only the lightest of all vapours, in the common acceptation of that
 term, but the lightest of all gases except hydrogen and ammonia.     To this
 circumstance the soft and tender beauty of the clouds of our atmosphere                                  is
 mainly to be ascribed.
    The sphericity of the cloud-particles may be immediately inferred from
 their deportment under the luminous beams.     The light which they shed
when spherical     continuous: but clouds may also be precipitated in solid
                       is
flakes and then the incessant sparkling of the cloud shows that its particles
        ;
are plates, and not spheres.   Some portions of the same cloud may be com
posed of spherical particles, others of flakes, the difference being at once
manifested through the calmness of the one portion of the cloud, and the
uneasiness of the other. The sparkling of such flakes reminded me of the
plates of mica in the River Rhone at its entrance into the lake of Geneva,
when shone upon                by
                        strong sun.

gauge indicated a pressure        of half   an inch  the mercury stood at 31°-25 ;
on readmitting     the air it rose again to 32°.      The experiment was repeated,
with precisely similar results ; and a correction was ultimately adopted,
corresponding to the varying pressures in the receiver, in order to reduce the
pendulum-experiments         to the true temperature at which they were made.
   2. It was generally admitted that this apparent fall of the mercury arose
from a change in the capacity of the interior of the thermometer ; and the
physicists, especially the pendulum-experimenters who followed in General
Sabine's steps, never neglected this correction when their object was to
discuss the results of experiments made in a vacuum, and in the reduction
of which the temperature        entered   as an element.
   In the pendulum-experiments which            were made at the      Kew Observatory
in connexion with the Great Trigonometrical              Survey of India (vide Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society, No. 78, 1865), the thermometers used were,
before the discussion of the observations, subjected to independent experi
ments, to determine their "vacuum-correction," which was found nearly
the same for each of the two thermometers employed, viz. 0°-43.                 In these
experiments    the   two  thermometers      were  suspended, together     with   another
(the  latter enclosed   in  a sealed  glass  tube, and hence    surrounded    by  air), in
the receiver, and their readings taken some time after the exhaustion,
sufficient to equalize its effect upon all three thermometers, bearing in
mind the fact that the thermometer in the glass case would take a some
what longer time for showing changes of temperature than those without
such an enclosure.        The arrangement of the experiments was precisely
the same as that originally adopted by General Sabine ; and the precaution
taken as regards the time of reading the different thermometers left no
doubt on my mind that the observed difference of 0o-43, by which amount
the thermometers exposed to the effect of exhaustion were in every experi
ment found      to   read less than      that enclosed in a glass tube, gave the
required vacuum-correction in this particular case.             It is also clear that in
this method of carrying on the experiment the refrigeration due to the
work done     by the expanding air during the process of exhaustion will
affect all thermometers alike, and that consequently the residual
                                                                              difference
must be due to other causes.
   3.  One point, however, was overlooked in these experiments, viz. to
wait a number of hours and then to take another series of readings, iu
order to determine whether the effect of the removal of the atmosphere
upon the capacity of a thermometer was only transient or permanent.
Professor Oscar Meyer, in Breslau, was the first to call attention* to this
question.    While making         some    experiments on the internal friction of
gases, he found that the primary effect of the exhaustion upon a ther
mometer was quite in accordance with the observations of General Sabine,
but that after some time (for the thermometer employed by him, after
about half an hour) this effect entirely disappeared.             Captain Basevi, who
                    * Vide roggendorff 's ' Annalen,' vol.

has charge of the pendulum-experiments                 in India, communicated to me
that the results of some experiments made by him strengthened Professor
Meyer's conclusion, and caused him grave doubts as to the necessity of
applying the vacuum-correction           in pendulum-experiments, one swing often
lasting   in such  experiments    from     five to eight hours.
    4. It appeared to me that there were various sources of error in the
experiments previously made.              The only experiments which seem con
clusive are those made by General Sabine with thermometers placed in ice ;
but we are not informed in the account of these experiments how long
each of them lasted, probably because there was no reason to regard the
element of time as of importance.
    In the experiments        made   by comparing the thermometers with one
enclosed in a glass tube and surrounded by air, it is obvious that the ther
mometers under comparison are throughout under different circumstances
as regards     their sensitiveness, and that this difficulty cannot be entirely
overcome by allowing some time for the equalization of the original effect
of the exhaustion.        Again, it is questionable whether the glass tube which
surrounds the thermometer which must be considered the standard of
comparison has not, during the process of being closed up before the blow
pipe, been so heated that the remaining air, instead of representing the
pressure of a whole atmosphere, is really of a much less density.             Further,
there is the question of time, raised by Professor Meyer and Captain Basevi.
    In Professor Meyer's experiments one thermometer was placed within
 the receiver, and another suspended outside, on the exterior of the receiver
itself.    He found that exhaustion lowered the reading of the former by
from one-half to one degree of the centesimal scale, but that after about
half    an hour    both    thermometers        agreed again : the readmission of air
 caused the thermometer in the receiver to rise by the same quantity by
 which it had previously fallen ; but after the lapse of some time the two
 thermometers read again alike.            This lowering of the mercury on evacu
 ation, and rising on readmission of the air, ceased almost entirely when the
 thermometer      was   introduced     into    the receiver immersed in dehydrated
 glycerine.     From these observations Professor Meyer concludes that it is
 solely the mechanical labour of the air during expansion or compression
 which produces these fluctuations, and that they do not depend on the vary
 ing pressure upon the bulb of the thermometer.                This conclusion may be
 correct as far as the particular       thermometer      is concerned which Professor
  Meyer employed, for it will     be seen     in the sequel that certain thermometers
 really behave exceptionally      ;  but it will also appear on examining the ex
  periments given in Table       II.  that two thermometers, under precisely the
 same    external   circumstances, and in close juxtaposition, often differ in
 their readings by half      a degree    of Fahrenheit's scale, and even more, with
 out any assignable cause.          We may obviously infer from this that two
 thermometers, arranged as in Professor Meyer's experiments, are not strictly
 comparable when small differences of temperature have to be ascertained.

 322                         Mr. B. Loewy on the Behaviour                          [Mar. 4,
     5.  In order to       decide   the question of the "vacuum-correction
 avoiding the above        indicated    sources of error,    I had three       a
 pairs of thermometers made, each pair of equal shape
 and size as regards bulb and tube, but these pairs differing
 in this respect among themselves. These six thermometers
 were,   in the manner which is shown in the annexed figure
 for one pair of them, enclosed in glass cases, which ter
 minated in narrow tubes of about 5 inches in length.                  One
 case with its thermometer was left open at the top                   (A),
 while the other (A1) with the corresponding thermometer
 was closed by a rapid puff of the blowpipe, without the
 possibility of heating the enclosed air and thus diminishing
 the pressure upon the enclosed thermometer.
    There were thus subjected to experiment six thermo-                      |
 meters, of three different forms, as may be seen from the
 following description of them :
                                         —
    (1) A* (No. 6700), Spherical bulb, diameter of bulb ^
           inch, length of stem 1 3 inches, enclosed in open
           case.
     (2) A' (No. 6701), Spherical bulb, diameter of bulb £
           inch, length of stem 13 inches, enclosed in shut
           case.
     (3) B (No. 6703),            Cylindrical   bulb,    1-pV inch long,
           -l2j inch wide, length of stem       15  inches, enclosed in
           open case.
     (4) B' (No. 6702), Cylindrical bulb, 1TV inch long,
                 inch wide, length of stem 15 inches, enclosed in
           shut case.
     (5) C (No. 6704), Spherical bulb, diameter of bulb £ inch, length of
           stem 27 inches, enclosed in open case.
     (6)  C     (No. 6982), Spherical bulb, diameter of bulb \ inch, length of
           stem 27 inches, enclosed in shut case.
    The thermometers A, A', B, B' represent the usual form and size of
these instruments, while those marked C, C are unusually large, and would
hardly be employed except for special purposes.                     The former had each
 degree divided into five parts, hence reading by estimation to                         of a
 degree,    while    the  latter  had  -each  degree    divided   into  ten  parts,  each of
which occupied about the space of one degree in the common form ; -l-L of
a degree of Fahrenheit's scale could thus be read with the utmost accuracy.
    6. The thermometers and the receiver employed in these observations
were made by         Mr.  L.  Casella, who took the greatest interest in the purpose
of the experiments,           and consequently took especial care to make the
instruments as perfect         as  possible.
   *  These letters are the same as those used   in  the succeeding  Table of Experiments to
designate    the different thermometers.

        The thermometers            were tested before putting                  them into the glass cases
    by comparing           them from three to three degrees with the Kew standard,
    taking     a great number           of readings by two independent observers for this
    purpose.        From this comparison and by interpolation, the following Table
    of corrections for every degree over the range of temperature during the
    experiments was constructed.                      It will not only prove that the utmost
    precaution was taken to ensure the experiments against errors inherent in
    the instruments employed, but will also show the excellency of the ther
    mometers and the degree of accuracy now obtained by eminent makers in
    the construction of these instruments.

          7.  The thermometers            were placed in the receiver, arranged close to each
     other on a board fixed to             a support, the four smaller thermometers on one
     side, the    two   larger     ones   on    the other ; and the manner of proceeding with
     each experiment was the following.                        Before pumping, all the thermometers
     were twice read           in  rapid     succession        ; after exhausting the receiver to be
     tween one and two inches of pressure (a manipulation which generally
     lasted about ten minutes), two or more readings were again taken to deter
     mine the
                   " immediate effect of exhaustion " on each thermometer. After
     an    interval    of    several     hours      the thermometers were                supposed to have
     assumed the surrounding temperature, and two readings were now taken
     for the
                 " residual effect of exhaustion."                      The whole apparatus was then
     left undisturbed for nearly a whole day, when another set of readings were
     taken, and the apparatus was refilled.                           After readmission of the air the
     temperature shown by the instruments was immediately registered to find
     the heating-effect upon them of the inrush of air.
          The readings, both for the comparison of the instruments and during
     the experiments themselves, were taken alternately by Mr. Thomas Baker,
     Assistant at the Kew Observatory, and myself.                                By the kind permission
     of Mr. Balfour Stewart, Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, I was
     enabled to avail myself of the obliging assistance of Mr. Baker and his
     great experience in thermometric experiments.                              I take this opportunity of
      expressing to both these gentlemen my gratitude for the aid given to me
     in the pursuit of this inquiry.

stant inrush of air, which vitiated the ultimate results.                  Only   those expe
riments are here given and discussed which were made in a smaller receiver
expressly constructed for my purposes by Mr. Casella.
   In this Table         the corrected means        of the individual observations          are
given, while a larger Table, embodying also the latter, has been deposited
with the Royal Society for future reference. It is seen from this larger
Table that the average amount of error in these observations is not more
than about two-hundredths of a degree of Fahrenheit.                     In a very few cases
only, where the thermal effect was not quite completed when the readings
were taken, errors of about one-tenth of a degree occur ; care, however,
was taken in these solitary cases to ascertain the completion of the effect
by the more close agreement of a new series of observations.
   9. A glance at the preceding Table will at once show that the immediate
effect of exhaustion is a fall, that of readmission of air a rise of all ther
mometers, and that there is at once a difference in the behaviour between
the thermometers A', B',        C,  which are still surrounded by air, and A, B, C,
which    are   in a vacuum.      But this difference is also observable to a certain
extent when the receiver is refilled, and when, as regards external pressure,
all thermometers are in the same condition ; hence this immediate difference
must have another cause than the supposed change in the capacity of the
instruments ; at any rate if a permanent difference is found afterwards in
consequence       of such   a change,   it must be included in that difference which
shows itself immediately.          The cause of the latter is obvious. The ther
mometers in closed cases lag a little behind when they are affected by such
sudden fluctuations as those produced in these experiments, and they
assume, as the experiments have shown, the normal temperature a little later.
   The following Table gives the immediate fall and rise of all thermometers,
observed      respectively on evacuating and refilling the receiver, and the im
mediate mean difference between the differently placed thermometers.                         It
exhibits a very close agreement between the effect of exhaustion and that
of readmission of air       ; but its more important practical purpose is to show
that an error      of nearly two degrees of Fahrenheit is made in thermometer-
readings in a receiver immediately after exhaustion or readmission of air.

  10.    Now   if
               this immediate difference would entirely disappear after some
time(say, after a number of hours, or a whole day), or would become so small
as to be within the limits of experimental errors, the question whether a
vacuum-correction   is necessary would have to be negatived.         We may
presume  that after  some time  the refrigeration caused   by the exhaustion
disappears, and that the thermometers are then solely or chiefly influenced
by the temperature of the surrounding air ; if then a difference still appears
in the behaviour        of the thermometers, this permanent difference must
obviously be caused by something independent         of the temperature, and its
source must be       looked for in a change of the instruments themselves.

     1 1.  These readings tell all the same thing, and taken separately agree
 closely with the mean result.          If  the result, found by another method, for
 the thermometers tested for the vacuum-correction during the pendulum-
 experiments for the Indian Survey, which gave 0o-43, is added, it may be
 stated,    as first result of these experiments, that a thermometer of common
form      and   size will, if  used in the vacuum of a receiver, require an addi
 tive correction of four-tenths of a degree of Fahrenheit's scale, provided
 that no readings are taken until the immediate effect of exhaustion, which
 amounts to nearly two degrees, is equalized.
     12. The two large thermometers gave the following differences: — As
 some of them are in an opposite direction,          I denote the expected differences

    These results only strengthen the validity of the others ; for obviously
we have,       in regard to these large thermometers, in fact no other difference
but that arising from experimental errors, local currents, &c.
    The first explanation of this behaviour that suggested itself           was,   that
the thermometer which was supposed to be surrounded by air, had some
flaw in the glass envelope, which allowed the air to escape during the
pumping, so that there was really no difference of condition between it and
its companion thermometer.             A most careful examination of the case did
not lead to the discovery of such a cause of leakage ; and as the thermo
meter in the closed case lagged behind the other in the same manner as
the other thermometers in a similar condition did, I can only come to the
conclusion that thermometers with large bulbs and stems really behave
 differently, or that the permanent effect of exhaustion is imperceptible.
     [With a view of determining whether the exceptional behaviour of the
large thermometers could be accounted for by greater strength of their
glass bulbs, Professor Stokes kindly suggested to me a comparison of the
relative thickness of the glass of the bulbs by placing on it a very minute
opaque dot, and measuring the apparent distance of the dot from its re
flected    image by a lens.      I found the following results : —
    1st. The thickness of the glass varies not inconsiderably in different parts
of the bulb of one and the same thermometer.
    2nd. The thickness of the glass in the bulbs of the large thermometers
        was, on the average, twice that of the small spherical bulbs.
    3rd. The thermometers with cylindrical bulbs had nearly three times
        the thickness of those with small spherical bulbs ; this thickness,
        however, was considerably less at the base of the cylinder.

   The behaviour of the large thermometers may thus be referred to their
greater strength ; but it also appears that in thermometers with cylindrical
bulbs great strength will not obviate the necessity of a vacuum-correction.

   13. In order to test the accuracy of the preceding results, the doted
cases of the thermometers were opened ; hence all instruments were in the
same condition when the receiver was exhausted.         The result was the

   14.     These         have sufficiently established the fact that in
                        experiments
vacuum-experiments due attention must be given to the causes which in
fluence the thermometers employed in the receiver, and that in delicate
experiments an independent                  determination          of the vacuum-correction                          is
indispensable.
   No new explanation of the cause of the permanent fall in vacuum has                      a
suggested itself during the experiments. General Sabine's original expla
nation, that the removal of the atmospheric pressure alters the capacity of
the thermometer,    probably the most correct, especially when
                           is                                        consi                      it      is

the original state of the instrument, has been proved groundless by these
experiments.
  In conclusion          I   have   to thank       the President          and Council of the Royal
Society for defraying the expenses incurred in these experiments.

   My dear Sir, — The                   has at length arrived, and we are now
                                      telescope

                                        ;                                till the                   it
great machine   itself came   to hand.    It will be nearly two months before                                        it
can be fairly tried, when       spacious rectangular building and its travelling
                                    a
roof will be completed.
  Mr. Le Sueur arrived nearly two months before the                                      telescope,          having

 come  by the overland mail, and the ship carrying the            telescope making
 an unusually  long passage.
   The principal or more delicate portions of the instrument came out in
good order: the specula are still in thin coats of varnish, and their
surfaces appear in perfect good order. Some of the large castings and
portions of the gearing had got rusted, but not to an injurious extent.
The piers were completed on New Year's morning, and form a magnificent
piece of masonry, the stone employed being the grey basalt, so common
here (called " blue stone "), in blocks from one to three tons in weight
each.   The building    we have   finally decided upon is of stuccoed brickwork
80 feet long by 40 wide. Forty in length is taken up by the telescope-room,
which is covered by a ridged roof of iron travelling on rails on the walls, and
moves back on the other 40 feet of the building, leaving the telescope in the
open air. The back 40 feet is covered by a fixed roof lower than the moveable
one, and will contain a polishing- and engine-room, a capacious laboratory,
and an office for observer. The cost of piers, building, and roof will be
about £1700.      The Government, with hard economy in all other direc
tions, have still acted very liberally about this work ; and I only trust the
telescope itself will turn out all that is expected of it. The micrometer
and spectrum-apparatus      have not arrived yet.
   Our magnetographs       do their    work smoothly and satisfactorily.        The
photography has become a part of the routine of the Observatory now.               I
have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of the baro- and thermographs,
and we look for them every day, although         I have   had no advices of their
having   been  shipped.     I  suppose you will have       seen  Mr. Verdon long
before this reaches you.

   The author stated that the examination of the fossil plant-remains which
had been at various times brought to Europe from North Greenland by

330        Prof. Heer on    the Fossil Flora of North Greenland.       [Mar. 11,
lished in his work, ' Flora Fossilis Arctica,' had led him to certain conclu
sions, the verification of which, by means of additional material, became
very important.
     Accordingly Mr. R. H. Scott had applied to the British Association at
 the Nottingham Meeting in 1866 for a grant of money towards the ex
penses of an expedition to Greenland.         A sum of money was voted to a
 Committee, consisting of Dr. Hooker, Sir W. Trevelyan, Dr. E. Perceval
 Wright, and Mr. E. Whymper, with Mr. Scott as Secretary. This grant
 was subsequently most liberally augmented by the Government-Grant
 Committee of the Royal Society.          The condition laid down by both of
 these bodies was that a complete series of specimens should be deposited in
 the British Museum.
     Mr. Scott being unable to go to Greenland himself, Mr. Whymper, who
 had, previously to the nomination of the Committee, formed the plan of tra
 velling in Greenland, undertook to visit the shores of the Waigat, and to
 carry out the wishes of the Committee, if his-time would permit him ; and
 grants of money were accordingly intrusted to him conditionally.               Mr.
 Whymper took with him Mr. Robert          Brown,   to assist in the collection  of
 the specimens   ; and the party ultimately arrived in Greenland on the 1 6th
 of June, 1867.
     Prof. Heer then gives extracts from Mr. Whymper' s Report, submitted
 by the Committee to the British Association in August last, and also from
 notes furnished to him by Mr. Brown.            From these statements a con
 siderable amount of information as to the geology of the district is de
 rived.
     All the specimens which had been previously brought to Europe, with
 the exception of a few brought by Dr. Lyall, had been found at a place
 called Atanekerdluk, on the mainland of Greenland, in lat. 70° or there
 abouts.     Dr. Lyall's specimens were found on Disco Island, at the oppo
 site side of the Waigat Strait from Atanekerdluk.         Mr. Whymper accord
 ingly, having engaged     a  number of natives    as  labourers, went to Atane
 kerdluk in the first instance, reaching it on the 22nd of August. The party
 remained at the spot for some days, and made a large collection of speci
 mens. The plant-beds are reported to be on a hill, at a height of nearly
  1200 feet above the sea, and the deposit is limited in extent.        Details of
 the different beds observed are contained in the paper.
     Professor Heer observes that the statements of Messrs. Whymper and
 Brown confirm the accounts of Olrik and Inglefield respecting the stratifi
 cation of the coal-deposits and plant-beds of Atanekerdluk.           They show
 that there is a considerable succession of sedimentary strata, pierced by
 volcanic rocks which form the summits of the mountains.             Fossil plants
  occur in all the beds  ; but the Siderite and Limonite contain them in the
 greatest abundance and in the best state of preservation.            In fact the
 slabs from these beds are quite covered with specimens, lying in every
  direction.

   1869.]      Prof. Heer on     the  Fossil Flora of North Greenland.              331
       With the  vegetable    remains two land-insects     were discovered.      Of the
   plants many species were inhabitants of marshy or moory ground, viz.
   Phragmites, Sparganium, Taxodium, and Menyanthes, which are all indi
   cative of a freshwater deposit, as is also a Cyclas, of which mollusk one
  valve was found.       These facts, taken together with the absence of marine
  forms, show the deposit at Atanekerdluk to have been a strictly freshwater
  formation.
      After completing the examination of the mainland at this point, the
  party crossed the Waigat, and landed on Disco Island, where they found
  plant-remains at two localities, Ujararsusuk and Kudliset.
      Coal-seams are exposed at several points on the east and south coasts of
  Disco ; but no specimens showing impressions of leaves, like those of Atane
  kerdluk, had ever been brought to Europe, except those obtained by Dr.
  Lyall. However, Sir C. Giesecke, in his MS. journal, of which a copy is
  in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, mentions that he had noticed

      The coal has been worked at several points, if the rough operations which
  have been carried on deserve the name of workings.              It is at present only
  obtained at the one spot, Ujararsusuk. The coal occurs interstratified with
  sandstones and shales, which rest on trap.            The fossils were discovered
  among the debris brought down by the streams, and were traced up to a
  bed   of brown sandstone about       100 feet above the sea.
      At Kudliset, the deposits      are very similar to those   just described ; and
  there also the fossils were    found, in the first instance, in a torrent-bed.
      The shores of   the Waigat were examined for some distance to the north
  wards, on each side of the strait, without any fresh discoveries being made,
  and the party returned to Atanekerdluk.
      Mr. Whymper, in concluding his report,           says that the success     of the
  expedition has been
                          " primarily   due to the invaluable information given by
  Herr C. S. M. Olrik, the Director of the Greenland Trade.               Scarcely less
 are our thanks      due   to Herr    K.   Smith,  the present Inspector      of North
  Greenland, and to Herr Anderson,          of Ritenbenk.      Both of    these gentle
 men gave much assistance         at considerable personal trouble ; and without
 their assistance   it would have    been almost impossible to obtain the collec
 tions."
     The general conclusion to      be drawn from the accounts       of the succession
 of strata &c. is that, on both      sides  of the Waigat, the sedimentary rocks
 are covered by Miocene deposits pierced by volcanic             rocks, which appear
 in places as thick beds of basalt and trap.
     In his summary of the botanical results of the expedition, the author
 announces the identification of fourteen species from Disco Island, among
 which Platanus Guilleltnce (G5pp.) and Sequoia Couttsiee (Hr.) are the most
common.        Of Magnolia Inglefieldi,     a species  originally identified by means
of   leaves found at   Atanekerdluk, two      cones  were found in the Disco beds,
thus     corroborating    the previous     determination,   and proving to us that
                                                                       2 r 2

th is splendid    evergreen ripened its fruit so far north as the parallel   of
 70°.
    Seven    out of the Disco species occur also at Atanekerdluk ; and eight
agree with those of the Lower Miocene of Europe. The age of the deposit
is accordingly well ascertained.
    The collection from Atanekerdluk contains 73 species, of which 25 are
new to Greenland.        Some of these are known European forms, especially
Smilax grandifolia, which, at the Miocene epoch, occurred over the whole
of Europe.       Of Sequoia Langsdorffii, as was to be expected, abundant evi
dence   has been accumulated, showing how favourable the conditions of
climate and soil were to its growth.
    Among the most interesting specimens are the flowers and fruit of a
chestnut, the latter in a very perfect condition.       The discovery of these
proves to us that the deposits in which they are found were formed at dif
ferent seasons, in spring as well as in autumn.
   The Miocene plants discovered in Greenland have now reached the number
of   137 species,  and those  of the Arctic Miocene Flora 194.   Of the Green
land species 46, or exactly one-third, agree with those of the Miocene
 deposits of Europe.      The determination of the age of the beds as Lower
Miocene has accordingly been confirmed.
    Four of the species agree with those of Bovey Tracey, among them
Sequoia Couttsite, the commonest tree in the latter locality.
    In concluding the first part of his paper, the author offers a resumS of
 the grounds on which the determinations of the species have been based.
    Seventeen species are represented by the leaves and organs of fructifica
tion among the Greenland specimens.
    Ten species are only represented by leaves in Greenland ; but their organs
 of fructification occur elsewhere.
    Seventeen species of those of which only leaves are found exhibit, how
 ever, such marked characteristics, that there can be no doubt about their
identification.
    Five Cryptogams have been satisfactorily recognized.
    Accordingly, though it must be allowed that the systematic position of
 many of the plants from North Greenland is still uncertain, yet the con
 siderable number of absolutely identified species which can be produced
 enables us to form a clear idea of the Miocene Flora of North Greenland.
    The second part of the paper contains the specific descriptions of the
 various forms.
    The collection, consisting of some 300 specimens, has been deposited     in
 the British Museum.

 introduced, and the mouth of the flask closed by a doubly perforated cork.
 Into one of these perforations a thermometer was introduced, into the
 other a bent tube, dipping beneath the surface of the liquid in the flask,
 and connected at its other extremity with a Liebig condenser.                            This tube
 had a lateral opening (inside the flask) just beneath the cork ; by means of
 this the vapour escaped to the condenser, and trickled back into the flask
 after being condensed. Thus the composition of the mixture was retained
 as uniform as possible.           Thus estimated, the barometer standing at 744 '4

    This    was    estimated by carefully observing the heights to which the
several mixtures rose in a capillary tube 0-584 millim. in diameter.
    These heights were measured by means of a telescope and a millimetre-
scale etched on a glass rod.             This glass rod was fixed to the capillary tube,
and terminated at its lower extremity in a point, which was made just to
touch the surface of the liquid.

   The specific-gravity bottle has two necks ; into one was fitted a thermo

336           Messrs. Dupre and Page               on the     Physical Properties              [Mar. 11,
   -Weight of water contained in the piezometer 1 14'9727 grms.
   In conclusion the authors confine themselves to pointing out certain
relations which connect the various physical properties examined.
   These properties may he divided into two classes, according as they
reach a maximum deviation from the theoretical mean at 30 per cent, or
40 per cent. ; each of these is divided into two subclasses, one containing
those properties in which the numbers found are above those calculated,
and the other containing those in which they are below.
         Class       I.
              Subclass a. Specific heat.
                          Heat produced by mixing.
                     „       b.   Boiling-point.
                                  Capillary attraction.
         Class       II.
              Subclass c. Rate of expansion.
                 „     d. Compressibility.
  Other characters, examined by previous investigators, are                            :   —
         1.    Vapour-tension         :   this falls under Class        I.   Subclass b.
       2. Specific          Gravity.
       3. Index            of Refraction.
   The two latter form a new class, coming to a maximum deviation from
their theoretical value at 45 per cent.
   In subclass a, specific heat— by reference to the Tables given, it will be
seen that the first addition of alcohol to water (though alcohol has a
specific heat much lower than that of water) produces mixtures which
have a higher specific heat than water, and that a mixture contain
ing between 30 and 40 per cent, alcohol has the same specific heat as
water.
   Similarly alcohol, though much more compressible than water, yet,
when added to              it,
                   forms mixtures less compressible than water so that a                   ;
mixture  containing between                   45   and 50 per cent, alcohol has the same
compressibility as water.
  The         rate   of expansion
                            remarkable, as, starting from water,
                                       is                           at first               it          is
below the theoretical value, then rises at        to 18 per cent. the rate of
                                                          ;     1   7
expansion     identical
                     is with   the calculated  expansion    for all mixtures     ;
stronger than this, the rate of expansion      constantly above that calcu
                                                               is
lated.
  The whole of the physical characters of mixtures of alcohol and water
come  to   maximum deviation from their theoretical values somewhere
                a
between 30 per cent. and 45 per cent. alcohol                       by
                                               weight. The 30 per cent,
nearly corresponds to the formula                    C2   HeO +     6   OH, (=29       87 per cent.)   ;

 1869.]              of Aqueous Mixtures and Solutions.                        337
the 45 per cent, has approximately the formula C2 Ha         0+30     Ha  (=46 per
 cent.).
   Some of the physical properties examined seem to he especially connected
with each other ; these are : —
    1. Specific heat and heat produced        by mixing;      for by dividing the
       number of units of heat evolved by 5 grammes of any mixture by
       3-41 1, the elevation of the specific heat of such mixture above the
       theoretical specific heat is obtained.
    2. Boiling-point and capillary attraction ; by dividing the depression of
       the capillary attraction by 3-6, the depression of the boiling-point is
       obtained.
   Deville & Hoek have shown the specific gravity and index of refraction
to be connected with each other (Ann. de Chim. et de Physique, 3rd ser.
vol. v.    Pogg. Ann. vol. cxii.).
   Whether the relations thus established between the various physical
properties of alcoholic mixtures hold good with other similar substances,
or whether these mixtures form        a singular   exception, must be decided by
 further research.

       of its Products of Decomposition." — Part             III.   By A. Mat-
        thiessen, F.R.S., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Bartholomew's
        Hospital.    Received February 18, 1869.

   In this part the preparation is described of two new         bases derived from
narcotine.
    1.  On the Action    of Hydriodic Acid     on    Narcotine. — When narcotine
is heated with fuming hydriodic acid, iodide of methyl is evolved, and
on investigating the residue it is found to consist of the iodide of a new
base.
   In two experiments made with 50 grms. of narcotine, 45-7 and 46-2
grms. of iodide of methyl, and in a third experiment with 100 grms. of
narcotine, 91-8 grms. of iodide of methyl, were obtained, 51 -5 grms. and
103-1 grms. being the theoretical          quantity required for the following
reaction   : —

338                              Dr. A. Matthiessen on the Chemical                                       [Mar.   18.

took place, the theoretical quantity of iodide would only be 34 -3 grma.
and 68- 7 respectively.
   The endeavours to obtain the base in a state fit for analysis have been
fruitless, owing to its oxidizing rapidly when exposed to the air; to esta
blish its composition, the chloride was analyzed, and led to the following
result        :—
                                                      C„   H17   N   07   H    CI.
The       base      itself   is,
                     when newly precipitated, nearly white, but as soon as
it   exposed to the air
     is                      becomes almost black
                                               it          soluble in carbo          ;   it   is
nate of sodium,   caustic soda, potash or  ammonia, slightly soluble in hot
alcohol, quite insoluble in ether, and nearly so in water.   All endeavours
to obtain          it   or its salts in
                                crystalline state have hitherto failed.
                                                a
     The        may be called normal narcotine, or, shorter, nornarcotine, as
               base
it   contains, in all probability,   normal meconin combined with cotarni-
mide.

tine    heated with hydrochloric acid for about two hours, chloride of
          is
methyl     evolved, and on examining the residue
               is                                   will be found to con             it
tain the chloride of new base.   The reaction which takes place
                                   a                              simply                                  is
that one atom of methyl in the narcotine   replaced by one of hydrogen    is                                      ;
thus      :—
                           C2a   HM
                                        N       07 +   H Cl=Cal H„ N 07+C H3 CI.
     The pure             white amorphous powder, almost insoluble in
                         base forms            a
water and ether, very- soluble in alcohol.  Its salts, like those of the
other bases derived from narcotine, are, as far as they have been pre
pared, amorphous.   The base may be called dimethyl-normal-narcotine,
or, shorter, dimethyl-nor-narcotine.
   In the annexed Table the properties                                    and reactions            of the narcotine
bases are given side                  by      side.
  Neither of the above bases has any marked physiological effects    for in                                ;
working  with them,  as well as in taking grain doses, no ill effects have
been      observed.              It            worthy of notice that the taste of the chlorides
                                      by is
varies so markedly                            the replacement of one atom of methyl by one of
hydrogen.

        Matthiessen, F.R.S., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Bartholo

                                      (Abstract.)
    In Section I. of this memoir some new reactions of narcotine are described.
    A. When narcotine is submitted to the action of water, either boiling in
 open vessels or at temperatures above 100° C. in sealed tubes,                it splits up
 into meconin and cotarnine.
                       C„ HM N07=C10 H10 04 + Cia H„ N0,.
    The splitting up of narcotine under the influence of heated water may
 explain the occurrence of meconin in opium-residues, as probably the
 small amount of meconin always found there is simply due to the partial de
 composition of the narcotine during the processes of extraction of morphia.
    B. Narcotine heated per se to a little above 200° splits up as above into
meconin and cotarnine, the latter being immediately decomposed at that
temperature.
    C. When hydrochlorate        of narcotine is heated along with ferric chloride
solution, the latter is reduced and the narcotine converted into opianic acid
and cotarnine.

    Section   II. treats of the decompositions of the narcotine-bases.
   A. Dimethyl-nornarcotine, when heated to above 1 00° C. with water in
sealed tubes, undergoes decomposition : from the corresponding narcotine
reaction it would seem that this decomposition              might take place      in either
of two ways : —
                Narcotine.              Meconin.                Cotarnine.
          C10Hu(CH3)3N07==C8H4(CH3)a04-r-Ca                    H10 (CH3) N0a.
          Dimethvl-nornarcotine.  Methyl-normeconin.            Cotarnine.
          Cl8 H;5 (CH3)a    N07=  C8 H5 (CH3) 04 + Cn H10          (CH,) N03,
or
                                      Meconin.              Cotarnimide.
          C„ Hl5 (CH,)aN07=C, H4 (CH3)a04+Cu Hn N03.
Of   these the former reaction is apparently      the one which thus takes place.
   This conclusion is borne out by the fact that, when treated with ferric or
platinic chloride, the hydrochlorate of dimethyl-nornarcotine forms methyl-
noropianic acid and cotarnine, and not opianic acid and cotarnimide.

cotine and nornarcotine with heated water and oxidizing agents are as

    Section    III.  contains some      miscellaneous observations on opianic acid,
meconin, and hemipinic acid.
   A. Opianic acid treated with sulphuric acid and dilute solution of bichro
mate of potassium becomes oxidized to hemipinic acid.
                              C10H10O5    + O=C10H10O8.
When heated       a few degrees above its melting-point,         opianic acid loses water
and yields a substance crystallizable from hot alcohol, differing in properties
from opianic acid, and apparently containing C40 II33 018, being formed
thus   : —
                           4Cl0Hl0O5=H2O + C40H38O18.
   B. All attempts        to oxidize   meconin to opianic or hemipinic           acid were
failures.
    Nitrous acid       gas passed    into melted meconin caused the formation of
nitromeconin,       identical with that got by the action of nitric acid, each
sample, however, giving rather different qualitative                reactions from those
usually ascribed to this substance.
    C. Hemipinic acid, when heated to              170°,  loses  water and becomes       an
anhydride, C10 Ha 04, which may be crystallized unaltered from absolute
alcohol, but when treated with ordinary spirit of 90 per cent, alcohol forms
ethyl-hemipinic acid, C10 H8 (Ca H5) 0,.

    (1) It has been shown from the analyses of various samples of narcotine
derived from various sources, that narcotine has always the same composi

      (2) As  stated by former observers, narcotine under the         influence of oxi

      (3) When heated to a little above 200° per se, or for a considerable
 time in contact with water, narcotine splits up into meconin and cotarnine
 (vol. xvii. p. 340).

                                      C10 H10  O, + C„ H„ N0,.
     (-l) When narcotine is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid for a short
 time (about two hours), chloride of methyl is formed, and one atom of H
 substituted for    CH,   in the narcotine ;  if heated for  a long time (some days),
 two atoms of     II arc  substituted for two of CH3     ;  when heated with fuming
 hydriodic acid, iodide of methyl is formed in such quantities as to prove
 that three atoms of Hare substituted for three of CH3.             A series of homo
 logous bases is thus formed, whose decompositions are analogous              to those
 of narcotine.
     (5) Cotarnine    has been shown to have the formula C12H13 N03, and not
 CiaH„N03, and is capable of crystallizing with half             a molecule, and with
 a whole molecule, of water of crystallization.
     (6) When cotarnine is heated with dilute nitric acid, under certain           not
 clearly understood circumstances, cotarnic acid and methylamine               is pro
 duced,
                    Cia Hl3 N03 + 2 Ha O = 0H H„ O, + CH5 N ;
 with strong nitric acid, as stated by previous observers, apophyllic acid is
 produced; other oxidizing agents give no definite results (vol. xi. p. 59).
    (7) When cotarnine is heated with strong hydrochloric acid, chloride of
 methyl is formed, and hydrochlorate         of cotarnamic acid.
            C, , H„ N03 + Ha    O + 2 H CI = CH,    CI + Cu H„ N0,, HC1.
 Hydriodic     acid produces a similar reaction, only one equivalent of CH,
being    removed   for one of cotarnine (vol. xii. p. 503).
    (8) Opianic acid under the influence of nascent hydrogen (as when
treated with sodium-amalgam          or zinc and sulphuric acid)        is reduced to
meconin (vol. xii. p. 503).
                        C10H10Os + Ha=HaO+C10H10O4.
    (9) Opianic acid heated with bichromate of potassium and dilute sul
phuric acid becomes oxidized to hemipinic acid (vol. xvii. p. 311).
                            C10H10Os + O=C10H10O8.
   (10) Opianic acid heated with caustic potash splits up into meconin and
hemipinic acid (vol. xi. p. 57).
                        2C10 H10  O,=C10   H10   O,+C10    H10O0.
   (11) Opianic acid heated with excess of hydrochloric acid forms chloride
of methyl, hydrogen being substituted for CH3 in the opianic acid : it ap
pears probable that two distinct substances are thus produced, noropianic
acid and methyl-noropianic        acid — the former by substitution of H3 for

(CH3)a, and the latter by substitution of H for CH3 ; only the latter has
been isolated in a pure state, the former decomposing spontaneously.
                    C„  H10 05 + 2HCl=2CH3 C1+ Cs H, 05,
                    C10H10O„+HCl = CH3Cl + C,HaOt.
Hydriodic acid apparently produces similar decompositions.
    Like opianic acid, methyl-noropianic acid is monobasic (vol. xvi. p. 39).
    (12) All experiments to oxidize meconin to opianic acid or hemipinic
acid or any other product have proved failures.
    (13) Meconin treated with excess of hydrochloric or hydriodic acid forms
chloride or iodide of methyl, and a body derived from meconin by substi
tution of    H for CH3, methyl-normeconin.
                     C10 H10 Ot + HC1= CH3 CI +    C„ H9 04.
    Attempts to procure     (hypothetical) normeconin by substituting Ha for
(CH,).,    did not yield anything capable of isolation in a pure state (vol. xvi.
p. 39).
    (14) Hemipinic acid treated with various reducing agents has in no case
been reduced to opianic acid or meconin ; nor have experiments to form
opianic acid by the union of hemipinic acid and meconin been successful ;
nor has hemipinic acid      been oxidized to any other compound.
    (15) When hemipinic acid is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid,
chloride of methyl and carbonic acid are formed, together with a new acid,
 methyl-hypogallic acid, in accordance with the following equation : —
                  Cl0  H10 0„+ HC1=CH3 CI + COa+       C9 Ht Ot.
    When heated with hydriodic acid, hypogallic acid     is found, together  with
 iodide of methyl and carbonic acid     : thus,
        C10H10O0+2HI=2CHaI+COa+C7H0O, (vol. xvi. p. 40).
    (16) The observations of Anderson, that hemipinic acid is bibasic, have
 been confirmed, and an anhydride obtained by simple desiccation (vol. xvii.
 p. 341).
                           CI0H10O0=HaO + C10H9O5.
  Methyl-hypogallic acid, however, is monobasic (vol. xvi. p. 40).
    ( 1 7) Hemipinic acid is capable of crystallizing with different amounts
 of water of crystallization, crystals with half a molecule, with a whole mo
 lecule, and with two molecules of water having been obtained (vol. xvi.
 p. 40).
    (18) All the reactions of narcotine and of its products of decomposition
 may be satisfactorily accounted for by the following rational formula     : —

  past in the computations of the Berliner Jahrbuch              and ' Nautical Al
 manac,' differ more from observation than is consistent with the present re
  quirements of astronomy ; and, moreover, abundant means for the correction
  of Bouvard's ' Elements' exist in the publication of the Greenwich Plane
  tary Observations, 1750-1835, and the annual volumes issued from the
  Royal Observatory since 1836. The present work, which has been under
 taken for this purpose, is based exclusively on the Greenwich Observations,
  1750-1865.
     Each  mean group   of observations in the Greenwich          Planetary Reduc
 tions &c. gives the mean error of the planet's tabular            geocentric   place,
 with its equivalent in terms of the heliocentric errors          of the earth and
 planet ; but in the present investigation the places            of Carlini's     Solar
 Tables, which have been used throughout the whole period (with the ex
 ception of 1864 and 1865), have been accepted without alteration ; for
 Jupiter and Saturn the factors of the earth's heliocentric errors are so
 small, that the difference of Carlini's Solar Tables from the recent investiga
 tions of Leverrier may be neglected.
    The coefficients of the errors of the elements in heliocentric longitude
 and radius vector, for different values of the mean anomaly, are calculated in
 the usual way ; and the formation of the equations of condition is effected
by their multiplication by the printed factors of the heliocentric errors of
 the planet in the Greenwich Observations.          A weight is assigned to each
 equation of condition, dependent on the number of observations in the
 group, and the relation of the geocentric and heliocentric errors.                The
 equations thus, multiplied by the weights, are then solved by the method
of least squares.    The results are given in the following Table : —

IV. " On      the   Structure of the Red Blood-corpuscle             of Oviparous
       Vertebrata."        By     William     S.   Savory,     F.R.S.      Received
       February 20, 1869.
    The red blood-cell has been perhaps more frequently and fully examined
than any other animal structure ; certainly none has evoked such various
and even contradictory opinions of its nature.           But without attempting
here any history of these, it may be shortly said that amongst the con
clusions now, and for a long time past, generally accepted, a chief one is
that a fundamental distinction exists between the red corpuscle of Mam
 malia and that of the other vertebrate classes — that the red cell of the
 oviparous vertebrata possesses      a nucleus which    is not to be found    in the
 corpuscle of the other class.       This great distinction     between the classes
 has of late years been over and over again laid down in the strongest and
 most unqualified terms.
    But   I venture to ask for a still further    examination     of this important
 subject.
    As the oviparous red cell is commonly seen, there can be no doubt whatever
 about the existence of a "nucleus" in its interior. It is too striking an object
 to escape any eye; but I submit that its existence is due to the circumstances
 under which the corpuscle is seen, and the mode in which it is prepared
 for examination.     I think it can be shown that the so-called nucleus is the
 result of the changes which the substance of the corpuscle undergoes after
 death (and which are usually hastened and exaggerated by exposure), and
 the disturbance to which it is subjected in being mounted for the micro
 scope.  When   a drop of blood is prepared for examination, little orno attention
 is given to the few seconds, more or less, which are consumed in the mani
 pulation.    It is usually either pressed or spread out on the glass slip, and

  1869.]            Red Blood-corpuscle     of Oviparous Vertclrata.               3-17
  often mixed with water or some other fluid.            But it is possible to place
  blood-cells under the microscope for examination so quickly, and with such
  slight disturbance, that they may be satisfactorily examined before the
 nuclei have begun to form.           They may then be shown to be absolutely
 structureless throughout ; and, moreover, as the examination is contiuued
 the gradual formation of the nuclei can be traced. The chief points to be
 attended to are — to mount a drop of blood as quickly as possible, to avoid
 as much as possible any exposure to air, to avoid as much as practicable
 contact of any foreign substance with the drop, or any disturbance of it.
     After many trials of various plans, I find that the following will often
 succeed     sufficiently well.    Having the microscope, and everything else
 which    is required, conveniently arranged       for immediate use, an assistant
 secures    the animal which is to furnish the blood (say, a frog or a newt),
 in such a way that the operator may cleanly divide some superficial vessel,
 as the femoral or humeral artery.          He then instantly touches the drop of
 blood which      exudes    with the under surface of the glass which is to be
 used as the cover, immediately places this very lightly upon the slide, and
 has the whole under the microscope with the least possible delay.               Thus
 for several seconds the blood-cells may be seen without any trace of nuclei ;
 then, as the observation is continued, these gradually, but at first very faintly,
 appear ; and the study of their formation affords strong proof of their
 absence from the living cells.
     The "nucleus" first appears      as an indistinct shadowy substance, usually,
 but not always, about the centre of the cell.         The outline of it can hardly,
for some seconds, be defined ; but it gradually grows more distinct.            Often
some small portion of the edge appears clear before the rest.           At  the  same
time the nucleus is seen to be paler than the surrounding substance. Syn
chronously with this change — and this is noteworthy — the outline of the
corpuscle (the "cell-wall") becomes broader and darker.                What was at
first a mere edge of homogeneous substance, becomes at length a dark
border sharply defined from the coloured matter within. Thus a corpuscle,
at first absolutely structureless, homogeneous throughout,        is seen gradually
to be resolved into central substance or nucleus,           external  layer or cell-
wall, and an intermediate, coloured though very transparent, substance.
But — and this is significant — these changes      are not always thus   fullycarried
out.    It not seldom happens that the nucleus         does not appear as a central
well-defined regularly oval mass.          Sometimes it never forms so as to be
clearly  traced    in outline, but remains   as an irregular shapeless mass, in its
greater portion very obscure.         Sometimes only a small part, if any, of an
edge can be recognized, most        of it appearing to blend indefinitely with the
rest of the cell-substance.       Sometimes it happens that in many corpuscles
the formation of a nucleus does not proceed even so far as this.                   No
distinct separation of substance can anywhere be seen, but shadows, more
or less deep, here and there indicate that there is greater aggregation of
matter at some parts than at others.              Occasionally some of the cells
                                                                    2 c 2

348                   Mr. W. S. Savory                  on the Structure              of the           [Mar. 18,
present throughout a granular aspect.                           I
                                           have almost invariably observed,
too, a relation between the distinctness of the nucleus and of the cell-wall.
When the nucleus is well defined, the cell-wall is strongly marked ; when
one is confused,   the other is usually fainter.    This, however, does not
apply to colour ;   on the  contrary, when the   nucleus  is least coloured it
contrasts most strongly with the surrounding cell.       As a rule, the wall
of the cell is more strongly marked than the  nucleus.
     It   will of course    be said that the nuclei are present                          all the while, but
are at first concealed by the surrounding                            substance — the           contents      of the
cell.      Thus the fact has               been   accounted for, that the nuclei are not so
obvious at first as they subsequently become.    But I think a careful com
parison of cells  will show that those in which a nucleus may be traced are
not more transparent than others which are structureless ; and, moreover,
when one cell overlaps another, the lower one is seen through the upper
clearly enough to show that the substance of these cells is sufficiently
transparent to allow of a nucleus being discerned if it exists.      When a
nucleus is fully formed, it hides that portion of the outline of a cell which
lies beneath it.         How     is   it,   then,   if      the nucleus        present from the first,
                                                                               is
that the portion of the cell over which                             it   subsequently appears is, for
a while, plainly seen        ?
     The        of the observation
            success                     of course influenced by numerous cir
                                                       is
cumstances. The rate at which the nuclei form in the corpuscles varies in
different animals.      have usually found that in the common frog they are
                         I
more prone to form than in many other animals — quicker than in most
fishes, or even than in some birds.        But this does not seem always to
depend upon   their  larger size; for in the common newt the cells, which are
larger than those of the frog, remain, as have noticed, for   I longer period                  a
without any appearance of nuclei.        But even in the frog    can be satis                  it
factorily demonstrated that the corpuscle   structureless.          is
 I   have found, too, that the observation succeeds best with the blood                                         of
animals which are healthy and vigorous.  Thus the first observations upon
fresh animals are usually the most satisfactory.  After they have been
repeatedly wounded or have lost much blood, the cells are more prone
to undergo the changes which result in the production of nuclei.
   Again, the formation of nuclei may be hastened, and their appearance
rendered more distinct at last,                   by
                                                  various reagents. Acids and many ether
reagents are well known                    to have this effect.  The addition of a small
quantity of water acts in the same way, but less energetically.  It hastens
the appearance of an indistinct nucleus, but interferes with the formation
of   a    well-defined     mass,      so that,         after the addition of water, neither the
outline of the cell nor of the nucleus becomes so strongly marked as    often                           it
does without it. Exposure to air also promotes their formation     indeed, as                      ;
a rule, the nuclei form best under simple exposure.       Any disturbance of
the drop,      as   by moving the point of                  a   needle    in    it,   certainly hastens the
change;       and perhaps      itinfluenced
                                      is                     by   temperature.

1869.]                  Red Blood-corpuscle of Oviparous          Vertebrata.             349
   Sometimes,   when the drop of blood has been skilfully mounted, the
majority of cells will remain for a long while without any trace of nucleus;
but, again, in almost every specimen, the nucleus in some few of the cells,
particularly in those nearest the              edges, begins to appear so rapidly that       it
is hardly possible to run over the whole field without finding some cells
with an equivocal appearance.
   It would follow, of course, from these observations that, if the living
blood were examined in the vessels, the corpuscle would show no trace of
any distinction of parts ; and this is so. Indeed, in my earlier observations *,
           I
before had learnt to mount a drop of blood for observation in a satisfactory
manner,         I
             examined, at some length, blood in the vessels of the most
transparent parts         I
                    could select ; and several observations on the web and
lung of the frog and elsewhere were satisfactory.   But still, when the cells
were thus somewhat obscured by intervening membrane, one could not
generally feel sure that the observation was so^clear and complete, but
that a faintly marked nucleus might escape detection.      While, therefore,
the result of observations on blood-cells   in the vessels fully accords with
the description I have  given, I do not think  that the demonstration of the
fact, that while living they have no nucleus, can be made so plain and un
equivocal as when they are removed from the vessels.
   The question naturally      Why, then, does not a nucleus form in the
                                     arises,
mammalian corpuscle ? But while it is accepted that the great majority of
these corpuscles exhibit no nuclei after death, excellent observers still
affirm their occasional existence ; and I am convinced that an indistinct,
                      " nucleus " is often seen ; and the shadowy sub
imperfectly formed
stance seen in many of the smaller oviparous cells after they have been
mounted for some time is very like that seen under similar circumstances
in some of the corpuscles of Mammalia.   Many, too, affirm that these cor
puscles        do not    exhibit     that distinction of wall and contents which is
generally described.   It           appears to me that this difference of opinion de
pends on the changes they are prone to undergo.     How far the absence of
                     " nucleus
                               " after death depends on their smaller size                    I
a distinctly defined
am not prepared to say.
   Many questions of course follow. For example, how far is this separa
tion of the substance of a homogeneous t corpuscle into nucleus, cell-
membrane, and contents to be compared to the coagulation of the blood?
and how do the agents               which      are known   to influence   the   one    process
affect the other?         A still
                         further and more important question     How are         is,
these changes in the corpuscles, and in the  blood around  them, related?
But   inthis paper   propose to go no further than the statement that the

   succeeded after some failures.   The position of this third line    at 2796               is
 of Kirchhoff's         scale.    It   is   generally excessively faint, and much more care
    required to see   than                   necessary in the case of the other lines

    Hence, then, with the exception of the bright yellow line, the observed
 spectra of the prominences and of the chromosphere correspond exactly
 with the spectrum of hydrogen under different conditions of pressure —                                a
 fact not only important in itself, but as pointing to what may be hoped for
 in the future.
      With regard to the yellow line which Dr. Frankland and myself have
 stated may possibly be due to the radiation of great thickness of hydrogen,
                                                                     a

1869.]                             Observations    of the Sun.                         351
      Dr. Frankland and myself           have pointed out that, although      the chromo
sphere and the prominences give out the spectrum of hydrogen, it does not
follow that they are composed merely of that substance : supposing others
to be mixed up with hydrogen, we might presume that they would be indi
cated by their selective absorption near the sun's limb.                 In this case the
spectrum of the limb would contain additional Fraunhofer lines.                     I have
pursued this investigation to some extent, with, at present, negative results ;
but I find that special instrumental appliances are necessary to settle the
question, and these are now being constructed.
      If   we assume,     as already suggested by      Dr. Frankland and myself, that
no other extensive atmosphere besides the chromosphere overlies the pho
 tosphere, the darkening of the limb being due to the general absorption of
 the chromosphere, it will follow : —
      I. That an additional selective absorption near the limb is extremely
          probable.
      II.   That the hydrogen Fraunhofer lines indicating the absorption of the
          outer shell of the chromosphere will vary somewhat in thickness :
          this  I  find to be the case to a certain extent.
      III.   That it is not probable that the prominences will           be visible on the
          sun's disk.
      In connexion with the probable chromospheric darkening of the limb,
  an observation        of a spot on February 20th is of importance. The spot
  observed      was near the limb,        and the absorption was much greater than
  anything       I had seen before     ; so great, in fact, was the general     absorption,
  that the several lines could only be distinguished with difficulty, except in
  the very brightest region.             I ascribe this to the greater length of the
  absorbing medium in the spot itself in the line of sight, when the spot is
  observed near the limb, than when it is observed in the centre of the disk —
  another indication of the great general absorbing power of a comparatively
  thin layer, on rays passing through it obliquely.
      I  now come to the selective absorption in a spot.           I  have commenced a
  map of the spot-spectrum, which, however, will require some time to com
  plete.      In the interim,     I  may state that the result of my work up to the
  present time in this direction has been to add magnesium and barium to
  the material (sodium) to which I referred in my paper in 1866, No. I. of
   the present series      ; and   I no longer regard a spot simply as a cavity, but as
   a place     in which     principally the vapours of sodium, barium, and magne
   sium    (owing to a downrush)            occupy a lower position    than they do ordi
  narily in the photosphere.
       I do not make this assertion merely on the strength           of the lines  observed
   to be thickest      in the spot-spectrum, but also upon the following           observa
   tions on the chromosphere           made on the 21st and 28th ultimo.
       On both      these days the    brilliancy of the F line taught   me that something
   unusual was going on         ; so I swept along   the spectrum to  see  if any materials
   were being injected into the chromosphere.

  352                      Mr.  J. N. Lockyer   on Spectroscopic            [Mar. 18,
      On the 21st     I  caught a trace of magnesium ; but it was late in the day,
  and    I was compelled to cease observing by houses hiding the sun.
      On the 28th      I  was more fortunate.   If anything, the evidences of intense
  action were stronger than on the 21st, and after one glance at the F line           I
  turned at once to the magnesium lines.            I saw them appearing short and
  faint at the base of the chromosphere.           My work on the spots led me to
  imagine that     I  should find sodium-vapour associated with the magnesium ;
  and on turning from b to D I found this to be the case.             I afterwards re
  versed     barium     in the same way.      The spectrum of the chromosphere
  seemed to be      full of lines, and I do not think the three substances I have
  named accounted for all of them.            The observation was one of excessive
  delicacy, as the lines were short and very thin.            The prominence was a
  small one, about twice the usual height of the chromosphere ; but the
  hydrogen lines towered high above those due to the newly injected materials.
  The lines of magnesium extended perhaps one-sixth of the height of the F
  line, barium a little less, and sodium least of all.
      We have, then, the following facts : —
      I. The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed in a
          spot, are thicker than their usual Fraunhofer lines.
      II. The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed in the
          chromosphere, are thinner than their usual Fraunhofer lines.
      A series of experiments bearing upon these observations is now in
 progress at the College of Chemistry, and will form the subject of a commu
 nication from Dr. Frankland and myself.            I may at once, however, remark
 that we have here additional evidence of a fact I asserted in 1 865 on tele
 scopic evidence — the fact, namely, that a spot is the seat of a down rush,
 a downrush to a region, as we now know, where the selective absorption             of
 the upper strata is different from what it would be (and, indeed, is elsewhere)
 at a higher level.
     Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, who brought forward the theory
 of   a downrush about the same time as my observations were made in 1 865,
 at once suggested        as one advantage  of this explanation that all the grada
 tions of darkness, from the facultc to the central umbra, are thus supposed
 to be due to the same cause, namely, the presence to a greater or less extent
of    a relatively cooler absorbing     atmosphere.     This I think is now spectro-
scopically established        ; we have, in fact, two causes for the darkening   of a
spot    : —
     I. The    general absorption of the chromosphere,       thicker here than else
        where, as the spot is a cavity.
     II.   The greater selective absorption of the lower sodium, barium, mag
        nesium stratum, the surface of its last layer being below the ordinary
        level.

periodical elevations and depressions, and that at the epoch of minimum
sun-spot-frequency the plane might be uplifted very high in the solar
atmosphere, so that there was comparatively little cold absorbing atmosphere
above       it,   and therefore great difficulty in forming                      aspot.

paper, its accuracy can fortunately now be tested.  It may happen, how
ever, that in similar periodical fluctuations the chromosphere may be
carried up and down with the photosphere      and   have already evidence

outer limits of stellar atmospheres, and of the same atmosphere at different
epochs. And when other spectra have been studied as we have now studied
hydrogen, additional means of continuing similar researches will be at our

                     Addendum. — Received March           17, 1869.
     Since the foregoing paper was written, I have had, thanks to the some
  what better weather, some favourable opportunities for continuing two of
  the lines of research more especially alluded to in it ; I refer to the method
  I had adopted for viewing the prominences, and         to the injection of sodium,
  magnesium, &c. into the chromosphere.
     With regard to seeing the prominences,       I find that, when the sky is free
                                                                  I
  from haze, the views I obtain of them are so perfect that have not thought
 it worth while to remount the oscillating slit.          I am, however, collecting
 red and green and violet glass, of the required absorptions, to construct a
 rapidly revolving wheel, in which the percentages of light of each colour
 may be regulated.       In this way I think it possible that we may in time be
 able to see the prominences as they really are seen in an eclipse, with the
 additional advantage that we shall be able to see the sun at the same time,
 and test the connexion or otherwise          between     the prominences    and  the
 surface-phenomena.
     Although I find it generally best for sketching-purposes to have the
 open slit in a radial direction, I have lately placed it at a tangent to the
 limb, in order to study the general outline of the chromosphere, which
 in   a previous communication      I  stated   to be pretty uniform, while M.
 Janssen has characterized it as    "u  niveau fort inigal et tourmentd."         My
opinion is now that perhaps        the mean of these two descriptions is, as
usual, nearer the truth, unless the surface changes its character to a large
extent from time to time.        I find, too, that in different parts the outline
varies   : here it is undulating and billowy ; there it is ragged to a degree,
flames, as it were, darting out of the general surface, and forming a ragged,
fleecy, interwoven outline, which in places is nearly even for some distance,
and, like the billowy surface, becomes excessively uneven in the neighbour
hood of a prominence.
    According    to my present limited experience     of these exquisitely beautiful
solar appendages, it is generally possible to see the whole of their structure ;
but sometimes they are of such dimensions along the line of sight that
they appear to be much denser than usual ; and as there is no longer under
these circumstances any background            to the central portion, only the
details of the margins can be observed, in addition to the varying bright
nesses.
    Moreover     it does  not at all follow   that   the largest prominences are
those in which the intensest action, or the most rapid change, is going on,
— the action as visible to us being generally confined to the regions just in,
or above, the chromosphere, the changes arising from violent uprush or
rapid dissipation, the uprush and dissipation representing the birth and
death of a prominence.        As a rule, the attachment to the chromosphere

is narrow and is not often single ; higher up, the stems, so to speak, inter
twine, and the prominence expands and soars upward until it is lost in
delicate filaments, which are carried away in floating masses.
     Since last October, up to the time of trying the method of using the
open slit,     I  had obtained evidence of considerable changes in the pro
minences from day to day.             With the open slit it is at once evident that
changes on the small scale are continually going on ; it was only on the
 14th inst. that    I observed any change at all comparable in magnitude and
rapidity to those already observed by M. Janssen.
     About   9h 45m   on that day, with a tangential slit I observed a fine dense
 prominence      near the sun's equator, on the eastern limb.           I  tried to sketch
 it with the slit in this direction ; but its border was so full of detail, and the
 atmospheric conditions were so unfavourable, that           I  gave up the attempt in
 despair.     I  turned the instrument round 90° and narrowed the slit, and
 my attention was at once taken by the F line ; a single look at it taught
 me that an injection into the chromosphere and intense action were taking
 place.     These phenomena        I  will refer to subsequently.
     At I0h   50m,  when the action was slackening, I opened the slit ; I saw at
 once that the dense appearance had all disappeared, and cloud-like filaments
 had taken its place.       The first sketch, embracing an irregular prominence
 with   a long perfectly straight one, which I called A, was finished at 1 lh 5m,
 the height of the prominence being 1' 5", or about 27,000 miles.                 I left the
  Observatory for a few minutes ; and on returning, at llh 15m, I was as
  tonished to find that part of the prominence A had entirely disappeared ; not
  even the slightest rack appeared in its place : whether it was entirely dis
  sipated, or whether parts of it had been wafted towards the other part, I do
  not know, although I think the latter explanation the more probable
  one, as the other part had increased.
     We now      come   to the other attendant phenomena.             First, as to the F
  line.   In my second paper, under the above title,               I stated that the F
  line widens as the sun is approached, and that sometimes the bright line
  seems to extend on to the sun itself, sometimes on one side of the F line,
  sometimes on the other.
      Dr. Frankland and myself have pointed out,           as a result    of  a long series
  of experiments, that the widening out is due to pressure, and apparently not
  to temperature per se ; the F line near the vacuum-point is thin, and it
  widens out on both sides       (I  do not say to the same extent) as the pressure
  is increased.     Now, in the      absence   of any disturbing cause, it would ap
  pear that when the wider line shows itself on the sun on one side of the
  F line, it should at the same time show itself on the other ; this, however,
  it  does not always do.       I  have   now additional   evidence    to adduce on this
  point, and this time in the prominence line itself, off the sun.              In the pro
  minence to which        I have referred, the      F bright line underwent the most
  strange contortions, as    if there   were some disturbing     cause which varied the
  refrangibility of the hydrogen-line under certain conditions and pressures.

    The D line of hydrogen (?)            also once bore a similar appearance.
    Secondly, as to the other phenomena which accompanied this strange
behaviour of the F line, and were apparently the cause of it.
    In the    same      field   of view with F,       I recognized    the   barium-line   at
1D89-5     of Kirchhoff's       scale.
    Passing on, the magnesium-lines and the enclosed nickel-iron-line were
visible in the chromosphere. The magnesium was projected higher into the
chromosphere than the barium, and the nickel or iron was projected higher
than the magnesium.               I  carefully examined whether the other iron-lines
were visible in the spectrum of the chromosphere ; they were not.
    I also searched for the stronger barium-lines in the brighter portion of
the spectrum        ;  but    I  did not find them, probably owing to the feeble
elevation of the barium-vapour                above the general level of the photo
sphere, which made the observation in this region a very delicate one.
    I detected another chromosphere-line very near the iron-line at 1569-5
(on the east side of it).
    The sodium-lines were also visible.
    Unfortunately clouds prevented my continuing               these interesting   observa
tions ; but the action was evidently toning down.
    Here, then, we have an uprush of
                  Barium,
                  Magnesium,
               ?  Nickel,
                  and an unknown substance
from the photosphere into the chromosphere, and with the uprush a dense
prominence ; accompanying the uprush we have changes of an enormous
magnitude in the prominence ; and as the uprush ceases the prominence
melts away.
    As   stated in the former part          of this paper, the barium- and magnesium-
lines   were     thinner     than the corresponding         Fraunhofer    lines.    In con
 nexion with this subject, I beg to be allowed to state that I have com
 menced a careful comparison of Kirchhoff's map with the recently pub
 lished one of Angstrom.               From what I have already seen, I believe other
 important     conclusions,      in addition to that before alluded to, may be derived
 from this comparison ; but I hesitate to say more at present, as                I have not
 yet been able to compare Angstrom's maps with the sun itself, or to examine
 the angular diameters of the sun registered at Greenwich during the pre
 sent century.
     On the    14 th inst. I also succeeded in detecting the hydrogen -line in          the
 extreme    violet    in the spectrum of the chromosphere.
     The Society then adjourned over the Easter Recess to Thursday, April                8.

         Received May 26, 1868*.
     The distribution of the retinal blood-vessels in this common British Insec-
tivore is so remarkable that I deem it worthy of a separate notice — only
capillaries enter the retina.
     The vasa centralia pierce the optic nerve in the sclerotic canal, and,
passing forwards through the lamina cribrosa, divide, at the bottom of
a relatively large and deep pit in the centre of the intraocular disk of the
nerve, into a variable number of primary branches, from three to six. These
primary divisions quickly subdivide, furnishing many large arteries and
veins, which, radiating on all sides from the nerve-entrance towards the
ora retinae, appear to the observer's unaided eye as strongly projecting
ridges upon the inner surface of the retina.                  When vertical sections
 parallel    to and across the direction of these        ridges are examined with a
 quarter-inch objective, we immediately perceive that the arteries and veins
lie, throughout their entire course, upon the inner surface of the mem-
 brana limitans     interna retinae,  between    this and the membrana hyaloidea
 of the vitreous humour,        and that only capillaries penetrate the retina
 itself.
     In sections of the retina   across the larger vessels the membrana limitans
 may be seen as a clean distinctly unbroken line passing over the divided
 vessels, with which it does not appear to have any direct structural connexion.
 The relation of the hyaloidea to the large vessels seems to be more intimate,
 but its exact nature can be less certainly demonstrated, owing to the ex
 treme tenuity of this membrane.           In my best sections I saw the hyaloidea
 also crossing the large vessels, as does the limitans, but excessively delicate
 extensions of the hyaloidea appeared to me to lose themselves upon the
 vessels.
     The capillaries, shortly after their origin, bend outwards away from the
 large vessels, and, piercing the retina vertically to its stratification in a direc
 tion more or less radial from the centre of the globe, and branching dicho-
 tomously in the granular and inner granule-layers, they form loops, the
 outermost of which reach the intergranule-layer.             As they enter the retina
 the membrana limitans interna is prolonged upon the capillaries in the
  form of a sheath, which is wide and funnel-like at first, but soon em
 braces    the vessels so closely as to become indistinguishable               from their
 proper wall ; so that, notwithstanding the existence of a sheath, there is no
  perivascular space about the retinal capillaries, such as His has described

358             Mr. W. Crookes       on the Measurement       of the
in the brain or spinal cord, and has stated to occur in the retina and else
where.
   In all other mammals, except the hedgehog,        as far as my    present know
ledge extends, the arteries, veins, and capillaries lie in the retina.        In fish,
amphibia, reptiles, and birds, however, as H. Miiller and others (myself
as regards amphibia and reptiles) have shown, the retina is absolutely non
vascular, the absence of proper retinal blood-vessels being compensated for
in fish, amphibia, and some reptiles by the vascular net which in these
animals channels the hyaloidea, and by the highly vascular pecten present
in other reptiles and in birds.     Thus it is possible to divide vertebrates into
two classes, according as their retina is vascular or non-vascular ; and these
classes would be connected by the hedgehog, the larger branches             of whose
vasa centralia  lying upon the membrana limitans in intimate relation with
the hyaloidea, represent the equivalent vessels of the hyaloid system, which
forms so exquisite a microscopic object in the frog ; whilst the capillary
vessels channelling the retinal tissues occupy the same position which they
do  in most mammalia.

" On the Measurement of the Luminous Intensity of Light."                         By
     William Crookes, F.R.S. &c. Received June 27, 1868*.
   The measurement of the intensity of a ray of light is a problem the solu
tion of which has been repeatedly attempted, but with less satisfactory
results than the endeavours to measure the other radiant forces.                 The
problem is susceptible of two divisions
                                              — the absolute and the relative
measurement of light.
   I. Given a luminous beam, we may require to express its intensity
by some absolute term having reference to a standard obtained at some
previous time, and capable of being reproduced with accuracy at any time
and at any part of the globe.          Possibly two such standards would be
necessary, differing greatly in value, so that the space between them might
be subdivided    into a definite number of equal parts ; or the same result
might perhaps be obtained by the well-known device of varying the appa
rent intensity of the standard light by increasing and diminishing its dis
tance from the instrument.
   II.  The standard of comparison, instead of being obtained once for all,
like the zero- and boiling-points of a thermometer, may be compared
separately at each observation ; and the problem then becomes somewhat
simplified into the determination of the relative intensities of two sources
of light.
   The absolute method is of course the most desirable            l but as the pre-
               * Read December  17, 1868: tee Abstract, antea, p. 100.

                          Luminous Intensity      of Light.                   359
  liminary researches and discoveries are yet to be made, before a photometer
  analogous to a thermometer in fixity of standard and facility of observa
  tion could be devised, the realization of an absolute light-measuring method
  appears somewhat distant.       The path to be pursued towards the attain
  ment of this desirable object appears to be indicated in the observations
  which from time to time have been made by M. Becquerel, Sir John
  Herschel, R. Hunt, and others, on the chemical action of the solar rays,
  and the production thereby of a galvanic current, capable of measurement
  on a delicate galvanometer, by appropriate arrangements of chemical baths
  and metallic plates connected with the ends of the galvanometer wires.
     Many so-called photometers have been devised, by which the chemical
 action of the rays at the most refrangible end of the spectrum have been
 measured, and the chemical intensity of light tabulated by appropriate
  methods ; and within the last few years Professors Bunsen and Roscoe
 have contrived a perfect chemical photometer, based upon the action of
 the chemical rays of light on a gaseous mixture of chlorine and hydrogen,
 causing them to combine with formation of hydrochloric acid.
     But the measurement of the chemical action of a beam of light is as
 distinct from photometry proper as is the thermometric registration of the
 heat-rays constituting the other end of the spectrum.           What we want is a
 method of measuring the intensity of those rays which are situated at the
intermediate parts of the spectrum, and produce in the eye the sensation
 of light and colour ; and, as previously suggested, there is a reasonable
 presumption that further researches may place us in possession of a pho
 tometric method based upon the chemical action of the luminous rays of
 light.
     The rays which affect an ordinary photographic sensitive surface are so
 constantly spoken of and thought about as the ultra-violet invisible rays,
 that it is apt to be forgotten that some of the highly luminous rays of light
are capable of exerting chemical action.       Fifteen years ago* the writer was
engaged in some investigations on the chemical action of light, and he suc
ceeded in producing all the ordinary phenomena of photography, even to
the production of good photographs in the camera, by purely luminous
rays of light free from any admixture with the violet and invisible rays.
When the solar spectrum (of sufficient purity to show the principal fixed
lines) is projected for a few seconds on to a sensitive film of iodide of silver,
and the latent image then developed, the action is seen to extend from
about the fixed line G to a considerable distance into the ultra-violet invisible
rays. When the same experiment was repeated with a sensitive surface of
bromide of silver instead of iodide of silver, the result of the development of
the latent image showed that, in this case, the action commenced at about
the fixed line b, and extended, as in the case of the iodide of silver, far
beyond the violet.      A transparent cell, with parallel glass sides one inch
across, was filled with a solution of twenty-five parts of sulphate of quinine
               * The Journal of the Photographic Society, vol. i. p. 98.
                                                                     2   e2

360                 Mr. W. Crookes on the Measurement of the
to one hundred parts of dilute sulphuric acid ; this was placed across the
path of the ray of light, and photographs of the spectrum were again taken
on iodide of silver and on bromide of silver, the arrangements being, in all
cases, identical     with those in the first-cited experiments, with the exception
of the interposition      of the quinine screen. The action of the sulphate of
quinine upon a ray of light is peculiar ; to the eye it scarcely appears to
 have any action at all, but it is absolutely opaque to the ultra-violet, so-
 called chemical rays, and thus limits the photographic action on the bro
 mide and iodide of silver to the purely luminous rays.           On developing the
 latent images, it was now found that the action on iodide of silver was con
 fined to a very narrow line of rays, close to the fixed line G, and in the
 case of bromide of silver, to the space between b and G.           Designating the
 spaces of action by colours instead of fixed lines, it was thus proved that,
 behind a screen of sulphate of quinine, iodide of silver was affected only by
 the luminous rays about the centre of the indigo portion of the spectrum,
 whilst bromide of silver was affected by the green, blue, and some of the
 indigo rays.
      It is very  likely that a continuance of these experiments would lead to
  the construction of a photometer capable of measuring the luminous rays ;
  for although bromide of silver behind quinine is not affected by the red
  or yellow rays, still it is by the green and blue ; and as the proportion of
  red, yellow, green, and blue rays is always invariable in white light (or
  the light would not be white, but coloured), a method of measuring one
  set of the components of white light would give all the information we
  want — just as in an analysis of a definite chemical compound the chemist
  is satisfied with an estimation of one or two constituents only, and calcu
  lates the others.
      Methods based upon the foregoing considerations would supply us with
  what may be termed an absolute photometer, the indication of which would
  be always the same for the same amount of illumination, requiring no
   standard light for comparison ; and pending the development of experi
   ments which the writer is prosecuting in this direction, he has been led
   to devise    a new and, as he believes,      a valuable form of relative photo
   meter.
       A relative photometer is one in which the observer has only to deter
   mine the relative illuminating powers of two sources of light, one of which
   is kept as uniform      as possible, the other being the    light whose intensity
   is to be determined.       It is therefore evident that the great thing to be
   aimed at is an absolutely uniform source of light.          In the ordinary pro
   cess of photometry the standard used is a candle, defined by Act of Par
   liament as a     " sperm-candle of six to the pound, burning at the rate of
    120 grains per hour."       This is the standard from which estimates of the
    value of illuminating gas are deduced; hence the terms " 12-candle gas,"
    " 14-candle gas," &c. In his work on ' Gas Manipulation,' Mr. Sugg
    gives a very good account of the difficulties which stand in the way of

                          Luminous Intensity of Light.                         361
 obtaining   uniform   results with the Act-of-Parliament         candle.    A true
 sperm-candle is made from a mixture of refined sperm with a small pro
 portion of wax, to give it a certain toughness, the pure sperm itself being
 extremely brittle.     The wick is of the best cotton, made up into three
 cords and plaited.      The number of strands in each of the three cords
 composing the wick of a six-to-the-pound candle is seventeen, although Mr.
 Sugg says there does not appear to be any fixed rule, some candles having
 more and others less, according to the quality of the sperm. Sperm-candles
 are made to burn at the rate of one inch per hour, and the cup should be
 clean, smooth, and dry.      The wick should be curved slightly at the top,
 the red tip just showing through the flame, and consuming away without
 requiring snuffing.    To obtain these results, the tightness of the plaiting
and size of the wick require careful attention ; and as the quality of the
 sperm differs in richness or hardness, so must the plaiting and number of
 strands.   A variety of modifying circumstances thus tend to affect the
illuminating power of a standard sperm-candle.            These difficulties, how
ever, are small compared      with those which have resulted from the sub
stitution  of paraffin &c. for part of the sperm ; and Mr. Sugg points out
that candles can be made with such combinations of stearin, wax, or sperm,
and paraffin, as to possess all the characteristics of sperm-candles and yet
 be superior to them in illuminating-power ; while, on the other hand,
candles made from      the same materials otherwise combined are inferior.
When, in addition to this, it is found that candles containing paraffin re
quire wicks more tightly plaited and with fewer strands than those suitable
for the true sperm-candle, our readers will be enabled to judge of the
almost insurmountable       difficulties which beset the present system of
photometry.
    But assuming that the true parliamentary sperm-candle is obtained,
made from the proper materials, and burning at the specified rate, its
illuminating-power     will be found to vary with the temperature of the
place where it has been kept, the time which has elapsed since it was
made, and the temperature of the room wherein the experiment is tried.
    The Rev. W. R. Bowditch, in his work on 'The Analysis, Purification
&c. of Coal-gas,' enters at some length into the question of test-candles,
and emphatically condemns them as light-measurers.                One experiment
quoted by   this  author  showed   that   the same  gas was  reported to be 14-63
or 17'36 candle-gas, according to the way the experiment was conducted.
    The present writer has taken        some   pains to devise a source of light
which should be at the same time fairly uniform in its results, would not
vary by keeping, and would be capable of accurate imitation at any time
and in any part of the world by mere description.           The absence of these
conditions seems to be one of the greatest objections to the sperm-candle.
It  would be impossible for an observer on the continent, ten or twenty
years hence, from a description of the sperm -candle now employed, to
make a standard which would bring his photometric results into relation

362                Mr. W. Crookes     on the Measurement     of the
with those obtained here.        Without presuming to say that he has satis
 factorily solved all difficulties, the writer believes that he has advanced
 some distance in the right direction, and pointed out the road for further
 improvement.
    Before deciding upon a standard light, experiments were made to ascer
 tain whether the electric current could be made available.             Through a
 coil of platinum wire, so as to render it brightly incandescent, a powerful
 galvanic     current was passed, and its strength was kept as constant as
 possible by a thick wire galvanometer and rheostat.               To prevent the
 cooling action of air-currents,    the incandescent coil was surrounded with
 glass  ; and it was hoped that by employing the same kind of battery, and
 by varying the resistance so as to keep the galvanometer-needle at the
 same deflection, uniform results could be obtained.        In practice, however,
it  was found that many things       interfered with the uniformity of the re
 sults, and the light being much feebler than it was advisable to work with,
 this plan was deemed not sufficiently promising, and it was abandoned.
    The method ultimately decided upon is the following : — Alcohol of sp.
 gr. 0-805, and pure benzol boiling at 81° C., are mixed together in the
proportion      of 5 volumes of alcohol and 1 of benzol. This burning fluid
 can be accurately imitated from description at any future time and in any
country ; and if a lamp could be devised equally simple and invariable,
the light which it would yield would, it is presumed, be invariable.            This
difficulty    the writer has attempted  to  overcome  in the following   manner.
    A glass~lamp is taken of about two ounces capacity, the aperture in the
neck being 0-25 inch diameter ; another aperture at the side allows the
liquid fuel to be introduced, and, by a well-known laboratory device, the
Have of the fluid in the lamp can be kept uniform.          The wick-holder con
sists of a platinum tube 1-81 inch long and 0-125 inch internal diameter.
The bottom of this is closed with a flat plug of platinum, apertures being
left in the~*sides to allow free access of spirit. A small platinum cup
0'5 inch diameter and      0-l inch deep is soldered round     the outside   of the
tube 0-5 inch from the top, answering the threefold purpose of keeping
the wick-holder at a proper height in the lamp, preventing evaporation of
the liquid, and keeping out dust.          The wick consists of fifty-two pieces
of hard-drawn platinum wire, each 0"01 inch in diameter and 2 inches
long, perfectly straight, and tightly pushed down into the platinum holder,
until only 0"1 inch projects above the tube. The height of the burning
fluid in the lamp must be sufficient to cover the bottom of the wick-
holder    : it answers best to keep it always   at the uniform    distance  of 1-75
inch from the top of the platinum wick ; a slight variation                of level,
however, has not been found to influence the light to an extent appre
ciable by our present means of photometry.           The lamp with reservoir of
spirit thus arranged, with the platinum wires parallel, and their projecting
ends level, a light is applied, and the flame instantly appears, forming a
perfectly shaped cone 1'25 inch in height, the point of maximum bnl

                         Luminous Intensity of Light.                       363
liancy being 0*56 inch from the top of the wick. The extremity of the
flame is perfectly sharp without any tendency to smoke ; without flicker
or movement of any kind, it burns when protected from currents of air
at a uniform rate of 136 grains of liquid per hour.           The temperature
should be about 60°     F., although moderate variations on either    side exert
no perceptible   influence.    Bearing in mind Dr. Frankland's observations
on the direct increase in the light of a candle with the atmospheric pres
sure, accurate observations ought to be taken only at one height of the
barometer.     To avoid the inconvenience and delay which this would occa
sion, a table of corrections should be constructed for each 0-  1 inch variation
of barometric pressure.
   There is no doubt that this flame is very much more uniform than that
of the sperm-candle sold for photometric purposes.            Tested against a
candle, considerable variations in relative illuminating-power       have been
observed ; but on placing two of these lamps in opposition, no such vari
ations have been detected. The same candles have been used, and the
experiments have been repeated at wide intervals, using all customary pre
cautions to ensure uniformity. The results are thus shown to be due to
variations in the candle, and not in the lamp.
   It is expected that whoever may be inclined      to adopt the kind of lamp
here suggested will find not only that its uniformity may be relied upon,
but that, by following accurately the description and dimensions here laid
down, each observer will possess a lamp of equivalent and convertible
photometric value ; so that results may not only be strictly comparable
between    themselves, but, within slight limits of accuracy, comparable with
those obtained by other experimentalists.     The dimensions of wick &c. here
laid down are not intended to fix the standard.       Persons engaged in pho
tometry as an important branch of their regular occupation will be better
able to fix these data than the writer, by whom photometry is only occa
sionally pursued as a means of scientific research. Already many improve
ments suggest themselves, and several causes of variation in the light have
been noticed.     Future experiments may point out how these sources of
error are to be overcome ; but at present there is no necessity to refine our
source of standard light to a greater degree of accuracy than the photo
metric instrument admits of.
   The instrument for measuring the relative intensities of the standard
and other lights next demands attention.        The contrivances in ordinary
use are well known.       Most of them depend on the law in optics, that the
amount of light which falls upon a given surface varies inversely with the
square of the distance between the source of light and the object illumi
nated. The simplest observation which can be taken is made by placing
two sources of light (say, a candle and gas-lamp) opposite a white screen a
few feet off, and placing a stick in front of them, so that two shadows of
the stick may fall on the screen. The strongest light will cast the strongest
shadow   ;  and by moving this light away from the stick, keeping the sha

(lows side by side, a position will at last be found at which the two shadows
appear of equal strength.      By measuring the distance of each light from
the screen and squaring             it,
                              the product will give the relative intensities                              of
the two sources of light.
   In practice this plan   not sufficiently accurate to be used except for
                                    is
the roughest approximations    and from time to time several ingenious

generally used, the lights shine on opposite sides of   disk of white paper,

intensity are placed on opposite sides of      piece of paper so prepared,

as to equalize the intensity, the whole surface of the paper will appear
uniformly illuminated on both  sides. This photometer has been modified
 bymany observers.    By some the disk of paper     moved, the lights re

   In   1833   Arago described    photometer in which the phenomena of
                                            a
polarized light were employed.      This instrument    fully described, with
                                                                        is

                                                                        is

                                            is
cosines, according to which polarized rays pass from the ordinary to the
extraordinary image.    The knowledge of this law, he says, will not only
prove theoretically important, but will further lead to the solution of a
great number of very important astronomical questions.     Suppose, for ex
ample, that    it wished
                    is   to compare the luminous  intensity of that portion
of the moon directly illuminated by the solar rays, with that of the part
which receives only light reflected from the earth, called the partie cendree.
Were the law in question known, the way to proceed would be as follows —                              :
After having polarized the moon's light, pass     through    doubly refracting
                                                                 it             a
crystal, so disposed that the rays, not being able to bifurcate, may entirely
undergo ordinary refraction.     A lens placed behind this crystal will there
fore show but one image of our satellite       but as the crystal, in rotating
                                                            ;
on its axis, passes from its original position, the second image will appear,
and its intensity         will go on augmenting.                 The movement of the crystal

must   be arrested at the moment when, in this growing extraordinary
image, the segment corresponding to the part of the moon illuminated by
the sun exhibits the intensity of the ashy part shown by the ordinary
image.    From these data it is easy to perceive, he says, that the problem
is capable of solution.
   In another part of the same volume, after speaking of the polariscope
which goes by his name, Arago writes: —                            "I
                                                  have now arrived at the
general principle upon which my photometric method is entirely founded.
The quantity (I do not  say the proportion) — the quantity of completely
polarized light which forms part of a beam partially polarized by reflection,
and the quantity of light polarized rectangularly which is contained in the
beam transmitted under the same angle, are exactly equal to each other.
The reflected        beam, and the beam transmittedunder the same angle by a
sheet of parallel glass, have in general very dissimilar intensities ;     how                  if,
ever, we examine with       doubly refracting crystal
                                    a                  first the  reflected and
then the transmitted beam, the greatest difference of intensity between the
ordinary and the extraordinary images will                               in the two cases,
                                                                   be the same
because this difference            is    precisely equal to the quantity of polarized light
which       is   mixed with the common                  light."
    In Arago's 'Astronomy,' the author again                       describes his photometer in the
following words —
                     " have constructed an
                         :     I                                   apparatus by means of which,

tenuating its intensity by degrees exactly calculable after    law which             a                   I
have demonstrated."     It difficult to obtain an exact idea of this instru
                                         is

to be exceedingly complicated and to be different in
principle and construction from the one now about to

D nor C should contain any polarized light, but that the light coming from
them, represented on each disk by the two lines at right angles to each
other, forming a cross, should be entirely unpolarized.) Let H represent a
double refracting achromatic prism of Iceland spar ; this will resolve the
disk D into two disks d and d\ polarized in opposite directions ; the plane
of d being, we will assume, vertical, and that of d' horizontal. The prism
H will likewise give two images of the disk C ; the image c being polarized
horizontally,and c' vertically. The size of the disks D, C, and the sepa
rating power of the prism H, are to be so arranged that the vertically
polarized image d, and the horizontally polarized image c, exactly overlap
each   other, forming, as shown in the figure, one compound disk c d, built
up  of  half the light from D and half that from C.
   The measure of the amount of free polarization present in the disk c d
will give the relative photometric intensities of D and C.

equal.   They  will  each  be divided by H  into two   disks d'                d    and   e    c*,   and

 surface D B may be illuminated (as in fig. 2) by the candle, and the other
 surface B C by the lamp.           If the eyepiece A is removed, the observer,
looking down the tube G B, will see at the end a luminous white disk
 divided vertically into two parts, one half being illuminated by the candle

 parts.    At L is   a lens to collect the rays from    D B C
 (fig. 2), and throw the image into the proper part
  of the tube. At M is another lens so adjusted as
 to give a sharp image of the two disks into which
 I  is divided by the prism       K.    The part N is an
 adaptation of Arago's polarimeter ; it consists of a
 series of thin plates of glass capable of moving
 round the axis of the tube, and furnished with a
 pointer and graduated arc (shown at A G, fig. 2).
 By means of this pile it is possible to partially
 polarize the rays coming from the illuminated disks
 in one or the other direction, and thus bring to the
neutral state the partially polarized beam c d(&g. 1),
 so as to get the images g,      r free from colour.      It  is
 so adjusted that when at the zere-point it produces an
equal effect on both disks.
     The action of the instrument        is as follows.    The
standard lamp being placed on one of the supporting pillars which slide along
the graduated stem (fig. 2), it is adjusted to the proper height, and moved

along the bar to a convenient distance, depending on the intensity of the
light to be measured : the whole length being a little over 4 feet, each light
can be placed at a distance of 24 inches from the disk.    The flame is then
sheltered from currents of air by black screens placed round, and the light to
be compared is fixed in a similar way on the other side of the instrument.
The whole should            be placed in a dark room, or surrounded with non-
reflecting screens     ;   and the eye must also be protected from the direct rays
of the two lights.          On looking through the eyepiece two bright disks will
be seen, probably      of different colours.            Supposing F represents the standard

convenient not to attempt to get absolute equality in this manner, but to
move the flame to the nearest                inch on      one   of equality.

meter one way or the other up to 45°, until the images are seen without
any trace of colour.   This will be found more accurate than the plan of
relying entirely on the alteration of the distance of the flame along the
scale l and by series of experimental adjustments the value of every angle

through which the bundle of plates      rotated can be ascertained once for
                                                   is
all, when the future calculations will present no difficulty. Squaring the
number of inches between the flames and the centre will give their ap
proximate ratios   and the number of degrees the eyepiece rotates will give
                   ;
the number to be added or subtracted in order to obtain the necessary
accuracy.
  The delicacy of the instrument                is   very great.   With two lamps, each
about 24 inches from the centre,              it   is easy to distinguish  movement of     a
one  of them to the extent of 0'l inch to or fro and       using the polari-
                                                                      ;              by
meter an accuracy considerably exceeding this can be attained.
   The employment of        photometer of this kind enables us to compare
                              a
lights of different colours with one another, and leads to the solution of                                       a
problem which, from the nature of their construction, would be beyond
the powers of the instruments in general use.    So long as the observer,
by the eye alone, has to compare the relative intensities of tint-surfaces,
respectively illuminated          by
                           the lights under trial,     evident that, unlessit   is
they are of the same tint,      impossible to obtain that equality of illu
                                   it   is
mination in the instrument which      requisite for
                                                is   comparison.    By the a
unaided eye one cannot tell which      the brighter half of
                                                   is          paper disk,                      a
illuminated on one side with      reddish, and on the other with
                                        a                          yellowish                    a
light ; but  by  using the above-described  photometer  the problem becomes
practicable.    For instance, on reference to fig.  suppose the disk  1,were                                 D
illuminated with light of         a    reddish colour, and the disk                       C   with greenish

light, the polarized disks d', d would be reddish and the disks e, c' greenish,
the central disk e d being of the tint formed by the union of the two
shades.    The analyzing prism K, and the selenite disk I, will detect free
polarization in the disk c d, if it be coloured, as readily as if it were white ;
the only difference being that the two disks of light, g, r, cannot be brought
to a uniform white colour when the lights from D and C are equal in
intensity, but will assume a tint similar to that of c d.       When the con
trasts of colour between D and C are very strong — when, for instance, one
is bright   green and the other scarlet — there is somedifficulty in estimating
the exact point of neutrality ; but this only diminishes the accuracy of the
comparison, and does not render it impossible, as it would be according to
other systems.
   No attempt has been made in these experiments to ascertain the exact
value of the standard spirit-flame in terms of the Parliamentary sperm-
candle.  Difficulty was experienced in getting two lots of candles yielding
light of equal intensities ; and when their flames were compared between
themselves and with the spirit-flame, variations of as much as 1 0 per cent,
were sometimes observed in the light they gave.     Two standard spirit-
flames, on the other hand, seldom showed a variation of 1 per cent., and
had they been more carefully made they would not have varied 0- 1 per
cent.
   This plan of photometry is capable of far more accuracy than the pre
sent instrument    will give.  It can scarcely be expected that the first
instrument    of the kind, made by an amateur workman, should possess
equal sensitiveness with one in which all the parts have been skilfully made
with special adaptation to the end in view.
  Addendum       to description    of Photometer.    By W. Crookes, F.R.S.
                         Received December 17, 1868.
   When     I
           wrote that other experimentalists had already made use of the
phenomena of polarized light for measuring the intensity of light, I was
not aware that a photometer already existed in which the principle of the
one above described was adopted.
   By the kindness of Sir Charles Wheatstone          I
                                                  have, within the last few
days, been enabled to experiment with a photometer devised by M. Jamin,
founded on the same principle.      I have not yet succeeded in finding a
printed account of this instrument, but a written one was supplied with           it,
and having been allowed to take       to pieces its construction
                                     it                             evident.
                                                                      is
   It consists, first, of Nicol's prism, then of an achromatized doubly
                          a
refracting prism   ; next, of two plates of quartz, cut oblique to the axis,
reversed, and superposed    ; and finally, at the eye-end, of    second Nicol's
                                                                  a
prism.      As in my instrument,    each   of the two lights to   be compared   split

 into two images     ; the ordinary ray from one is superposed on the extra
 ordinary ray    from   the other, and the compound beam so produced is ex
 amined further.       The means adopted to effect the desired object are,
 however, very different, being much simpler in my method, whilst the re
 sults are superior.
     In Jamin's photometer the light which eventually         reaches  the eye  is
 comparatively feeble, and the field of view is very restricted ; the objects
 themselves under comparison are seen direct through the instrument with
out the interposition of a telescopic arrangement, and no means are taken
to prevent extraneous light from entering.         The deficiency of light makes
observations by artificial light difficult, whilst when examining objects
illuminated by diffused or direct sunlight the eye is fatigued and bewildered
by the variations of shape, size, and colour assumed by the overlapping
objects seen through the instrument.         In the photometer described in the
former part of this paper, there is abundance of light, and the observation
is made upon two luminous disks, which are magnified by means of a lens,
so as to appear close to the eye.       It will be found  much easier to detect
differences of colour between these two adjacent disks than to observe the
presence or absence of the coloured fringes in the central portion of the
field of Jamin's photometer.        In the former case the eye has nothing to
observe     but two uniform and purely coloured disks, changing from red-
green    to  green-red through an intermediate stage of neutrality ; in the
latter case the eye has to detect the stage of neutrality in the central por
tion of the field, where the two images under comparison overlap, the at
tention being distracted, and the sensitiveness of the eye weakened, by the
brilliantly coloured fringes which cross the adjacent objects.
    A  direct comparison of the two instruments for sensitiveness shows that
the present photometer will detect much more minute differences of in
tensity than Jamin's will, whilst it will work with tolerable accuracy in a
light too feeble to give any results with the latter instrument.

and Anthophyllite, homceomorphous with the oblique Augites and Horn

sibly    is tridymite.     In bulk it forms about a third part of the mixed
crystalline    mass.
    The crystals     are very imperfect, and are twinned          :  but there   are two
cleavages parallel to the planes of a prism of about 119° ; and, on looking
through a plane that is perpendicular to this zone, it is seen that the
crystal is biaxial.      The normal to this plane is parallel to the second mean
line, the optical character being negative.
    A section made for examination in the microscope showed two small
crystals in which light traverses the section with equal brilliancy during
its rotation between crossed Nicol prisms.             This, and possibly a similar
case recorded by Vom Rath, seems to result from the section being cut
parallel to a composite portion of the crystal.
    The analysis of the mineral       gave, by distillation of the silica as silicic
difluoride, and subsequent determination as potassic fluosilicate, 97-43 per

    A   second analysis gave 99-21 per cent, silica, 0-79 of residue.
     Its specific gravity, as determined from a very small amount of the mi
 neral picked      under    the microscope, was 2-18       ; a   second determination
 made     on a larger amount gave the value 2-245.                That of tridymite is
 2-295 to 2-3.       This may be taken as evidence that the mineral is not
 quartz, the specific gravity of which is 2-65.              Vom Rath's experiments
 were made on a rather less pure form of tridymite.
    There can be no doubt from these results, further details of which shall
 be shortly laid before the Society, that this mineral is silica in the form of
 its allotropic condition and lower density.        It may possibly be the mineral
 to which Vom Rath has given the name of Tridymite ; the crystalline
 system, however, of Tridymite, as given by Vom Bath, does not accord with
 the above facts.

         Schorlemmer.            Communicated by Prof. Stokes, Sec. R.S
        Received March 5, 1869.
    At the time when          I  commenced this investigation, the existence of
 normal propyl       alcohol   was  very doubtful.     According to Chancel*, this
 body is found in the fusel-oil from the marc of grapes ; but Mendelegefff
 tried in vain to isolate it from a sample of this oil which he had obtained

   from Chancel himself.             Several attempts to prepare the normal alcohol
   by synthesis failed. Thus Linnemann and Siersch* tried to obtain it by
   converting acetonitril into propylamine, by means of hydrogen in the
   nascent state, and decomposing the hydrochlorate of this base with silver
   nitrite ; but the alcohol thus formed was found to be the secondary one.
   The same compound was obtained by Butlerow and Ossokint, by acting
                                                    H

   place iodine by methyl.           Now as in both cases, according to theory, the
  normal or primary alcohol ought to have been formed, and as we have
   no explanation why instead of this compound the secondary alcohol was
  obtained,    Butlerow     and Ossokin         believe      that the normal propyl-alcohol
  cannot exist.      Not agreeing with this view, I was led to an investigation
  of this subject, the results of which              I    have the honour to lay before the
  Society.
      My reasoning    was as follows       : — It   appears, as the most probable theory,
  and which is now accepted by most chemists, that the four combining
  powers of the carbon atom have the same value.                          If so, only one hydro
  carbon having the composition Ca Ha can exist.                         This propane must be
  formed by replacing the iodine in the secondary propyl iodide, by hydro
  gen, and subjecting the hydrocarbon thus obtained to the action of chlo
 rine, by which primary propyl chloride must be formed in accordance with
 the behaviour of other hydrocarbons of the same series.
      I soon found that my theory was correct                  ; and in a short note, which      I
 published     in ' Zeitschrift fur Chemie'              (1868, p. 49),      I  stated that I had
 obtained the normal propyl alcohol by this method.                           At the same time,
 Fittig proved      that   it   was   contained     in     fusel-oilst,   and   lately Linnemann
 prepared it synthetically from ethyl-compounds by converting acetonitrile
 (ethyl cyanide) into propionic anhydride, and acting upon this body with
 nascent hydrogen§.
     The propane which           I  used  in my        researches       was   obtained by acting
 upon isopropyl iodide with zinc turnings                     and diluted hydrochloric acid.
 A continous evolution of gas takes place if the flask containing the mix
 ture is kept cold.       If   it is not cooled down a violent reaction soon sets in.
The     gas always contains vapour           of the iodide,       even    if it  has been evolved
very slowly.       In order to purify it           as much        as possible,      it was washed
with Nordhausen         sulphuric acid, with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric
acids and with caustic soda solution.
     As a gas-holder     I   used a tubulated bell-jar, which was suspended in a
larger    inverted   one,    filled   with a concentrated solution of common salt.
When      a sufficient quantity       of gas had collected, chlorine was passed into

tion-products were formed, which collected          as an oily layer on the salt

apparatus, until        was nearly filled with the excess of propane and

ture.   To collect the liquid chlorides which were contained in the gas
holder,      the tubulus     of the bell-jar was closed with cork,                         which      was
provided with      wide short glass tube, open at both ends, and so much
                    a
salt solution put into the gas-holder that the chlorides entered this tube,
from which they could easily be removed with        pipette.  By repeatinga
this process several times,  quantity of chlorine compounds, sufficient for
                                     a
further investigation,        was obtained.               This    was      washed with water, dried
over caustic potash, and distilled. The liquid commenced to boil at42°C,
the boiling-point rising towards the end above 200° C.        By fractional
distillation, comparatively
                a            small  quantity of  liquid was obtained,awhich
boiled at 42°-46°, and consisted of the primary propyl chloride,    H7 CI.                     C,

   In order to prove that this body was really the normal chloride,      had                     it
to be converted into the alcohol.     For this purpose      used that portion   I
of the chlorides which, after repeated distillation, boiled below 80° C.                                  It
was       heated in sealed tubes with potassium acetate and glacial acetic acid
for several      hours to 200° C., and thus converted into the acetate,   light                  a
colourless liquid, possessing the characteristic odour of the acetic ethers.
I  did not endeavour to obtain this ether in the pure state, as this could
have been effected only with great loss of material, but converted     at                            it
once into the alcohol, by heating     with diluted solution of potash, in

sealed tubes, up to 120° C.     After cooling, the contents of the tubes
were distilled       and rectified.        A     portion     of      it   was   oxidized with    a    cold
diluted solution of chromic acid.                    No
                                      gas was evolved, but  strong smell              a
of aldehyde was perceived, which disappeared on adding more chromic
acid.  On distilling to dryness, an acid liquid was obtained, which was
neutralized with sodium carbonate.         The solution was evaporated to dry
ness, and the residue distilled with quantity of sulphuric acid, sufficient to
                                                 a
liberate about one-fourth of the acid.      The residue in the retort was again
distilled with the same quantity of sulphuric acid, and,          repeating this     by
process,  the acid  was  obtained   in four fractions.  Each  of these was con
verted into the silver-salt          by
                                boiling with silver carbonate. The silver-salts
 crystallized from the hot saturated solution in small shining needles, which
 were grouped in stars and feathers.    These were dried, first, over sulphuric
 acid, afterwards in the steam-bath, and the silver determined by ignition.

 I also prepared the lead-salt,       which exhibited the properties of lead-pro-
pionate ; it did not crystallize, but dried up to an amorphous gum-like
 mass.    As by oxidation no other acid besides propionic was found, it
follows that the alcoholic liquid could only contain normal propyl alcohol.
 I  tried to isolate this body from the remaining liquid, by adding potas
 sium carbonate until it separated into two layers.             The upper one was
taken off and dried, first over fused potassium carbonate, and afterwards
over anhydrous baryta.         This liquid, however, proved to be a mixture j it
began to boil at 80° C., and the boiling-point rose slowly to 96° C.                  By
fractionating it could be separated into two portions — a smaller one boiling
 between    80°-85°,    and a larger one boiling above 90°.               The portion
boiling between      92°-96°    gave, by combustion,    numbers agreeing with the

    I have not yet studied the properties of this alcohol, as                I hope to

    The liquid boiling between 80°-85° appears to be an acetal               ; it is not
acted upon by sodium, and therefore can easily be obtained free from alcohol,
by distilling it over this metal.       The small quantity was just sufficient for

readily decomposed, a high boiling acetate being formed, which, on heat

subjecting the hydrocarbons thus obtained to the action of chlorine, by
which the primary chlorides are formed.
   Of greater interest, perhaps, as possessing an important bearing on the
theory of substitution,     the fact that the second substitution-product
                                 is                                       of

—      CI.   This was the less to be expected, as ethane,     H„, the hydro             Ca
     CHa
carbon next lower in the series, yields, by acting on with chlorine as             it
second product, ethylidene dichloride, CHa— CH Cla. Whilst, therefore, in
propane first one hydrogen atom in the methyl group       replaced by                    is
chlorine, and afterwards one which combined with the adjoining carbon
                                                      is
atom, in ethane the substitution                  takes place at one and the same carbon
atom.         The action of chlorine upon propane    certainly in contradiction

   After a description of certain instruments, now employed for the first
time in researches of this kind, the topics inquired into successively are : —
the electrical phenomena which belong to nerve and muscle in a state of
rest ; the electrical phenomena which mark the passing of nerve and
muscle from the state of rest into that of action         ;   the motor phenomena
ascribed to the action of the      " inverse "   and   " direct

and electrotonus.
    I. On certain Instruments now employedfor           the first time in Researches
                             in Animal Electricity.
   The instruments here referred to and described are SirWm. Thomson's
 Reflecting Galvanometer, Mr. Latimer Clarke's Potentiometer, and some
new electrodes devised by the author.
   Sir Wm. Thomson's        Reflecting Galvanometer, which is the principal
galvanometer      made use  of, is stated to be more manageable than the old
galvanometer of Prof. Du Bois Reymond, and not less sensitive.
    Mr. Latimer Clarke's " Potentiometer,"         which is really a very ingenious
 adaptation of the idea upon which the Wheatstone's Bridge is based, is the
instrument employed for the measurement of tension.               It is so delicate as
to measure with certainty the     -j^j part   of the tension of    a Daniell's cell.
   The new electrodes     are  simply pieces    of platinum      wire, flattened and
pointed at the free ends, and having         these  free ends    freshly tipped with
sculptor's    clay at the time of an experiment.             The necessary homo
geneity   of  the two is secured by pushing the clay a little further on
one of the wires, or by pulling it a little further off ; for by a simple
manipulation of this kind it is found that the clay tips of the two elec
trodes may be so adjusted as to allow them to be brought together
without the development of the slightest current.                After a very little
practice it is found, indeed, that in a very few moments the two electrodes
may be made perfectly homogeneous by thus covering or uncovering one
of them. And, further, it is found that the secondary polarization arising
from the passage of a current may be got rid of at once by simply bringing
the clay tips of the two electrodes together so as exclude the polarizing
current from the circuit of the galvanometer, and by leaving them in this
position for a moment or two — by short-circuiting the galvanometer, that
is to say, for a very brief period.    It is found, in short, that these electrodes
are infinitely more manageable, and not less effectual, than the electrodes
commonly in use, in which enter zinc troughs filled with saturated solution
of zinc, and pads of blotting-paper, the pads being kept sodden with this

 solution    by having one of their ends dipping into it — electrodes which,
 to say the least, are not easily put in order or kept in order.
     II.   On the Electrical Phenomena         which   belong to Living Nerve and
                          Muscle during the state of rest.
    Living nerve and muscle supply currents to the galvanometer (the
 nerve-current, and the muscular current, so called) which are not supplied
 by dead nerve and muscle.          These currents, when the tissues supplying
 them are fresh and at rest, show that the surface composed of the sides of
 the fibres, and the surface composed of the ends of the fibres, are in op
 posite electrical conditions, the former surface being positive, the latter
 negative. These currents, when the tissues supplying them are about to
 die, and, in some      cases, when they are     put in action,   are wholly or par
 tially  reversed — are  so changed   in direction,  that is to say, as to show that
 there is at this time a total or partial reversal in the electrical relations
of the ends and sides of the fibres. The fact of a partial reversal, in
 which the fibres may be positive in some part of their sides and negative
in others, or positive at     one of their ends and negative at the other, is now
pointed out for the first time.
    Nerve and muscle, and the animal tissues generally, oppose a very high
resistance to the passage of a common voltaic current — so high, indeed, as
to justify the inference that muscles and nerves may be looked upon as
non-conductors rather than as conductors.              The resistance in an inch of
the sciatic nerve of a frog, for example, is about 40,000             B.A. units, or
nearly seven times that of the whole Atlantic Cable.
    The    mean tension   of the nerve-current and the muscular current proves
to be about half that of a Daniell's cell.         Moreover, negative and positive
electricity, in equal amounts, are both found to be present. The case is
not one in which only one kind of electricity is present, — in which what
appears to be negative is only a lower degree of positive, or vice versd ; it
is one in which two electricities are present, one above the zero of the
earth, the other below it — one as much above the zero of the earth as the
other is below it. These facts are made out by means of the potentiometer.
    Looking at these facts, and especially at the comparative non-conducti-
bility of nerve and muscle, wholly or in part, and at the presence in these
tissues of positive and negative electricity in equal quantities, it is thought
probable —
    That the comparative non-conductibility of nerve and muscle may allow
certain parts of these tissues to act as dielectrics rather than as conductors,
and that these parts may be the sheaths of the fibres.
    That the development of one kind of electricity (by oxygenation, or in
some other way) on the exterior of the sheaths of the nerve and muscular
fibres may lead, by induction, to the development of the other kind of
electricity on the interior of these sheaths.

    1869.]     Dr. C. B. Radcliffe's Researches in Animal Electricity.        37'J
       That the exterior and interior of the sheaths of the fibres in nerve and
    muscle may be in opposite electrical conditions, because the sheath plays
   the part of a dielectric.
       That the surface composed of the ends of the fibres in nerve and muscle
   may be in an electrical condition opposed to that of the surface composed
   of the sides of these fibres, because there may be a communication at the
   ends of the fibres with the interior of the sheaths of the fibres.
      That the nerve-current and muscular current may be no more than
   accidental phenomena, depending upon the mere fact of the positive ex
   terior and the negative interior of the nerve and muscular fibre being con
   nected   by a conductor.
      That the fundamental electrical condition of nerve and muscle during
   rest may be, not one of currents ever circulating in closed circuits around
  peripolar molecules, of which currents the nerve-current and the mus
   cular current are only derived portions, but one of tension — a condition,
   not current in any sense, but static — a state which, as long as it lasts,
   must tend to keep the molecules acted upon in a state of mutual re
   pulsion.
      III.  On the Electrical Phenomena which mark the passing of Nerve
               and Musclefrom the state of Rest into that of Action.
      The fact of  " induced contraction" so called, together with the analogies
  existing between the muscles and the electric organ of the torpedo as
  to the relation to the nervous system and the manner of acting in
  more cases than one, are cited as reasons for believing, with Matteucci,
  that a discharge, analogous to that of the torpedo, marks the passage of
  both muscle and nerve from the state of rest into that of action.
      And, further,   the fact, well established   by Prof. Du Bois Reymond,
  that the nerve-current     and the muscular     current are both alike greatly
  weakened when the nerve       or muscle passes from the state of rest into
  that of action, is cited as corroborative   evidence in support of Matteucci's
 conclusion   —  as demonstrating, in short, the actual disappearance of elec
 tricity in the very cases in which Matteucci, from analogy solely, infers the
 existence of discharge.
     Again, the conclusion arrived at as to the electrical condition of muscle
 and nerve during the state of rest, is looked upon as another argument to
 the same effect ; for if it be true that this condition is one, not of current,
 but of charge, then there is a substantial ground for supposing that the
 passing of nerve and muscle from the state of rest into that of action may
 be marked by discharge.
     In  a word, the more the evidence     is considered the more it seems to
justify this conclusion, — that   the passing of nerve and muscle from the state
of rest into that of action is marked by a discharge of electricity analogous
 to that of the torpodo.

   in the other, it is found that the closing and opening of the circuit may or
   may not be attended by contraction, and that the presence or absence of
   contraction may or may not obey a similar rule in the two limbs.         The
   facts admit of being arranged in three stages, thus                      :   —

tion of the poles.         strong battery.
      In seeking to account for these facts, the "direct" and "inverse" cur
    rents are not the only agencies which have to be taken into consideration.
    If the limbs were perfectly sufficient conductors, the sole agencies at work
    might be these currents ; but instead of being very good conductors, the
    limbs are, in fact, non-conductors rather than conductors, opposing a re
    sistance      to the current   of about 40,000 B.A. units (a resistance nearly
    seven       times that of the whole Atlantic Cable) ; and the result of closing the
    circuit with them is this — that each limb is found to be charged with the
    free electricity which is present at the poles when the circuit is open, and
    which would be entirely discharged                   if the   place   of the limbs were supplied
    by a perfectly sufficient conductor.    The case is one in which, in accord
    ance with the investigations of Mr. Latimer Clarke on the tension of the
    voltaic circuit, each limb is found to participate in the charge of the pole
    nearest to       it,
                    the charge being positive in the limb in which the current                                  is
    inverse, and negative in the limb in which the current  direct, the tension      is
    of the charge in each limb diminishing regularly from the pole where                                 it     is
    highest, to some point midway between the poles, where        at zero   the           it   is      ;

1869.]      Dr. C. B. Radcliffe's Researches in Animal Electricity.           381
case is one  in which, supposing the value of the tension at each of the poles
to be 10, the state as to tension at different points between the poles is
found to be that which       is indicated by the figures in the accompanying
sketch : —
                                       Fig.   I.
   This, then, being the state of the limbs as to tension under these circum
stances,  it is plain that there must be definite changes in tension at the
closing and opening of the circuit.        It is plain that the limbs must be tra
versed by a discharge at the moment of closing the circuit ; for the charge
of the poles must diminish in direct proportion to the freedom with which
the current passes.      It is plain also that the opposite electricities which
are accumulated in the limbs while the circuit is closed must be discharged
when the circuit is opened.         It is possible also that the discharge at the
opening of the circuit may be less in amount than that which occurs at the
closing of the circuit ; for immediately after the opening both the limbs may
be supposed to receive a charge from the pole with which they happen to
remain in connexion, which charge will to some degree counteract the dis
charge.
   How then    ?   Is it possible that  these changes   of tension may have to do
with the motor phenomena which are           ascribed to the action of the direct
and inverse currents 1
   That the changes of tension in question are of themselves sufficient to
tell upon the muscles in the requisite manner is proved by a new and very
curious experiment.       The two hind legs of a frog, prepared and arranged
as in the experiment for exhibiting the action of the inverse and direct
currents, are connected, time after time, first with one pole of the battery
and then with the other, but never with the two poles at once. The result,
for a time at least, is contraction in one or both of the limbs when they are
thus carried from one pole to the other.          There is a succession of charges
and discharges   ;   for before  a charge can be received from either pole this
charge must neutralize the charge carried away from the other pole.           The
contraction must have to do with changes of tension, and with changes of
tension only ; for the circuit remains open from the beginning to the end of

 382      Dr. C. B. Radcliffe's Researches in Animal Electricity.             [Apr. 8,
 the experiment.        The case, indeed, appears to be not remotely analogous
 to that in which the prepared limbs of a frog are made to hang from the
 prime conductor of an electrical machine, and then charged and discharged
 alternately ; for here the rule as to contraction is the same, namely this, —
 that the limbs contract, not when they receive or while they retain the
 charge, but at the moment of discharge.
    That the changes of tension in question do actually affect the limbs as
 they are found to be affected under the action of the inverse and direct
 current appears to gain in probability      as the matter is more     fully inquired
 into.
    There is no difficulty in referring to changes of tension the phenomena
 belonging to the first stage (vide Table).      If  the closing and opening of the
 circuit be attended by discharge, and      if contraction   be coincident, not with
 charge but with discharge, the presence of contraction in both limbs at the
 moments of opening and closing the circuit is in accordance with rule ; and
 if the discharge at the opening of the circuit be weaker than that which
 happens at the closing, it is easy to see that with a weak battery the
 stronger discharge at the moment of closing the circuit may be strong
 enough to tell upon the muscles when the weaker discharge at the opening
 of the circuit is not strong enough to do so. Indeed it is plain that the ab
sence of contraction at the opening of the circuit in the case where a weak
 battery is used is merely a matter of wanting battery power, for the missing
contraction is made to appear by simply supplying this want.
    Nor is there any difficulty in applying the same key to the explanation
of the phenomena belonging to the second stage (vide Table).
    It  is a fact that the power of contracting is affected very differently in
 the two limbs by the action of the electricity.            The limb in which the
current    is direct  loses this  power  much    more   speedily than it does when
left to itself   ; the limb in which   the current is inverse retains this power
much longer than it does when left to itself ; the limb in which a direct
current has been passed until the power of contracting is at an end re
covers this     power, and this, too, more than once, if the direction of the
current be changed for a time.           Of these facts — the impairment of the
power of contracting in the limb in which the current is direct, the pre
servation and restoration of this power in the limb in which the current is
inverse — there can be no question.
    There is also reason to believe that there are electrical differences in the
two limbs which will, in some degree at least, account for the differences
in the power of contracting, and for other differences which have yet to be
considered.
    The conclusion already arrived       at respecting the natural      electricity of
nerve and muscle is that the state during rest is one of charge — that, ordi
narily at least, the sheaths of the fibres are charged positively at their
exterior and negatively at their interior.          The resistance of the animal
tissues to electrical conducion, it is assumed, is sufficient to keep the two

1869.]       Dr. C. B. Radcliffe's Researches in Animal Electricity.          383
opposite electricities apart — an assumption,     be it remarked, which is not   a
little   borne out by the fact that the resistance which      the voltaic current
encounters in the hind limbs of a frog when its course is up one limb and
down the other (vide fig. 1) is sufficient to keep the two limbs in opposite
electrical conditions as regards charge. In short, the natural electrical
condition of nerve and muscle during rest may be assumed to be one in
 which the exterior of the sheath of the fibre is positive and the interior
 negative — a state of charge which, taking 5 as the value of the tension, and
 viewing the sheath in longitudinal section from within, may be figured thus : —
                                      Fig. 2.
                                        ± S
    The electrical condition of the fibres of the nerves and muscles of the
 limb in which the current is direct may be assumed to be one in which the
 exteriors of the sheaths are charged negatively from the negative pole, and
 the interiors positively by induction — a state in which the disposition of
 the two electricities forming the charge is the reverse of that which belongs
 to the natural charge — in which, before this reversal can take place, there
 must be a meeting of opposite electricities without and within the sheaths
 which must result in the discharge of the weaker natural charge and of an
 equivalent quantity of the artificial charge — which, assuming 10 as the
 value of the tension, and taking the figure already used to illustrate the
 state of things in the natural charge, may be represented thus : —
                                      Fig.  3.
                                       —   ic
 The   case, indeed, is one in which the artificial charge of the fibres involves
 a reversal similar   to that  which  happens naturally when these fibres, in
 some instances at least, have lost a great portion of their activity, — in which
 there may be supposed to be a similar reason, whatever that may be, for
 failure in this activity : and hence it need not be altogether a matter of
 wonder that the limb in which the current is direct should lose its power
 of contracting more rapidly than the same limb when left to itself.
     The electrical condition of the fibres of the nerves and muscles of the
 limb in which the current is inverse, on the other hand, may be taken as
 one in which the exteriors of the sheaths are charged positively from the
  positive pole, and the interiors  negatively by induction  —a   state  in which

 384       Dr. C. B. Jladcliffe's Researches in Animal Electricity.        [Apr.  8,
 the sheaths are affected without         and within similarly by the natural and
 artificial   charges — in which the artificial may be added to the natural
 charge, causing, not discharge, as in the case of the limb in which the cur
 rent is direct, but surcharge — in which, assuming the value of tension to be
  10 for the artificial  and   5 for the natural charge, and taking the figure used
 before in illustration,    the result of this combination of charges may be set
 down thus      : —
                                          Fig. 4.
                                          + 1S-
    The     case is one in which      the artificial charge, by supplementing the
 natural charge, may be supposed to retard the disappearance         of the natural
 charge, and with it the power of contracting ; for between this charge and
 this power there is, without question, a connexion which may not be severed.
And if this be so, then it is not difficult to advance a step further and
perceive how it is that this artificial charge may restore the natural power
of contracting after it is lost, and how, in this way, after this power has
disappeared from the limb in which the current is direct, it may be brought
back again by reversing the position of the poles.            In a word, it is not
altogether unintelligible that there should be along with the inverse cur
rent an action which preserves and restores the power of contracting.
    And if the condition of the two limbs be thus different when the circuit
is closed, a clue is found, by tracing which it is possible to arrive at an
explanation of the different behaviour of the two limbs at the moment of
closing and opening the circuit.
    In the second period of the second stage (vide Table), the limb in
which the current is direct contracts at the moment of closing and not at
the moment of opening the circuit, and, contrariwise, the limb in which the
current is inverse contracts at the moment of opening the circuit and not
at the moment of closing it         ; and most assuredly there is nothing anoma
lous in these differences.
    In the limb in which      the current  is direct, as will appear on comparing
the two figures 2 & 3, there must be at the moment of closing the cir
cuit a conflict between the natural and artificial charges of the fibres
before the        stronger artificial charge can have the victory which it
gains    in  the   end, — a conflict in which the neutralization of the natural
charge by an equivalent quantity of the artificial charge, must issue in
discharge ; and hence the presence of contraction at this moment, if con
traction be coincident, not with charge, but with discharge.                Indeed
there is a double reason for contraction at this moment ; for in addition to

this discharge is the discharge of the opposite electricities of the poles
which attends upon the closing of the circuit in any case. Nor is the
absence of contraction at the opening of the circuit unintelligible ; for it
is easy to see that the loss in the power of contracting which the limb
in which the current is direct has experinced by this time, may have ren
dered the limb incapable of responding           to the weaker discharge which
attends upon the opening of the circuit.
     In the limb in which     the current is inverse, as will appear on com
paring the figures 2    & 4, there   must be the addition of the artificial charge
                          —
to the natural charge a surcharge — a state which may nullify the dis
charge attending upon the closing of the circuit ; and hence the absence
of contraction at the closing of the circuit ; for, according to the premises,
 there will be no contraction if there be no discharge, or, rather, there will
be no contraction     if there be no sufficient discharge.        Nor is a reason
wanting for the presence of contraction at the opening of the circuit in
this case ; for if the action of the electricity be to preserve and restore the
power of contracting in the limb in which the current is inverse, it is easy
 to suppose that in the case in question this power is so far preserved as
 to allow the limb to respond to the discharge which attends upon the
 opening of the circuit.
    Nor need there be any difficulty in dealing with the phenomena be
longing to the other periods of the second stage.            The presence of con
 traction at the closing as well as at the opening of the circuit, in the case
 of the limb in which the current is inverse (second stage, first period, in
 Table), would seem to imply no more than this, that the conditions pre
 sent in the first stage have not yet come to an end.         The  absence  of con
 traction at the closing as well as at the opening of the circuit      in the limb
in which the current is direct (second stage, third period, in        Table), may
merely be due to the electricity having now so far destroyed          the power of
contracting as to make the limb incapable of responding to            the stronger
 no less than to the weaker           of the discharges acting upon it.        The
 differences in question are merely transitional, nothing more.
    A few words will suffice for all that need be said respecting the pheno
mena which remain to be considered (third stage in Table).               For if the
charges of the poles play the part which has been ascribed to them, it is
to be expected that, by reversing the position of the poles, what was done
in either limb by either pole may be undone by the other pole, and that
at a certain moment after this reversal the two limbs may be restored to
that state of similarity in which they will, as at first, contract similarly
on closing and opening the circuit, one or both — at the opening as well as
at the closing if the battery power be strong, at the closing only if the
battery power be feeble.
    It would seem, then, as     if the changes of tension, to which attention has
been directed, supplied an explanation of the motor phenomena ascribed to
the action of the " inverse
                               " and." direct " currents, which, to
                                                                     say the least,

is more intelligible than any which can be found in the action of the
currents themselves, and that in fact it is a gain rather than a loss to
discard altogether the "inverse" and "direct" currents from the field
of operation in which they have hitherto been supposed to play so all-
important a part.
  It would seem, in fact, that the evidence     in this section agrees with
that supplied in the two previous sections in leading to the conclusion
that muscular relaxation is associated with a state of charge, and mus
cular contraction with a state of discharge.      It would even seem as if
all the evidence so far gave countenance to the conclusion that the state
of charge may cause muscular relaxation by keeping the molecules of the
muscle in a condition of mutual repulsion, and that the state of discharge
may lead to muscular contraction by doing away with that state of elec
trical tension which prevents the molecules of the muscle from yielding to
the attractive force, inherent in their physical constitution, which is ever
striving to bring them together.
                                         V. On Electrotonus.
     It
    is not enough to be content with repeating, after Professor Du Bois
Reymond, that the nerve-current and voltaic current are in the same direc
tion in anelectrotonus and in opposite directions in cathelectrotonus, or,
after Professor Eckhard, that the activity of the nerve is paralyzed in the
former of these states and exalted in the latter.   In fact, the subject of
electrotonus requires complete revision.
   The direction of the nerve-current and voltaic current is found to agree
in anelectrotonus and to disagree in cathelectrotonus,      as   commonly       if,    is
the case, the direction               of the former          current   is    from the end to the
side of the fibres            ;   but not    so   if,   as   may happen, the course of the
nerve-current           is   the reverse of this.       In this case the direction of the two
currents will agree in cathelectrotonus and disagree in anelectrotonus.
Nay,  more, there are movements of the needle, corresponding perfectly to
those which happen in the two electrotonic states, when the experiment
is made upon dead nerve and upon other bodies too, provided these
bodies are sufficiently bad conductors of electricity.
     If piece of wire be placed as the piece of nerve
          a                                             placed in an ex       is
periment on electrotonus and dealt with in the same manner, the needle of
the galvanometer remains motionless     and so likewise
                                                    ;     piece of cotton     if   a
or hempen thread moistened with water be substituted for the wire   but                      ;
not so  the nerve be represented by silk or gutta percha moistened with
          if
water.  In the latter case, indeed, the needle     found to move as    is                        it
moves  in anelectrotonus and cathelectrotonus when the voltaic poles are
placed in the way necessary to produce these two electrotonic conditions.
The needle may be at zero before these movements are manifested, or                              it
may not.    It at zero the electrodes of the galvanometer are homoge
                        is         if
neous     ;  on this or that side of the zero-point
              it   is                                                  if,
                                                    as commonly happens,

there is      some accidental heterogeneity in these electrodes.       Still no serious
complication in the problem is introduced by the presence of this purely
accidental current ; for all that it does is to shift in one direction or the
other the point from which the electrotonic movements of the needle have
to be      reckoned.      Be this accidental current present or absent, indeed, the
 degree      and  direction  of the electrotonic movements of the needle remain the
 same, and it is only the starting-point of the movement which is shifted.
       These, then, being the facts, it is difficult to regard the electrotonic phe
 nomena in nerve which are exhibited in the galvanometer as modifications
 of the nerve-current. The nerve-current, if present, is undoubtedly modi
 fied, just as is the accidental current depending upon the heterogeneity of
 the electrodes of the galvanometer to which attention has just been di
  rected ; but the essential workings in electrotonus must be deeper than the
  nerve- current, deeper even than the nerve. It would seem, indeed, that
  the nerve-current must in reality play as accidental a part in the pheno
  mena of electrotonus as does the current depending upon heterogeneity
   in the electrodes of the galvanometer in the experiment in which gutta
   percha or silk moistened with water is substituted for the nerve. It would
   seem, indeed, that a given degree of resistance between the voltaic poles is
   in reality all that is essential to the manifestation of the galvanometric phe
   nomena of electrotonus — a resistance sufficient to pen up free positive elec
   tricity at the positive pole and free negative electricity at the negative pole ;
    and that the movements of the needle may be owing to the outflowing or
   inflowing of this free electricity through the coil of the galvanometer from
    or to the pole which happens to be nearest to the coil ; for it is found that
    similar movements to those which happen in electrotonus are witnessed
    when the part of the nerve acted upon ordinarily by the voltaic current is
    charged alternately with positive and negative electricity from a friction-
    machine.      In   an experiment on electrotonus,     as commonly conducted, the
    insulation    of the circuits of the galvanometer and the battery is sufficient
    to prevent any passage of the voltaic current proper into the coil, but it is
    not sufficient to hem in electricity of a higher tension ; it is not sufficient
    to prevent the flowing of a stream of free electricity from the positive pole,
    and to the negative pole, of which stream a part may pass through the
    coil of the galvanometer, and so act upon the needle. And hence the
    movements of the needle of the galvanometer in anelectrotonus and cath-
    electrotonus     ; for the movement in anelectrotonus is only that which hap
     pens   when   free positive electricity is passed through the coil, and the move
     ment in cathelectrotonus is only that which happens when free negative
     electricity is so passed.
         Instead of the activity of nerve being paralyzed in anelectrotonus and
     exalted in cathelectrotonus, a very different conclusion appears to be ne
     cessary.     Taking the prepared limbs of a frog, and placing the middle
     portion of the connecting band of nerve belonging to them across the poles
      of a voltaic battery of which the circuit is open, a drop of salt water is ap

plied   on each side to the portion of nerve beyond the pole.                          Then,
 having waited until the salt has set up a state of tetanus in both limbs,
the voltaic circuit is closed and opened in turn, with the poles first in one
 position and then in the other.             On closing the circuit, anelectrotonus is
set up on the side       of the positive pole, cathelectrotonus on the side            of the
negative pole      ;  and what has to be done is to notice the behaviour               of the
limb before, during, and after the setting up of these states.                  In this expe

and direct currents are passing — in similar cases, that                            is    to say       ;   for, as
regards the phenomena of tension, the state in anelectrotonus      identical                      is
with that which     present in the limb in which the current
                         is                                    inverse (see               is

    In the first    stage of the experiment the facts are — suspension           of   the
tetanus caused      by the salt during cathelectrotonus and anelectrotonus         alike,
return of tetanus after anelectrotonus, momentary contraction only                  after
cathelectrotonus ; and these facts are not inexplicable.            The tetanus     after
anelectrotonus, and the momentary contraction only after cathelectrotonus,
show, as it would seem, that the power of responding to the action of the
salt has been preserved in anelectrotonus, as in the case              of the   limb in
which the current is inverse, and lost in cathelectrotonus,              as in  the    case
of the limb in which the current        is direct.   It is quite intelligible  also that
the tetanus caused by the salt should be suspended during the continuance
 of the electrotonic state, if this state be based upon charge, and if this
charge have that power of counteracting            contraction which would       seem to
 belong to it.

 considered are (1) what happens when anelectrotonus follows cathelec
trotonus, and (2) what happens when              cathelectrotonus   follows   anelectro
 tonus.
     In the   case in   which anelectrotonus follows cathelectrotonus the facts
 are these    : — during anelectrotonus,      rest at first, then twichings progres
 sively increasing in frequency and force ; and after anelectrotonus, tetanus ;
 and so it should be.        If, indeed, the power of contracting is impaired in
 cathelectrotonus and preserved in anelectrotonus, it may be supposed,
 when anelectrotonus is made to follow cathelectrotonus, that the power of
 contracting has been so far impaired by the previous state of cathelectro
 tonus   as to   oblige the muscles to remain in a state of rest until this power
 is to a certain degree restored by the state of anelectrotonus ; and that the
 rest at first, and the twitchings progressively increasing in force and fre
 quency afterwards, when anelectrotonus is made to follow cathelectrotonus,
 may be accounted for in this way.             Moreover the tetanus upon the ces
 sation of anelectrotonus may be supposed to receive its explanation also,
 if the action of the anelectrotonus has been to preserve and restore the
 power of contraction, and if the state of charge upon which that of anelec
 trotonus is based, has, in some degree at least, the effect of counteracting
 contraction.
     In the   case  of cathelectrotonus after anelectrotonus, also, what happens
 is intelligible enough when the same principles of interpretation are applied
 to the facts.       The facts themselves are these : — during cathelectrotonus,
 first tetanus, then rest      ;  after cathelectrotonus,    momentary contraction.
  Now when cathelectrotonus follows upon anelectrotonus, as a comparison
  of figs. 3 & 4 will show, there must be discharge. And, further, when
 either electrotonic state is established, there must be that discharge which
  attends upon the closing of the circuit in any case ; and hence the tetanus
 which happens when cathelectrotonus is made to follow anelectrotonus ; for
  in addition to being acted upon by the salt, the muscles (the power of con
  tracting is preserved in anelectrotonus) are at this time acted upon by the

 1869.]        Source     of Free Hydrochloric Acid in       the Gastric Juice.      391
 two discharges which have been mentioned.                 Nor is it difficult to find a
 reason for the rest which follows the tetanus when cathelectrotonus is
 established, and the momentary contraction which happens when cathelec
 trotonus     passes off.      The rest which follows the tetanus under        these cir
 cumstances is intelligible ; for the cathelectrotonus may be supposed to
 do away with the power of responding to the action of the salt; and
 the momentary contraction which happens when the cathelectrotonus
 passes   off   is intelligible also ;  for, according to the premises, the cessation
 of the state of electrotonus implies the cessation of a state which counter
 acts that action of the salt which causes contraction.           Moreover, it is intel
 ligible   enough that there should be tetanns after anelectrotonus, and
 momentary contraction only after cathelectrotonus, if the power of con
 tracting be impaired in the one case and preserved in the other.
     Nor  is  it otherwise with other experiments on electrotonus when            care is
 taken to eliminate what is fallacious.
     One and the same explanation, indeed, would seem to apply to the motor
 phenomena connected with anelectrotonus and cathelectrotonus, and to the
 motor phenomena connected with the inverse and direct currents ; and this
 explanation is to be found, as it would seem, in the workings, not of the
 constant current, but of statical electricity.
     The electrotonic variations in the conductibility of nerve            detected by
 Professor von Bezold are reserved for future investigation.

 I. " On     the Source of Free Hydrochloric             Acid in the Gastric Juice."
        By Professor E. N. Horsford, Cambridge, U. S. A. Communi
        cated by T. Graham, F.R.S.               Received January 18, 1869.
    The long-disputed position of Prout that the gastric juice contains free
hydrochloric acid, was at length established by C. Schmidt, who, in an
absolute quantitative analysis of the juice, found about twice as much hydro
chloric acid as was required to neutralize all the bases present. The pro
longed discussion of this subject (now since 1823) has brought to light,
through the researches of Lassaigne, Tiedemann and Gmelin, Berzelius,
Blondlot, Claude Bernard, Schwann, and numerous others, the unmistake-
able evidence of the presence of lactic acid and of acid phosphates in the
gastric juice, which latter might or might not be due to the presence of
lactic or hydrochloric acid.           A point of special interest to the chemist and
physiologist still remained, and was this          :
                                                                       2 g 2

    How could free hydrochloric acid be secreted from the blood, which is an
alkaline fluid ?
    The blood freshly drawn consists of a fluid (the plasma) in which there
are swimming myriads of exceedingly minute irregularly spheroidal bodies
(the corpuscles).    The plasma consists of two bodies, one of which, the
fibrine, spontaneously separates from the other, the serum.    The corpuscles
are little sacs of delicate animal membrane enclosing a fluid.       This fluid
has an acid reaction, and its ash contains a monobasic alkaline phosphate.
The fibrine of the plasma contains, according to Virchow, a glycerophos
phate of lime, though the plasma, as a whole, has an alkaline reaction, and
contains in its ash a great measure (1 1 per cent.) of chloride of sodium.
    The moist corpuscles constitute about one-half of the blood.
    I assume that in healthy digestion, as a consequence of increased flow
of blood to the gastric mucous membrane and of the normal elasticity of
the walls of the capillaries, there exists in the membrane a condition which
is the equivalent of engorgement.      Under the pressure which attends this
condition, the corpuscles in contact with the walls of the capillaries would
discharge a portion of their acid contents, which, with the adjacent plasma,
would pass through the walls of the capillaries.     This mixture would con
tain acid phosphates and chlorides.
    The mucous membrane of the stomach presents on its inner surface the
mouths of numerous microscopic tubes, which, like stockings, are some
times single blind sacs, or, like gloves, terminate in several blind sacs like
the glove fingers.    In the bottoms of these tubes, and along their sides, are
several closed spherical sacs or cells, containing other lesser sacs and fluid
within. The tubes, as a whole, dip down into the spongy tissue that underlies
the mucous coat, where they are surrounded by the fluid poured from the
network of nutritive capillaries, which fluid, as remarked above, contains
acid phosphates and chlorides.
    Now by pressure and osmosis a portion of this fluid will pass through
the walls of the gastric tubes, and the question is :
    Whether the fluid that goes through will contain free hydrochloric acid ?
    The experiments I have made are conclusive on the principal point.
    By employing acid phosphate of lime and common salt I had this advan
tage, that as increased acidity on the one hand is a just inference from in
creased alkalinity on the other, and as increased alkalinity would be shown
by the precipitation of phosphate of lime (a visible white powder) I could
determine the qualitative fact without the difficulties and delay attending
on accurate quantitative analysis of the solutions, before and after the ex
periments on both sides of the membrane.
    I employed an acid phosphate of lime of specific gravity 1-1 1 7, of a con
stitution of 3(Ca O P 05) + 2P 03,.with an amount of phosphate of peroxide
of iron present  as one to twenty-eight of the acid phosphate of lime.     The
various other solutions employed were the ordinary laboratory reagents.
    On adding ammonia in small quantities to the solution of acid phosphate,

  with alternate agitation, it required, as might be inferred, several repetitions
  before the peroxide with its phosphoric acid became a permanent precipi
 tate, and still several more before the precipitate of phosphate of lime
 became permanent.
    In my earlier experiments, in which      I  employed parchment-paper,       I was
 embarrassed with the presence of sulphate of lime in the precipitated powder ;
 so that what was at first supposed to be phosphates of lime and iron was
 found to be in part sulphate of lime.      This sulphate was due to imperfectly
 washed parchment-paper, which still contained sulphuric acid.           This diffi
 culty overcome, the experiments were made with parchment-paper pre
 pared from German and Swedish filter-paper, as well as with goldbeater's
 skin (animal membrane).
    I employed acid phosphate of the formula above, with (each by itself)
 chloride of sodium, chloride of ammonium, chloride of potassium, chloride
 of calcium, and chloride of magnesium.
    I also experimented with acetate of potassa and acid phosphate of
 lime.
    With all of these there  was obtained the same kind     of evidence of increased
 acidity   on one side and     of increased alkalinity on the other, to wit, the
 powder    thrown   down  from   the mixture of acid phosphate and chloride.
 What successive additions of ammonia had been required to effect, had been
 accomplished by dialysis.
    The same effect took place from a mixture of acid phosphate of soda and
 chloride of calcium.
    It follows from the above,    if these experiments fairly represent the case,
 and from the known composition of the blood, its condition in the walls of
 the stomach, and the structure of the gastric tubules, that free or uncom-
bined hydrochloric acid must find its way into the bottoms of the gastric
tubules, and thence into the cavity of the stomach.
    It may be urged that I should show that the acid phosphate pressed from
the corpuscles more than neutralizes the alkalinity of the plasma present.
 In reply it may be said that I present a condition of things in which there
is the kind of physical change required going on, namely, relative augmen
tation of the corpuscles, under pressure, the concomitant of increased supply
 of blood to the gastric mucous membrane. Its degree must be inferred
from the effects on the secretions, which       I  have  endeavoured to point out,
by conducting      an experiment     under what    I conceive  to be essentially like
conditions, and obtaining the result due to identical conditions.
    The secretion of hydrochloric acid is of course mixed with acid phosphates
and alkaline chlorides.
    That such    a result as I  have arrived at would follow experiment might
have been predicted from Graham's researches on dialysis.            Phosphates of
lime and soda are colloidal relatively to more crystalloidal hydrochloric
acid.    Graham found that bisulphate of potassa, by dialysis, was resolved
into two salts or mixtures of greater and      lesser acidity than the original bi

sulphate.     So he found that acetate of peroxide of iron was resolved by
dialysis into hydrated peroxide of iron and free acetic acid.            It is possible
and probable that the albuminoid bodies present take part in determining
the contrast between colloid and crystalloid bodies.           Graham found that by
dialysis he could separate free hydrochloric acid from the gastric juice thrown
up in vomiting.
   It  may be further objected that anatomists are not agreed as to the struc
ture of the corpuscles.       But it will be seen that there is no more required
than may be regarded as established.           The corpuscles act in many parti
culars, if not in all, as if they were membranous sacs more or less distended
with fluid.    They may be swollen by immersion in a thinner (less colloid)
fluid, and reduced by immersion in a more colloid fluid — that is, they are
susceptible of endosmosis and exosmosis as membranous sacs would be.                  In
their ordinary condition as seen under a microscope, they present the                ap
pearance of collapsed spherical or oval sacs or cells. They          appear as  double
concave disks.     In swelling (by endosmosis) the lowest part of each con
cavity is the last to take on the spherical contour, just as it would do if the
corpuscles were membranous sacs.           The corpuscles sometimes so collapse
(by exosmosis) that one-half of the hollow sphere is reversed, while the
other half retains its form unchanged, the former sitting like a cup in the
latter — a conformation inconceivable on the theory of homogeneity of the
corpuscles as a whole.        Crystallizable substances may be extracted from
the corpuscles by pressure and by endosmosis.               They must have been in
solution in order to crystallization, and solution involves a fluid.               The
liquid expressed from the corpuscles has an acid reaction, and contains an
organic acid and acid phosphates.           It contains, among other bodies, the
haematoidin of Virchow.         The ash of these crystals consists almost wholly
of metaphosphates*,       which point directly to tribasic phosphoric acid in
solution,   combined     with one atom of fixed base, which is inconceiv
able unless separated       by membrane from          the plasma, which is always
alkaline.
    In fine, whatever other peculiarities the blood-corpuscles may possess,
they have the requisites for furnishing acid phosphates in solution under
pressure, such as must attend engorgement of the capillaries in the walls of
 the stomach.
    Let us glance at what takes place in all probability as the acid fluid
 enters the gastric tubules.      They are surrounded by a mixture of hydro
 chloric acid, acid salts, neutral salts, and albuminoid bodies.               Dialysis
 must be repeated, and a stronger acid solution pass into the sacs or cells
 contained in them.      The sacs swelling by endosmosis, and corroded by the
 acid, must at length burst, and the liquid contents, together with the disin
 tegrated and partially digested membrane of the sacs, pass out into the
   * The ether-extract of the blood-corpuscles yields, according to Schwann, an ash con
taining acid phosphate of soda.    Owen, Bees, and Berzelius maintained the existence
of oleo-phosphoric acid in the corpuscles.

     F. A. Abel, F.R.S., For. Sec. C. S.             Received      March 9, 1868.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The   degree   of rapidity with which       an explosive substance undergoes
 metamorphosis, as also the nature          and results of such change, are, in the
 greater number of instances, susceptible of several modifications by varia
 tion of the circumstances under which the conditions essential to chemical
 change are fulfilled.
    Excellent illustrations   of the   modes by which such modifications may be
 brought    about are furnished      by gun-cotton, which may be made to burn
 very slowly, almost without        flame, to inflame with great rapidity, but
 without development of great explosive force, or to exercise a violent de
 structive action, according as the mode of applying heat, the circumstances
 attending such application of heat, and the mechanical condition of the
 explosive agent, are modified*.            The character of explosion and the
 mechanical force developed, within given periods, by the metamorphosis
 of explosive mixtures such as gunpowder, is similarly subject to modi
 fications; and even the most violent explosive compounds known (the
 mercuric and silver fulminates, and the chloride and iodide of nitrogen)
 behave in very different ways, under the operation of heat or other dis
 turbing influences, according to the circumstances which attend the meta
 morphosis of the explosive agent (e.g. the position of the source of heat
 with reference to the mass of the substance to be exploded, or the extent
 of initial resistance opposed to the escape of the products of explosion).
    Some new and striking illustrations have been obtained of the suscepti
bility to modification in explosive action possessed by these substances.
    The product of the action of nitric acid upon glycerine, known as nitro
glycerine or glonoine, which bears some resemblance to chloride of nitrogen
in its power of sudden explosion, requires the fulfilment of special condi
tions for the development of its explosive force.                Its explosion by the
simple application     of  heat can   only   be accomplished      if the source of heat
be applied, for a protracted period, in such a way that chemical decom
position is established in some portion of the mass, and is favoured by the
continued application of heat to that part.             Under these circumstances,
the chemical change proceeds with very rapidly accelerating violence, and
the sudden transformation, into gaseous products, of the heated portion
eventually results, a transformation which is instantly communicated

throughout the mass of nitroglycerine, so that confinement of the sub
stance is not necessary to develope its full explosive force.      This result
can be obtained more expeditiously and with greater certainty by exposing
the substance to the concussive action of a detonation produced by the
ignition    of a small quantity of fulminating powder, closely confined and
placed    in contact with, or proximity to, the nitroglycerine.
     The development of the violent explosive action of nitroglycerine, freely
 exposed to air, through the agency of a detonation, was regarded until
 recently as a peculiarity of that substance ; it is now demonstrated that
 gun-cotton and other explosive compounds and mixtures do not necessarily
require confinement for the full development of their explosive force, but
that this result is attainable (and very readily in some instances, especially
 in the case of gun-cotton) by means similar to those applied in the case of
nitroglycerine.
    The manner in which a detonation operates in determining the violent
 explosion of gun-cotton, nitroglycerine, &c., has been made the subject of
 careful investigation.    It is demonstrated experimentally that the result
 cannot be ascribed to the direct operation of the heat developed by the
 chemical changes of the charge of detonating material used as the ex
 ploding agent.      An experimental comparison of the mechanical force ex
 erted by different explosive compounds, and by the same compound em
 ployed in different ways, has shown that the remarkable power possessed
 by the explosion of small quantities of certain bodies (the mercuric and
 silver-fulminates) to accomplish the detonation of gun-cotton, while com
 paratively very large quantities of other highly explosive agents are inca
 pable of producing that result, is generally accounted for satisfactorily by
 the difference in the amount of force suddenly brought to bear in the
  different instances upon some portion of the mass operated upon.         Most
  generally, therefore, the degree of facility with which the detonation of a
  substance will develope similar change in a neighbouring explosive sub
  stance may be regarded as proportionate to the amount of force developed
  within the shortest period of time by that detonation, the latter being, in
  fact, analogous in its operation to that of a blow from a hammer, or of the
  impact of a projectile.
      Several remarkable   results of an exceptional character have been ob
  tained, which indicate that the development of explosive force under the
  circumstances referred to is not always simply ascribable to the sudden
  operation of mechanical force.      These were especially observed in the
  course of a comparison of the conditions essential to the detonation of gun-
  cotton and of nitroglycerine by means of particular explosive agents (chlo
  ride of nitrogen, &c.), as well as in an examination into the effects pro
  duced upon each other by the detonation of those two substances.
      The explanation offered of these exceptional results is to the effect that
  the vibrations attendant upon a particular explosion, if synchronous with
  those which would result from the explosion of a neighbouring substance

in   a state of high chemical tension, will, by their tendency to develope those
vibrations, either determine the explosion of that substance, or at any rate
greatly aid the disturbing effect of mechanical force suddenly applied,
while, in the instance of another explosion, which developes vibratory im
pulses of different character, the mechanical force applied through its
agency has to operate with little or no aid, greater force, or a more power
ful detonation, being therefore required in the latter instance to accom
 plish the same result.
     Instances of the apparently simultaneous explosion' of numerous distinct
 and even somewhat widely separated masses of explosive substances (such
 as simultaneous explosions in several distinct buildings at powder-mills) do
 not unfrequently occur, in which the generation of a disruptive impulse
 by the first or initiative explosion, which is communicated with extreme
 rapidity to contiguous masses of the same nature, appears much more
 likely   to be the operating cause, than that such simultaneous       explosions
 should be brought       about by the direct operation of heat and mechanical
 force.
     A  practical examination has been instituted into the influence which the
 explosion of gun-cotton through the agency of a detonation, exercises upon
 the nature of its metamorphosis, upon the character and effects of its
 explosion, and upon the uses to which gun-cotton is susceptible of application.

         Latitude   7° 55' 20" South, Longitude 14° 25' 30" West, from
         July 1863    to March 1866."        By Lieut. Rokeby, R.M.           Re
         duced   by G.    M. Whipple, Magnetical Assistant at           the  Kew
         Observatory. Communicated by B. Stewart, LL.D.                 Received
         March 11, 1869.
      On leaving England for Ascension Island in May 1862, Lieut. Rokeby
  was supplied by General Sabine with the following instruments for the
  purpose of making       observations  of magnetical    variation and intensity,
  viz. : —
      A portable declinometer and unifilar for absolute observations of declina
  tion and horizontal intensity, a Barrow's dip-circle (No. 24), a differential
  declinometer, and a differential bifilar.
      The differential declinometer and the bifilar were erected at George Town,
  Ascension, in August 1862, and bihorary observations commenced; but in
  consequence of instability in the supports of the instruments, caused pro
   bably by the shifting of the volcanic cinders which formed the ground at
   the observing-station, the observations made exhibit frequent discrepancies.
   The whole of the bifilar observations, and all the differential declinometer
   observations prior to June      1864, have therefore been omitted from the
   present discussion.

 398                 Lieut. Rokeby on Magnetic Observations.                [Apr. 15,
     These observations were discontinued in June 1866, when Lieut. Rokeby
 left the Island.
     Observations of absolute horizontal force and dip were made on the Green
 Mountain, Ascension, once every month from July 1863 to March 1866,
 two months in 1865 excepted.
     Observations were not made with the portable declinometer.
                     Observations   of Horizontal Force and Dip.
     The horizontal, vertical, and total forces (Table No. 1 ) are calculated to
 English measure ; one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain
 being assumed as the limits of space, of time, and of mass.
     The vertical and total forces are obtained from the absolute measures            of
 the horizontal force and the dip.
     The observations of dip (Table No. 1) were made in every instance save
 one with the needle marked A 2.
     For the observations of deflection and vibration taken each month for
 absolute measure of horizontal force, the same magnet (collimator 5) has
 always been employed.
     The moment of inertia of the magnet, with its stirrup for different de
grees of temperature, and the coefficients in the corrections required for the
 effects of temperature and of terrestrial magnetic induction on the magnetic
 moment of the magnet, were determined in             1 858 at the Kew Observatory
 by the late Mr. Welsh.
    That    these corrections held good in 1862 was proved by the agreement          of
 the horizontal      force obtained at Kew with this instrument           previous to
its departure, with       the value  of  the force  determined   by  the  observatory
unifilar.
    The moment of inertia of the magnet with its stirrup is 5-3828 at
60° Fahr.
    The induction-coefficient n =0-000252.
    The correction for error of graduation of the deflection-bar         at 1'0 foot is
0-00000 foot, and at 1-3 foot 0-00003 foot.
    The formula used for determining the temperature correction was
                              q(t35°) + q(t0-35°y,
where    t0
             is the observed   temperature, 35°    F. being the adopted standard
temperature.
    The values of     q and q' for the magnet used are respectively 0 0001 1035
and 0-000000581.
    The observed times of vibration have been corrected for rate of chrono
meter when it has exceeded five seconds per day.              A correction has also
been applied for the effect      of torsion  on the  suspending thread.
    The initial and terminal semiarcs of vibration have always been less than
30', consequently no correction was requisite on this account.

on inspection to be valueless for the purposes   of reduction, for the reason

then rejected, and new means taken of the unrejected observations.
   The mean reading for each month was then computed ; finally, the
hourly means were subtracted from the monthly means.

I.  "Description of Parkeria and Loftusia, two gigantic Types of
      Arenaceous Foraminifera."          By Dr. Carpenter, V.P.R.S., and
       H. B. Brady, F.L.S. Received March 18, 1869.

   The Authors of this Memoir commence by referring to the separation of
the series of Arenaceous Foraminifera from the Imperforate or Porcel-
lanous, and from the Tubular or Vitreous, first distinctly propounded in
Dr. Carpenter's 'Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera' (1862),
on the basis of the special researches of Messrs. Parker and Rupert Jones ;
who had pointed out that whilst there are several genera in some forms of
which a cementation of sand-grains into the substance of the calcareous
shell is a common occurrence, there are certain genera in which a " test
                                                                                "
formed entirely of an aggregation of sand-grains takes the place of a cal
careous   shell ; and that these genera constitute a distinct Family, to which
important additions might probably be made by further research.
   The propriety of this separation of the Arenacea from the calcareous-
shelled Foraminifera    has been fully recognized by Prof. Reuss, the highest
Continental authority upon the group ; who had come to accept the prin
ciple laid down in Dr. Carpenter's successive Memoirs (Phil. Trans. 1856-
 1860), that the texture of the shell-is a character of fundamental im
portance in the classification of this group, the plan of growth (taken by
M. d'Orbigny as his primary character) being of very subordinate value ;
and who had, on this basis, independently worked out a Systematic Ar
rangement of the entire group, which presents a most remarkable cor
respondence with that propounded by Dr. Carpenter and his coadjutors.

been     fully borne out,    on    the one hand by the discovery of several most
remarkable new forms at present existing at great depths in the Ocean,
which has been made by the dredgings of M. Sars, Jun., and those of the
'               '
   Lightning       Expedition, and on the other by the determination of the
real»characters of two fossils, one of the Cretaceous, and the other probably
of the earlier Tertiary period, which prove to               be gigantic examples      of the
same type.
     The first of    these, discovered by Prof. Morris more than twenty years
ago    in  the Upper Greensand near Cambridge, was long supposed to be a
Sponge ; but his more recent discovery of two specimens which had been
but little changed by fossilization, led him to suspect their Foraminiferal
character ; and this suspicion has been fully confirmed by the careful ex
amination made of their structure by Dr. Carpenter, to whom he committed
the inquiry, and by whom, with his concurrence, the name Parkeria was
assigned to the genus.           The second, which was obtained by the late Mr.
W. K. Loftus from "          a hard rock      of blue marly limestone        "  between the
N.E.      corner of the Persian Gulf and Ispahan, bears so strong a resem
blance in its general form and mode of increase to the genus Alveolina, that
its Foraminiferal character was from the first recognized by the discoverer ;
but as all the specimens brought by Mr. Loftus had undergone considerable
alteration by fossilization, their minute structure, though carefully studied
by means of transparent sections, could not in the first instance be satisfac
torily made out. When, however, Dr. Carpenter's investigation of Parkeria,
with the full advantage of specimens but little changed by fossilization,
revealed the very remarkable plan of its structure, the investigation of this
type was resumed by Mr. Brady (who assigned to it the name Loftmia),
 with the new light thence derived : for as transparent sections of infiltrated
 ParkeritB furnish a middle term of comparison between specimens of the
 same type which retain their original character, and transparent sections
 of infiltrated Lo/tusice, the last-mentioned can now be interpreted by
reference to the preceding ; so that the obscurities which previously hung
 over their minute structure have been almost entirely dissipated. — The de
 scription of the structure of Parkeria in this Memoir is by Dr. Carpenter,
 and that of the structure of Loftusia by Mr. H. B. Brady ; but each has
 gone over the work of the other, and can testify to its correctness.
     The specimens of Parkeria which have               been collected by     Prof. Morris*
 are spheres      varying in diameter from about 3-4ths of an inch to about                 1 j
     * Since this Memoir was completed, the Author has learned that Mr. Harry Seeley, of
 Cambridge, has collected several specimens of this type, and has been studying it inde
 pendently with a view to publication. And Mr. Henry Woodward has placed in his
 hands a specimen from the Upper Greensand in the Isle of Wight, which is not less than
 2J inches in diameter.     It is interesting to remark that the " nucleus " of a smaller
  specimen from the same locality consists of a considerable number of chambers arranged
  in a tpire, the structure of its concentric spherical layers being exactly the same as in the
  specimens described in the text.

 inch.    The character of their external surface differs considerably in dif
 ferent individuals ; but the Author gives reason for believing that it was
 originally tuberculated, like a mulberry, and that the departures from this
 have been the result of subsequent abrasion.         The entire sphere is com
 posed  of a great number   of concentric layers, all of which, except the inner
 most, are arranged with very considerable regularity around a central
                                                                                              " nu
 cleus," which consists of five chambers, disposed in rectilineal sequence,
 thus unmistakeably indicating the Foraminiferal character of the organism,
 which might otherwise have remained in doubt, on account of the entire
 divergence from any known type presented in the structure of the concen
 tric layers. The first of these layers is moulded (as it were) on the exterior
 of the nucleus, and partakes of its elongated form ; but the parts of every
 additional exogenous layer are so arranged as to bring about a gradual
 approximation to the spherical form, which is afterwards maintained with
great constancy.              Each layer may be described as consisting of a lamella
 of   " labyrinthic         structure

berlets, whose cavities communicate    freely with one another), separated

" radial tubes," that pass from each lamella to the one external to it. All
these    structures,        in common         with the chamber-walls        and septa of the
" nucleus,"are built up              by
                          the aggregation of sand- grains   very uniform       of
size. These sand-grains are found to consist of Phosphate of lime    and                  ;
they seem to be united                   by
                               cement composed of Carbonate of lime,

which was probably exuded                     by
                                the animal itself.   Although there     a                     is
very general uniformity in the thickness of the successive layers, the pro
portion of their several components varies considerably      different parts in
of the sphere. In those which immediately surround the nucleus, the
solid lamellae, which are composed of labyrinthic structure, are compara
tively thin whilst the interspaces which separate them from one another
              ;
are very broad, so that the radial tubes which traverse these interspaces
are very conspicuous.           As   we pass outwards, we find the
                                                         labyrinthic lamellae
increasing in thickness, whilst the breadth of the interspaces diminishes in
the same degree, until we meet with layers in which the interspaces are
almost entirely replaced              by
                               labyrinthic structure.   With this increased
development   of  the labyrinthic structure in the concentric lamellae them
selves, we find  extending between one lamella and another, as an invest

the outer side of the lamella, into what, when it is newly formed, is the
surrounding medium, but, when it has itself been invested by another layer,
into its "interspace-system." — In the larger of the two non-infiltrated
specimens which have furnished the materials for the present description,
the number of concentric layers is 40, and their average breadth about
l-65th of an inch.
   The Author discusses the mode in which this composite structure was
formed   ;   and comes                  that the production of each new
                         to the conclusion
layer was  probably accomplished by   the  instrumentality of the sarcodic
substance, which not only filled the chamberlets of the preceding layer,
but projected beyond it ; that the radial processes were first built up like
the columns     of   a Gothic     cathedral,   and that    their impervious invest
ing wall spread itself      from their summits, so as to         form a continuous
lamella over the sarcodic layer, in the manner that the summits of such
columns extend themselves to form the arched roof of the edifice ; and that
on the floor of the new layer thus laid the partitions of the chamberlets
were progressively built up by the agency of the sarcodic substance con
veyed to the outer surface of that floor through the radial tubes. The
author further argues, from the analogy of living Foraminifera, that not
withstanding the indirectness of the communication between the cavitary
system of the inner layers and the external surface, the whole of that
system (consisting of the labyrinthic structure of the successive lamella,
and of the interspaces which separate them) was occupied during the life
of the animal by its sarcode-body.
   The plan of growth in Lo/tusia is stated by Mr. Brady to differ ex
tremely from that of Parkeria, whilst its intimate structure, on which its
physiological condition must have depended, is essentially the same ; thus
affording a conspicuous example of the validity of the principle of Classifi
cation already referred to. This difference is indicated by its shape, which
closely resembles that of many Alveolinte and Fusulince ; being a long oval,
frequently tapering almost to a point at either end, though sometimes
obtusely rounded at its extremities. Of two large and perfect examples
in the collection of the late Mr. Loftus,  one measures 3| inches by 1 inch,
the other  2\   inches by    \\   inch.   A
                                        transverse  section at once indicates
that the plan of growth is a spiral, formed by the winding of a continuous
lamina around an elongated axis ; the general disposition of the chambered
structure being very similar to that which would be produced if one of the
simple Rotations were thickened and drawn out at the umbilici. The space
inclosed by the primary lamina is divided into chambers by longitudinal
septa, which may be regarded as ingrowths from            it,
                                                   extending, not perpen
dicularly (as in Alveolind), but very obliquely.    The chambers, sepa
rated by these principal or secondary septa,  are long and very narrow,
and extend from one end of the body to the other.    Their cavities are
further divided into chamberlets          by
                                  tertiary ingrowths, which are gene

rally at right angles to the septa or nearly          so,   but   are otherwise irregular
in their arrangement.     No large primordial          chamber, such as is        common
among Foraminifera, has been yet discovered in Loftusia ; but its absence
cannot be certainly affirmed. In fully grown specimens the turns of the
spire, which succeed each other with tolerable regularity at intervals of
from l-50th to l-30th of an inch, are usually from twelve to twenty in
number ; but as many as twenty-five have been counted in one instance,
and a yet larger number might not improbably be met with.      The spiral
lamina and its prolongations, forming the accessory skeleton, are all con
structed of almost impalpable grains of sand, which is proved by analysis
to have consisted of Carbonate of Lime, united by a cement of the same
material.
   The Author then describes in detail the several components of the fabric
of Loftusia, and compares them with the corresponding parts of Parkeria.
The continuity of increase of the spiral lamina always leaves an open fissure
between its last-formed margin and the surface of the previous whorl ; and
through this aperture the whole system of chambers included within its
successive laminae communicates with the exterior, through the passages
between their cavities, which are left in the building up of the septa. As
already explained, the labyrinthic structure takes its origin from the inner
surface of the impervious spiral lamina, the septa being directed towards
the central axis. These ingrowths have in many instances the form of
tubular columns, which traverse the chambers in a radial direction          >.           (t.
                                                                                               of of
perpendicular to the spiral lamina), terminating either on the septum
the previous chamber, or on the exterior wall of the preceding whorl
chambers.    But these tubes do not seem to be homologous with the " radial
tubes" of Parkeria, whose relations differ in important particulars.   The

chambers in Loftusia     very great.

lamina, imparting the necessary solidity to the organism.     The degree                       of
subdivision of the chambers into chamberlets seems to have little bearing
on the general economy of the animal.
   The Author attempts to determine from the other Foraminifera,                               of
which the remains are found associated in the same Limestone with those
of Lqftusia, .what was its probable Geological age, and under what condi
tions   it   was deposited   ;    and he thence draws the conclusion that the rock
belongs to the lowest portion of the Tertiary period, presenting microzoic    a
Fauna very similar to that of some of our Miliolite Limestones, but richer
in the small arenaceous Rhizopods    and that the sea-bottom was

 Lund, Pictet, De Blainville, Gervais, Burmeister, and Leidy, deferring the
 further analysis and comparison of the descriptions by the latter palae

 sists of casts and photographs of fossils discovered by Don Antonio del
 Castillo, mining engineer, in a posttertiary deposit beneath volcanic tufa in
 the Valley of Mexico.
    The fossils include the dentition of the left ramus of the lower jaw,
 wanting the incisors ; also the series of cervical vertebrae, wanting the first
 or atlas.
    Assuming the incisors to be in number as in Ruminants, the dentition
 of this mandibular ramus is formularized as : — i 3, el, p3, m3 = 10.
    Of the grinding-teeth,    the three molars, with   the last two premolars,
 form a close-set or continuous series of five teeth, the first of which (p 3)
is small, simple, conical, and obtusely pointed.      A still smaller or rudi-
 mental premolar (p 2 or p 1) is situated in the long diastema between the
 series of five teeth and the canine ; the latter tooth is relatively smaller
 than in the Camel.
    Detailed descriptions are given, illustrated by drawings, of each of the
 teeth, from which the author shows that they have belonged to a Cameloid
 species, as large as the larger variety of existing Dromedary, but with
modifications of the teeth, testifying to a closer affinity with the Lama and
Vicugna.
    He then proceeds to give detailed descriptions, with figures, of the
cervical vertebrae ; they present the intraneural position of the vertebro
arterial canals characteristic of the Camelidce, and of the extinct Perisso-
dactyle genus Macrauchenia ; and the comparisons of the fossil vertebrae
are made with the corresponding one of that extinct genus and of the
existing species of Camelus and Auchenia.
    The result of the comparison concurs with that of the dental characters
in demonstrating the former existence in America of a Cameline Ruminant
as large as the largest variety of living Camel or Dromedary, with closer
affinities to the Lamas    and Vicugnas, yet with such departures from the
dental and osteological characters of Auchenia, Illig., as justify the author
in indicating them by the generic or subgeneric term Palauchenia, which
he proposes for such extinct form of American Cameline quadruped.

        III. "  On the Proof of the Law of Errors of Observations."
          By M. W. Crofton, F.R.S.           Received March 24, 1869.
                                    (Abstract.)
     The object of this Paper is to give the mathematical proof, in its most
  general form, of the law of single errors of observations, on the hypothesis
  that each error in practice arises from the joint operation of a large number
  of independent sources of error, each of which, did it exist alone, would
  occasion errors of extremely small amount as compared generally with those
  actually produced by all the sources combined.       This proof is contained in
  a process given for a different   object, namely, Poisson's generalization of
  Laplace's investigation of the law of the mean results of a large number of
 observations, to be found in the ' Connaissance des Temps' for 1827, and
              '                                                   '
                             sur la Probability des Jugements ; it is also re
 also in his    Recherches
                                       '
 produced in Mr. Todhunter's able History of the Theory of Probability.'
 It is not therefore pretended that any new results are arrived at in the
 present Paper.     Considering, however, the importance and celebrity of the
 question, and the refined and difficult character of Poisson's analysis, it will
 not probably be deemed superfluous to show how the same law may be
 demonstrated with equal generality, in a much more simple and elementary
 manner.     The difficulty of the general proof seems indeed to have been so
extensively felt, that several attempts have been made to simplify it.
 However, so far as the present writer is aware, no proof has been given,
 except Poisson's,    which is not open to grave objection, as based upon
 unjustifiable assumptions, or as unduly limiting the generality of the in
vestigation.
    The mathematical reasoning in this Paper is based entirely on the above-
mentioned hypothesis as to the causation of error, namely, that errors
in rerum naturd result from the superposition of a large number of minuter
errors arising from a number of independent sources.         The laws of these
elementary errors are supposed entirely unknown, no further restriction
whatever being imposed on the generality of the investigation ; as would be
the case, for instance, were    we to assume    (as has  sometimes been done)
that each independent source gives positive and negative errors with equal
facility. To decide fully how far the above hypothesis (which seems now to be
generally accepted) really agrees with facts, is an extremely subtle question in

philosophy,   — one   which probably never can be more than partially resolved.
Still, even   a cursory and superficial      examination of a few particular cases
seems to show that, far from        being a mere arbitrary assumption, it is at
least a reasonable    and probable account of what really does take place in
nature, in many large classes of errors of observations.             The history of
practical astronomy, in particular, seems to prove that, whatever doubt may
be entertained    of its exactness   as  applied to the errors of rude and primi
tive observers, we may safely accept it in the case of the refined and deli
cate observations of modern astronomers.
    It would be scarcely possible in this Abstract to convey any clear idea
of the mathematical analysis employed in reducing the above hypothesis to
calculation.     It will suffice to remark that, whereas in the processes given
by Laplace and Poisson, when applied to the problem before us, the ele
mentary component errors are at first supposed of finite magnitude, and
finite in number, and the results are afterwards modified for the supposition
that the magnitude of the errors becomes infinitesimal and their number
infinite ; much simplicity is gained in this Paper by making these suppo
sitions at the commencement.          Also, instead of taking a simultaneous view
of all the elementary errors,      as affecting the actual or resultant error, the
latter is considered as produced by the superposition of some one of the
elementary errors upon the error produced by the combination of all the
others.    We   are thus led to examine the infinitesimal       change produced in
a given finite error, as expressed by a given function, by the superposition
of a new infinitesimal error ; and from the analytical expression arrived at,
it is shown how to find the form        of the function of error resulting from the
combination of     an infinite number     of given infinitesimal errors. This form
is found to be    altogether independent of the nature or laws of the compo
nent errors.     If we  assume the following      data as known, viz.
         m=sum of the mean values of the component errors,
          A=sum of the mean values of the squares of component errors,
          t=sum of squares of the mean values of component errors,
it is proved that the probability of the actual resulting error being found to
lie between x and x-\-dx is
This result will   be found to agree     with Poisson's.

                                            [Abstract.]
    While the author       was    engaged       in some experimental determinations of
 the changes that take place in the composition of the Cinchona barks
 after being taken from the tree, he noticed a somewhat singular circum
 stance, which induced him to institute               a series of experiments, by which
 he discovered that the various parts of living plants excrete carbonic acid,
 not only in their normal condition, but after they have been deprived for
 days together of all access of oxygen.              The experiments were mostly made
 on cut portions of the plants         ;  but experiments were also made, for control,
 on plants as they actually grow.              The deprivation of oxygen was effected
 sometimes by Sprengel's air-pump, sometimes by substituting for air an
 atmosphere     of hydrogen         or    nitrogen ; while comparative experiments
 were made on plants supplied             with air that had been freed from carbonic
 acid.    The main conclusions to which               he was   led are those enunciated
 by the author     : —
    1st. That nearly all parts of growing plants evolve carbonic acid                  in
 considerable quantities, quite independently of direct oxidation.
    2nd. That this evolution is connected with the life of the plant.
    3rd. That    it is due to two        causes,   namely, to previous oxidation, result
ing after a lapse of time in the production of carbonic acid, and to the
 separation of carbonic acid from the proximate principles of the plant
while undergoing the chemical changes incident to plant-growth.

       F.R.S.        Received    April 15, 1869.
    When the loss of an iron-built vessel has been caused by an error in the
direction of her course by dead reckoning, as derived from her course by
compass, it is a question of scientific interest whether the error has or has
not arisen from an error in the assumed deviation of the compass.                     By
careful consideration       of  all  the    circumstances of the case, and by piecing
together the generally scanty fragments of information which can be
obtained as to the magnetic state of the ship, a probable or certain answer
to this question may be given more frequently                  than might be supposed
possible by those who do not know how perfectly definite and well ascer
tained the laws of the deviation of the compass are, how small is the
number of quantities involved which are peculiar to each particular ship,
and from what apparently slight indications an approximate estimate of
the numerical values       of  these quantities can be made.

     The  case   the circumstances of which       I now propose to lay before the
  Royal Society, is one in which it appears to me that a positive answer to the
  question can be given.       It will, I hope, be found to have some interest as
 an example of the manner in which such an answer can be elicited from
 the data.     It may have some scientific interest as the first case in which
 any information as to the magnetic character of an English merchant-ship
 has been published since the publication of the Third Report of the
 Liverpool Compass Committee in 1861; and I think it will be found to
 have much      practical  interest, as bringing into prominence a particular
 error of great importance, not as yet, I believe, ascertained or corrected in
 the usual course of adjustment of compasses in merchant-ships, even by
 the most experienced and skilful compass-adjusters, but which, ever since
 the mode of ascertaining and correcting it without heeling the ship was
 given in the 'Admiralty Manual for the Deviation of the Compass' in
 1862, has been ascertained, and when necessary corrected, in the ships of
 the Royal Navy, viz. the Heeling Error.             The case to which    I  refer is
                            '             '
 the loss of the ship         Glenorchy     of Glasgow, on the Kish       Bank,    in
 Dublin Bay, on the 1st of January 1869, on which a court of inquiry was
held under the direction of the Board of Trade in pursuance of the
 Merchant    Shipping Act.       In examining this     case I have had the advan
 tage, by the permission of the Board of Trade, of perusing the evidence
taken before the Court of inquiry, and the report of the Court.               I have
also had the advantage of discussing the nautical as well as the magnetical
circumstances of the case with Captain Evans, F.R.S., the highest authority
in all that relates to such an inquiry, and who permits me to state his
concurrence in the conclusions at which I have arrived ; and above all, I
have to express    my obligations to Mr. William Fleming, compass-adjuster,
James Watt Street, Glasgow, for the full particulars with which he has
kindly furnished me of the deviations and correction of the compasses of
the ' Glenorchy ' — information without which the results of this inquiry
would have been in a great measure conjectural.
    The 'Glenorchy'      was an   iron-built sailing-ship of  1200 tons, having an
iron poop, with a wooden deck laid upon iron beams, with iron bulwarks,
except on the poop-deck, above which there was a light rail.                She was
built at Dumbarton in 1868. Her head in building was about N.N.E.
After being launched      she was taken to Glasgow, where she lay         for   some
time head     N.W. taking in a cargo of about 1100 tons of iron railway-
chairs and sleepers.
    She had two compasses on deck — a steering-compass and a standard
compass.     The card of each had two edge-bar needles 8f inches long, the
ends separated 50°.
    The steering-compass      was near the stern, about 32 or 33 inches above
the poop-deck, and 2 feet in front of the steering-wheel, which had an iron
spindle.    The standard compass was on a wooden pillar about 5 feet high,

standing on a wooden platform laid from the poop to the mainmast, and
about 15 feet abaft the mainmast, which was of iron.
     On the 18th of December the 'Glenorchy'         had her compasses     adjusted
in the Gareloch by Mr. Fleming in the usual way.
     The deviation of the steering-compass, as might have been            expected
from the combined effect of the position of the compass in the ship and of
the ship in building, was enormous.        Mr. Fleming says it was "as bad if
not worse than any he ever saw."          Mr. Fleming informs me that before
magnets were applied to the steering-compass, when the ship's head bore
 N. (magnetic) it bore S. by the steering-compass; when the ship's head
 bore   W. (magnetic) it bore about S.W. by S. by the steering-compass.
 In other words, at N. (magnetic) there was a deviation 180°, at W.
 (magnetic) a deviation of about 56° la' E. The quadrantal deviation was
 about 10°.
                                                      '
     These data give, using the notation of the         Admiralty Manual for     the

                                    C=       0,
 or a force of the ship to the stern exceeding by one-fourth the whole
 directive force of the earth's magnetism acting on the compass, a disturbing
 force about twice as great as that found at the steering-compass in any of
  the iron-built armour-plated ships in Her Majesty's Navy.
      This enormous disturbing force was corrected by three large magnets
  one of 36 inches and two of 26 and 28 inches placed together, fore and
  aft, on the starboard side of the binnacle, and by two or three smaller
  magnets placed so as to correct as far as possible the residual error on the
  other cardinal points.
      The ship was then placed head N.W. (magnetic), when a westerly
   deviation of three-fourths of a point 8° 26' was observed. This was of
   course approximately the amount of the quadrantal deviation, and it was
   corrected by a No. 12 iron jack-chain placed in the chain- boxes on each
   side of the compass.
      The ship was then swung on sixteen points and the following deviations
   of the steering-compass obtained (+ signifying that the N. point of the
   needle was drawn to the   E., —    to the W.).

    From these I derive the following expression for the deviation (8) in
terms of the azimuth of the ship's head (£) measured eastward from the
magnetic     N.
           2 = 30'+30' sin     (+  1° 2' cos £+2° 37' sin 2^-38'     cos 2£.
    These values show that the semicircular             deviation  had been entirely
corrected.      Of the quadrantal deviation      a small part appears to have been
uncorrected.        There are practical difficulties in the way of correcting very
large amounts of this deviation by soft iron, and I have no doubt Mr.
Fleming acted with judgment in not attempting to carry this correction
further.      We may probably assume the maximum quadrantal deviation
to have been about 10°.
    The standard compass         was not corrected by magnets, but its deviations
were observed,       and a Table of the deviations furnished.       They    were : —

    This Table     and these values do not bear directly on the loss       of the ship,
because    owing, as    I collect, to the unsteadiness of the pillar the standard
compass was found to be useless, and the ship was navigated by the
steering-compass alone ; but it is interesting from the light it throws on
the general magnetic character of the ship, and its confirmation of the
 results obtained from the steering-compass.
    The proportion of C to —13 exactly agrees with what we know of the
 direction in which the ship was built.
    The large value of — 13 was no doubt owing to the original magnetism
 of  the  hull and not      to the iron     cargo, which     in fact probably     rather
 diminished than increased the — 13.
    Cards containing the deviations of both compasses           were furnished to the
 captain.
    The question of the correction of the standard compass by magnets is
 one which has become        of so much importance that I may be pardoned for
 interposing a digression on this subject and for inserting a passage from
 the third edition of the 'Admiralty Manual' now in the press.

  412           Mr. A. Smith        on the Causes    of the Loss of the    [Apr. 29,
     "The question of the mechanical deviation of the compass has mate
  rially changed its     aspect   of late years.   Before that time the deviation of
  a properly placed standard compass         was   of moderate amount, its maximum
  seldom exceeding 20°, and the directive force which acted upon it being
  generally comprised within the limits of two-thirds and four-thirds of the
  mean force.      There was then no difficulty and some advantage in dis
  pensing altogether with mechanical correction ; or, if mechanical correction
  was employed, it was possible, at least in vessels which did not change
  their magnetic latitude, to make the correction so complete that tabular
  correction might be dispensed with.             But in the present day it is fre
  quently impossible to find a position for the standard compass at which
 the deviation and the variation of directive force do not greatly exceed
 these limits.     In such cases the application of magnets for the purpose of
 equalizing    the  directive force on different azimuths becomes a matter of
 necessity ; while at the same time the danger of trusting to mechanical
 correction alone without ascertaining and applying the residual errors is
 increased.
     " This  change of the condition of the question has produced a corre
 sponding    change    in the practice in the Royal Navy.
     " The same care as before is still used in the-selection of a place for the
 standard compass ; but a magnet is frequently or generally introduced for
 the purpose of equalizing the directive force on different azimuths, and at
 the same time diminishing the semicircular deviation.               The quadrantnl
 deviation is not often corrected mechanically, but is generally left for
 tabular correction.
     " The heeling deviation is always ascertained, and is sometimes corrected
 mechanically."
     After the ' Glenorchy
                                '
                                   was  swung she took in an additional quantity
 (about 120 tons) of iron.          I do not, however, think it possible that this
 quantity   could  have   altered   the deviations sensibly.
    The 'Glenorchy' sailed from Greenock on the 25th of December.               She
 had on board a pilot accustomed to the navigation of the Irish Channel.
 She was towed to Lamlash Harbour, in the Island of Arran, where she
lay till 3 a.m. on the 31st of December.              She then got under way, the
wind blowing moderately from the N.W., and steered a course down mid-
channel, sighting the Copeland, the Mull of Galloway, the North and
South Rock, St.      John's Point, and the Calf of Man lights.
    The wind gradually heading her, she tacked about 6.15 a.m. on the
 1st of January.       At 7.10 a.m. her position was determined by a bearing
and distance    of  the  South Stack Light, which then bore S. by W., distant
five miles.
    Till the ship tacked      she    had been    on the starboard tack, on courses
from S.W. to S., on which the deviation-card gave small deviations for the
steering-compass.         The bearing of the lights successively passed had,

                      Iron-built                '                              413
1869.]                             Sailing-ship   Glenorchy.'
however, been carefully taken by the captain, and from these he found
that the compass had a westerly deviation of one point not shown by the
deviation-card.      From 7.10 a.m. till 3 p.m. the ship was on the port tack,
sailing by the wind but kept good full, her course by the steering-compass
being about S.W. by W.            During the whole of this time a gale of wind
was   blowing from S.S.E., gradually increasing in intensity,          with thick
weather and rain, which cleared only for a little about               1 .30,  when
land was seen in the distance bearing W.N.W.              The lead was cast and
35 fathoms found.            The captain and pilot consulted the chart, and
making what they considered a proper allowance for tide and leeway, came
to the conclusion that the land was Wicklow Head, bearing W.N.W. ,
distant twenty-two miles.
   The ship then stood on the same course till 3 p.m., when soundings
were again taken and 25 fathoms found.           Orders were then given to wear,
but in wearing, and when nearly before the wind, the ship struck and
remained fixed on the Kish Bank, about four miles S. of the Kish
Lightship.
   The point    at which the ship so unexpectedly found herself was about
twenty geographical miles to leeward of that at which the captain and
pilot supposed themselves to be. In other words, the ship's actual course
was   about   28° or     2\ points to the right of her supposed course.          To
what, then, was the error due       1
   In the first   place,  it  seems impossible to attribute any large part   of the
error to an insufficient allowance for the effects of tide and leeway. It is
true that from 7 to 1 o'clock a spring flood-tide, assisted by a southerly
gale, had been      running, but this was known to the captain and pilot.
They had watched with great care throughout the day the courses, the
leeway, and the rate, and, if we may judge from their estimate of the
distance run, had estimated them with great exactness.
   The next cause that suggests itself is a deviation of the compass not
allowed for.
   The steering-compass by which the ship was navigated was, we have
seen, carefully adjusted in the Clyde, and was then nearly correct on a
S.W. by W. course. Is it possible that any change in the magnetism of
the ship had taken place, as has sometimes been found or supposed in new
ships, which would account for the error? The answer to this must be in
                                                                                   '
the negative.      It is certain that any such change in the ' Glenorchy
would have had the effect of producing an error of the opposite kind, and,
had it operated, she would have been found to the south, not to the
north, of her supposed course.
   Is there, then, any other cause adequate to produce an easterly deviation
on a S.W. by W. course which might lurk concealed and undetected in
the process of adjustment and only emerge during the voyage              ? To this
the answer is emphatically Yes ! The Heeling Error.

                                                                     '
414      On the Loss         of the Iron-built Sailing-ship              Glenorchy.'   [Apr. 29,
   From the combined effects of the position of the steering-compass in
the ship and of the ship in building, it is certain that there must have
been a very large heeling error drawing the north point of the compass to
the weather side of the ship.     This error was probably not less than
3° or 4° for each degree of heel on a N. or S. course, before the chain-
correctors were applied.   The chain-correctors would reduce it about 50',
leaving  2° or 3° for each degree of heel.   On a S.W. by W. course this
error would be reduced to five-ninths of its maximum amount, or would
be from 1° to l£° for each degree of heel.      Hence if the 'Glenorchy'
was heeling 10°, she would   certainly have an easterly deviation of a point
to a point and a half, or possibly more, introduced.
   But it may be asked, if the ship had this large amount of heeling
deviation, how did it escape detection in the earlier part of the voyage,
when the ship was on a southerly course and the bearings of the lights
were taken?       and   if    detected, how was          it not allowed for       on   the 1st of
January '/
   The answer to    these questions is remarkable ; it is shortly this.  The
error was detected and was allowed for correctly when the ship was on the
starboard tack.    Afterwards, and when the ship was put on the port tack,
it was still allowed for, but in the same direction as before, and therefore
in the wrong       direction.             It   was  a westerly deviation,
                                                     allowed   for   as
although it had become an easterly deviation    ; and  consequently the
heeling error instead of being corrected, was doubled.  And of this the
cause was as follows.
   Between Greenock and Lamlash, the ship being towed and on even keel,
there were no means of detecting the error.  Between Lamlash and the
Calf of Man, when the ship was on the starboard tack and on a southerly
course, an error of a point of westerly deviation was, as we have seen,
detected and allowed for by the captain. This error I think there cannot
be a doubt was heeling error.
   But when on the morning of the 1st of January the ship tacked and was
put on the port tack, the heeling deviation changed from being a westerly
deviation to being an easterly deviation. The captain not being aware that
there would be this change, and having no opportunity of verifying his
course, continued to make the same allowance as before, and consequently
made    it,
         as   have said, in the wrong direction.
              I                                  As to the fact think                  I      I
cannot be mistaken.
  The captain's words   — " Our observations of the different lights all
                                are   :
the way down Channel showed the compasses were inaccurate, and during
the whole course on the starboard tack we had to steer one point more to
the west than the proper course."
  Then,   speaking of the ship's supposed position at 1.30, he says: —
" The  coursesI  had observed, and the rate we were going, allowing for the
tide and the leeway, and the point the compass was in error while on the

1869.]            On Spectroscopic          Observations     of the Sun.                     415
starboard     tack, should       have brought     us to a point       with Wicklow Head,
lying W. by N., twenty-one miles distant."
  It  is clear from this that the captain made an allowance for the point
of error he had discovered. Had he applied it in the opposite direc
tion, he would undoubtedly have mentioned that he did so and why he
did so.
  The particular conclusions, then, which               I draw   from the facts of the case
are these   :—
   1.There must have been a large heeling error affecting the steering-
               '
compass of the   Glenorchy,' which, on the courses steered, would be a
westerly deviation        on the starboard        tack, an easterly deviation         on the
port tack.
  2. The westerly             deviation   detected on     the    starboard      tack was     this
heeling error.
  3. The true construction to be put on the captain's statement      that              is,
when on the port tack he allowed for the point of deviation which he had
detected on the starboard tack as   point of westerly deviation, not as
                                              a                                                a
point of easterly deviation, as he would have done had he known the
cause and the law of the deviation which he had detected.
   4. That, in consequence, his supposed course was in error one point
plus the heeling deviation, which, on   S.W. by W. course, was probably
                                                  a
about one point  more.
   The general conclusions to be drawn from the history of the ship
wreck seem to me to be           : —
   1.  The great importance of selecting       position for the navigating-
                                                         a
compass where the force of the ship's magnetism       moderate and uniform.
                                                                 is
   2. The importance of extending the usual process of
                                                         " adjustment" of                       a
compass to the ascertaining and (if necessary) the correcting of the heeling
error.   This    ismatter of no difficulty

        Norman Lockyer, F.R.A.S.     Communicated                          by   Dr. Sharpey,
        Sec.R.S. Received April 14, 1869.
 I    beg to lay before the Royal Society very briefly the results of observa
 tions made on the 1th instant in the neighbourhood of fine spot, situated
                          1                                            a
 not very far from the sun's limb.
   I. Under certain conditions the            C   and   F   lines may be observed bright
        on the sun, and in the spot-spectrum             also, as in prominences or in the
      chromosphere.
   II. Under certain conditions, although they are not observed as bright
      lines, the corresponding Fraunhofer lines are blotted out.
    III.    The accompanying changes of refrangibility of the lines in question

        show that the absorbing material moves upwards and downwards as
        regards the radiating material, and that these motions may be deter
        mined with considerable accuracy.
     IV. The bright      lines observable in the ordinary spectrum are sometimes
        interrupted by the spot-spectrum, i. e. they are only visible in those
        parts of the solar spectrum near, and away from, spots.
     V. The C and F lines vary excessively in thickness over and near a spot,
        and on the 1 1 th in the deeper portion of the spot they were much
        thicker than usual.
     IV.   Stars, in the spectrum of which the absorption-lines of hydrogen
        are absent, may either have their chromospheric light radiated from
        beyond the limb just balanced by the light absorbed by the chro
       mosphere on the disk, or they may come under the condition referred
        to in  (II.), either absolutely or on the average.
                      Addendum.      — Received April    29, 1869.
    Since the date on which the foregoing paper was written,            I  have ob
 tained additional evidence on the points referred to.        I  beg therefore to be
 permitted to make the following additions to it.
    The possibility of our being able to determine the velocity of movements
 of uprush and downrush taking place in the chromosphere depends upon
 the alterations of wave-length observed.
    It is clear therefore that a mere uprush or downrush at the sun's limb
will not affect the wave-length, but that if we have at the limb cyclones,
or backward or forward movements, the wave-length will be altered ; so
that we may have : —
    1. An alteration of wave-length near the centre of the disk caused by
       upward or downward movements.
    2.  An alteration of wave-length close to the limb,        caused by backward
       or forward movements.
    If  the hydrogen-lines were invariably observed to broaden out on both
sides, the idea of movement would require to be received                with great
caution ;    we   might   be in presence   of  phenomena due to greater pressure,
both when the lines observed are bright or black upon the sun ; but when
they widen out sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, and some
times on both, this explanation appears to be untenable, as Dr. Frankland
and myself in our researches at the College of Chemistry have never failed
to observe a widening out on both sides the F line when the pressure of
the gas has been increased.
   On the 21st I was enabled to extend my former observations.
   On that day the spot, observations of which form the subject              of the
paper, was       very near the limb      ;  as  this was  the first opportunity of

 observing a fine spot under such circumstances I had been able to utilize,
 I at once commenced work upon it. The spot was so near the limb that
 its spectrum and that of the chromosphere were both visible in the field of
  view.
     The spot-spectrum       was very narrow, as the spot              itself was so greatly
 foreshortened   ; but the spectrum of the chromosphere showed me that the
 whole adjacent limb was covered with prominences of various heights all
 blended together.
     Further, the prominences seemed fed, so to speak, from, apparently, the
 preceding edge of the spot ; for both C, F, and the line near D, were
 magnificently bright on the sun itself, the latter especially striking me
 with its thickness and brilliancy.
     In the prominences C and F were observed to be strangely gnarled,
 knotty, and irregular, and         I thought at once that some "injection" must
be taking place.       I  was      not   mistaken.         On turning to the magnesium
lines I saw them far above              the    spectrum      of the limb and unconnected
with it.
    A  portion of the upper layer of the photosphere had in fact been lifted
 up beyond the usual limits of the chromosphere, and was there floating
cloud-like.
    The vapour of sodium           was also present in the chromosphere, though
not so high as the magnesium, or unconnected with the spectrum of
the limb, and, as I expected, with such a tremendous uplifting force,
 I saw the iron lines (for the first time) in the spectrum of the chromo
sphere.
    My observations commenced at 7.30 a.m.                   ;  by 8.30 there was compara
tive quiet.
    At 9.30 the action had commenced afresh                      ; there was   now a single
prominence.
    At the  base  of the prominence          I   got this appearance     :

418                  Spectroscopic       Observations     of the Sun.         [Apr.    29,
   On the following      side    of the spot, at about 10 a.m.,      I observed that the
F line had disappeared        ;   at the point of disappearance there appeared to
be an elongated brilliantly illuminated               lozenge lying across it at right
angles,  as   if the spectroscope      were  analyzing the light proceeding from a
cyclone of hydrogen on the sun itself, but so near the limb that the
rotatory motion could be detected.
   The next observations I have to lay before the Royal Society were made
on the 27th inst.        Careful observations on the 25th and 26th revealed
nothing    remarkable     except that       the    chromosphere     was   unusually uni
form.
   On the 27th      a fine spot with a long train        of smaller ones and facnloe was
well on the disk.       The photosphere in advance of the spot, and the large
spot  itself,  showed   no alteration from the usual appearance of the hydrogen-
lines ; but in the tails of the spot the case was widely different.
   The F line, at which I worked generally, as the changes of wave-length
are better seen, was as     irregular    as on the former occasions.
   I. It  often stopped short of one of the small spots, swelling out prior to
      disappearance.
   II. It was invisible in a facula between two small spots.
   III. It     was changed into a bright line, and widened out on both side*
      two or three times        in the very small spots.
   IV.   Once     I observed it to become          bright near   a spot, and  to expand
      over it on both sides.
   V. Very many times            near a spot    it widened out, sometimes consider
      ably, on the less refrangible side.
   VI.   Once it extended as a bright line without                any thickening over     a
      small spot.
   VII.   Once it put on this appearance         :
   VIII. I     observed in it all gradations of darkness.
   IX.   When the bright and dark lines were alongside, the latter                     was
      always the less refrangible.
The Society then adjourned over Ascension Day                 to Thursday, May     1 3.

 I. " On      some   of the minor Fluctuations       in the Temperature of the
        Human Body when at rest, and their Cause." By A. H. Garrod,
        St. John's College, Cambridge.         Communicated by Dr. Beale.
        Received April 16, 1869.
    The author's object in the following communication is to show that the
 minor fluctuations in the temperature of the human body, not including
those arising from movements of muscles, mainly result from alterations in
the amount of blood exposed at its surface to the influence of external ab
sorbing and conducting media.
    In  the following Tables, when not otherwise mentioned, all the tempe
ratures are taken under the tongue, the thermometer remaining in the
mouth for five minutes, except when the observations were made each two-
and-a-half minutes, on which occasions the temperature of the bulb         was not
allowed to fall below 85° F.
    It  may be remarked that in no case mentioned below was the tempera
ture of the air above 65° F., and that on all occasions the skin was dry,
whereby any complications from the presence of perceptible moisture were
avoided    ;  and the arguments based on the facts necessitate     an approxima
tion   to those conditions.
   The Tables have      been selected from a great number    of observations ; and
no results have     been obtained which are not easily explained on the theory
given.

   The actual temperature of the body at any given moment must be                                           the
resultant of (1) the amount of heat generated in the body, and (2)                                           the
amount lost by conduction and radiation.
  (1) The source of heat in the body is not considered in this paper;
and no more will be now said of                      it,

believe that      not in the skin itself, and that, for the short periods
                      it   is
through which each observation was made,      approximately uniform.
                                                                  is it

skin and by changes in the surrounding media and these two are mutually
                                                                      ;
dependent.
     It
      has long been known that cold contracts and heat dilates the small
arteries of the skin, respectively raising and lowering the arterial tension,
and thus modifying the amount of blood in the cutaneous capillaries.
   But modifications in the supply of blood to the skin must alter the
amount of heat diffused by the body to surrounding substances and so                               ;
we should expect that by increasing the arterial tension, thus lessening the
cutaneous circulation, the blood would become hotter from there being
less      facility for the diffusion             of its heat, and that             by   lowering   the ten

  1869.]      Fluctuations in  the Temperature    of the Human Body.           425
 sion, thus increasing the cutaneous circulation, the blood would become
 colder throughout the body, from increased facility for conduction and
  radiation.
     That such is the case is proved by Tables I., II., III., IV., V., and VI.,
  where, by stripping the warm body of clothing, in a cold air, when the
 tension was low (as in Tables IV., V., shown by the sphygmograph-trace),
 the temperature and tension rose, at the same time that the surface became
  colder.
     In Tables I., II., III., IV., V., and VI., by covering the nude body with
 badly conducting clothing, when the tension was high, the surface-heat
 soon accumulated sufficiently to cause a sudden reduction of arterial tension,
 commonly called a glow, and a rapid fall in the temperatures, from the
 larger amount of blood exposed at the surface of the body to the influence
 of colder media.
     Changes in the arterial tension are easily recognized by the subject of
 experiment, from the sensations they produce ; a feeling of warmth fol
 lowed by a shiver, or a shiver itself, generally shows that the tension is
 lowered, while the opposite effect follows a rise in the tension ; and this
 can be generally confirmed by the sphygmograph-trace.               A bounding
 weak pulse shows a low, and a small thready one a high tension.
    We know, from the observations of Davy and others, that by reducing
 the tension in one part of the body the tension of other parts is lowered ;
 thus by placing one hand in hot water, a thermometer in the other rises.
 In Tables VII. and     VIII.  it is shown that by putting the feet in hot water
 (at  1 10° to 115°) the lowering of the tension was so great that the amount
 of heat lost into the air considerably      exceeded  that gained to the body
 from the water, so that the temperature of the body began to fall di
 rectly, and decreased considerably ; and it was noticed that on adding more
 hot water chills were produced, which was the same as the effect of first
 putting the feet in the water.
    By covering a small part of the body with a bad conductor, the ten
 sion of the whole body soon falls, from the accumulation of heat in the
 covered parts causing a lowering in the tension generally, and a con
 sequent greater carrying away of heat.         In this way the fall after sitting
 down on a bad conductor when nude can be explained (Table VII;).
    A glow is felt in the skin directly upon short muscular movement, as
 stooping, and the temperature falls at the same time, as in Table       IV.,   be
tween 1 1.45 and 12.20, and in Table XI., between 5.0 and 5.15.            In   the
latter case the muscular movement was carried to such an extent that the
loss was made      up for by the increase of heat from the muscular move
ment.
    Simply heating the feet lowers the tension and temperature together, as
in Table IX. and in Table X. The passage of a cloud before the sun
seems to have acted     by reducing the loss of heat,   as the temperature rose
at the time.

     Further confirmation of the facts stated as to the modification of arterial
 tension may be found in Marey's work, ' De la Circulation du Sang,'
 published in Paris in 1863.          In that book the author ascribes the uni
 formity of   the  heat in the   internal  parts to the same cause as the author of
 the present paper ascribes the variations.
     The fact observed by Dr. W. Ogle in the St. George's Hospital Reports
 for 1866, and by Drs. Ringer and Stewart in a paper read before the Royal
 Society this year, that the temperature falls at night, and is lowest at from
  12 to 1 a.m., and begins to rise after that time, is simply explained on
 the theory given above ; for it depends on the custom of Englishmen going
 to bed at about that hour, and thus giving a large amount of heat to the
 cold bedelothes, which at first is expended in warming the sheets &c,
 while later on in the night the bedelothes are warm, and therefore the
 body has only to make up for the heat diffused.
     Other natural phenomena can be similarly explained.          Thus, on a cold
 day, the effect of sitting with one side of the body in the direct rays of a
 fire is to cause the other side to feel much colder than if there was no
 fire at all, because the fire lowers the tension over the whole body, and
 supplies heat to the full cutaneous vessels of one side, while the other side,
 being equally supplied with blood in the skin, does not receive heat, but
 has to distribute it rapidly to the cold clothes &c.

    The observations made by the author were of the three usual elements
— the Dip,     Declination, and Intensity of the Horizontal Component of the
Force.     They were taken with instruments supplied to the Colaba Obser
vatory in the year 1867 through the Kew Committee of the British Asso
ciation, after having been tested at the Kew Observatory.           The dip-circle
was made by Barrow of London, and is furnished with two needles ; the other
instrument, the unifilar magnetometer, which serves both for observations
of declination and horizontal force, was made by Elliott Brothers of Lon
don.     The results of the observations for dip only have as yet been received
from the author.
    A complete observation consists of thirty-two readings, each end of the
needle being read twice in each different position of the needle and circle ;
and the mean of the thirty-two is taken as the result of the observation.
The observations     were   1 78   in number,    commencing on the 29th of April
1867, and extending to the 29th of December 1868.                They were gene
rally taken, with the two needles alternately, on particular days of the

1869.]        Mr. C. Chambers     on Magnetic Dip-Observations.             427
week.     Up to August 17, 1867, the observations commenced with either
end   (A  or B) of the needle dipping, and without remagnetizing the needle ;
i. e. the magnetization for the latter half of one observation was made to
serve   for the first half of the next observation with the same needle, the
 two needles having been kept during the interval with contrary poles ad
jacent in a zinc box ; but after August 1 7, 1867, the needle was always re-
 magnetized, so as to make the end A dip during the first half of the obser
vation.     The effect of this change of practice was to produce a marked
increase in the accordance of successive observations.         Tables are given
containing every complete observation made up to the end of 1868, and
showing, as well as the mean dip, the partial results in each position of the
circle, and with each end of the needle dipping, and also the mean weekly
and mean monthly values.        The mean dip obtained for the months April
to December 1867 was 19° 2'-00, and for the year 1868 was 19°3'-87.
The period embraced by the observations is too limited to allow of an exact
determination of the rate of secular change ; nevertheless the observations
show distinctly that the dip is increasing.      The author takes + 1''3 as the
rate of annual change.
   For the probable error of a single weekly determination, including the
effect of actual magnetic disturbance of an irregular character, the author
obtains for the period from April 29 to August 16, 1867, 0,-67; from
August 23 to December 31, 1867, 0'-26 ; from January 1 to December31,
 1868, 0,-24.    Notwithstanding     the extreme smallness of these probable
errors, the indications of needle No. 2 exceeded       those of needle No. 1 by
quantities ranging,   in the means    of periods of a few months, from about 0
to +5'-0.      An endeavour is made in another communication to explain a
possible cause of these differences.
III.   " On   the Uneliminated     Instrumental     Error in the Observations
       of Magnetic Dip."       By Charles Chambers, Esq., Superinten
       dent of the Government Observatory, Bombay.              Communicated
       by Lieut.-General Sarine, E.A., President.           Received   April 15,
       1869.
                                    (Abstract.)
   A single reading of one end of a dipping-needle placed in a dip-circle pro
vided with microscopes for observing is liable to a variety of instrumental
errors, which are eliminated by taking the mean of the sixteen readings of the
two ends in the eight different positions included in a complete observation.
Nevertheless it is found that with the best modern instruments a mean
value results from these sixteen observations different for each different
needle, and that the difference between the results obtained with two
different needles is not the same at all times.
    The irregularities in the values of the dip observed at Bombay with two
 needles of excellent character made by Barrow of London, led the author

 428        Mr. C. Chambers on Magnetic Dip-Observations.            [May 13,
 to investigate the effect of a hypothetical irregularity in the shape of the
 axle of the needle, such that a section of the axle by a plane perpendicular
 to its axis would be elliptical instead of circular in form.   Another source
 of error, which   was brought to the notice  of the Royal Society many years
 ago in a paper published in the Proceedings, is the displacement of the
 centre of gravity of the needle from the centre of the axle, combined with in
equality in the magnetization of the needle when the poles are direct and re
versed.     Experience has led the author to the conclusion that the usual
 method of magnetization, by a definite number of passes of the same pair of
 bar-magnets, communicates magnetism to the needle very unequally when
the one end of the needle is made north and when the other end is made
 north.    Consequently it is advisable to investigate the effects of ellipticity
of the axle and of displacement of the centre of gravity at the same time,
 which the author proceeds to do.
    As each of these errors depends upon two independent unknown quanti
 ties, suppose the excentricity and the azimuth of the major axis of the
elliptic section of the axle for the first, and the two coordinates of the
 centre of gravity, referred to axes in the plane of motion of the needle and
passing through the centre of the axle, for the second, the equation con
 necting the true and apparent dip, in any one position of the needle and of
 the face of the dip-circle, will involve four unknown quantities depending
on the above errors.      If we suppose the instrumental errors small, so that
 the apparent dip does not much differ from the true dip, these four unknown
 quantities will appear as coefficients respectively of the sine and of the
cosine of twice the dip for the elliptic error, and of the sine and the cosine
of the dip for the error of excentricity of the centre of gravity, and will be
divided in each case by the magnetic moment of the needle.          On taking
the mean of the apparent dips in the four usual positions of the needle and
of the dip-circle before the magnetism of the needle is reversed, two of the
terms, one for each error, disappear, and there results for the difference
between    the true dip 0 and the mean of the four apparent dips (0') an
equation of the form
                            »'(A-B)=(0')-0                                    (])
where n' is the reciprocal of the magnetic moment of the needle, and A and
B are the constants depending on the errors of the pivot and of the centre of
gravity respectively.    These two quantities are constant only for the same
place, the first involving as a factor the sine of twice the dip divided by
the total force, the second the cosine of the dip divided by the total force.
    Now let the poles be reversed in the usual way, and let n" be the reci
procal of the magnetic moment, and (0") the mean apparent dip in the four
positions after remagnetization ; then
                             »"(A+B)=(0")-0                                  (2)
    The equations (1), (2) contain three unknown quantities A, B, 0 ; but if
we repeat the observations with the difference that this time the needle is

magnetized as weakly as is consistent with the condition that the apparent
shall not greatly differ from the true dip, we shall obtain two more equa
tions of the form
                            »"'(A-B)=((T)-0,
                            »""(A + B)=(6"")-0;
and these four equations, when suitably combined, will determine the values
of the three unknown quantities A, B, 0.
   The magnetic moments involved in these equations may be determined
with little trouble, and with sufficient accuracy, by placing the needle as a
deflector on a unifilar magnetometer, and observing the angle of deflection
produced thereby upon the suspended magnet.
   A series of observations has been commenced by the author with the view
of testing whether the true dip can be determined exactly with a single
needle by the method above described, the results of which he hopes to
communicate to the Royal Society hereafter.

 I. "  On the Laws and Principles concerned in the Aggregation of
       Blood-corpuscles both within and without the vessels."                By
       Richard Norris, M.D., Professor of Physiology, Queen's Col
       lege, Birmingham.      Communicated by Dr. Sharpey.            Received
       April 29, 1869.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In 1827, or forty-one years ago, the phenomenon which forms the sub
ject of this paper was first observed by Mr. Joseph Jackson Lister and
 the late Dr. Hodgkin.
    To these observers the microscope revealed the fact that if a minute drop
 of human blood is placed between two plates of glass, the red corpuscles
apply themselves to each other by their concave surfaces in such a manner
as to form long cylindrical masses, which resemble piles of coin, and that
very frequently these piles are so arranged as to form with each other a
complete network of rouleaux with clear intervening spaces occupied by
liquor sanguinis.
   Simple as this observation may appear, its importance in a pathological
point of view   can scarcely be overrated ; for upon its correct interpretation
depends our knowledge of the real nature of one of the most marked cha
racteristics of inflammation, viz. the phenomenon of inflammatory or homo
geneous stasis.
   During the forty years which have       elapsed  since the discovery of this

   430       Dr. Norris on the Aggregation of Blood-corpuscles.         [May 27,
  fact, many theories have been advanced to explain its nature ; but all of
  them, without exception, have laboured under the disadvantage of being
  purely hypothetical in their character, and quite incapable of demonstra
  tion by an appeal to experiment.           Thus, while some writers have attri
  buted the effect to an imaginary law of vital attraction, others have more
  correctly referred it to the operation of some unexplained physical cause.
     Professor Lister (son of the original observer already mentioned), who
  has devoted much attention to this subject, says, in a paper submitted to
  the Royal Society, June 18, 1857, and published in the Philosophical
  Transactions for 1858, p. 648 : — " For my own part, I am satisfied that the
  rouleaux are simply the result of the biconcave form of the red disks, to
 gether with a certain though not very great degree of adhesiveness, which
  retains them pretty firmly attached together when in the position most
  favourable for its operation, viz. when the margins of their concave
  surfaces are applied accurately together, but allows them to slip upon one
  another when in any other position.         There is never to be seen anything
  indicating the existence      of an attractive force drawing the corpuscles
  towards each other    :  they merely stick together when brought into contact
 by accidental causes.       Their adhesiveness does not affect themselves alone,
 but other substances also, as may be seen when blood is in motion in an
 extremely thin film between two plates of glass, when they may be observed
 sticking for a longer or shorter time to one of the surfaces of the glass, each
 one dragging behind      it a short tail-like process."
     Again, at the end of section I., p. 652 of the same paper, Lister says,
 " From the facts detailed in this section, it appears that the aggregation
of the corpuscles of blood removed from the body depends on their pos
 sessing a certain degree of mutual adhesiveness, which is much greater in
 the colourless globules than in the red disks, and that in the latter this
property, though apparently not dependent upon vitality, is capable of
remarkable variations in consequence of very slight chemical changes in the
liquor sanguinis."
    From these quotations it is apparent that Mr. Lister ignores altogether the
idea of the aggregation of the corpuscles being due to an attractive force
or energy, and refers it to adhesiveness or stickiness of the corpuscles ; in
his own words,    "  they merely stick together when brought into contact by
accidental causes."       At the same time he states that this adhesiveness is
liable to great variations, both in the way of increase and diminution, by
very slight changes in the chemical qualities of the plasma.
    Dipping deeper into the writings of Lister, we find that this idea of
adhesiveness   or stickiness of the corpuscles is retained in his explanation of
the nature of inflammatory stasis. And his views upon the subject generally
may be summed up in three propositions : —
    1.  The blood-corpuscles exhibit no tendency to unite together in healthy
blood within the vessels, although such blood may be in a state of rest.
    2. The corpuscles become suddenly adhesive (in 10
                                                              seconds) when, by
being shed, the blood is brought into contact with ordinary matter.

1869.]        Dr. Norris on the Aggregation of Blood- corpuscles.           431
    3. Irritation, by reducing the vitality of the surrounding tissues, causes
them to bear the same relation to the blood within the vessels in their
immediate vicinity as ordinary matter does to that which has been shed,
inducing    adhesiveness of the corpuscles, and thus bringing about inflam
matory    stasis.
    These effects upon the blood-corpuscles are assumed by Lister to depend
upon chemical changes induced by ordinary matter or by vitally degraded
tissues upon the plasma of the blood ; but inasmuch as chemical changes
cannot occur without      corresponding physical modifications, it is quite as
rational to refer the increased aggregating-tendency displayed by the cor
puscles to physical as to chemical changes in the liquor sanguinis ; and this
view has the advantage of not requiring us to believe that the functional
activity of the tissues is depressed by mild forms of irritation — an idea which
is opposed to all we know of the increased nutritive and formative changes
which follow in the wake of irritation.
    Having now briefly reviewed the existing position of the subject, we
will proceed to consider the real causes at work in the production of the
phenomenon under consideration.
    Many years since, having familiarized myself with the behaviour of, and
the appearances presented by blood-corpuscles under almost every con
ceivable -condition,    both within and without the vessels, I became pro
foundly impressed      with  the conviction that these phenomena had their
 origin in some physical law of attraction, and at the same time felt not the
less certain that, if this view proved to be correct, the behaviour of the
 blood-corpuscles would be found to be no isolated exhibition of this law,
 and that, provided conditions similar to those which exist in the case of
 the blood-corpuscles could be obtained, many illustrative examples of the
 operation of the law would be immediately forthcoming.
    That such attractive force did not exert its influence through distances
readily appreciable was obvious, and this fact at once indicated that it
must be sought for among those forms of attraction which have been
 designated molecular.
    After much experiment and reflection    I came, in 1862, to the conclusion
 that  these   phenomena were due to no less universal a law than that of
 cohesive attraction   ; and I embodied the views I then held upon the subject
in  a paper which was read before the Royal Society, and published in the
 Proceedings, entitled
                         " The Causes of various Phenomena of Attraction and
 Adhesion as exhibited in Solid Bodies, Films, Vesicles, Liquid Globules, and
Blood-corpuscles."       Since that time other departments of physiology have
occupied my attention ; and I have only been induced to recur to the old
theme because     I find that, in some recent references to the history of this
subject, my observations have not been mentioned, from which I am
led to infer either that my views had not been sufficiently put forward,
or that my experiments had failed to produce conviction in others.              I
therefore now present the result of a renewed investigation, in which            I

   432        Dr. Norris on     the   Aggregation of Blood-corpuscles.            [May 27,
   believe  I have established, by conclusive experiments, the correctness of
  my    explanation    of the phenomena.
      Among the various modes of aggregation which the blood -corpuscles
  undergo, two typical forms stand prominently forward, of which all others
  are   merely modifications.         The one appears to be dependent upon the
  normal disk-shape, the other upon the globular or spherical form which
  the corpuscles assume on the addition of various substances to the blood,
  such as gum, gelatine, linseed mucilage, potash, &c.
     With the first of these modes of aggregation, viz. into rouleaux, we are
  all sufficiently familiar ; and an excellent notion of the character of the
  second form may be obtained by a careful examination of microphoto-
  graphs of the blood-corpuscles which have been obtained instantaneously by
  exploding magnesium in heated oxygen*.
      In order   to leave as   little  as possible to hypothesis,      it was desirable    as
  a preliminary     step to make sure      that these differences in form       of the   cor
  puscles were the real cause       of the diverse modes of arrangement         — whether,
  in fact, we could safely predicate that disk-shaped bodies having an attrac
 tion for each other would arrange themselves so as to form rolls or cylin
 drical masses, and whether, on the other hand, attracting spheres of soft
 material would attach themselves together in such a fashion as to cause
 plane surfaces to be opposed to each other — in a word, to convert them
 selves    by mutual attraction into polyhedral bodies just as they might do
 under mutual compression.
     In the first place, we had to ascertain experimentally how disk-shaped
 bodies, having the utmost freedom of movement, and possessing an attrac
 tion for each other, would arrange themselves.
     In casting about for the conditions to make such an experiment,                   I  re
 membered a very familiar phenomenon              which    had  often excited my curi
 osity,  viz. the  rapidity  with   which  a bubble  or a small  floating fragment upon
 the surface of a cup of tea or other liquid rushes to the side of the con
 taining vessel, or with which two such bubbles or fragments rush together,
 the moment they approach within a certain range.                 I determined to see if
 I could not make use of this attraction, the true nature of which I at the
 time imperfectly understood, and with this object prepared a number of
circular     disks of cork, which        I  accurately poised so that they should
 assume     and maintain      the vertical position when partially immersed in
liquid.     On    throwing    these disks into liquid, I had the satisfaction of
seeing them run together and form themselves into                      the most perfect
rouleaux after the fashion of the blood-disks.
    This    experiment has the value of demonstrating that if the blood-
disks    attracted   each other, their shape would determine the formation of
rouleaux.
     As regards the behaviour of spherical vesicles or globules which attract
    * Specimens of these, as well as the several experiments referred to in the paper, were
exhibited to the Society.

each other,     it   is found that the moment any point        in their convex surfaces is
made to touch, these surfaces become flattened, and consequently bubbles
in a group convert each other into polyhedral- shaped bodies. This effect
is not due to compression, but to a progressive mutual attraction of the
surfaces of these bodies for each other.
     As soap-bubbles              with aerial contents, and are therefore
                             are vesicles
physically unlike the blood-corpuscles, it became desirable to ascertain how
vesicles with liquid contents would behave in regard to each other.      This
was accomplished by placing in a large test-tube a solution of soap, and
upon its surface a stratum of petroleum an inch or so in depth ; the petro
leum does not mix with or injure the soap solution, which is the case with
most other substances.           A
                             glass tube is now passed through the petroleum
into the solution of soap below.    On blowing down the tube, we succeed in
forming  innumerable   small bodies  or corpuscles of a spherical form, which
are very plastic, and the contents of which consist of petroleum, and the ex
ternal envelope or vesicle of soap. Corpuscles so produced float in the upper
stratum of petroleum, and are found to unite themselves into groups and
masses   in precisely the manner of the air-bubbles, although they are en
tirely submerged in liquid.
    These experiments show that disk-shaped bodies, having an attraction
for each other, will arrange themselves in rolls or cylindrical masses, and
that spherical bodies of a plastic character and vesicular structure, be their
contents-aerial or liquid, will attach themselves together in such a fashion
as to cause plane surfaces to be opposed to each other — in a word, convert
themselves by a progressive attraction, which commences at their points of
mutual contact, into groups of polyhedral bodies.
   The question now remaining                is,
                                     do the blood-corpuscles possess such
attractions for each other as those displayed by the objects with which we
have been dealing      The reply
                         ?           that their physical nature being analo
                                            is
gous,  if the same conditions exist, they cannot escape the influence of the
same law.   An examination of the photographs and of the drawings of
blood-corpuscles exhibited will serve to show that these bodies are amenable
to the law which        is   concerned in grouping together the bubbles and liquid
vesicles.
     But in the      cases we have heretofore been considering, the disks, bubbles,
and other              objects are not in precisely the same conditions
                  factitious
as the blood-corpuscles — the former being only partially, or not at all
submerged in liquid, while the latter are entirely so, and nevertheless they
run together into rouleaux and groups. It may fairly be asked            the        if
artificial bodies will do the same.                The answer obtained by experiment     is,
that the moment these disks or bubbles are entirely submerged, they lose
at once their attraction for each other and fall apart.
     For    several years I    unceasingly asked myself the cause of this difference
in   behaviour.   I    at length found that when small bodies, such as disks of cork
or gelatine, are first wetted with water, and then submerged in             a   liquid with

434        Dr. Norris on              the   Aggregation of Blood- corpuscles.           [May 27,
which water will not mix, such as oil of turpentine or petroleum, they will
run together in piles or rouleaux, very much in the same way as the
blood-disks.
     To understand this result,       simple primary principles must be
                                                  a few
called to mind.            In the first
                             place, the particles which compose any liquid
have a mutual attraction for each other ; but between the particles which
compose different liquids a mutual repulsion may exist, e.g. water aud oil,
or chloroform and water.                    It   is likewise true that there is a   mutual attrac
tion between certain liquid and rigid bodies, and also a mutual repulsion
between others.   Any rigid body which can be wetted by a liquid is re
garded as having a cohesive attraction for it, while one which cannot be
wetted is said to have no such attraction, or to exert a repulsive influence,
as the case may be.
  These phenomena therefore depend upon what might be justly termed
double cohesion — cohesion in the first place between the rigid body and
the liquid, and in the second place between the particles                            of the liquid
itself.
     If,
      now, we examine into the cases in which we have complete sub
mergence, viz. the blood-rolls, the gelatine disks, and the loaded cork disks,
we find the same law to be in operation. These bodies must all be regarded
as localizers of liquids, either by their cohesive attraction for liquids, or, as
in the case of the blood-corpuscles,                      by
                                          being receptacles containing liquids.
   If the cork disks, bubbles, or other bodies are entirely submerged
                                                                                                is in
water, all     attraction            ceases,     and this because
                                                     cohesive equilibriuma

                                is
water and air.    If, however, after having wetted these bodies in water, we
completely submerge them in   liquid which has cohesive antagonism to
                                                 a                       a
water, or even liquid which
                       a    has  simply no cohesion for water, which may
be known by the             insolubility and immiscibility of
                                                        liquid in the other, one
such as turpentine or petroleum, we get the phenomena     of attraction pre
cisely as in the atmosphere.    This fact   illustrated by taking the cork
                                                               is
disks from the water in which they are non-adherent, and placing them in
the vessel of petroleum, in which they become instantly attractive of each
other.
     This principle        is   further illustrated by the gelatine disks, which are first
made       to absorb as much water as possible, and are then submerged                          in
petroleum.
   In all these cases there are present, therefore, two dissimilar or antago
nistic liquids    and upon the presence of these the phenomena depend.

   My idea of the blood-corpuscle       that its contents are something essen
                                                      is
tially different, so far as cohesive attraction     concerned, from the liquor

isof course self-evident,               if,
                             according to some modern views, we regard the
corpuscles
           " as tiny lumps of uniformly viscous matter," inasmuch as
                                                  a
such matter must be insoluble in and immiscible with the liquor sanguinis.

The  explanation is equally easy if we accept the old and,     believe, the            I
true view, of the vesicular character of these bodies, as we have only to
assume    that the envelope is so saturated with the corpuscular contents
as practically to act as such contents would themselves act, i. e. to exhibit
a greater cohesive attraction               for their own particles than for those of the
contiguous liquid.
  The cohesive power of the blood-corpuscles varies with varying conditions
of the liquor sanguinis ; and this is doubtless due to the law of osmosis ;
for   we can readily imagine that when the exosmotic tendency is in excess,
the corpuscles will          more adhesive, and, on the contrary, when the
                            become
endosmotic    current prevails, less so. In any case the increased cohesive-
ness will be due to the increased extrusion                     of the corpuscular contents
upon the surface.
   All, then, that is required in the       of the blood-corpuscles, is a differ
                                                  case
ence between their liquid contents and the plasma in which they are sub
merged.     That this difference is not so great as between the liquids used
in these experiments is probable ; but it must also be remembered that the
attraction is not so powerful.      The power required to attach the blood-
corpuscles together          is,
                         on account of their exceeding minuteness, extremely
small, as they are thus so much more removed from the influence of gravi
tation, and brought under that of molecular attraction.

the stagnating mass      in the  vessel  appears to thaw as it were.    The corpuscles
are not pushed onwards         in  mass as a coherent   plug  ;  but the homogeneity
of appearance    is suddenly lost by the resumption of          their normal form by
the corpuscles and the reappearance of their differentiating outlines, which
 were previously obscured by their blending with one another and with the
 walls  of the  vessels.     Before    this takes place, the vessel very gradually
 assumes a lighter tint, passing in some instances from a deep red to a pale
 orange.    This appears to be due to a washing away of extruded colouring-
 matter.
    When this change from             homogeneity to heterogeneity         commences,
 although sufficiently progressive in its character as it traverses the vessel,
 it nevertheless takes place with considerable rapidity. It is evidently
 brought about by the gradual permeation of new liquor sanguinis among the
 corpuscles, and the contemporaneous abolition of their cohesive attraction
 for each other in accordance with the principles previously            established.

    From four     species    of Touraco,    or Plantain-eater,    the author has      ex
 tracted a remarkable red pigment. It occurs in about fifteen of the primary
 and secondary pinion feathers of the birds in question, and may be ex
 tracted by a dilute alkaline solution, and reprecipitated without change
 by an acid.    It is distinguished from all other natural pigments yet iso
 lated, by the presence of 5-9 per cent, of copper, which cannot be removed
 withoutthe destruction of the colouring- matter itself.            The author pro
 poses   the name turacine for this pigment.             The spectrum of turacine
 shows two black absorption-bands, similar to those of scarlet cruorine ;
 turacine, however, differs from cruorine in many particulars.              It  exhibits
 great constancy    of composition,      even  when   derived   from  different  genera
 and species of Plantain-eater ; as, for example, the Musophaga violaceo,
 the Corythaix albo-cristata,        and the C. porphyreolopha.

                oP  Rosse, F.R.S.          Received May 27, 1869.
     The following experiments on Lunar Radiant Heat were undertaken
  with the view of ascertaining whether with more powerful and more
  suitable means than those previously employed by others, with little or
  no success, it would be possible to detect and estimate the amount            of heat
  which reaches the earth's surface from the moon.

 1869.]                       Heat from the Moon.                          437
    Professor Piazzi Smyth had conducted a series of experiments on the
 Peak of Teneriffe with a thermopile, but apparently without any means
 of concentrating the moon's heat beyond the ordinary polished metal cone.
    Melloni had employed      a glass lens of considerable diameter (I believe
 about   three feet) ; but as glass absorbs rays of low refrangibility, it was
 not so well adapted to concentrate heat as a metallic mirror.
    In the following experiments the point sought to be determined was, in
 what proportions the moon's heat consists of
    (1) That coming from the interior of the moon, which will not vary
 with the phase.
     (2) That which falls from the sun on the moon's surface, and is at
 once reflected regularly and irregularly.
    (3) That which, falling from the sun on the moon's surface, is absorbed,
 raises the temperature of the moon's surface, and is afterwards radiated as
 heat of low refrangibility.
    The apparatus consisted of a thermopile of four elements, the faces half
 an inch square, on which all the moon's heat which falls on the large
 speculum of the 3-foot telescope is concentrated, by means of a concave
              \
 mirror of 3 inches aperture, 2'8 inches focal length.
    As it was found difficult to compensate the effects of unequal radiation
 on the anterior face of the pile, by exposing the posterior face also of the
same    pile to radiation  from the sky, during the later experiments (be
ginning with March 23rd) two piles were used, and the following was the
form of apparatus adopted.
    D E is the large mirror of the telescope ; F G the two small concave
mirrors of 3| inches aperture, and 2-8 inches focal length, fixed in the
plane of the image formed by the large mirror D E. The two thermo
piles are placed respectively in the foci of F and G, their anterior faces
shielded from wind and other disturbing causes by polished brass cones,
and their posterior faces kept at a nearly uniform temperature by means
of brass caps filled with water.         The thermopiles and accompanying
mirrors are supported by a bar screwed temporarily on the mouth of the
tube.     Two wires are connected with the two poles of each pile ; and the
ends of the wires are connected, two and two, close to the galvanometer,
in such a manner that a given amount of heat on the anterior face of one
pile will produce a deviation equal in amount, and opposite in direction, to
that produced by an equal amount of heat on the anterior face of the
other pile.     Thomson's   Reflecting Galvanometer was the one used.
                                                              2 k  2

and calculated quantities of heat, the results suggest to us that the law of
variation of the moon's heat will probably be found not to differ much from
that of the moon's light.       It therefore follows that not more than a small
part  of the  moon's   heat can  come from the first of the three sources already
mentioned.
    With the view of ascertaining what proportion of the sun's heat      does not
leave the moon's surface until after it has been absorbed, some readings of
the galvanometer were taken on four different nights near the time of full
moon, with a disk of thin plate glass in front of the face of each pile     ; and
the deviation was about six or eight divisions.
    As the glass  screens were examined     with  care for dew after removal on
each night,    and none was perceived except on one occasion, the probable
percentage of the   moon's heat which passes through plate glass is 8, or rather
less.
    Few experiments appear to have been made on the absorptive power of
glass for the sun's rays ; but, from the best data that I have been able to
obtain,  I find that probably about 80 per cent. pass through glass.
   The greater part of the moon's heat which reaches the earth appears,
therefore, to have been first absorbed by the lunar surface.
   It now appeared desirable to verify this result, as far as possible, by de
termining by direct experiment the proportion which exists between the
heat which reaches the earth from the sun and from the moon.
   If we start with the assumption that the sun's heat is composed of two
portions,
                    the luminous rays, whose amount =       L,

   Owing to the extremely uncertain state of the weather, only one series of
eighteen readings was obtained for the determination of the sun's heat. A
beam   of sunlight was thrown, by means of a plane mirror, alternately on and
off a plate of polished metal with a hole • 1 75 inch in diameter. At a short
distance behind this the pile was placed.         The deviation thus found was

 theoretical point of view.            It was assumed

In deducing this result allowance has been made for the imperfect ab
sorption of the sun's rays by the lunar surface.
     In the present imperfect state of these observations it would be prema
ture to discuss them at greater length ; but as some months must elapse
before any more complete series can be obtained, and the present results
are sufficient to show conclusively that the moon's heat is capable of being
detected with certainty by the thermopile,               I  have thought it best to send
this account to the Royal Society ;              and I  shall be most happy to receive
suggestions as to improvements in the method of working, and as to the
direction in which it may be most desirable to carry on future experiments.
IV. " On a New Arrangement of Binocular Spectrum-Microscope."
      By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c. Received April 23, 1869.
     The spectrum-microscope, as usually made, possesses several disadvan
 tages : it is only adapted for one eyef ; the prisms having to be introduced
 over the eyepiece renders it necessary to remove the eye from the instru
 ment, and alter the adjustment, before passing from the ordinary view of an
 object to that of its spectrum, and vice vend ; the field of view is limited,
 and the dispersion comparatively small.
     I have devised, and for some time past have been working with, an in
 strument in which the above objections are obviated, although at the same
 time certain minor advantages possessed by the ordinary instrument, such
 as   convenience of examining the light reflected from an object, and com
 paring its spectrum with a standard spectrum, are not so readily associated
 with the present form of arrangement.
     The    new   spectrum-apparatus consists of two parts, which are readily
 attached to an ordinary single or binocular microscope ; and when attached
 they can be thrown in or out of adjustment by a touch of the finger, and
 may readily be used in conjunction with the polariscope or dichrooscope ;
 object-glasses of high or low power can be used, although the appearances
are more      striking with a power of £-inch focus or longer ; and an object as
small as a single corpuscle of blood can be examined anditsspectrum observed.
    * This may seem a very large rise of temperature ; but it is quite in accordance with
the views of Sir John Herschel on the subject (Outlines of Astronomy, section 432 and
preceding sections), where he says that, in consequence of the long period of rotation of the
moon on its axis, and still more the absence of an atmosphere,
                                                                    " The climate of the moon
must be most extraordinary, the alternation being that of unmitigated and burning sun
shine, fiercer than that of an equatoreal noon ; and the keenest severity of frost, far ex
ceeding that    of our polar winters, for an equal time."     And again,  " . . . . the surface of
the   full moon  exposed to us must    necessarily be very much heated, possibly to a degree
much exceeding      that of boiling water."
    t  Mr. Sorby in several of his papers (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1867, xv. p. 433 ; ' How to Work
with the Microscope,' by L. Beale, F.R.S., 4th edition, p. 219) refers to a binocular
spectrum-microscope      ; but he gives no description of it, and in one part says that it is not
suited for the examination of any substance less than           of an inch in diameter.

   The two additions to the microscope consist of the substage with slit
&c., and the prisms in their box.       The substage is of the ordinary con
struction, with screw adjustment for centring, and rackwork for bringing
it nearer to or withdrawing it from the stage. Its general appearance is
shown in fig. 1, which represents it in position.     A B is a plate of brass,

sliding in grooves attached to the lower part of the substage; it carries
an adjustable slit, C, a circular aperture, D, 0 6 inch in diameter, and an
aperture, O, ^ inch square. A spring top enables either the slit or one of the
apertures to be brought into the centre of the field without moving the eye
from the eyepiece.     Screw adjustments enable the slit to be widened or
narrowed at will, and also varied in length. At the upper part of the sub-
stage is a screw  of the standard   size, into which an object-glass of high
power is fitted.   E represents one in position. I generally prefer a j-inch
 power  ; but it may sometimes be found advisable to use other powers here.

The slit C and the object glass E are about 2 inches apart ; and if light is
 reflected by means of the mirror along the axis of the instrument, it is
 evident that the object-glass E will form a small image of the slit C, about
 0-3 inch in front of it. The milled head F moves the whole substage up
 or down the axis of the microscope, whilst the screws G and H, at right
 angles to each other, will bring the image of the slit into any desired part
 of the field.     If the slide A B is pushed in so as to bring the circular
 aperture D in the centre, the substage arrangement then becomes similar
 to the old form of achromatic condenser. Beneath the slit C is an arrange
 ment for holding an object, in case its surface is too irregular, or substance
 too dense, to enable its spectrum to be properly viewed in the ordinary
 way*.
     Supposing an object is on the upper stage of the microscope (shown in
 fig. 2) and viewed by light transmitted from the mirror through the large
 aperture D and the condenser E, by pushing in the slide A B so as to
 bring the slit C into the field, and then turning the milled head F, it is evi
 dent that a luminous image of the slit C can be projected on to the object;
 and by proper adjustment of the focus, the object and the slit can be seen
 together equally sharp.        Also, since the whole of the light which illumi
 nated the object has been cut off, except that portion which passes through
 the slit, all that is now visible in the instrument is a narrow luminous line,
 in which is to be seen just so much of the object as falls within the space
 this line covers.      By altering the slit-adjustments the length or width
 of the luminous line can be varied, whilst by means of the rackwork
 attached to the upper stage, any part of the object may be superposed on
 the luminous line.        The stage is supplied with a concentric movement,
 which permits the object to be rotated whilst in the field of view, so as to
 allow the image of the slit to fall on it in any direction.                 During this
 examination a touch with the finger        will at  any time   bring  the  square aper
ture O, or the circular aperture D into the field, instead of the slit, so as
to enable the observer to see the whole of the object ; and in the same
 manner the slit can as easily be again brought into the field.
     The other essential part of this spectrum -microscope consists of the
 prisms.     These are enclosed in a box, shown at K (fig. 2). The prisms
 are of the direct-vision kind, consisting of three flint and two crown, and
are altogether 1-6 inch long.          The box screws into the end of the micro
scope-body at the place usually occupied by the object-glass ; and the ob
ject-glass is attached by a screw in front of the prism-box.          It is shown in its
place at L. The prism-box is sufficiently wide to admit of the prisms being
pushed to the side when not wanted, so as to allow the light, after passing
    * In carrying out the experiments which were necessary before this spectrum-micro
scope could be made in its present complete form, I have been greatly assisted by Mr. C.
Collins, Philosophical-Instrument Maker, 77 Great Tichfield Street, to whom I am also
indebted for useful suggestions as to the most convenient   arrangement   of the different
parts, so as to render them easily adapted to microscopes of ordinary construction.

 the finger.    As the prisms are close above the object-glass, the usual sli
 ding box, carrying the binocular prism and the Nicol's prism (shown at N),
 may be employed as usual, and the spectrum of any substance may thus
 be examined by both eyes simultaneously, either by ordinary light, or when
 it is under the influence of polarized light. The insertion of the prism-box
 between the object-glass and the body of the microscope does not interfere
 with the working of the instrument in the ordinary manner.       The length of
 the tube is increased 1 or 2 inches, and a little additional rack work may in
 some instruments be necessary when using object-glasses of low power.
 The stereoscopic effect when the Wenham prism is put into action does
 not appear to be interfered with.

of view, all that        is necessary is to push the         slit into adjustment with one
hand, and the prisms with the other.                    The spectrum of any object which
is superposed on the image of the slit is then seen.
   The small square aperture at O (fig. 1 ) is for the examination of dichroic
substances. When this is pushed into the field, by placing a double-image
prism P between A B and E, two images of the aperture are seen in juxta
position, oppositely polarized ; and if a dichroic substance is on the stage,
the differences of colour are easily seen.
   When the spectrum of any substance is in the field and the double-image
prism P is introduced, two spectra are seen, one above the other, oppositely
polarized, and the variations in the absorption-lines,                  such as are shown by
didymium, jargonium, &c., are at once seen.
   A Nicol's prism, Q,              as polarizer, is also arranged to slip into the same
position as the double-image prism, and another, R, as analyzer, above the
prism-box.   The spectra of the brilliant colours exhibited by certain crys
talline bodies, when seen by polarized light, can then be examined. Many
curious effects are then produced, a description of which I propose to make
the subject of another paper.      Both the prisms P and Q are capable of
rotation.
   If the substance under examination is dark coloured, or the illumination
is not brilliant, it is best not to divide the light by means of the Wenham
prism at N, but to let the whole of it pass up the tube to one eye.       If,
however, the light is good, a very great advantage is gained by throwing
the Wenham prism into adjustment and using both eyes.     The appearance
of the spectrum, and the power of grasping faint lines, are incomparably
superior when both eyes are used ; whilst the stereoscopic effect it confers
on some absorption and interference spectra (especially those of opals)
seem to throw entirely new light on the phenomena.        No one who has
worked with a stereoscopic spectrum-apparatus                       would willingly return   to
the old monocular spectroscope*.
   If the illumination in this instrument is taken from a white cloud or the
sky, Fraunhofer's lines are beautifully visible ; and when using direct sun
light they        are seen   with    a perfection which leaves        little to be desired. The
dispersion is sufficient to cause the spectrum to                   fill the whole field of the
microscope, instead of, as in the ordinary instrument, forming a small por
tion of     it,

0-001 inch, according to the actual width of the slit), it is evident that the
spectrum of the smallest objects can be examined.            If  some blood is in
the field, it is easy to reduce the size of the image of the slit to dimensions
covered by one blood-disk, and then, by pushing in the prisms, to obtain its
spectrum.
    If the object under examination will not transmit       a  fair image of the
slit (if it be a rough crystal of jargoon for instance), it must be fixed in
the universal holder beneath the slit and the light concentrated on it be
fore it reaches the slit. If the spectra of opaque objects are required, they
can also be obtained in the same way, the light being concentrated on them
either by a parabolic reflector or by other appropriate means.
    By replacing the illuminating lamp by a spirit-lamp burning with a soda-
flame, and pushing in the spectrum-apparatus, the yellow sodium-line is
seen beautifully    sharp ;  and by narrowing the slit sufficiently it may even
be doubled.      Upon introducing lithium or thallium compounds into the
flame, the characteristic crimson or green line is obtained ; in fact so
readily   does  this form of instrument     adapt itself to the examination of
flame-spectra, that for general work I     have almost ceased to use a spectro
scope of the ordinary form.        The only disadvantage  I find is an occasional
deficiency of light ; but by an improved arrangement of condensers I hope
soon to overcome this     difficulty.
               V.   " On    some Optical Phenomena of      Opals."
      By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.             Received   April 23, 1869.
    When   a good fiery opal is examined     in day-, sun-, or artificial light, it
appears to emit vivid flashes of crimson, green, or blue light, according to
the angle at which the incident light falls, and the relative position of the
opal and the observer ; for the direction of the path of the emitted beam
bears no uniform proportion to the angle of the incident light.         Examined
more closely, the flashes of light are seen to proceed from planes or sur
faces of irregular dimensions inside the stone, at different depths from the
surface and at all angles to each other.         Occasionally a plane emitting
light of  one colour overlaps a plane emitting light of another colour, the
two colours becoming alternately visible upon slight variations of the angle
of the stone ; and sometimes a plane will be observed which emits crimson
light at one end, changing to orange, yellow, green, &c., until the other
end of the plane shines with a blue light, the whole forming a wonder
fully beautiful solar spectrum in miniature.       I need scarcely say that the
colours are not due to the presence of any pigment, but are interference
colours caused by minute striae or fissures lying in different planes. By
turning the opal round and observing it from different directions, it is
generally possible to get a position in which it shows no colour whatever.
Viewed by transmitted light, opals appear more or less deficient in trans
parency and have a slight greenish yellow or reddish tinge.

1869.]          Mr. W. Crookes    on some   Optical Phenomena of Opals.     449
  In order to better adapt them to the purposes of the jeweller, opals          are
almost always polished with rounded surfaces, back and front ; but the
flashes of coloured light are better seen and examined when the top and
bottom of the gems are ground and polished flat and parallel.
   A good opal is not injured by moderate heating in water, soaking in
turpentine, or heating strongly in Canada balsam and mounting as a
microscopic slide.
   By the kindness of Mr. W. Chapman, of Frith Street, Soho, and other
friends,   I    have been enabled to submit some thousands of opals to optical
examination       ; and from these  I
                                    have selected about a dozen which appeared
worthy of further study.
   If an opal which emits a fine broad crimson light is held in front of
the slit of a spectroscope or spectrum-microscope, at the proper angle, the
light is generally seen to be purely homogeneous, and all the spectrum
that is visible is a brilliant luminous line or band, varying somewhat in
width  and more or less irregular in outline, but very sharp, and shining
brightly on a perfectly black ground. If, now, the source of light is moved,
so as to shine into the spectrum-apparatus     through the opal, the above
appearance is reversed, and we have a luminous spectrum with a jet-black
band in the red, identical in position, form of outline, and sharpness with
the luminous    band previously observed.    If instead of moving the first
source of light (the one which gave the reflected luminous line in the red)
another source of light be used for obtaining the spectrum, the two appear
ances, of a coloured line on a black ground, and a black line on a coloured
ground, may be obtained simultaneously, and they will be seen to fit accu
rately.
   Those parts of the opal which emit red light are therefore seen to be opaque
to light of the same refrangibility as that which they emit ; and upon ex
amining in the same manner other opals which shine with green, yellow,
or blue light, the same appearances are observed, showing that this rule
holds good in these cases also. It is doubtless a general law, following of
necessity the mode of production of the flashes of colour.
   Having                       that the above law held good in all the in
                once satisfied myself

tions will apply equally well, mutatis mutandis, to the reflected spectra.
The examinations were made by means of the spectrum-microscope a de
scription of which I have just had the honour of sending to the Society.
This instrument is peculiarly adapted to examinations of this sort, both on

  portion   of the opal  ;  but the general character of each individual stone      is
   well marked.
     No. 1 shows a single black band in the red. When properly in focus
  this has a spiral structure.      Examined with both eyes it appears in decided
  relief, and the arrangement of light and shade is such as to produce a
  striking resemblance to a twisted column.
     No 2. gives an irregular line in the orange.         Viewed binocularly,    this
  exhibits the spiral structure in a marked manner, the different depths and
  distances standing well out ; upon turning the milled head of the stage-
  adjustment, so as to carry the opal slowly from left to right, the spiral line
  is seen to revolve and roll over, altering its shape and position in the spec
  trum.     It is not easy to retain the conviction that one is looking merely
  at a band   of deficient light in the spectrum, and not     at a solid  body, pos
  sessing dimensions and in actual motion.
     No. 3 has a line between the yellow and green, vanishing to a point at the
  top, and near the bottom having a loop, in the centre of which the green
 appears.      Higher up, in the green, is a broad green band, indistinct on one
 side and branching out in different parts.
     No. 4 has a broad, indistinct, and sloping band in the blue, and another,
 still more indistinct, in the violet.
     No. 5 has a band in the yellow, not very sharp on one side, and some
 what sloping.      Upon moving the opal sideways, it moves about from one
 part of the yellow field to another.        In one position it covers the line D,
 and is opaque to the sodium-flame of a spirit-lamp.
     No. 6 shows a curiously shaped band in the red, very sharp and black,
 and terminating in one part at the line D.        In the yellow there is a black
 dot.    The spectrum of this opal showed by reflected light intensely bright
 red bands, of the shape of the transmission bands.            On examining this
 opal with a power of 1 inch, in the ordinary manner, the portion giving
 this spectrum appeared to glow with intense red light, and was bounded
with a tolerably definite outline.        Without altering any other part of the
microscope, the prisms were then pushed in so as to look at the whole
surface of the opal through the prisms, but without the slit.            The shape
and appearance of the red patch were almost unaltered ; and here and there
over other parts of the opal were seen little patches of homogeneous light,
which, not having been fanned out by the prisms, retained their original
shape and appearance.
    No. 7 shows a black patch in the red, only extending a little distance,
and a line in the yellow. On moving the opal the line in the red vanishes,
and the other line changes its position and form.
    No.   8 shows the most     striking example of  a spiral rotating line which   I
have yet met with.         On moving the opal sideways the line is seen     to start
from the red and roll over, like an irregularly shaped and somewhat hazy
corkscrew, into the middle of the yellow.        The drawing shows the appear
ance   of this band in two positions.

   No.    9 is one  of the most curious.        A  broad black and sharp band
stretches diagonally across the green, touching the blue at the top and the
yellow at the bottom.
   No. 10 gives a diagonal band, wide, but straight, and tolerably sharp
across the green.       By rotating these opals, 9 and 10, in azimuth, whilst
in the field of the instrument, the lines can be made to alter in inclination
until they are seen to slope in the opposite direction.
   No. 1 1 gives another illustration of a diagonal line, across the yellow and
green, not extending quite to the top.
   No.    12 is one of the best examples   I have met with of a narrow, straight,
and sharply cut line.       It is in the green, and might easily be mistaken for
an absorption-band      caused by an unknown      chemical element.
   Other opals    are exhibited    which show  a dark band travelling  along the
spectrum, almost from one end to the other, as the opal is moved side
ways.
    It is scarcely necessary to say that the colour of the moving luminous
line varies with the part of the spectrum to which it belongs.          The ap
pearance of a luminous line, slowly moving across the black field of the
instrument, and assuming in turn all the colours of the spectrum, is very
beautiful.
   All   these black bands can be reversed,     and changed into luminous bands,
by illuminating the opal with reflected light.          They are, however, more
difficult to see ; for the coloured light is only emitted at a particular angle,
whilst the special opacity to the ray of the same refrangibility as the
emitted ray holds good for all angles.
   The explanation of the phenomena is probably as follows : — In the case
of the moving line, the light-emitting plane in the opal is somewhat broad,
and has the property of giving out at one end, along its whole height and
for a width equal to the breadth of the band, say, red light ; this merges
gradually into a space emitting orange, and so on throughout the entire
length of the spectrum, or through that portion of it which is traversed
by the moving line in the instrument, the successive pencils (or rather
ribbons) of emitted light passing through all degrees of refrangibility.
It is evident that if this opal is slowly passed across the slit of the spec
trum-microscope, the slit will be successively illuminated with light of
gradually increasing refrangibility, and the appearance of a moving lumi
nous line will be produced ; and if transmitted light is used for illumination,
the reversal of the phenomena will cause the production of a black line
moving along a coloured field.        A diagonal line will be produced if an opal
of this character is examined in a sloping position.
   The phenomenon of a spiral line in relief, rolling along        as the opal is
moved, is doubtless caused         by modifying planes at different depths and
connected by cross planes ; I can form a mental picture of a structure
which would produce this effect, but not clear enough to enable me to de
scribe it in words.

   It  is probable that similar phenomena may be seen          in many,  if not all,
bodies which reflect coloured light after the manner of opals.          A magnifi
cent specimen of Lumacelli, or Fiery Limestone, from Italy, kindly pre
sented to me by my friend David Forbes, shows two sharp narrow and
parallel    bands in the red.     I have  also observed similar appearances in
mother-of-pearl.       The effects can be imitated to a certain extent by
examining

existing     species    it characterizes the Camelida, occurring          also,  as shown
in Palauchenia, in the fossil form of that family            ;  but this rare disposition
of the vertebral arteries was likewise met with                in  a large fossil Ungu
late of     South     America,    Macrauchenia,      belonging to the Perissodactyle
 group*.
     The author therefore communicates, as an appendix to his former paper
 on Palauchenia,        a description, with drawings, of the mandibular dentition
 of Macrauchenia patachonicha, of the natural size, the lower jaw of that
 fossil animal being still a unique specimen in the British Museum.                     It
 displays the entire molar series, with the exception of the first small pre
 molar : the several teeth in place are described in detail and compared with
 those of other Perissodactyles.           The grinding-surface of the true molars
 presents     the   bilobed   or bicrescentic type, as in Palceotherium and Rhino
 ceros ; but Macrauchenia differs from both those genera in the limitation
 of the assumption of the molar type to the last premolar, the antecedent
 ones retaining the single-lobed crown.           From Palceotherium it further dif
 fers in the last molar being bilobed, as in Rhinoceros, not trilobed.                 In
 Palauchenia all the premolars have the simpler structure, as in Artiodac-
 tyles generally.         Macrauchenia     resembles    Anoplotherium     and Dichodon

     It  has been shown that when narcotine is heated with an excess of con
  centrated hydrochloric or hydriodic acid, one, two, or three molecules of
  methyl are successively eliminated, and a series of new bases homologous
  with narcotine obtained.        It appeared interesting to see if any similar re
  actions took place with morphia ; and for this purpose a quantity of that
  base, in a perfectly pure state,      kindly furnished by Messrs. M'Farlane, of
  Edinburgh,     was   submitted to experiment.         The purity of the substance
  was shown by the following         analysis.
     It was found that although crystallized         morphia does not lose its water
  of crystallization     in  an ordinary   steam drying-closet     (t. e. slightly below
   100°), yet  it readily loses the whole when placed in a Liebig's drying-tube
  immersed    in boiling water, dry air being aspirated over it.

(about 10 cub. ceutims. of ordinary acid, of about 35 per cent. II CI to each
gramme of morphia), and heated to 140°-150° for two or three hours, on
opening the tubes after cooling no gas is found to have been formed, nor is
there any formation of chloride of methyl. The residue in the tube contains
the hydrochlorate of a new base, differing considerably in its properties from
morphia.      It may be obtained in a state of purity by dissolving the con
tents of the tube in water, adding excess of bicarbonate of sodium (not the
ordinary carbonate Na2 CO,, nor caustic soda, as these hasten the decom
position of the precipitated base), and extracting the precipitate with ether

460     Messrs. A. Matthiesserl and C. R. A. Wright on the                  [June  10,
   The physiological     effects of apomorphia    are very different    from those of
morphia   ;  a very small dose      produces speedy vomiting          and considerable
depression, but this soon passes off, leaving no after ill effects, — facts of
which we have repeatedly had disagreeable proof while working with it.
   Dr. Gee is now studying these effects, and has found that -^(, of a grain of
the hydrochlorate     subcutaneously injected, or \ grain taken by the mouth,
produces    vomiting  in from four to ten minutes.         Our friend Mr. Prus al
lowed himself to be injected with -^j grain, which produced vomiting in less
than ten minutes.      From Dr. Gee's experiments on himself and others, he
concludes that the hydrochlorate is a non-irritant emetic and powerful anti-
stimulant.     As from these properties it appears probable that it may come
into use in medicine, we have called it apomorphia, rather than morphinine,
to avoid any possible mistakes in writing prescriptions.
   Apomorphia is likewise formed by heating morphia and dilute sulphuric
acid (1 vol. acid to 8 or 10 of water) in sealed tubes to 140°-150° for three
hours.    It  appears possible that the substance obtained by Arppe *, sub
sequently named sulphomorphide by Laurent and Gerhardt t, is an impure
sulphate of apomorphia, as the formula deduced by these latter chemists
from their analysis,       C34 H38 N2  0, S, is identical with that of this sul
phate, (C17 H17   NOa),    H, S04.     They,  however, considered it a species of
amide.    On repeating Arppe's experiments, we have obtained apomorphia
from the product. The physical characters ascribed to sulphomorphide (of
becoming green on keeping, especially on heating, of communicating this
green tint to water, and of solubility in caustic alkalies, producing a brown
substance by decomposition) are precisely those of the hydrochlorate of
apomorphia.       It appears probable that the class of analogous bodies pro
duced from other alkaloids by similar means, such as sulphonarcotide, may
possibly be the sulphates of new bases. We propose to submit these to ex
periment, and to prosecute our researches on the opium bases.
   On sealing up codeia with hydrochloric acid and digesting it at 150°, we
find some permanent gas is evolved, probably chloride of methyl, in which
case the new base, if any, will be morphia or apomorphia or their isomers,
as codeia differs from morphia only by CHa.

   Codeia and morphia are,       as is  well known, homologous, only differing in
composition by CHa.          Both of them contain one atom of hydrogen re
placeable by organic     radicals, from which it appears that methyl-morphia

with codeia, and not identical. If, therefore,            codeia be morphia where H
is replaced by CH3, the atom of hydrogen so              replaced must be one of those

V.   "A   Preliminary Investigation into the Laws regulating the
      Peaks and Hollows exhibited in the Kew Magnetic Curves
      for the first two years of their production."                 By BalPour
      Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Kew Obser
      vatory.      Received May 20, 1869.
   The Kew magnetographs began to        be in regular operation    in May 1858,
and have continued so up to the present date. The curves derived from
these instruments, representing the changes which take place in the three
components of the earth's magnetism at Kew, are often found to be studded
with small serrated appearances,    which have been denominated peaks and

1869.]             Dr. B. Stewart on    the  Kew Magnetic Curves.                  4G3
hollows    ;  and the following    remarks will serve to show that the study of
these may be attended        with considerable   advantage.
    The labours of General Sabine have been instrumental in showing that
there are at least two forces concerned in producing disturbances ; and this
conclusion is confirmed by the appearance of the Kew curves, from which
it may be seen that no disturbance of any magnitude is due to the action
of a single force merely varying in amount and not in direction ; for if
this were the case the distance at any moment of a point in the curve of
one of the elements from its normal position should bear throughout such
a disturbance an invariable proportion to the distance of a corresponding
point in the curve of another of the elements from its normal                ; but this
is by no means the case.
    It becomes therefore a question of interest to endeavour to find the
elementary forces concerned in producing a disturbance ; and it is thought
that this knowledge may to some extent be attained by a study of those
 small and rapid changes of force which are denoted by peaks and hollows.
 For if   several   independent forces are at work, it may be thought unlikely
that at the same moment a sudden change should take place in all ; there
is thus a probability that sudden changes of force, as exhibited in peaks
and hollows, are changes in one of the elementary forces concerned, which
may thus enable us to determine the nature of that force.                  Even if the
change     is  not   a very abrupt   one,  provided  that we   confine     ourselves to
such peaks and hollows as present a similar appearance for all the curves,
we may suppose that we are observing changes in one only of the ele
mentary disturbing forces ; for it is unlikely that two or more independent
forces, changing independently, should produce similar appearances in all
of the three curves. Thus what we have to look
 for is similar appearances ; and the precise meaning
 attached to this expression will be rendered clear
 by means of the annexed graphical representation.
    We see here that (time being reckoned horizon
                                                            Hor- forcc-
 tally)  we have a disturbance      commencing at the
 same moment in each of the three elements, that
 for the declination being throughout three times as        Vert, force. I /K      X. 1
 large, and that for the annexed force twice as
 large as the corresponding vertical-force disturbance.
    In a paper communicated by me to the Royal Society, and published in
 the Transactions (1862, page 621), it was stated that, as a rule, small and
 abrupt disturbances at Kew tend either to increase at the same moment
 both components of magnetic force and the westerly declination, or to
 decrease these elements, as the case may be.            As in the Kew curves of
 1862, increasing ordinates represented decreasing horizontal force, decreas
 ing vertical force, and decreasing declination, the above statement is the
 asme as saying that, as a rule, peaks and hollows in one element correspond
 to peaks and hollows in the other two.

 464              Dr. B. Stewart on the Kew Magnetic Curves.               [June  10,
    Nevertheless one notable exception to this rule was mentioned in the
 above paper, namely, that at the beginning of the great disturbance of
 August-September         1859, an abrupt fall of the declination curve corre
 sponded to a rise of the other two components.              It was also shown in
 this paper    that  while  the  horizontal-force   peaks  are  always as nearly as
 possible double in size of the vertical -force peaks, the proportion between
 the declination peaks and those of the other components appeared to be
 variable.    Some light was thrown upon this variability in a subsequent
 paper by Senhor Capello and myself, in which the peaks and hollows at
 Lisbon and at Kew were compared together (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1864, p. 111).
 It was found that these phenomena occurred simultaneously at these two
 observatories   ;  and it was stated that, as far as Kew is concerned, the pro
 portion   of the declination peaks and hollows to those of the horizontal
 and vertical force presents the appearance of a daily range, being great at
 the early morning hours and small in those of the afternoon.
    Thus the type of small and abrupt changes, judging from the behaviour
 of the declination, seemed to vary from two causes, being in the first place
 subject to a diurnal variation, and in the second place appearing to vary
 with the disturbance, inasmuch as that for the great disturbance August-
 September 1859 was, as above stated, entirely different from the usual type.
    This complexity      seems puzzling  ;  but the results of a preliminary com
 parison   between     the Stonyhurst      and Kew declination magnetographs
 (Sidgreaves    and   Stewart,  Proc. Roy. Soc. 1869, p. 236) appear to throw
 some light upon its cause.       It was there stated that when the declination-
curves of Stonyhurst and Kew are compared together during rather slow
disturbances, the scales are such that the traces seem exactly to coincide
even to their most minute features ; but, on the other hand, when the
disturbance is abrupt, there is an excess of Stonyhurst over Kew, which
appears to vary with the abruptness of the disturbance, being great when
this is great.     In fine, there appears to be superimposed upon a disturb
ance, which is mainly cosmical, a comparatively small effect, which appears
to be of a more local nature, and may perhaps be caused by earth-currents.
This circumstance renders it prudent, in discussing the laws of the small
and abrupt changes of force (peaks and hollows) at Kew, to avoid all great
and excessively abrupt disturbances, confining ourselves to those cases in
which there is only a moderate abruptness.            The result obtained for the
great   disturbance     August-September       1859  may   therefore be dismissed
as probably      effected by this local cause, inasmuch as the disturbance
measured was very abrupt.           The question then arises — Rejecting very
great and abrupt disturbances, has the peak-and-hollow force only a regular
diurnal variation, or is it subject besides to other changes of type ?
   Mr. Whipple, magnetical assistant at Kew, has carefully selected and
measured all the similar peaks and hollows for the first two years of the
Kew curves ; and the result exhibits          a manifest diurnal   variation  in the
type of the peak-and-hollow force.

    It  will   be seen from this        Table that there is great constancy in the type
of the peak-and-hollow               force for the same hour.             Bearing in mind the
difficulty of finding exactly similar appearances denoting an unmixed force,
and remembering also the small size of many of the peaks and hollows
observed,      it is not too much to            say that, as far as these two years' obser
vations are concerned, there is no trace                    of anything else than a diurnal
change in the type of the peak-and-hollow force.                         But this question can
not be finally decided until more observations are discussed.

    From this Table it will be seen that, as was formerly stated, the ratio
 between simultaneous peaks and hollows of the two components of the
 force is very nearly constant, the               horizontal    force disturbance being very
 nearly double      of that of the vertical force.
    It will also      be seen that there is a very             marked diurnal range in the
 ratio which the declination peak or hollow bears to that of the vertical
 force, this ratio being greatest about 7 a.m.                      About this hour we have
 also most peaks and hollows, while               in the evening and very early morning

  this the case that for the two years investigated         I have not succeeded in
  finding a single example of a peak or hollow, suitable for this research,
  between the hours of 6 and 7 p.m., or between those of 9 and 10 p.m.

  VI. " On       a new  Astronomical Clock, and         a Pendulum    Governor     for
          Uniform Motion."         By Sir William Thomson,          LL.D.,    F.R.S.
          Received June 10, 1869.
      It seems strange that the dead-beat escapement should still hold its place
 in the astronomical clock, when its geometrical transformation, the cylinder
 escapement of the same inventor, Graham, only survives in Geneva watches
 of the cheaper class.       For better portable time-keepers, it has been altered
 (through the rack-and-pinion movement) into the detached lever, which
 has proved much more accurate.            If it is possible to make astronomical
 clocks go better than at present by merely giving them a better escapement,
 it is quite certain that one on the same principle as the detached lever, or
 as the ship-chronometer escapement, would improve their time-keeping.
     But the inaccuracies hitherto tolerated in astronomical clocks may be
 due more to the faultiness of the mercury compensation pendulum, and of
the mode in which it is hung, and of the instability of the supporting
 clock-case or framework, than to imperfection of the escapement and             the
greatness of the arc of vibration which it requires ; therefore it would          be
wrong to expect confidently             much   improvement in the time-keeping
merely from improvement of the escapement.                 I have therefore endea
voured to improve both         the compensation    for change of temperature in the
pendulum, and the mode of its support, in a clock which I have recently
made with an escapement on a new principle, in which the simplicity of
the dead-beat escapement of Graham is retained, while its great defect, the
stopping of the whole train of wheels by pressure of a tooth upon a surface
moving with the pendulum, is remedied.
     Imagine the escapement-wheel of a common dead-beat clock to be
mounted on a collar fitting easily upon a shaft, instead of being rigidly
attached to it.       Let friction be properly applied between the shaft and the
collar, so that the wheel shall be carried round by the shaft unless resisted
by a force exceeding some small definite amount, and let a governor giving
uniform motion be applied to the train of wheel-work connected with this
shaft, and so adjusted that, when the escapement-wheel is unresisted, it will
move faster by a small percentage than          it ought to move when the clock is
keeping     time  properly.    Now   let the escapement-wheel, thus mounted and
carried round, act upon the escapement, just as it does in the ordinary clock.
It    will  keep   the pendulum     vibrating,  and will, just as in the ordinary

1869.]        Sir W. Thomson on a New Astronomical Clock.                            469
clock, be held back every time it touches the escapement during the interval
required to set it right again from having gone too fast during the preceding
interval of motion.    But in the ordinary clock the interval of rest is con
siderable, generally greater than the interval of motion.   In the new clock
it is equal to a small fraction of the interval of motion :      in the clock
as now working, but to be reduced probably to something much smaller
yet.  The simplest appliance to count the turns of this escapement-wheel
(a worm, for instance, working upon a wheel with thirty teeth, carrying a
hand round, which will correspond to the seconds' hand of the clock) com
pletes the instrument    ;   for minute and hour-hands      are a superfluity       in an
astronomical clock.
  In various trials which     I
                            have made since the year 1865, when this plan
of escapement first occurred to me, I have used several different forms, all
answering to the preceding description, although differing widely in their
geometrical and mechanical characters.     In all of them the escapement-
wheel is reduced to a single tooth or arm, to diminish as much as possible
the moment of inertia of the mass stopped by the pendulum.       This arm
revolves in the period of the pendulum (two seconds for a one second's
pendulum), or some multiple of it. Thus the pendulum may execute one or
more complete periods of vibration without being touched by the escapement.
   I look forward to carrying the principle of the governed motion for the
escapement-shaft much further than hitherto, and adjusting it to gain only
about      per cent. on the pendulum ; and then        I
                                                    shall probably arrange
that each pallet of the escapement be touched only once a minute (and the
counter may be dispensed with).  The only other point of detail which I
need mention at present is that the pallets have been, in all my trials,
attached to the bottom of the pendulum, projecting below           it,
                                                                   in order that
satisfactory action with a    very small arc of vibration (not more on each side
than -l-J-j- of the radius, or1  centimetre for the seconds' pendulum) may be
secured.
  My trials   were rendered practically abortive from 1865      until    a   few months
ago by the difficulty of obtaining    satisfactory governor for the uniform
                                        a
motion of the escapement-shaft     this difficulty
                                   ;                 isquite overcome in the
pendulum governor,   which    now
                              I    proceed   to describe.
   Imagine a  pendulum with single-tooth escapement mounted on          collar  a
loose on the escapement-shaft just as described above — the shaft, however,
beingvertical in this case.  Asquare-threaded screwis cut on the upperquarter
of the length of the shaft, this being the part of on which the collar works,

latteris in its range, the springs pull the masses inwards with less or more
force.   A fixed metal ring coaxial with the main shaft holds the governing
masses  in  when their centrifugal forces exceed the forces of the springs,
and resists the motion             by
                               forces of friction increasing approximately                      in

or slower, the nut collar works its way down or up the screw, until the
governor   again regulated, and gives the same speed in the altered circum

                               a
shaft, and yet that the periodic application and removal of about -fa of this
amount in the half period of the pendulum shall cause but        very small      a
periodic variation in the speed.  The latter important condition     secured           is
by the great moment of inertia of the governing masses themselves round
the main shaft.      hope, after

     This paper is intended as a sequel to Professor Sylvester's paper above
 mentioned, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for
  1866. The notation, so far it differs from Professor Sylvester's, is as
 follows : —
    p is the distance from the centre of the ellipsoid        to the rough plane.
     X. the
              (constant) component angular velocity of the ellipsoid about the
 diameter normal to the rough plane, ft the component angular velocity of
 the ellipsoid about the diameter parallel to the projection of the instan
 taneous axis on the rough plane.
     h\, hp -are the component angular momenta about these diameters respec
 tively.
     ht about the diameter at right angles to both.
     n the angular velocity, in space, of the plane through the instantaneous
 axis perpendicular to the rough plane .
     Then the        mass of the ellipsoid being taken,   as in Professor Sylvester's
paper, to be unity,        it is proved that
    The following theorem is then established : — " The component angular
 momentum of the ellipsoid about any diameter parallel to the rough plane
is equal to p, multiplied into the component velocity of the point of contact
of the ellipsoid and rough plane, in the direction at right angles to this
diameter."
    It  hence follows that
whence      it  is proved that

II. "On      the Origin of a Cyclone."                By Henry F. Blanford,
      F.G.S., Meteorological Reporter to the Government of Bengal.
      Communicated by Dr. T. Thomson.                   Received May 21, 1869.
   It has long been an object to the completion of our knowledge of vor
tical storms to trace out their early history, and to show, by the compari
son of a sufficient number of local observations, by what wind-currents the
vortex is generated in each storm-region, and by what agency these cur
rents are directed to the spot at which the storm originates.
   With this object in view, I endeavoured, immediately after the great
Calcutta   storm of the 1st of November          1867, to obtain,   through the as
sistance of Captain Howe (then officiating as Master Attendant of the
Port), the logs of as many ships as possible that had been in the Bay of
Bengal or anywhere to the north of the Equator during any part of the
last week of October.        A similar application was made to the Meteorolo
gical Department of the Board of Trade and readily granted.                  The me
teorological   stations recently established in Bengal, and the observatories
of Calcutta    and Madras, contributed a number of observations, for the
most part fairly trustworthy ; and I was thus placed in possession of data
which, although far from sufficient to the complete solution of the pro
blem for the storm in question, have at least enabled me to elucidate its
origin to a greater extent than has been accomplished, as far as I am aware,
for any previous storm in these seas or elsewhere.
   The following Tables give the noon barometric pressures at several sta
tions in Bengal * and on the shores of the bay, and those of a few ships
   * These are calculated from the observations  at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., but io regular ii

the march      of the barometer    that they may     safely be   accepted     as  within -02 of the
truth.
    * The Madras barometer should         be included in this remark, but being an excellent
 standard    instrument, it may fairly be assumed that its difference, if any, is insignificant.
    t  The barometer of this ship has not been compared with the standard, but from a
 comparison of its reading at a later date, at the Sandheads, with that of Saugor Island, it
may be inferred that its error is small,      not exceeding -05 inch, and probably less.           For
the purpose of comparison, I have added -04 to the reported readings.

   A  comparison   of  the above data* shows as follows : —
   On the 23rd of October the barometric pressure was about 0-005 higher
at  Chittagong and Dacca than elsewhere around or on the bay.                           From
Calcutta to Galle, at Akyab over the northern and down the western part
of the bay, it was nearly uniform, being slightly lower at Madras ; but to
the west of Acheen and the Nicobars it was from 0-15 to 0-2 inch lower
than around the coasts of India and Arakan.                   In Bengal and down the
west coast of the bay the winds were light from between S. and E., and
the same was the case over the bay down to the latitude of the Nicobars.
In lat. 4° to 6° 30' N., in the region of barometric depression, the ' J. C.
            '
Botelbhoe     experienced rain and cloudy weather, with a moderate breeze
from  W.N.W. during the latter part of the day, and the 'St. Marnock'
 about 2° further north had similar weather and a heavy sea from W.S.W.,
 but the breeze was light from E. and S.E.              It appears from the log of the
last-named vessel, and that of the 'Loonie't, that from the Equator up
to lat. 5°, W.N.W. winds with rain and squally weather had prevailed for
many days previously (at least, from the         1 1 th of October)   ;   and this current,

476             Mr. II. F. Blanford        on the Origin     of a Cyclone.       [June   17,
as appears from the accounts furnished              by other vessels, eventually contri
buted in a great degree to produce the cyclone, being diverted from its pre
vious direction towards the place of low barometer in the south of the bay *.
    On the 24th and 25th the barometric pressure increased slightly over
the north and west of the bay, but chiefly at Patna.                   The increase was
from 0-04 to 0-07 inch at stations in Lower Bengal, 0-05 at Madras, and
0-03 at Akyab.          The difference of pressures at Chittagong and Madras
amounted on the latter day to about 0'06 inch, and between Chittagong
and Akyab to about 0-05 inch.              In the region to the west of the Nicobars
the pressure seems to have remained much the same as on the 23rd, and
was about 0-23 inch less than at Chittagong,             and 0'19 less than at Madras.
At   the same time, in lat. 5° S., the pressure was about                 0-l inch   higher
than in the south of the bay.            The figures given in the       Table   thus indi
cate   a region     of slight but distinct barometric depression running from
Sumatra up towards Arakan, with a minimum to the west of the Nicobars,
or, more probably, somewhat further to the south.
    Meanwhile the northerly or north-easterly wind, which was first felt at
Chittagong on the afternoon of the 23rd, extended over Lower Bengal
and down the western half of the bay as far as the northern extremity of
Ceylon.      It prevailed also over the northern part of the bay from N.E.
and E.N.E. as far down as lat. 1 2°, and was accompanied with fine and
clear weather.        Below this latitude to the west and north-west of the Ni
cobars the winds were light and variable, with rain and squally weather
('Leonie,'      'J.   C. Botelbhoe').         Still further south, on the Equator
('Gauntlet'), and probably for some degrees to the north, the W.N.W.
winds, already noticed, prevailed with squally weather, while the S.E. trade
was blowing ('Gauntlet,' 'Astracan') up to 2° 30' or 3° south latitude.
    On the 26th there was a general fall of the barometer, greatest in
Bengal, and the pressure became nearly equal over Bengal, down the west
                                                               '
coast to Madras and over the bay (' Winchester,'                 St. Marnock') down to
lat. 14°.      In the eastern part of the bay, between lats. 14° and 10°, there
was a barometric dip of 0' 1 7 inch (' St. Marnock,' 'J. C. Botelbhoe'), and
the barometer stood at about the same height in N. lats. 10° and 4° (' J.
C. Botelbhoe,' 'Gauntlet').            The area of maximum depression lay evi
dently    between    these latitudes,   since in S. lat. 3° the pressure was 0-l inch
and in S. lat. 7° 0-13 inch higher ('Astracan,' ' Iron King').
    The state of the wind and weather appears to have been much the same
as on the previous day       ;  but there is some evidence       in the logs of the  'J. C.
    * This W.N.W. current      is very prevalent in the winter months, as is well known to
mariners.    Its prevalence is clearly shown in the Board of Trade charts, and it is especi
ally noticed by Maury (Phys. Geolr. of the Sea, 12th edit. p. 375) as the winter or west
erly monsoon of the line. It is usually accompanied by rain and squally weather, and
not improbably plays an important part in the production of all the cyclones that origi
nate in the south of the bay to the west of the Andamans and Nicobars.        On this point
compare the Report on the Calcutta cyclone of 1864, especially pp. 79, 85, 105. See l'
postea.

1869.]             Mr. H. F. Blanford                  on the Origin          of a    Cyclone.           4,77
Botelbhoe,' ' Timoor Shah,' and ' Gauntlet ' that the wind was beginning
to circulate around the area of greatest depression and of variable winds.
The first of these ships, whose course was northward and on the east of
the area in question, had a moderate breeze veering from N.E. to E. with
heavy squalls ; the second, moving slowly up on the west of the area, had
northerly freshening breezes and an overcast sky with rain and a heavy S. W.
swell. The ' Gauntlet,' at 200 to250 miles to thesouth, had the windat W.N. W.
with hard rain-squalls.     There                is,
                                     however, no evidence of the wind having
attained to anything like hurricane violence until the following day.
    On the 27th the barometric pressure remained much the same as on the
previous day over the greater part of our area.      The barometric difference
between Chittagong and Akyab amounted to about 0-05 inch, and to an
equal amount between the latter place and Port Blair. At 70 miles to the
west of the Andamans the barometer of the                               'J.
                                                      C. Botelbhoe' stood 0-l
inch lower but the lowest pressure recorded on this day was experienced by
               ;
the 'Gauntlet' in lat.         at about 100 miles due west of the Nicobars.
                                    7°   5'
The reading of this ship's barometer was 29-562, or 0-29 less than at
Port Blair, and 0-22 less than on the Equator to the south, 0-4 less than
at Calcutta and Dacca, and nearly 0-36 less than at Madras.          There can

sphere in Ceylon was as high as before the cyclone of 1864.
   The principal facts exhibited in the foregoing description may be summed
up    as     follows   :—
     For at least four days previously
                                   to the formation of the cyclone vortex
the barometric pressure to westward of the Nicobars and the northern ex
tremity of Sumatra was lower than elsewhere in or around the bay.                                        It
was       lower (on the 24th of October certainly, and probably on the
        also
previous day also) than on the open sea to the southward.  The depres
sion was gradually intensified up to the 27th, when     began to blow              it                     a
hurricane on the northern limit of this area.   It then amounted to — 0-4
of the pressure in Bengal, — 0-36 of that in Madras, and — 0-22 of that on
the Equator.   It would appear, however, that over the greater part of the
bay the pressure was nearly equable, and that the depression was local and
bounded by     much higher barometric gradient than would be indicated
                   a
by the figures above given. Thus the Gauntlet' reading was 0-29 less
                                                         '

                                      '
      Around the north and west coasts of the bay the differences of pressure
and its changes were inconsiderable.               On the 23rd there was a slightly
higher pressure (0-05 in.) in the N.E. corner, which difference remained
unaltered on the two following days.                In Ceylon also the pressure was
 0-03 greater than at Madras ; at the same time there was a general rise of
 the barometer, small in amount, over Bengal and the northern and western
 coasts.       On the 27th there was a general fall, and the pressures were
 nearly equalized.
      Coincident with these changes were those of the winds.               For many days
 previously to the 24th        *  light south-easterly winds prevailed on the west
  coasts of the bay, while       in  Bengal the wind was variable, with a predomi
  nance of easterly components.             To the south, between the Equator and
  N. lat. 5°, a squally damp W.N.W. wind blew continuously, having pre
 vailed at least from the 1 1th of October.            On the 27th it became W.S.W.,
  drawing round towards the area of depression.                 With the barometric rise
  on the 24th and 25th a N.E. wind set in in Bengal and down the western
  half of the bay displacing the S.E. wind, which, however, continued to be
  felt in the immediate neighbourhood of the Nicobars.                 The cyclone vortex
  was formed by the indraught           of these three currents   to the preexisting area
  of barometric depression.
      The storm chart of the Bay of Bengal drawn up by Mr. Fiddington shows
  that the majority of the cyclones, the tracks of which are there laid down,
  proceed from a line running from south to north by the Nicobars, Anda-
  mans, and the islands of the Arracan coast, following the westward side
   of the mountain-axis, which, in part submarine, is a prolongation of that of
   the Sunda Islands.          Of these storms, several appear to have originated
   in the neighbourhood of the Andamans ; but none of them have been
   traced back to a sufficiently early period to admit of a comparison of
   the circumstances of their origin with those of the storm now under dis
   cussion.      The data for the great Calcutta cyclone of October 1864 dis
    cussed by Colonel Gastrell and myself in the report published by the
    Bengal Government, were insufficient for a satisfactory determination of the
    conditions under which it originated, but they offer several points of simi
    larity to those detailed in the preceding pages.
       The two storms agree approximately in their place of origin, in their
    course    up the bay and over Bengal, and in their termination ; and as re
    gards period, both occurred at the close of the S.W. monsoon.                The chief
    noticeable    differences  are,  that   the  cyclone   of  1864  originated about N.
    lat. 10°, and therefore 3° or 4° further north, and on the morning of the
    2nd   of October, or nearly     a month earlier.       Previously to this date, for at
    least   five days, the wind in Ceylon had been from the westf or W.S.W.,
       *  I have tabulated them for the six days previous.
       t  We had no data to show how far to the south or south-east this direction prevailed,

damp wind prevailed over the south of the bay up to the Great Andaman
on the 1st and 2nd.     The greater northern extension of this current                     is,
doubtless, connected with the above-mentioned difference in the position
of the storm's birthplace.   At Port Blair, on the 29th and 30th, and over
the greater part of the bay as far south as Madras, southerly and
east-south-easterly winds prevailed up to the 3rd of October.     In Eastern
Bengal  alone the  wind  was northerly, becoming   N.E. on  the 1st and 2nd;
but it was not until the 3rd of October that      N.E. wind established itself
                                                       a
over the north and west of the bay.            may, however, be noticed that
                                                  It
during the five days preceding the cyclone, an unusually high barometer
prevailed     Bengal, and this may have been due to the existence of an
             in
upper northerly current.     north-east wind was also felt in lat.
                                    A                               5° on             1
the north-west limb of the vortex, on the 2nd, but was  evidently  merely
the indraught of the south-east current.
   The barometer data for the storm of 1864 were few in number, and not
comparable inter se but we adduced some reason for the inference that
                           ;                                                                   a
low barometric pressure prevailed near the Andamans for some days pre
viously to the 2nd of October.
   It   appears,    then, that the same three wind-currents       eventually took part
in the formation of both storms, viz.         a   south-east wind    the south-east of
                                                                      in
the bay,    north-east wind along the west coast, and
            a                                           westerlya             wind to the
south   ;but that while   the storm of 1864 the north-east wind
                               in                                             did not pre
vail until after the formation of the vortex, up to which time the south-east
current held possession of the bay, in that of 1867 the former current
had established itself three days prior to the commencement of the cyclone.
These facts, coupled with the further fact that neither the north-east nor
(at this time of year) the south-east currents are stormy winds capable
of feeding the vortex and increasing the barometric depression, tend to
confirm the view enunciated in the Report on the Calcutta Cyclone of 1864,
viz. that the formation of the vortex was mainly determined     the inrush  by
of saturated westerly current towards the place of low barometer.
  a
   The fact        above          that the majority of the Bay of Bengal
                           mentioned,
cyclones arise along   line parallel to, and immediately to the west of, the
                           a
chain of islands that form the eastern boundary of the bay, indicates the
operation of some general cause tending to produce       low atmospheric
                                                                      a
pressure in that region at those seasons at which cyclones are most pre
valent.    Such   cause may be suggested, but the data available to me are
                    a
not sufficiently precise to establish its existence. If can be shown that,
                                                                 it
either owing to     predominance of marine currents from the south, or to
                     a
any other cause, the water along the eastern side of the bay has    higher       a
temperature than that of the western side during those months at which
cyclones prevail, the increased evaporation thus arising, together with the
but despite the difference in mean direction, the wet squally character of this wind permits
of its identification with Maury's westerly monsoon of the line.

more elevated temperature it would         impart to the atmosphere, would give
rise to a diminution of barometric         pressure, small at first, but becoming
more marked with the continued operation of the producing                      cause, so that
afterseveral days it might become capable of causing that extensive in
draught of air which appears to be the immediate antecedent of the forma
tion of a cyclone vortex.
   According to Horsburgh, from         April  the early part or middle of
                                                     to
October, a current generally sets to the north or north-east all over the
bay in the open sea, but governed in its direction and strength by the pre-
Tailing winds. " In the eastern side of the bay, and about the entrance to
the Malacca Strait more particularly, it sometimes sets to the southward.
The current     begins to set along the coast of Coromandel to the southward
in October,     sometimes about the middle of the month.     Near the end of
 this month, or early in November, it begins         run very strong to the
                                                            to
 southward."    He adds, however, that the period of the currents or mon
 soons changing in the Bay of Bengal is not always the same.   These changes
 happen in some years nearly a month sooner or later than in others.
    From this and the remainder of the description, it is to be gathered that
 the set of the current changes with the monsoon, and that in general its
 direction and strength are governed by the prevailing winds.       Now it is
 well known that at the change from the south-west to the north-east mon
 soon, the latter is first felt down the western part of the bay, and that at
 this season ships bound to Calcutta from the southward keep up the east
 of the bay, with   a view to catching a favourable wind.  It might be ex
 pected, therefore, that there would be a tendency to northerly currents in
 the east of the bay, and to southerly currents in the west ; and, so far as
 can be gathered from     Horsburgh's description, such indeed appears                   to be
 the case ; but facts are at present wanting              to establish   it,   and also the
 existence   of those differences of water-temperature           which would           seem to
 be the necessaryconsequence.
   It   would
            appear from Horsburgh's description that, at the commence
 ment of the south-east monsoon in May (the minor of the two cyclone
 seasons), the tendency   of the currents  the opposite of the above, that
                                                is
  from January to June  northerly current sets strongly up the Coromandel
                         a
  coast, and that from April there      current to the north or north-east

  the east of the bay holds good in the case of those barometric depressions
  which determine the cyclones of the beginning of the south-west monsoon,

  however, remark that, as far as can gather from the recorded cyclones

  the beginning as at the end of the south-west monsoon.
     It   is probable that in the course of a few years, if not already, the obser
  vations of currents and sea temperatures, collected by the Meteorological
  Department of the Board of Trade, will afford data for a satisfactory dis
  cussion of this subject, which is one of great importance to the compre

     Since the above was written,          I have  visited Chittagong, and have found
  that the elevation of the barometer-cistern at that place above sea-level
  (which had been reported as 1 66-46 feet) is actually about 108 ft. only.
 This correction requires an alteration of the reduced barometric pressures
 for Chittagong (given on p. 473), which will consequently stand as fol
 lows   : —

     A few corrections must also be made in the text. The excess of pressure
 at Chittagong, as compared with certain other stations on the 23rd and
 25th, disappears, and on the 26th and 27th the noon pressure at this
 place becomes lower than at any other station.               The conclusions arrived at
 in the foregoing paper         are, however, unaffected by the correction.

          Deep-sea Soundings."              By W.     A.  Miller,     M.D.,   Treas. and
          V.P.R.S.        Received     June 3, 1869.
     The Fellows of the Royal Society are already aware that the Admiralty,
 at the request     of the Council of the Society, have placed a surveying-ves
 sel at the disposal of Dr. Carpenter and his coadjutors for some weeks
 during the present summer, to enable them to institute certain scientific
 inquiries in the North Sea.            Among the objects which the expedition has
 in view is the determination of deep-sea temperatures.
     Now it is well known that self-registering thermometers of the ordinary
 construction are liable to error when sunk to considerable depths in water,
 in consequence of the diminution produced for the time in the capacity of
 the bulb under the increased pressure to which it is subjected. The index,
 from this cause, is carried forward beyond the point due to the effect of mere
 temperature, and the records furnished by the instrument rise too high-f.
     A simple expedient occurred to me as being likely to remove the diffi-

culty ; and as upon trial it was found to be perfectly successful, I have
thought that a notice of the plan pursued might not be unacceptable to
future observers.
    The form of self-registering thermometer which it was decided to em
ploy is one constructed upon Six's plan.                 Much care is requisite in
adjusting the strength of index-spring, and the size of the pin, so as to
allow it to move with sufficient freedom when pressed by the mercury,
without running any risk of displacement in the ordinary use of the in
 strument     while  raising    or   lowering it into the
 water.     Several of these thermometers have been
 prepared for the purpose with unusual care by
 Mr. Casella, who has determined the conditions
 of strength in the spring and diameter of tube
 most favourable to accuracy.             He has also him
 self had an hydraulic press constructed expressly
 with the view of testing these instruments.             By
 means of this press the experiments hereafter to
 be described were made.
     The expedient adopted for protecting the ther
 mometers from the effects of pressure consisted
 simply in enclosing the bulb of such a Six's ther
 mometer in a second or outer glass tube, which
 was fused upon the stem of the instrument in the
 manner shown in the accompanying figure.              This
 outer tube was nearly filled with alcohol, leaving a
 little space to allow     of variation     in bulk due   to
 expansion.      The spirit was heated to displace
 part of the air by means of its vapour, and the
 outer tube and its contents were sealed hermeti
 cally.
     In this way, variations in external pressure        are
 prevented from affecting the bulb of the thermo
  meter within, whilst changes of temperature in the
  surrounding medium           are    speedily transmitted
  through    the  thin   stratum    of  interposed alcohol.
  The thermometer is protected from external in
 jury by enclosing it in           a suitably   constructed
  copper case, open at top and bottom, for the free
  passage of the water.
     In order to    test   the efficacy of this plan, the instruments to be tried
  were   enclosed in     a strong wrought-iron      cylinder filled with water, and
  submitted    to hydraulic pressure, which could be raised gradually till it
  reached three tons upon the square inch, and the amount of pressure
  could be read as the experiment proceeded upon a gauge attached to the
  apparatus.
     Some preliminary       trials made upon the      5 th of May showed that the

press would work satisfactorily, and that the form of thermometer                                  pro
posed would answer the purpose.
   These preliminary trials showed that, even in the thermometers                                  with
protected bulbs,  forward movement of the index of from 0°-5 to

  The hydraulic press was exposed                     in   an open yard, and had been filled
with water several hours before.                   A     maximum thermometer, introduced
into   awrought-iron tube filled with water, open at one end to the outer
air, closed at the other, where     passed into the water contained in the

press, registered 46°-7 at the commencement, and 47° at the                            end of       the
experiment.          Temperature of the external air 49° F.
   In commencing the experiment, the        seven thermometers under                       trial   were
introduced into the water in the cavity of the press, and after   lapse                a             of
ten minutes the indices of each were set, carefully read, and each instru
ment was immediately replaced in the press, which was then closed, and
by working the pump the pressure was gradually raised to        tons upon
the inch.  It was maintained at this point for forty minutes, in order to
allow time for the slight elevation of temperature caused by the compres
sion of the water to equalize itself with that of the body of the apparatus.
At the end of the forty minutes the pressure was rapidly relaxed. A cor
responding         depression of temperature was thus occasioned, the press was
opened          immediately, and the position of the indices of each thermometer
was again read carefully             ;   and the water was found to he at         a   temperature
sensibly lower than before the experiment began, by about 0o-6 F.  By this
means      was proved that the forward movement of the index

    In the Phillips's maximum thermometer, with unprotected spherical
bulb, No. 9651, the bulb had experienced so great a degree of compression
as to drive the index almost to the top of the tube.              In all the other un
protected instruments, which had been made with bulbs of unusual thick
ness, the index had been driven          beyond its proper position from 6°-4 to
8°-9   F.  ;  and it is obvious that the amount of this error must vary in each
instrument with the varying thickness of the bulb and its power of resist
ing compression.
    Notwithstanding the great pressure to which these instruments had been
subjected, all of them, without exception, recovered their original scale-
readings      as soon as   the pressure was removed.
    It  will   be seen that the mean rise     of temperature indicated by the three
protected instruments was 0o-9 F., whilst the mean depression registered
on removing the pressure amounted upon all the instruments which ad
mitted of its measurement to 0° 6, an agreement as close as was to be
expected from the conditions of the experiment.
    A second set of experiments was made upon the same set of instruments,
with the exception of 9651 ; but the pressure was now raised to 3 tons
upon the inch ; this was maintained for ten minutes.               When it had risen
to   2\  tons a slight report was heard in the press, indicating the fracture
 of one of the thermometers.            On examining the contents of the press
 afterwards it was found that No. 2 was broken, the others were uninjured.

The broken thermometer          was the earliest constructed upon the plan now
proposed,    and  it  was  consequently not quite so well finished as subsequent
practice has secured for those of later construction.         The results of the
trial under the higher pressures showed       an increase in the amount of com
pression experienced by the unprotected instruments rising in one instanced
as much as 1 lo,0 F. With the protected instruments the rise did not exceed
 l0,f>, due, as before,   to the heat evolved from the water  by its compression.
     A  pressure of 3 tons, it may be observed, would be equal to that of 448
atmospheres of 15 lb. upon the square inch ; and if it be assumed that the
diminution in bulk of water under compression continues uniformly at the
rate of 47 millionths of its bulk for each additional atmosphere, the reduc
tion in bulk of water under a pressure of 3 tons upon the square inch will
amount to about ±\ of its original volume.         This probably is too high an
estimate, as the rate of diminution would most likely decrease as the
pressure increases.

        J. Ferry, F.R.A.S., F.M.S. Communicated by the President.
        Received June 3, 1869.
                                     (Abstract.)
     This survey was undertaken by the Rev. W. Sidgreaves and myself in
connexion with the Observatory at Stonyhurst College.           The instruments
employed were those in constant use for the monthly observations of the
magnetic elements at this observatory, i. e. Barrow's dip-circle, No. 33, a
unifilar by Jones, and Frodsham's         chronometer,   No. 3148.    A   portable
altazimuth and an aneroid barometer were kindly placed at our disposal by
the late Mr. Cooke.
     A  complete set of observations of the dip, declination, and horizontal
intensity were taken at the following stations : — Paris, Laval, Brest, Vannes,
Angers, Poitiers, Bordeaux, Abbadia (near Hendaye), Loyola, Bayonne,
Pau, Toulouse,       Perigueux,   Bourges, Paris (a second time), and Amiens.
The chronometer       was compared on every possible occasion, and    its rate was
found to be nearly always 2" per day.
    The dip was observed according to the description of the observation given
by the President of the Royal Society in the ' Manual of Scientific Inquiry.'
     The method of vibrations and deflections was invariably adopted for
determining the horizontal component of the intensity.        For the declination
it  was deemed most convenient to find the azimuth of a fixed mark by
observing transits of the sun with Cooke's altazimuth, and then to measure
the azimuthal angle between the magnet and the fixed mark with Jones's
unifilar. Dr. Lloyd's method, by reflection, was made use of only at Brest.
The results of   these observations, reduced to the epoch    January   1st, 1869,

    The secular variation has    been   obtained by comparing the observations
 of this survey with those of Dr. Lamont, taken about ten years previously.
    Maps of the isodynamic, isoclinal, and isogonic lines of the epoch, Sep
tember 1st, 1868, are drawn from the following data, Paris being chosen
as the central station for reasons given in the paper     : —
   For the isoclinals the direction is
                    N. 73° 25' 10"  E. to S.  73° 25' 10"   W.,
the distance between the lines being 44-25 geographical miles for a change
of 30' of dip.
   The direction for the isogonics is
                    N. 20° 31' 16" E. to S. 20° 31' 16" W.,
and the distance only slightly greater than for the isoclinals, i.      e. 44-35
geographical miles for 30' of angle.
   The isodynamics lie in the direction
                    N.  70° 34' 13"  E. to S.  70° 34' 13"   W.,
the distance in this case being    1 15  geographical miles for a change of 0-1
in the intensity.
   For the lines of equal horizontal force the direction is
                    N.  74° 19' 30"  E. to S.  74° 19' 30"   W.,
 and 72 geographical miles the distance separating lines where the horizontal
intensity differs by 0- 1 .
   An attempt has     been made    to apply a correction for the magnetic dis
turbances at the times of observation by means of the magnetograms ob
tained at Stonyhurst Observatory during the Survey ; but these corrections
have not been taken into account in forming the equations of condition
from which the final results have been obtained.
   The probable error of any single observation of the dip, declination, total
force, and horizontal component are found to be respectively
                      3'13j 0'-95; 0 0144 ; and 0-0067.

of General Sabine and Bessel,                        it    determine for every

                   a
pressure, and also in       receiver from which the air

withdrawn     from the difference in the number of vibrations thus found
                   ;
the correction was then calculated on the assumption that this difference
is proportional to the difference of density of the air.
   2. In the pendulum-observations made at the Kew Observatory in con
nexion with the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (vide Proceedings
of the Royal Society for 1865, No. 78) we adopted, for determining the
necessary constant, the method first carried out by General Sabine, and                                      of
which      detailed account

eminent physicists, Professor Clerk Maxwell and Professor O. E. Meyer                                        in
Breslau, have independently investigated the internal friction in gases, and its
effect upon bodies moving in them         and among the prominent results ob
                                                           ;
tained by them       this, that the influence of the internal friction of a fluid
                              is
on   amoving body      not proportional to its density.

researches, the old method for determining the correction         sufficiently             is
accurate or again,

application of             a   more correct principle of reduction will not sensibly affect
the ultimate results, because                        the difference between        the true and approxi
mate correction    in such     is                a   case extremely small.          But if, as  the case

pressures,         it    is   very desirable to apply experimental methods which will
give the true correction.

carefully conducted experiments, and also to supply those who                                   are actually
engaged      in       pendulum-experiments        at the present time                   with practically
valuable results, we proposed to ourselves to observe                              the behaviour of pen
dulums of the different forms hitherto used in such                                    researches   in which
the pendulum is employed, at pressures varying through the whole range,
from the lowest obtainable in a receiver to the usual atmospheric pressure.
The carrying out of our intentions met, however, with many delays through
unavoidable circumstances, and there                    is,
                                           indeed, at present little prospect
of our being able to complete the whole of the original plan. We give,
therefore, here an account of some preliminary results which are, in our
opinion, not without practical importance, and which will certainly find
their use in the reduction of observations made with pendulums of form                               a
similar to that used by ourselves, viz. that form of reversible pendulum
 known as " Rater's pendulum."
   4. The following     an account of the operations: — The pendulum was
                                is
 swung in the Kew receiver, made of five pieces, two of metal and three of
 glass, the parts fitting closely, and the whole being connected with siphon-
 gauge and air-pump by tubes.       One of the metal pieces     perforated be            is
 hind and in front, and the apertures are covered by plate glass for the
 observation of the coincidences.
    The pendulum was swung at the following pressures —                             :

 At each pressure good many observations were made, in order to ensure
                         a
 reliable mean results.
   5.    With   reference to the       registration     of the observations,               we have   strictly
 adhered to the method previously adopted after careful consideration, and
 explained in our former account    hence we need not here enter upon this
                                              ;
 part again.  Instead of registering one coincidence at the beginning, during
 the progress, and at the end of an experiment, we have this time in most
 cases observed three successive coincidences, and the arithmetical mean of
 these, together       with the mean of the corresponding                          registrations     of arc,
 temperature, and pressure, stands for one observation  we think that this         ;
 method ensures greater correctness, although     more laborious than that
                                                                      it   is
 previously adopted.
    6. The reduction            of the observations comprises,                  as shown in the previous
 paper alluded to above, several corrections to be applied                              to the number     of
 observed vibrations        ;    we shall mention here only those points which                        differ
 numerically or experimentally from the numbers or methods explained in
 that paper, which contains also an experiment with its full reductions. By
 referring  to these and the following remarks our method of procedure will
 be so abundantly clear, we hope, that we shall be able to proceed immedi
 ately afterwards to the statement of the final results.

observations (which are preserved at the Kew Observatory), should such
appear desirable when the results of the Indian pendulum observations
will be published.
   B. The precise determination of the rate of the clock might have been                                 of
minor importance in our experiments, an approximate uniformity          rate                      of
being the chief desideratum.   We expected, however, that very small                                     dif
ferences in the number of vibrations would result in those experiments
where the pressure differed only               by
                                     an inch or even less.   We considered
it hence of the utmost value to have    precise record of the behaviour

the clock during these experiments, so as to discover at once changes                                    in
the rate, and to make our reductions depending on    for each experiment. it
A great number of transit-observations were accordingly made, and during
these not only the pendulum-clock,              but also the behaviour of             a   chronometer

the four months during which the experiments were carried on, each re
sult being of course employed for the pendulum-experiments of the corre
sponding day. The Table shows that our plan was the safest, as differences
of nearly one second are observable ; these differences have, however, ap
parently no connexion with changes of temperature, as the rate of the clock
during the artificial heating of the pendulum-room, of which we shall soon
have to speak, showed hardly any difference from the mean rate, proving
that the compensation was not faulty.

492                 Messrs. Stewart and Loewy on the true       [June    17,
urometers was precisely the same as that used in our previous experiments
and described in the account we gave of them to the Royal Society.    The
formula employed for deducing the most probable      mean  temperature for
each experiment was as before, using the same symbols   :   —
   As explained in the paper mentioned   above, we had then no time atour
disposal to swing the pendulums used at extremes of temperature, and
hence we availed ourselves of the elaborate series of experiments on the
temperature-correction of pendulums made by General Sabine (vide Phil.
Trans. 1830, p. 251), adopting the mean of his entire results, viz. 0-435
vibrations per diem, as correction for 1° of Fahrenheit's scale for our
reductions.
  In our present investigation we thought it indispensable to obtain the
utmost accuracy, by ascertaining the temperature-correction for each pen
dulum intended to be used by an independent series of experiments in an
artificially     room, the natural annual range of temperature in the
               heated
Kew pendulum-room being insufficient for our purposes. The arrangement
consisted in erecting an iron stove in the vicinity of the pendulum-
apparatus, and carrying a long pipe through the whole height of the
room.   By several preliminary trials, it was soon found that up to about
80° the temperature could be maintained constant for several hours, but
that the difficulties increased with the rise of the temperature, and be
came almost unsurmountable       when the temperature was above 100°.
Besides the maintenance of a pretty equable temperature during the dura
tion of an experiment, another difficulty arose.  The pillar of masonry
which carries the apparatus on one side, and the wall of the room on the
other, prevented us giving to the heating-apparatus such a lateral po
sition as to bring the bar which carried the thermometers and the pen
dulum   in equal proximity to it. The stove had to be placed in front,
somewhat to the left of the apparatus, and hence the brass bar which
carried the thermometers was nearer to the source of heat than the pendu
lum.     In order to arrive at the most exact measurement of the real
temperature of the pendulum, two additional thermometers were sus
pended behind       it,
                  at about the same distance from as those in front,
                                                     it
and all four were read during the experiments.
  Seeing from the preliminary trials that an approximately equal    distri
bution of temperature throughout the apparatus could only be         relied
upon up to about 70°, and that after that point the differences in the
readings of the thermometers, behind and in front, increased to an extra
ordinary degree, we decided upon making two different classes of ex
periments, viz. one set confined to temperatures of about 70°, and
another comprising higher temperatures and we further, during the pro

 cess   of reducing our observations, came to the conclusion that it would
 be   best to exclude all experiments made at temperatures above 100°,
 and also those where great differences in the readings for

   Although in the rejected experiments                       the means           of all readings of
both    sets    of thermometers            approach       each     other,       still there occurs a
fall of nearly 20° at the end of an experiment, as                             compared with that
temperature which is recorded at the beginning,                                  besides      differences
of nearly 8° between the thermometers in front                                   and those at the
back of the pendulum.                That the temperature of the latter during an
experiment is represented by the arithmetical mean of such discordant
readings, we think most unlikely; and hence these experiments and
similar ones were not used, although, of course, the number of available
experiments was thereby reduced.

rection for pressure, we took care to correct at once, before beginning an

regulate by a few strokes of the pump the pressure, so as to assimilate it
to the mean pressure (also reduced to 32°) of the experiments pre
viously made in cold air.     All pressures are reduced to 32°, and the
small difference of pressure which still resulted, comparing the mean
of the hot-air experiments with those in cold air, amounting to about
     of an inch, has been disregarded in the final reduction.

    Comparing these results with those obtained by General Sabine (Phil.
 Trans. 1830, p. 251, &c), we find that the pendulums employed by him
 gave a correction of 0-44 of a vibration per diem for each degree of
 Fahrenheit between 30° and 60°, a result which agrees well with that found
 by ourselves between 40° and 70°, the small difference being probably
 referable to a difference in the composition of the metal of which the
 pendulums were made.         But a considerable difference appears in the expe
 riments made at the higher temperature.                   General Sabine made some
 experiments, previously to those discussed in the above-mentioned paper,
 with two different pendulums in a chamber artificially heated to between
 80° and 90°, which gave for the correction for each degree of Fahrenheit,
 respectively   for the two     pendulums, 0-432 and 0*430 vibrations, cor
 responding to that part of the thermometer-scale which is included be
 tween 45° and 85°.         These results are somewhat different from those
 which   are   obtained   for the scale-reading between 30° and 60°, and
 General Sabine points to this difference in the following words * : —
    " In the experiments in the chamber artificially heated, the fluctuations
of temperature, in spite of every precaution, were considerable, and
rendered the determination        of the mean temperature more difficult, and
probably less exact than in the natural temperatures ; hence it would be
unsafe to conclude in favour of the inference to which these facts would
otherwise lead, that the correction at high temperatures is less than at low
temperatures, or that the metal expands a smaller proportion of its length
for one degree between 85° and 45° than for one degree between 60°
and 30°."
    Our own experiments, on the other hand, seem to agree with the
general fact that the coefficient of expansion increases with the tem
perature, and that in a series of experiments a lower range of temperature
will give  a lower, a  higher range        a greater value    for the expansion for one
degree.    Nevertheless the values resulting             from our high temperature-
experiments appear decidedly too large to be explained solely by this
general behaviour of bodies ; and in our reductions of the pressure-expe
riments, where the differences of temperature, as will be seen in the fol
lowing   paragraph, are inconsiderable, we have adopted that value for the
temperature-correction which results from the experiments between 45°
and 70°, viz. 0-458 of a vibration for one degree, a result which not only
well agrees with those found by General Sabine, but also appeared to our
                              * Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 252.

496                    Messrs. Stewart and Loewy on the true                           [June     17,
own     considerations        the       most   reliable,    for   reasons    which    will   appear
presently.
   Speaking generally of the subject of the temperature-correction, we
must admit that our experiments do not tend to remove the difficulties
that seem to surround it. Our experience goes to prove, what the Indian
officers, entrusted with thependulum-experiments and their reduction, have
also suspected, that the thermometers fixed to      so-called dummy-bara
(in order                            similar to the swinging pendulum)
               to place them in conditions
do not give        a          of the real temperature of the pendulum.
                       true indication
If this the case, the differences found by ourselves between the result
          is
of the lower and that of the higher range can easily be understood.
Indeed, during the progress of these experiments     has always appeared
                                                                       it
to us that not only the fluctuations indicated by the thermometers are
greater in range than those to which the pendulum itself   subjected, but        is
that they are also more rapid, and that the heavy and substantial pen
dulum cannot keep time in these changes with the light and delicate
thermometers which are not absolutely sealed up into the substance itself.
In our experiments, each of which lasted from one to two hours, a high
temperature was usually produced at the beginning, and we attempted                                   to
maintain the heat as much as possible by keeping the pendulum-room
closely shut on all sides during the progress of the experiment.   The
inrush of cold currents             can, however, obviously not be
                                                          wholly prevented,
and   asteady, more or less considerable fall of the temperature is recorded
in each of the experiments beyond 70°. This fall affects, in our opinion,
chiefly the thermometers themselves, while probably the pendulum main
tains its higher temperature much longer.    Thus we are inclined to
think that the mean temperature of the pendulum,        could by some       if
                                                                             it
means be exactly ascertained, might perhaps appear considerably higher
than the mean of the thermometer-readings recorded   and to this circum;
stance we ascribe     mainly that the high temperature-experiments
                         it                                           give
too large    correction, for in these experiments
               a                                    greater difference a                          in
the number of vibrations                corresponds to an apparently smaller difference

   The question will, we have reason to hope, find its best solution by the
labours of Colonel Walker and Captain Basevi in India, where these
gentlemen can avail themselves of     great natural range, which will free

cannot conclude this part without reminding experimenters of the words
with which, nearly forty years ago, General Sabine concluded the account
of his own experiments, and which have gained new force by the short
comings of our own investigations*.
   "It seems therefore desirable, for the sake of experiments, which are
becoming greatly multiplied, and which are daily increasing in accuracy,

for determining the changes in the number of vibrations of our pendulum
 produced by varying pressures, and hence the correction necessary to
 reduce experiments made at any pressure to a vacuum.                                 These results, as
given by each separate experiment, are contained in the following Table : —

    The experiments made at a full atmospheric pressure are the same as
 those given previously in connexion with the temperature-experiments,
 but they are here repeated for the sake of comparison.                              Their mean
 temperature being 47°' 16, the whole of the other experiments has been
 reduced to the same temperature by means of the coefficient adopted in
 accordance with our preceding statement.
    The results as given in Table III. do not require any special remarks.
 It will be seen that the resistance of the air to the motion of a pendu
 lum, as measured by the number of its vibrations, increases very slowly up
to 7 or 8 inches of pressure ; a more energetic action is exerted up to
about 20 inches, and after that point the resistance increases very slowly
up to the full atmospheric pressure.
    This behaviour is represented in a more impressive manner on the ac
companying curves.              One of them, marked A, shows simply the result
ing    number      of   vibrations    at the given pressures, which latter form the
abscissae, while the former are the ordinates.                    The second curve, B, is
derived from       A, by assuming the whole correction necessary                   to reduce the
pendulum observations made in air to a vacuum as unity, and expressing
the correction for intermediate pressures as fractions.                          The ordinate
representing unity has been divided into forty parts, each representing
0-025, enabling us to represent the correction to three decimals with
great precision.

VI. "Additional   Observations on Hydrogenium."      By Thomas
    Graham, F.R.S., Master of the Mint. Received June 10, 1869.
   From the elongation of a palladium wire, caused by the occlusion of
hydrogen, the density of hydrogenium was inferred to be a little under 2.
But it is now to be remarked that another number of half that amount
may be deduced with equal probability from the same experimental data.
This double result is a consequence of the singular permanent shorten
ing of the palladium wire observed after the expulsion of hydrogen.       In
a particular observation formerly described, for instance, a wire of 609-14
millims. increased in length to 618-92 millims. when charged with hy
drogen, and fell to 599-44 millims. when the hydrogen was extracted.
The elongation was 9-78 millims., and the absolute shortening or retrac
tion 9'7 millims., making the extreme difference in length 19-48 millims.
The elongation and retraction would appear, indeed, to be equal in
amount.     Now it is by no means impossible        that the volume added to
the wire by the hydrogenium is represented by the elongation and re
traction taken together, and not by the elongation alone, as hitherto
assumed.    It is only necessary to suppose that the retraction of the
palladium molecules takes place the moment the hydrogen is first ab
sorbed, instead of being deferred till the latter is expelled ; for the
righting of the particles of the palladium wire (which are in a state of
excessive tension in the direction of the length of the wire) may as well
take place in the act of the absorption of the hydrogen as in the ex
pulsion of that element.    It may indeed appear most probable in the
abstract that the mobility of the palladium particle is determined by the
first entrance of the hydrogen.  The hydrogenium will then be assumed
to occupy double the space previously allotted to              it,
                                                     and the density
of the metal will be reduced to one half of the former estimate.   In
the experiment referred to the volume of hydrogenium in the alloy will
rise from 4-68 per cent. to 9-36 per cent., and the density of hydro
genium will fall from l-708 to 0-854, according to the new calculation.
In  aseries of four observations upon the same wire, previously recorded,
the whole retractions      rather   exceeded   the whole   elongations,    the    first
amounting to 23 99 millims., and the last to 21-38 millims.      Their
united amount would justify  still greater reduction in the density of
                                    a
hydrogenium, namely to 0-8051.
  The first experiment, however,        in hydrogenating any palladium wire
appears to be the most uniform in its results.        The expulsion of the hy
drogen    afterwards  by   heat  always injures  the structure  of the wire more
or less, and probably affects the regularity of the expansion afterwards in
different directions.    The equality of the expansion and the retraction in
a  first experiment appears also to be         amatter of certainty.     This     is   a
curious   molecular   fact  of  which  we  are  unable   as yet  to  see  the full
import.     In illustration, another experiment upon       a   pure palladium     wire

may be detailed.          This wire, which was new, took up a full charge of
hydrogen, namely 956-3 volumes, and increased in length from 609-585
to 619 354 millims.         The elongation was therefore 9-769 millims.               With
the expulsion of the hydrogen afterwards, the wire was permanently
shortened to 600-      1 15 millims.    It thus fell 9-470 millims. below its normal
or first length.      The elongation and retraction are here within 0-3 millim.
of equality. The two changes taken together amount to 19-239 millims.,
and their sum represents the increase of the wire in length due to the
addition of hydrogenium.             It represents a linear expansion of 3-205
on 100, with a cubic expansion of 9-827 on 100. The compositon of the
wire comes to be represented as being,

The specific gravity of the palladium            was   12-3, the weight of the wire
 1-554 grm., and its volume 0-126 cub. centim.                 The occluded hydrogen
measured 120-5 cub. centims.            The weight of the same would be 0-0108
grm., and the volume of the hydrogenium               0-012382 cub. centim.          (100:
9-827   : : 0- 126 : 0-01238).      The density of the hydrogenium is therefore
                                   0-0108

                                   0-01238
This is   a near approach to the preceding result, 0-854.               Calculated on the
old method, the last experiment would give a density of l-708.
    It was incidentally observed on a former occasion that                      palladium
alloyed with silver continues to occlude hydrogen.                  This property is now
found to belong generally to palladium alloys, when the second metal does
not much exceed one half of the mixture.             These alloys are all enlarged in
dimensions when they acquire hydrogenium.                  It was interesting to per
ceive   that the expansion was greater than happens to pure palladium
(about twice as much), and that, on afterwards expelling the hydrogen by
heat, the fixed alloy returned         to its original   length without any further
shortening of the wire.          The embarrassing retraction of the palladium
has, in fact, disappeared.
   The fusion of the alloys employed was kindly effected for me by
Messrs. Matthey and Sellon, when the proportion of palladium was con
siderable, by the instrumentality of M. Deville's gas-furnace, in which
coal-gas is burned with pure oxygen — or by means of a coke-furnace
when the metals yielded to a moderate temperature.                         The alloy was
always drawn out into wire if possible, but             if   not   sufficiently ductile, it
was extended by rolling into the form of a thin ribbon.                    The elongation
caused by the addition       of hydrogenium      was ascertained by measuring the
wire or ribbon       stretched    over a graduated      scale,    as in the former      ex
periments.

   1.  Palladium, Platinum, and Hydrogenium. — Palladium was fused with
 platinum, a metal of its own class, and gave an alloy consisting, according
to analysis, of 76 03 parts of the former and 23 97 parts of the latter.
This alloy was very malleable and ductile ; its specific gravity was 12-64.
Like pure palladium, it absorbed hydrogen, evolved on its surface in the
acid fluid of the galvanometer, with great avidity.
    A wire 601-845 millims. in length (23-69 inches) was increased to
618-288 millims., on occluding 701-9 volumes of hydrogen gas measured
at 0°C. and 0-76 barom.      This is a linear elongation of 16-443 millims.
(0-6472   inch), or 2-732 on a length of 100.    It corresponds with a cubic
expansion of 8-423 volumes on 100 volumes; and the product may be
represented —

   The elements for the calculation of the density of hydrogenium are the
following, the assumption being made as formerly, that the metals are
united without condensation : —
           Original weight of the wire 4-722 grms.
           Original volume of the wire 0-373 cub. centim.
           Volume of the hydrogen extracted 264-5 cub. centims.
           Weight of the hydrogen extracted, by calculation, 0-0237 grm.
   The volume of the hydrogenium        will            be to the volume       of the wire
                                                               is,
(0-373 cub. centim.) as 100 is to 8-423— that       0-03141 cub. centim.
Finally, dividing the weight of the hydrogenium by its hulk, 0-0237 by
0-03141, the density of hydrogenium     found to be 0-7545.

returned to its first dimensions as exactly as could be measured.    The
platinum present appears to sustain the palladium, so that no retraction
of that metal   allowed to take place. This alloy therefore displays the true
                is
increase of volume following the acquisition of hydrogenium, without the
singular complication of the retraction of the fixed metal.      It now ap
pears clear that the retraction of pure palladium must occur on the first
entrance of hydrogen into the metal.     The elongation of the wire due to
the hydrogenium       negatived thereby to the extent of about one half,
                     is
and  the apparent bulk  of the hydrogenium     reduced to the same extent.

Hydrogenium came in consequence to be represented of double its true
density.
   The compound alloy returns to its original density (12-64) upon the
expulsion of the hydrogen, showing that hydrogen leaves without pro
ducing porosity in the metal.      No absorptive power for vapours, like
that of charcoal, was acquired.

wire of alloy increased sensibly more in thickness than the pure palladium,
about twice as much ; the reason                 is,
                                        that the latter while expanding re
tracts in length at the same time. The expansion of both wires may be
familiarly compared to the enlargement of the body of leech on absorbing      a
blood. The enlargement uniform in all dimensions with the palladium -
                                     is
platinum alloy the leech becomes larger, but remains symmetrical. But

the retraction in the pure palladium wire has its analogy in muscular con           a
traction of the leech, by which its body                 becomes        shorter but thicker in       a
 corresponding measure.
    The same wire of palladium and platinum charged                            a   second time with
 hydrogen, underwent an increase in length from 601-845 to 618-2, or
 sensibly the same as before. The gas measured 258-0 cub. centims., or
 619-6 times the volume of the wire. The product may be represented as

 1-902 on 100,       and a cubic expansion of 5-81 on 100.           The volu-«e o/
 hydrogen gas     extracted was  188-8  cub.  centims.,   of  which   the weight is
 0-016916 grm. The volume of the hydrogenium was 0-02365 cub. centim.,
that of the palladium-gold alloy being 0-40/l cub. centim.               Hence the
 density of the hydrogenium      is 0-715.
    In  a  third experiment     made on a shorter       length of the same wirr,
 namely 241-2 millims., the amount of gas occluded was very similar, namrb
 468 volumes, and was not increased by protracting the exposure of the
wire for the long period of twenty hours.       There can be little doubt, then, of
 the uniformity of the hydrogenium      combination,   the volume of gas occluded
in the three experiments being 464-2, 463-7, and 468 volumes.            The linear
expansion was 1-9 on 100 in the third experiment, and therefore similar
also to the preceding experiments.
   The hydrogenium may        be supposed to be    in direct combination with the
palladium only, as gold by     itself shows no attraction for the former element.
In the first experiment the hydrogenium is in the proportion of 0-3151 to
 100 palladium and gold together.        This gives 0-3939 hydrogenium to 100
palladium ; while a whole equivalent of hydrogenium is 0-939 to 100 pal
ladium*.       The hydrogenium found is by calculation 0-4195 equivalent,
or 1 equivalent hydrogenium to 2-383 equivalents palladium, which comes
nearer to 2 equivalents of the former with 5 of the latter than to any other
proportion.
   To ascertain the smallest proportion of gold which prevents retraction,
an alloy was made by fusing 7 parts of that metal with 93 parts of palla
dium, which had a specific gravity of 13-05.           The button was rolled into
a thin strip   and  charged  with  hydrogen by   the  wet  method.    An occlusion
of 585-44      volumes of gas took place, with a linear expansion of 1-7 on
100. A retraction followed to nearly the same extent on afterwards ex
pelling the hydrogen by heat.
   With another alloy, produced by fusing 10 of gold with 90 of palladium,
the occlusion of gas was 475 volumes, the linear expansion 1-65 on 100.
The retraction on expelling the gas afterwards was extremely slight.            To
nullify the retraction of the palladium, about 10 per cent. of gold appears
therefore to be required in the alloy.
   Another alloy of palladium of sp. gr. 13-1, and containing 14-79 per
cent, of gold, underwent no retraction on losing hydrogen, as already
stated.
   The    presence   of  so much    gold in the alloy as half its weight did no
materially reduce the occluding power of the palladium.              Such an alloy
was capable of holding 459-9 times its volume of hydrogen, with a linear
expansion of 1-67 per cent.
   3. Palladium, Silver, and Hydrogenium. — The occluding power of pal
ladium appeared to be entirely lost when that metal was alloyed with much
more than its own weight          of any fixed metal.       Palladium alloys  con-

taiuing       80, 75, and 70 per cent, of silver occluded no hydrogen           what
ever.
      With     about 50 per cent, of silver, palladium rolled into a thin strip oc
 cluded       400-6 volumes of hydrogen.         It expanded 1 -64 part in 100 in
 length,      and returned to its original dimensions without retraction upon the
 expulsion of the gas. The specific gravity of this silver-palladium alloy
was 11 -8; the density of the hydrogenium 0-727.
      An alloy which was formed of 66 parts of palladium and 34 parts of
 silver had the specific gravity 11-45.           It was drawn into wire and found
 to absorb 511-37 volumes of hydrogen.             The length of the wire increased
 from 609-601 to 619-532 millims.            This is a linear elongation of 1-629. on
  100, or cubic expansion of 4-97 on 100. The weight of the wire was
  3-483 grms., its volume 0-3041 cub. centim. The absolute volume of
  occluded hydrogen was 125-1 cub. centims., of which the weight is
  0-01 120896.         The volume of the hydrogenium was 0-015105 cub. centim.
  The resulting density of hydrogenium is 0-742.
      In a repetition of the experiment upon another portion of the same
  wire, 407-7 volumes of hydrogen were occluded, and the wire increased
  in length from 609-601 millims. to 619-44 millims. This is a linear ex
  pansion of 1-614 part on 100, and a cubic expansion of 4-92 on 100.
  The absolute volume of hydrogen gas occluded was 124-0 cub. centims., and
  its calculated weight 0 01111 grm. The volume of the hydrogenium
  being 0-1496 cub. centim., the density of hydrogenium indicated is 0-741.
  The two experiments are indeed almost identical.               The wire returned
  in both experiments to its original length exactly after the extraction of
  the gas.
       4. Palladium, Nickel, and Hydrogenium. — The alloy, consisting of equal
  parts of palladium and nickel, was white, hard, and readily extensible.         Its
   specific gravity was     1  1-22. This alloy occluded 69-76 volumes of hydro
  gen, with a linear expansion of 0-2 per cent.           It suffered no retraction
  below its normal length on the expulsion of the gas by heat.
       An alloy of equal parts of bismuth and palladium was a brittle mass that
   did not admit of being rolled.       It occluded no hydrogen, after exposure to
   that gas as the negative electrode in an acid fluid for a period of 18 hours.
   It   seems   probable that malleability and the colloid character, which are
   wanting in this bismuth alloy, are essential to the occlusion of hydrogen by
   a  palladium alloy.
       An alloy of   1  part of copper and 6 parts of palladium proved moderately
    extensible, but absorbed no sensible amount of hydrogen.            The metallic
    laminae which remain on digesting this alloy in hydrochloric acid, and
    which   were found by M. Debray to be a definite alloy of palladium and
    copper (Pd Cu), exhibited no sensible occluding power.
       The conclusions suggested as to the density of hydrogenium, by the
     compound    with palladium alone and by the compounds with palladium
    alloys, are as follows   : —

    The results, it will be observed, are most uniform with the compound
alloys, in which retraction is avoided, and they lie between 0- 71 1 and
0-7545.       It may be argued that hydrogenium is likely to be condensed
somewhat in combination, and that consequently the smallest number
(0-711) is likely to be the nearest to the truth. But the mean of the two
extreme numbers will probably be admitted as a more legitimate deduction
from      the experiments on the compound alloys, and 0-733              be accepted
provisionally as the approximate density of hydrogenium.
    I   have   the pleasure to repeat my acknowledgments to Mr. W. C.
Roberts for his valuable assistance in this inquiry.
    Could the density of hydrogenium be more exactly determined, it would
be interesting     to compare its atomic volume with the atomic volumes of
other metals.       With the imperfect information we possess, one or two
points may be still worthy of notice.         It will be observed that palladium is
 1 6- 78 times denser than hydrogenium taken as 0-733, and 17-3 times denser
than hydrogenium taken as 0-71 1.           Hence, as the equivalent of palladium
is 106-5, the atomic volume of palladium is 6-342 times greater than the
atomic volume of hydrogenium having the first density mentioned, and
6- 1 56 greater with the second density.        To give an atomic volume to palla
dium exactly six times greater than that of hydrogenium, the latter ele
ment would require to have the density 0-693.
    Taking the density of hydrogenium at 0-7, and its atomic volume equal
to   1, then the following results may be deduced by calculation.         The atomic
volume of lithium is found to be 0-826; or it is less even than that of hy
drogenium (1).         The atomic volume of iron is 5-026, of magnesium
4-827, of copper 4-976, of manganese 4-81, and of nickel 4-67.               Of these
five   metals,  the atomic volume   is  nearly 5 times that of hydrogenium.       Pal
ladium has already appeared to be nearly 6 times. The atomic volume of
aluminium on the same scale is 7-39, of sodium 16-56, and of potassium
 31-63.

     My dear Sir, — After what         I wrote to you last week you will scarcely
 be surprised     to hear again from me on the same subject ; and indeed I
 feel in some measure bound to communicate without delay results of fur

ier and more            successful observations.        Should you think fit to publish
them,       I hope you will do       so, as   I cannot command the necessary leisure to
follow them up myself to their legitimate conclusion.
    On the 3rd instant I learnt (as I informed you) that the spectrum of
the    solar envelope was visible with the spectroscope at my command, appar
ently without difficulty.              On the following day I saw the same pheno-
nena, and was enabled to form a fair mental picture of the distribution of
the luminous regions surrounding the sun.                     Two very fine prominences
were particularly examined, one of which was evidently a large cloud float
 ing 1' to 2' above the surface.
     On the 5th, while traversing over a new prominence to learn its shape
and dimensions, I became aware of a fourth line in the neighbourhood of G.
Its      position was determined without difficulty with reference to the rest of
that crowded group of solar lines. It was identical with the thick line at
 2796 of KirchhofFs chart.              I have seen the same line repeatedly since, and
 have satisfied myself of the identity stated.
       It rained pretty heavily on the night of the 5th ; and the next morning
  I   was disappointed by seeing no remarkable prominences, and but faint in
  dications, in many parts, of the solar envelope.              In the afternoon, however,
   the air,     I suppose, being clearer, I could again see the luminous spectrum
   in nearly every part.          But there were very few elevated masses.           Having
   traversed round the whole circumference, I returned, after perhaps an hour's
    search, to examine again a moderately striking elevation which I had no
    ticed at setting out ; and for this purpose I directed the slit as a tangent
    to the surface at the place — the most favourable position for getting a good
    view of the lines.
         Immediately      I remarked that the red line was very brilliant, and glan
     cing up     the  spectrum saw that the orange and blue lines were also much
     more intense than usual.          My eye was next caught by a fainter red flash,
     which    I  soon succeeded    in  seeing    more steadily.    Concluding    that it was
     the line which      Mr. Lockyer had         seen
                                                       " occasionally,"  I only staid to es
      timate its position, and proceeded to bring the violet end into the field to
      have another look at the line in that region and to see F to better advan
      tage.                   I
               In so doing noticed another line (the sixth) between F and G.
          Before going any      further   I   must take the liberty of christening these
       lines for reference.     Leaving a and ft for C and F if wanted,       I  would call
       the orange line near D J, the violet one y, the red          line near  C  e, and the
       last mentioned         The solar bright-line series is then as follows : —

    The position of       e is estimated    ; for there    are no visible     solar lines between
B and C (in my spectroscope), and                because by the time           I was ready to go
back and measure it (( having already faded) it was no longer to be seen ;
and as the other lines had visibly decreased in brilliancy, could only con     I
clude that     I  had been a fortunate witness of the effects of a violent and
spasmodic action or eruption of vapour lasting only a few minutes.                              Nor
       I
did see any recurrence of this spectacle, though                          I   watched for some
time.
     I should    here state that      I  was  looking at this time        at a very low stratum,
and that the line y is rarely visible except quite close to the sun's limb ;
F also is not generally brilliant, except near the limb. S is never (so far
as   I  have seen) so brilliant as either C or F.
     I  have said that these appearances are to be seen without any defence
from excessive light ; and this is strictly true, for                   I  have seen them rea
dily,    even  when     the   paper cap     which    I  at  first  used    over   the object-glass
was removed ; but as a precaution against the heating-effects of the sun's
image,     I  have latterly used metal diaphragms, one of £-inch diameter, 12
inches, and a second of ^*-inch diameter, 1 £ to 2 inches distant from the
slit. When these had been inserted                    I  dispensed with any cover for the
object-glass.         I  was in hopes that, by carefully            stopping      out all unneces
                                I
sary light in this way, should be able to dispense with a slit, and view the
monochromatic images of a protuberance on the white background (so to
speak) of the atmospheric illumination. But so far                          I  have been disap
pointed.       Nevertheless       I  still believe that whoever will go            a step   further
and use a      red glass prism tcithout a slit will see the actual                  " red flames."
 [When writing my eclipse-report                 J   was under        the   impression    that   the
 orange was the principal light (v. § 43).]                       This much of foundation I
 have for this belief, that I actually have seen the form of a solar cloud
 through a widely distended slit — not a luminous line of varying length and
 position, but a view such as you may obtain through a partly open shutter
 by moving the head slightly to and fro, only that the movement was in
 this case effected by a gentle pressure up and down of the telescope itself —
a movement rendered possible by the absence of perfect rigidity of the in
 strument.                         I
                  In this way could see clearly that the solar clouds were very
 similar to terrestrial ones, fleecy, irregularly shaped, and illuminated, Sec.,
 just as eclipses have told us they are. The opening through which I
 viewed them was about             | of a minute in width, and the height and length
 of the mass       \\   and 3 minutes respectively, or thereabouts.
      After this    I  need not describe the appearances of the lines, the less so
  as  I  fully expect that,       once    the ready visibility of these           appearances be
  comes realized, numerous             accounts of such eruptions as             I saw yesterday,
  as well as   of the real forms and appearances which they present, will                         be
  forthcoming       from observers who can better spare the necessary daylight
 hours.

   1869.]                     Observations    of the Sun.                      509
      May 8. — This morning I received, and read with deep interest, your
  article in the ' Journal of Science.'        Had I received it a week ago, my
  note of the 3rd would have been differently worded.         On the other hand,
  it is clear that some of the facts I have stated above are still legitimate sub
  jects for communication, and will probably lead to further discoveries.
  The new lines may or may not have been since seen by Mr. Lockyer. In the
  former case the corroboration will be worth something — the more so as his
  secondary red line, as mentioned in Mr. Crookes's article in the January No.
  of the ' Journal of Science,' is apparently misplaced.        This line, as also
  those I have called 5 and £, does not appear to coincide with any known
 solar line.    The elementary substances to which these belong remain yet
 to be declared.       As for y, I suppose the strong solar line to which it
 corresponds belongs to some known element.
     I have not remarked any tendency in F to vary in width.
     It cannot but be considered strange that no traces have been seen of       M.
 Rayet's and Major Tennant's green lines.          I have watched that part of the
 spectrum very closely on purpose, but, even where the four principal lines
 were more than ordinarily bright,        I  have failed to distinguish even the
 slightest fading of the strong magnesium lines, or of others in that neigh
 bourhood.       This fading invariably precedes the substitution of a bright for
 a dark line : thus, if the slit admits to view the tops of several adjacent
 prominences, the line F (for instance) is broken into detached bright por
 tions, between which there is in each case a more or less complete hiatus,
 which may or may not amount to the original dark solar line.            The dark
 line, being only a less intense light, is susceptible of all degrees of darkness,
just as the bright line, being only a more intense light, may appear of all
lower degrees of brightness.       This intermediate condition between dark and
bright is constantly to be recognized, more or less strongly marked, within
 the sun's border ; but I cannot say      I have seen a continuation of the bright
 line inwards.       I often see this absence of the dark line y when the light
is not intense enough to show it as a " bright
                                                      " line. So far, then, as re
gards the magnesium element I have strong negative evidence, which is
strengthened by the consideration of the improbability that such a very
marked group should not have been recognized by the above-mentioned
observers if it was actually present, on the one hand, and that the element
should have been represented by a single member only of this group, on the
other.      The confident way in which this metal has been accepted as re
cognized, by more than one speculator, seems to challenge question on the
evidence.
    And    I  would take the present opportunity to remark that, after the
studied avoidance (on my part) of such hasty conclusions,           I have felt it
rather hard to be set right where      I  had not erred, as in the case of the
orange line.      I never said that a line, apparently identical though it was
with D, represented sodium.          One writer, if I recollect right, made me
responsible, not only for sodium and hydrogen, but for magnesium as well I

 Neither word        even occurs      in my report, except incidentally in the words
  "a   sodium-flame."           The exceeding care which I observe in your own
 writings in this respect will, I hope, make it unnecessary for me to apo
 logize for this protest.
     To return : 1 do not question the presence of an element giving a green
 line ; the testimony of three observers must be taken as conclusive ; but I
 am slow to believe that either            E or b is  connected with it.
     This afternoon I made a slight advance towards seeing the actual forms
 with greater comfort.            Taking a hint from your figure (p. 2 1 6 of the above
 article),   I  introduced one of the compound prisms of the hand-spectro
 scopes    into  the eye-tube, thus increasing the dispersion by about one-fourth,
 which enabled me to open the slit a little wider.                  Finding a suitable pro
 minence, I was able to examine it with an aperture of about 20" to 25".
 As it was not much more than 1' in height,                 I  could, by a slight pressure
 one way or the            other,
  view the whole.         It is of
 course wholly unimpor
 tant what the actual form
 was, but, for the sake of
 illustration,    I   attempt a Jf
 drawing.       It  is not easy
                                     1^^T
 to convey the impression J-
 of a fleecy cloud such as —           —
 I saw. I       looked at one or two others in the same way, and left off even
 tually quite satisfied that with a suitable battery the whole of any promi
 nence or eruption might be seen with comfort (either the red, or the
 orange, or the blue, or any other principal image being examined at will)
 by limiting the field of view, and with it the unnecessary diffuse light, to
 the actual dimensions of the object.               The portion of a cloud-shape which
 is due to one element          will  thus be artificially separated from the form which
 is due to another, and the regions or strata to which the various elements
are confined will become known with certainty *.
     It is unfortunately       impossible for me to prosecute these researches any
 further.      I have neither the leisure nor the opportunity to devise and use
 suitable instruments except at rare intervals, for which such discoveries
 will not wait.                               Yours very truly,

           Zirconium."   By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S. &c.     Received June 4,
           1869.
     At the Soiree of the President of the Royal Society on March 6th,                     I
exhibited various spectra, differing so much from those characteristic of
any known substance, that             I
                                considered myself warranted in concluding
that they were evidence of a new element.    Since this may be studied to
the greatest advantage in the jargons of Ceylon, it appeared to me that,
like as the name zirconium has been adopted for the principal constituent
of zircons, so that of jargonium would be very suitable for this constituent
of jargons.
    At the above-named Soiree I gave away a printed account of the
objects I exhibited, and in this I said that the earth jargonia
                                                                     " is distin
 guished from zirconia and all other known substances by the following very
 remarkable properties.     The natural silicate is almost, if not quite colour
less, and yet it gives a spectrum which shows above a dozen narrow black
lines, much more distinct than even those characteristic sf salts of didymium.
When melted with borax it gives a glassy bead, clear and colourless both
hot and cold, and no trace of absorption-bands can be seen in the spec
 trum ; but if the borax bead be saturated at a high temperature, and
flamed, so that it may be filled with crystals of borate of jargonia, the
spectrum shows four distinct absorption-bands, unlike those due to any
 other known substances *.
                           "
   I have since applied myself almost exclusively to this subject, hoping to
have been able to communicate to the Royal Society a full account before
the close of this session ; but so much still remains to be done, that it is
now impossible to give more than a brief outline of some of the more im
portant facts.  The delay has not been occasioned by any difficulty in
proving it to be a new substance, but because its properties are so unique
and have so much interest in connexion with physics that it appeared de
sirable to carefully examine all other known elements, in order to ascer
tain whether any exhibit analogous phenomena.
   That jargonium is quite distinct from zirconium is proved not only by
the spectra, but also by other facts.    Both                  I
                                                  and Mr. David Forbes
have succeeded,  by entirely different processes, in separating from jargons
zirconia apparently quite free from jargonia, and jargonia nearly, if not
quite, free from zirconia ; and, even if the separation be not perfect, it                is,
at   all       more than sufficient to prove that they are distinct.

are certainly closely allied, and are deposited from borax blowpipe beads
in microscopical crystals of the same general forms, quite unlike those
characteristic of other known             earths   ;   but, beyond this, the difference   is

contain more than one earth.   He was so far correct, but failed to esta
blish the existence of any substance with special chemical or physical pro
perties ; and    as    probable, the Norwegian zircons, which, according to
                     if,     is
his views, contain such                a    notable quantity of this supposed new earth as
to have led him to give                 it    the name noria, were from Fredericksvarn,
and if the Siberian were from Miask, his norium cannot be looked upon as
equivalent to my jargonium, which       almost or quite absent from those
                                                      is
zircons.
  The most remarkable    peculiarity of jargonium       that its compounds
                                                                        is
may exist in no less than three different crystalline states, giving spectra
which differ from one another as much as those of any three totally dif
ferent elements which give the most striking and characteristic spectra.
Several substances can be obtained in two physical states, giving different
spectra  :but usually only one of them     crystalline    the other
                                                             is          the ;              is
vitreous or colloid condition.     Crystalline minerals, coloured by oxide of
chromium, do indeed show two types of spectra, but                am not aware
                                                                             I
that they   ever both  occur in the same   mineral.   In the case  of jargonium,
however, the three types of spectra are all met with in crystalline modi
fications of apparently the same compound.
   The most characteristic test for jargonia        the spectrum of the borax
                                                                  is
blowpipe beads, seen with the spectrum-microscope, which enables us to de
tect in zircons containing less than one per cent.

natural silicate as will completely dissolve should be melted in circular loops
of platinum wire, about of an inch in diameter, with mixture of borax and
                                  g                                     a
boric acid, and       a    very strong heat kept up          till crystals begin to be deposited,
owing      to loss    of the solvent by volatilization.
                                                   On removing the beads
from the flame they remain clear, and show        few acicular crystals, but
                                                                   a

bright cloud, so as to give an excellent spectrum, without being at all daz
zling.   In the case of beads containing jargonia, the spectrum differs com

sorption-bands      ; and when the crystals are deposited at as low a tempera
ture as possible, much below dull redness, and only just high enough to
soften the borax, there may be scarcely any trace of bands ; but, if a clear
bead be quickly raised to a temperature very little below dull redness, it
suddenly becomes opaque, and shows a spectrum with a number of narrow
black absorption-bands (fig. 1). The most distinct is in the green, then
one in the red, and one in the blue ; and there are three fainter, one in
the orange, and two in the green.          On raising the temperature to bright
redness all these bands vanish, and four others appear, none of which coin
 cides with the former (fig. 2). Three are situated in the red and orange, and
                Red end.                                       blue end.

 one in the green, so as to give a spectrum           of very different general cha
racter.    In this     state the bead is a pale straw-colour,     and not, as before,
 almost white.       In the    case of nearly pure jargonia, the bead should not
he more than             of  an  inch thick, or else it would be too opaque.
Pure zirconia treated in the same manner gives no bands whatever in any
condition ; the bead is quite white, and sufficiently transparent when two
or three times as thick as just named.
    It might   be    thought that the three different spectra thus briefly de
 scribed were due to different compounds, if it were not that there is a
similar series in the case of the natural crystalline silicate.          Some of the
jargons of Ceylon have a specific gravity very little inferior to that of pure
 zircons (4- 70), and contain very little jargonia ; but those of low gravity
 (4-20 or thereabouts) contain perhaps nearly 10 per cent., in a form
which gives scarcely any trace of absorption-bands.            On keeping such a
specimen at a bright red heat for some time, the specific gravity increases
from about 4-20 to 4-60.          Judging from the imperfect data now known,
this   indicates   that the volume of the silicate of jargonia is reduced to
about one-half     ; the hardness becomes       somewhat greater, and, when exa
mined with the spectrum-microscope,          the spectrum is found to be entirely
changed.      Instead of a mere trace        of bands, a spectrum is seen with
 thirteen narrow black lines and a broader band, more remarkable than that
 of any clear transparent substance with which I am acquainted.             No such
 changes occur in the case of zircons free from jargonia, like those from
 Miask, Siberia ; there is no increase in the specific gravity, and no ab
 sorption-bands      arc developed, and, as    a  general rule, the increase varies

simply and directly as the amount of jargonia which passes from one state
into the other.  Zircons in their natural condition from various localities
contain a very variable absolute and relative amount of these two modifica
tions of jargonia, and there seems good reason to believe that this differ
ence     physical state may materially assist us in
        in                                                                 determining the
temperature at which certain rocks have been formed.                        I have also met
with   one example of the third         form of spectrum.              A brown-red          zircon
from Ceylon was so dark in one           part as to be  quite opaque, and therefore
I  do not know what the original         spectrum might have been.      On heating
it to redness, the whole became         a clear pale green ; and, without examina
tion with the spectroscope, no one would have suspected any difference be
tween the different portions.  That which was originally a pale brown-red
then showed the same spectrum as that usually developed by heat, whilst
that which was originally very dark showed an entirely different spectrum,
corresponding exactly with that of the borate deposited in blowpipe beads
at a medium temperature.    It also corresponds in general character, but
not in detail, with that of the blue spinels from Ceylon, which must,   think,          I
contain a small quantity of jargonia.      That part of the zircon which gave
this spectrum appears to have had the same remarkably low specific gravity
of about 4-0, both before and after ignition, as though the volume of the
silicate of jargonia in this state were even greater than in that which gives no
bands. All these spectra, due to jargonium, are of a very marked character,
and quite unlike those due to any other element in similar conditions.
  The alteration produced in jargons by heat                 is,
                                                    to some slight extent,

arragonite    but, instead of changing into an opaque mass of minute crys

mercury      is                        of an alteration in the spectrum, due
                  an excellent illustration
to  a  change  in  crystalline form produced by heat      but still the facts
                                                                   ;

and rutile have distinct crystalline forms, but they do not differ much in
specific gravity, and their spectra present no characteristic differences.
On the whole, the different states of carbon (charcoal, graphite, and dia
mond) are perhaps the best illustration of the existence of three different
conditions  in the same substance, since they differ materially in specific
gravity  and optical characters, one being black, the other having     metallic     a
lustre, and the third being transparent and colourless     but these are varia

     There      cannot then,       I think,  he any doubt whatever that jargonium       is
not only        a new elementary substance, but is also one likely to throw much
light     on several important physical questions.         By the time that the Society
resumes its meetings, I trust that I shall be able to send a complete
account of the whole of my investigations, including such facts connected
 with other substances as may serve to illustrate the very peculiar properties
 of this     hitherto unrecognized element.

     I    here    subjoin    a   brief account of the methods        employed by Mr.
 David Forbes* and myself in separating zirconia                     and jargonia from
  one another.         He separated apparently pure zirconia by means of strong
  hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the chloride of jargonium, but left chlo
 ride of zirconium undissolved ; and obtained the approximately pure jar
  gonia by adding to the solution excess of ammonia, and then considerable
  excess of tartaric acid, which left most of the tartrate of jargonia insolu
  ble, but dissolved what may turn out to be a mixture of zirconia and jar
  gonia with a third substance, not yet sufficiently studied — perhaps Svan-
   berg's noria.       My own analysis        was only qualitative.    I fused powdered
  jargon with       several   times its weight of borax, which gave a perfectly clear
   glass, completely soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. After separating the
   silica in the usual manner, a slight excess of ammonia was added to the
   hydrochloric-acid solution of the earths, and then some oxalic and hydro
   chloric acids, which left undissolved apparently pure zirconia that had
   passed into an imperfectly soluble state.             To the solution so much am
   monia was added as to give a very copious precipitate, but yet to leave the
   solution with a very decided acid reaction.              After removing the precipi
   tate,   which was chiefly oxalate of zirconia, almost or quite free from jar
   gonia, excess of ammonia was added to the solution, and the washed
    precipitate digested in dilute hydrochloric acid, to remove peroxide of iron.
   The insoluble portion must have been approximately pure oxalate of jar
    gonia, for it gave the characteristic spectra described below in remark
    able perfection.       Though this method        succeeded  far better than  I antici
   pated,    I  do not yet understand         the exact conditions requisite to ensure
   success, and have         been prevented by absence from home from making
    further experiments.

516                 Mr.    J. P. Harrison on Solar Radiation.                    [June  17,
Royal Society in     1867 *,   it  was shown, from observations        of the black-bulb
thermometer      and Herschel's       actinometer,  that maximum           effects  of solar
radiation occur at Greenwich, on the average, some weeks after the summer
solstice, and about two hours after mid-day, when the atmosphere would
appear to be charged with a considerable amount of vapour.
   These results accord with the fact that the highest readings of the solar
thermometer are met with in India in districts of great relative humidity t,
the explanation of the phenomenon being, as the author ventured to sug
gest in the paper above alluded to, that an increase of insolation is pro
duced by radiation from cloud and visible vapour.
   During the two years which have elapsed since the spring of 1867,
whenever the state of the sky and other circumstances permitted, special
observations have been made for the purpose of ascertaining with greater
certainty the nature of the relation between insolation and humidity.
   Before proceeding to state results, it will afford additional proof that
a connexion     between the phenomena really exists, if a passage in the
appendix    to a work by the late Principal of St. Andrews, until very
recently overlooked, is quoted in support of the fact. Mr. Forbes, writing
some years ago, employs much the same words that were used in the
                                  "
paper above referred to : — Cloudy weather, if the sun be not itself greatly
                                                                        "
obscured, apparently increases the effect of solar radiation               J.
   The action, however,       does not appear to be confined to days on              which
there is visible cloud   ; for even on cloudless days (so called) very high read
ings  of solar radiation    seem to be due to the presence of opalescent vapour,
which can be easily detected if the hand or some other screen is held for a
few minutes before the sun.
   Thus, on May 2, 1868, at lh 30m, solar radiation appearing to be rela
tively intense, on raising a screen white glare was observed around the
sun, and the tint of the sky, which had previously appeared a fair blue,
was found, more especially in the south, to be very pale.
   But the most interesting result of this series of observations is the dis
covery that an apparent increase of solar radiation occurs as the sun enters
a white cloud    of sufficient tenuity to allow free passage for its rays.
   In October 1867,      at 2h,  whilst attentively watching      a solar thermometer,
a sudden rise was observed to take place, upon which, the sun being im
mediately screened,     it  was   found that it had entered the bright border of
a cumulus.
   On May 1 1, 1868, at 22h 40m, as a very light cloud approached the sun,
which was shining in blue sky, the mercury rose 4°, and in 30 seconds
 3° more as it entered the white cloud.
    On the same day, at 23h, the reading of the solar thermometer was 1 0 1 ° F.
when the sun was in the midst of cirri, but it fell in 3 minutes 9° when

was perfectly still.
  On May 1 5, 1 868, the highest reading of the solar thermometer for the
day occurred at 2h 1 7m, just as the sun entered the skirts of a cloud.
  On    July         21, 1868, at 2h, the maximum        of the day (128° F.)       was reached
when the sun was shining in a patch of pale sky surrounded with white
cumuli, some of which were within one or two diameters of its disk.
  To mention one more example amongst numerous others which might
be cited    ;       on Aug. 3, 1868, at      0h 40m,   under an apparently clear sky, the
solar thermometer registering                112°, and the temperature      of     shade 82°,   in
two minutes insolation increased to   1 25°, whilst the temperature of shade
rose 0-3 only ; on examining     the sky in the neighbourhood of the sun,
white cirri were detected crossing its disk.
   Light cloud and opalescent vapour having been thus found, when in the
direction of the sun, to intensify the effects of solar radiation, a series of
experiments was commenced with circular screens of various sizes, to dis
cover, if possible, the distance to which the effects of bright glare and
light vapoury cloud extended round the sun.
   The observations were made when the sun's altitude                       was between         30
and 50 degrees.    All the screens were placed at a uniform distance of
six inches from the bulb of a solar thermometer, 5 in. in diameter, coated
with China ink, and laid on a small piece of dark oak about two inches by
ten inches on grass.    The bulb of the thermometer was not covered
with an exhausted globe. The mean results of the experiments were as
follows*        :   —
   1.   A        in. in diameter reduced the difference of the readings of
            screen       £
the black-bulb thermometer and a thermometer in the shade, four yards
distant, by one-third.
   2.   A   screen       1\ ins. in diameter reduced the difference by two-thirds.
   On reversing the experiment, converse results were obtained, e. g.
   The rays of the sun, after passing through a circular aperture 2i ins.
in diameter in a 12-in. screen, were made to fall on the bulb of the solar
thermometer, when the readings were found to equal in value those ob
tained when the instrument was entirely exposedf.
   And no difference was noticed when the black-bulb                       thermometer was
screened from the rest               of the sky by     a double cover   of mill-board     placed
tent-wise over it.
  * Similar results          were    obtained when tho solar thermometer was laid upon short
grass, in the afternoon, when tho dew was off the ground.
   With the instrument freely suspended 6 in. above the grass, the readings showed
a proportionate fall.
   t In the above experiments, it is evident that the whole of the results were not due to
direct radiation or reflection. Account must be taken of the greater or less distance of
tho heated surface of the ground, and of the hot air in contact with         it,
                                                                          from the bulb of

    Results of an equally negative kind were obtained in the case of other
experiments which were made with the object of detecting heat in the
light reflected from sky and cloud not in the direction of the sun.
    A black -bulb thermometer, after having been placed for some time in a
dark room, was then exposed to the sky, near a large French window, facing
S.E., the glass of which was clear, and had been carefully cleaned, without
any rise being perceptible.            The sun, at an altitude of about 40°, was
shining brightly      on   white  vapour and light cirro-cumuli*.
   Thermometers were also placed in the open air on the north side of the
house, on a still day, exposed to half the sky when covered with bright
white clouds      ;  but the mercury stood at the same height as in a dark
passage on the same side of the buildingf.
    The same apparent absence of any direct heating-power in the light re
flected from the sky generally was shown in this, as in the previous series
of experiments when the solar thermometer was screened, excepting in the
direction of the sun.
    As   respects     the momentary        increase of insolation        which occurs in
connexion with bright vapour in the neighbourhood                     of the sun, further
experiment is required for the purpose of ascertaining whether                  it is  due to
radiation or to reflection.
    Note. — An opportunity occurred              on the 7th     of June of repeating       the
 experiments with        screens   at altitudes      of the sun exceeding 50°.            The
following results were obtained         : —

          OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
                                ML    1  to 12 (1791 to 1804).
  Michael Faraday*           was born in the working class,      of a very religious family.
  For two generations at least those who preceded him shared the extreme
  views in favour of toleration and disestablishment which caused, first, the de
  position of the Rev. John Glas, and afterwards the secession of his son-in-
  law, R. Sandeman, from the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. That the re
  vealed will of Christ should be the supreme and only law, not only in all
  church questions, but in every thought and word and deed, was the belief of
  those who were nearest to Fp.raday in his infancy ; and this he held through
  out his life, as though it had been a special revelation to himself.
     His father, James, was the third of ten children born at Clapham in
  Yorkshire.      He  was a blacksmith       ;   his eldest brother     worked as slater,
  grocer, and millowner, another brother was a farmer, another a packer, an
  other  a shopkeeper, and the youngest a shoemaker.               Another of the brothers
  died young, in the year Michael was born ; and a letter from the mother of
  the young man shows the strength of the religious feeling in mother and son.
     When twenty-five, in 1786, Jame- Faraday married Margaret Hastwell,
  daughter of a farmer near Kirkby Stephen. Soon after their marriage they
  came to Newington      in Surrey, where Michael, their third child, was born,
  September 22, 1791, in a house probably long since pulled down.                       The
 father obtained work at Boyd's, in Welbeck Street ; and when Michael was
  about five years old, after living a short time in Gilbert Street, they removed
 to rooms over a coach-house in Jacob's Well Mews, Charles Street, Man
  chester Square. The home of Michael Faraday was in these mews for nearly
 ten years ; and his family remained there until 1809, when they moved
 to 18 Weymouth Street.
     Faraday himself has pointed out where he played at marbles in Spanish
 Place, and where, years later, he took care of his little sister in Manchester
 Square.      He says, " My education was of the most ordinary description,
 consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading, writing, and arith
 metic at a common day-school.             My hours out of school were passed at
home and in the streets."
    Only a few yards off was a bookseller's shop, No. 2 Blandford Street ;
 there, as a boy of thirteen, in 1804, he went on trial for a year to Mr.
 George Riebau.        Once when walking with a niece they passed a little
news-boy, when he said,
                               " I always feel a tenderness for those boys, because
I once carried newspapers myself."

                                                    having been already given to the world
by one eminently qualified for the task,  it   has been deemed advisable in this place   to
give a narrative of the chief events of his personal history, with such indications of his
character   and opinions as may be read in his written correspondence           and private
memorials. This service has been kindly rendered by Dr. Bence Jones, F.R.S., Secre
tary to the Royal Institution, the devoted friend of Faraday, in whose hands have been

     On the 7th of October, 1805, when fourteen, Faraday was apprenticed; and,
in consideration of his faithful service, no premium was given to Riebau.
     Four years later his father wrote (in 1809), "Michael is bookbinder andstt-
tioner, and is very active at learning his business. He has been most part of
four years of his time out of seven.                He has a very good master, and
mistress, and likes his place well : he had a hard time for some while at
first going ; but, as the old saying goes, he has rather got the head above
water, as there is two other boys under him."
      Faraday himself says,
                                  " Whilst an apprentice I loved to read the scien
tific books which were under my hands, and amongst them delighted in
 Marcet's ' Conversations on Chemistry,' and the electrical treatises in the
    Encyclopaedia Britannica.' I made such simple experiments in chemistry
 '
 as could be defrayed in their expense by a few pence per week, and also
 constructed an electrical machine, first with a glass phial, and afterwards
 with a real cylinder, as well as other electrical apparatus of a corresponding
 kind."       He told a friend that Watts on the Mind first made him think,
 and that his attention was turned to science by the article             " Electricity
                                                                                        "
 in an encyclopaedia he was employed to bind.
      " My master," he
                              says,
                                     " allowed me to go occasionally of an evening to
 hear the lectures delivered by Mr. Tatum in natural philosophy at his
 house, 53 Dorset Street, Fleet            Street.   I obtained a knowledge of these
 lectures by bills in the streets and shop-windows near his house.            The hour
 was eight o'clock in the evening.            The charge was Is. per lecture, and my
 brother Robert [who was three years older and followed his father's busi
  ness] made me a present of the money for several.              I attended twelve or
  thirteen lectures between February 19, 1810, and September 26, 1811. It
  was at these      lectures    I first became     acquainted with Magrath,    Newton,
  Nicol, and others."
      He learned perspective of         a Mr. Masquerier, that he might illustrate
  these lectures.       " Masquerier lent me Taylor's Perspective, a 4to volume,
  which    I studied closely, copied all the drawings, and made some other very
  simple ones, as of cubes or pyramids, or columns in perspective, as exer
  cises of the rules.       I was always very fond of copying vignettes and small
  things   in ink  ;  but  I  fear they were mere copies of the lines, and that I
  had little or no sense of the general effect and of the power of the lines in
  producing it." How he was educating himself at this time and the subjects
   that interested him, may be seen in a manuscript volume (a shadow of the
                                  " The Philosophical Miscellany, being a collection
   future) which he called
   of notices, occurrences, events, &c. relating to the arts and sciences col
   lected from the public papers, reviews, magazines, and other miscellaneous
   works.      Intended," he says, " to promote both amusement and instruc
   tion, and also to corroborate or invalidate those theories which are continu
   ally starting into the world of science. Collected by M. Faraday, 1809-10."
       In 1811    (aet.   19)   he becume     acquainted, at   Mr. Tatum's, with    Mr.

                                                  iii
Huxtable and Mr. Benjamin Abbott ; the first was a medical student, the
other, who belonged to the Society of Friends, was employed in a house of
business in the city.
     Mr. Huxtable lent him Parkes's           '
                                                  Chemistry,'              which Faraday bound for
him, and the third edition of Thompson's               '
                                                                   Chemistry.'

   Among the few notes Faraday made of his own life are the following : —
   "During my apprenticeship I had the good fortune, through the
kindness of Mr. Dance, who was a customer of my master's shop and
also a member of the Royal Institution, to hear four of the last lec
tures of Sir H. Davy in that locality [he always sat in the gallery
over the clock]. The dates of these lectures were February 29, March
14,      April   8 and 10, 1812.   Of   these           I   made        notes,    and then wrote out
the lectures in a fuller form, interspersing                       them with such drawings as I
could make.     The desire to be engaged                           in scientific occupation, even
though of the lowest kind, induced me, whilst an apprentice, to write, in
my ignorance of the world and simplicity of my mind, to Sir Joseph Banks,
then President of the Royal Society.  Naturally enough, ' No answer,' was
the reply left with the porter."
   On Sunday, July 12, 1812, three months before his apprenticeship was
over, he wrote the first of a series of letters to his friend Mr. Benjamin
Abbott (who          was a year and a   half younger than himself), from which                      a
full view can           of what he
                     be gained             was by nature, and what his self-edu
cation at this time had made him.
     "I   have lately made a few simple galvanic experiments merely to illus
trate to myself the first principles of the science.    was going to Knight's I
to obtain some nickel, and bethought me that they had malleable zinc.        I
inquired and bought some ; have you seen any yet ? The first portion                                I
obtained was in the thinnest pieces possible, — observe, in a flattened state.
It was, they informed me, thin enough for the electric smoke, or, as I before
called     it,
          De Luc's electric column.    obtained

                                    !    But laugh no longer, dear A., rather
wonder at the effects this trivial power produced  was sufficient to produce

the decomposition of sulphate of magnesia, an effect which extremely sur
prised me." And then he describes how he built up larger battery, and ob      a
tained greater and further effects, and reasons on the results, and urges his
friend to think of these things, and " let me, you please, sir,
                                                             if you please let       if

 Inability.   I must ask your advice on the subject, and intend, if can, to                  I

 the steam-engine, and, indeed, anything where iron is concerned."
    In his next letter he says, speaking of fresh experiments with his battery,
      I
 " must trust to your experiments more than my own ; I have no time, and
 the subject requires several;" and in a letter written August 1 1,      Pyro-                   "

October 11, be says, "As for the change which you suppose to have taken
place with respect to my situation and affairs, I have to thank my late
master, it is but little.        Of liberty and of time     I have,    if possible, less than
before, though      I hope my circumspection         has not at the same time decreased.
I  am well aware       of the irreparable evils that     an abuse    of those blessings will
give rise to. These were pointed out to me by common sense ; nor do I
see how anyone who considers his own station and his own free occupations,
pleasures, actions, &c. can unwittingly engage himself in them.                       I thank
that Cause to whom             thanks are due that       I am    not in general a profuse
waster of those blessings which are bestowed on me as a human being ; I
mean health, sensation, time, and temporal resources.                       Understand me
here, for I wish not to be mistaken : I am well aware of my own nature ;
it is evil, and   I feel  its influence strongly. I know, too, that               ; but I find
that   I am   passing insensibly      to a point   of divinity  ;  and  as these matters   are
not to be treated lightly, I will refrain from pursuing it."
    To his friend Huxtable          he writes on the 18th     :

better to delay my answer until my time was expired, I did so ; that took
place Oct. 7, and since then I have had by far less time and liberty than
 before. With respect to a certain place I was disappointed, and am now
working      at my old trade, the which          I wish to leave at the first convenient
opportunity.         I  am at present in very low spirits, and scarce know how to
continue on in a strain that will be any way agreeable to you."

Humphry Davy, sending, as a proof of my earnestness, the notes I had
taken of his last four lectures ; the reply was immediate, kind, and favour
able.     After this I continued to work as a bookbinder, with the excep
tion of some days during which I was writing as an amanuensis for Sir
 H. Davy, at the time when the latter was wounded in the eye from an ex
plosion of the chloride of nitrogen."
    On the 24 th of December, 1812, Sir Humphry Davy wrote to Faraday: —
 " Sir,  I  am far from displeased with the proof you have given me of
your confidence, and which displays great zeal, power of memory, and
attention.      I  am obliged to go out of town, and shall not be settled in
 town till the end of January ; I will then see you at any time you wish.
 It  would gratify me to be of any service to you ; I wish it may be in my
 power.     I  am, Sir, Your obedient hnmble Servant."

me as a member of the Society in 1813. Magrath was Secretary to the So
ciety.     It consisted of thirty or forty individuals, perhaps all in the humble
or moderate rank of life.            Those persons met every Wednesday evening
for mutual instruction.            Every other Wednesday the members were alone,

                                          vi
each in turn.      On the intervening Wednesday evenings friends       also of the
members were admitted, and a lecture was delivered, literary            or  philo
sophical,   each member taking the duty, if possible, in turn (or in default
paying a    fine of half a guinea).   This Society was very moderate in its pre
tensions,   and most valuable to the members in its results."       [I remember,
too, says   one of the members, we had a
                                               " class-book," in which, in rota
tion, we wrote essays, and passed it to each other's houses.]
   Sir H. Davy, at his first interview, advised him to keep in business ui
bookbinder, and he promised to give him the work of the Institution, as
well as his own and that of as many of his friends as he could influence.
   One night, in Weymouth Street, he was startled by a loud knock                   at
the door, and on looking out he saw a carriage from which the              footman
had alighted and left a note for him.        This was a request from Sir H. that
he would call on him the next morning.              Sir H. then referred to their
former interview,      and inquired whether he was still in the same mind,
telling him that if so he would give him the place of assistant in the
laboratory of the Royal Institution, from which he had on the previous
day ejected its former occupant.        The salary was to be 25*. a week, with
two rooms at the top of the house.
   In the minutes of the meeting of Managers on the 1st of March, 1813, is
this entry : — " Sir Humphry Davy has the honour to inform the Managers
that he has found a person who is desirous to occupy the situation in the In
stitution lately filled by William Payne. His name is Michael Faraday. He
is a youth of twenty-two years of age. As far as Sir H. Davy has been able
to observe or ascertain, he appears well fitted for the situation. His habits
seem good, his disposition active and cheerful, and his manner intelligent.
He is willing to engage himself on the same terms as given to Mr. Payne
at the time of quitting the Institution.
    " Resolved, — That Michael
                                     Faraday be engaged to fill the situation
lately occupied by Mr. Payne, on the same terms."
    As early as the 8th of March, Faraday dates his first letter from            the
 Royal Institution to his friend Abbott.
    " 1 have been                             " to-day in part in extracting
                      employed," he says,                                        the
sugar from a portion of beetroot, and also in making a compound of sul
phur and carbon — a combination which has lately occupied in a consider
 able degree the attention of chemists."
    A month later he says : — " When writing to you seize that opportunity
                                                          I
 of striving to describe a circumstance or an experiment clearly, so that you
 will see  I am urged on, by selfish motives partly, to our mutual correspon
 dence   ; but though selfish yet not censurable.
    " Agreeable to what I have said above, I shall at this time proceed to
 acquaint you with the results of some more experiments on the detonating
 compound of chlorine and azote ; and I am happy to say I do it at my
 ease, for I have escaped
                              (not quite unhurt) from four different and strong
 explosions of the substance.       Of  these the most terrible was when     I  was

                                                             vii
holding between my thumb and finger a small tube containing         grains oi
it. My face was within 1 2 inches of the tube, but I fortunately had on a
glass mask.   It exploded by the slight heat of a small piece of cement that
touched the glass above half an inch from the substance, and on the out
side.     The explosion              was so rapid as to blow my hand open, tear               off   a part
of    one nail, and has made my fingers so sore                         that     I
                                                                        cannot yet use them
easily.        The   pieces     of tube        were   projected with such force as to cut the
glass face of the mask I had on."
   On the 1st of June he writes : — " The subject upon which I shall dwell
more particularly at present has been in my head for a considerable time,
and it now bursts forth in all its confusion. The opportunities that I have
lately had of attending and obtaining instruction from various lecturers in
their performance of the duty attached to that office, has enabled me to ob
serve the various habits, peculiarities, excellencies, and defects of each of
them,     they were evident to me during the delivery.
          as                                                did not wholly           I
let this part of the things occurrent escape my notice ; but, when I found
myself pleased, endeavoured to ascertain the particular circumstance that
had affected me ; also, when attending to Mr. Brande and Mr. Powell in
their lectures, I observed how the audience were affected, and by what
their pleasure and their censure was drawn forth.
   " It may perhaps appear singular and improper that one who is entirely
unfit for such an office himself, and who does not even pretend to any of
the requisites for             it,
                        should take upon him to censure and to commend
others, to express satisfaction at this, to be displeased with that, according
as he    led
         is        by
                his judgment, when he allows that his judgment        unfit for           is
it
 ;  but   Ido not  see, on consideration,  that  the  impropriety    so great.           is
If
 I       am unfit        for   it,
                             evident that
                                     it   is  have yet to learn    Iand how              ;
learn better than by the observation of  others       we never  judge at all
                                                                        1   If
we shall never judge right  and       far better to learn to use our mental
                                          ;        it   is
powers (though     may take
                         it     whole life for the purpose) than to leave
                                               a
them buried in idleness,  mere void."  a  And then for three letters he goes
on with his ideas on lecture-rooms, lectures, apparatus, diagrams, experi
ments, audiences and when urged, two years later, to complete his re
                          ;
marks, he answers, Dec. 31, 1816                      : — " With       respect to my remarks on lec
tures, I      perceive  I      am but      a   mere tyro in the art, and therefore you must
be satisfied with what you have, or expect at some future time                           a    recapitu
lation, or rather revision of them."
     " Duringthis spring Magrath and       established the mutual-improve
                                                             I
ment plan, and   met at my rooms up  in the  attics of the Royal Institution,
or at Wood Street at his warehouse.    It consisted perhaps of half dozen                      a
persons, chiefly from the City Philosophical Society, who met of an even
ing to read together, and to criticise, correct, and improve each other's
pronunciation and construction of language.       The discipline was very
sturdy, the remarks very plain and open, and the results most valuable.
This continued for several years." Saturday night was the time of meeting

                                         VIII
at the  Royal Institution, in the furthest and uppermost room in the house,
then Faraday's place of residence.
    He says : — " In the autumn Sir H. Davy proposed going abroad, and
offered me the opportunity of going with him as his amanuensis, and the
promise of resuming my situation in the Institution upon my return to
England. Whereupon I accepted the offer, left the Institution on the
 13th of October, and, after being with Sir H. Davy in France, Italy, Swit
zerland, the Tyrol, Geneva, &c. in that and the following year, returned to
England and London the 23rd April 1815."
    Whilst abroad he kept a daily journal, " not," he said, " to instruct or
to inform, or to convey even an imperfect idea of what it speaks ; its sole use
is to recall to my mind at some future time the things I see            now,    and
the most effectual way to do that will be, I conceive, to write        down, be
they good or bad, my present impressions."         From this journal,   and from
his letters to his mother and his friend Benjamin       Abbott, only a few cha
racteristic passages can be given here.
    In his journal he wrote, Wednesday,       13th October: — "This      morning
formed a new epoch in my life.         I have never before, within my recollec
tion, left London [he had as an infant gone to Newcastle and Whitehaven,
by sea chiefly] at a greater distance than twelve miles, and now        I leave it
perhaps for many years, to visit spots between which and home whole
realms will intervene.     'T is indeed a strange venture at this time to trust
ourselves in a foreign and hostile country, where also so little regard is had
to protestations and honour, that the slightest suspicion would be sufficient
to separate us for ever from England, and perhaps from life.        But curiosity
has frequently incurred daugers as great as these, and therefore why
should   I wonder at it in the present instance.     If we return safe, the plea
sures of recollection will be highly enhanced by the dangers encountered;
and a never-failing consolation is that, whatever be the fate of our party,
variety, a great source of amusement, and pleasure must occur."
    Some idea of the variety of his observat;ons may be got from this note,
28th October, Dreux      : —" I  cannot help dashing a note of admiration       to
one thing found in this part     of the country — the pigs 1  At first I was  po
sitively doubtful of their nature ; for though they have pointed noses, long
ears, rope-like tails, and cloven feet, yet who would have imagined that an
animal with a long thin body, back and belly arched upwards, lank sides,
long slender feet, and capable of outrunning our horses for a mile or two
together, could be at all allied to the fat sow of England ! When I first
saw one, which was at Morlaix, it started so suddenly, and became so ac
tive in its motions on being disturbed, and so dissimilar in its actions to
our swine, that I looked out for a second creature of the same kind before
I  ventured to decide on its being a regular or an extraordinary production
of nature ; but I find they are all alike, and that what at a distance I
should judge to be a greyhound,       I  am obliged, on a near approach, to  ac
knowledge a pig."

                                        Mt.  22  (1814).
     To    his mother he writes, April 14, 1814, from Rome: — "When SirH.
Davy       first had the goodness to ask me whether I would go with him, I
mentally said, ' no, I have a mother, I have relations here,' and I almost
wished that I had been insulated and alone in London ; but now I am glad
that I have left some behind me on whom I can think, and whose actions
and occupations I can picture in my mind.                  Whenever a vacant hour occurs
I    employ it by thinking on those at home. In short, when sick, when cold,
when tired, the thoughts of those at home are a calm and refreshing balm
to my heart. Let those who think such thoughts are useless, vain, and
paltry think so still.            I envy them not their more refined and more
estranged feelings.         Let  them    look about the world unencumbered by such
 ties and heart-strings, and let them laugh at those who, guided more by
 nature, cherish such feelings. For me, I still cherish them, in opposition
 to the dictates of modern refinement, as the first and greatest sweetness in
 the life of man."
      In a letter to his friend Abbott, dated September 6, 1814, he says : — " I
  fancy that when I set my foot in England I shall never take it out again j
  for I find the prospect so different from what it at first appeared to be, that
  I  am certain,   if I could have foreseen the things that have passed,          I should
  never have left London.          In the second place, enticing as travelling is (and
   I appreciate fully its advantages and pleasures), I have several times been
   more than half decided to return hastily home ; but second thoughts have
   still induced   me to try what the future may produce, and now I am only
   detained by the wish of improvement.               I have learned just enough to per
   ceive my ignorance, and, ashamed of my defects in everything,                I  wish to
   seize the opportunity of remedying them.                 The little knowledge I have
   gained in languages makes me wish to know more                 of them, and the little I
   have seen of men and manners is just enough to make me desirous of seeing
   more ; added to which, the glorious opportunity I enjoy of improving in the
   knowledge of chemistry and the sciences continually, determines me to finish
   this voyage with Sir Humphry Davy ; but if I wish to enjoy those
   advantages    I have to sacrifice much      ;  and though those sacrifices are such
   as   an humble    man would         not feel,  yet    I  cannot quietly make them.
   Travelling, too,   I find, is almost inconsistent       with religion (I mean modern
   travelling), and   I am yet so old-fashioned as         to remember strongly (I hope
   perfectly) my youthful education, and upon the whole, malgre the advan
   tages of travelling, it is not impossible but that you may see me at your
    door when you expect a      letter."
                                        Mt.  23 (1815).
       On the 25th   January 1815,       he writes  : — " You    tell me  I am not happy,
    and you wish to share my difficulties.            I  have  nothing important to tell
    you, or you should      have known      it long     ago ;  but, since your friendship
    makes you feel for me,     I   will trouble you with my trifling affairs.

                                                        X
   " It happened, a few days before we left England, that Sir H.'s valet
declined going with him, and in the short space of time allowed by circum
stances, another could not be got.  Sir H. told me he was very sorry, but
that if I would do  such things as were absolutely necessary for him until
he got to Paris, he should there get another.   I murmured, but agreed.
At Paris he could not get one ; at Lyons he could not get one ; at Mont-
pellier he could not get one ; nor at Genoa, nor at Florence, nor at
Rome, nor in all Italy ; and I believe at last he did not wish to get one ;
and we are just the same now as we were when we left England.      This, of
course, throws things into my duty which it was not my agreement, and is
not my wish to perform, but which are, if I remain with Sir H., unavoid
able. These, it is true, are very few ; for having been accustomed in early
years to do for himself, he continues to do so at present, and he leaves very
little for       a valet to perform      ;   and as he knows that          it is not pleasing to     me,
and that I do not consider myself as obliged to do   he   always as care   it,     is
ful as possible to keep those things from me which he knows would be dis
agreeable.             But Lady Davy         is   of another humour.         She likes     to show    her
authority,                found her extremely earnest in mortifying me.
                     and at firstI
This occasioned quarrels between us, at each of which gained ground and      I
she lost      for the frequency made me care nothing about them and
                 it  ;
weakened her authority, and after each she behaved in a milder manner.
Sir H. has also taken care to get servants of the country, ycleped lacquau
de place, to do everything she can want, and now     am somewhat comfort
                                                                       I
able   ;   indeed at this moment             I    am perfectly at liberty,       for Sir
                                                                           has gone        H.
to Naples to search for             a house or lodging to which we may follow him,
and    have nothing to
       I                             do but see Rome, write my journal, and learn
 Italian."
    About the same time he writes to his friend Huxtable —                        :
    " Since Sir H. has left England he has made great addition to chemistry
                                                                 a
in his researches on the nature of iodine.     He first showed that       was                   it    a
simple body.     He   combined      with chlorine
                                              it   and   hydrogen,   and  lately
with oxygen, and thus has added three acids of            new species to the

science.    He combined      with the metals, and found
                                    it                      class of salts ana

logous to the hyperoxymuriates.        He still further combined these sub
stances, and investigated their curious and singular properties.
    " The combination of iodine with oxygen            late discovery, and the
                                                                  is   a
paper has not yet perhaps reached the Royal Society.        It confirms all Sir
H.'s former opinions and statements, and shows the inaccuracy of the
labours of the French chemists on the same subjects.
   " Sir Humphry also sent long paper lately to the Royal Society, on
                                             a
the ancient Greek and Roman colours, which will be worth your reading
when       it   is   printed."
  A fortnight  after his return to England he was engaged as assistant                               in
the laboratory at    salary of 30*.
                            a        week, and apartments were given

  On the 17th of January, 1816, Faraday began a course of seventeen
Lectures on Chemistry, at the City Philosophical Society, which extended
over two years and a half. He called them " an account of the inherent Pro
perties of Matter, of the forms in which matter exists, and of simple ele
mentary substances."    During the year he gave six or seven lectures on the
general properties of matter, on the attraction of cohesion, on chemical affinity,
on radiant matter, on oxygen, chlorine, iodine, and fluorine, on hydrogen,
and on nitrogen.     He wrote his first lectures at full length, whilst of the
latter lectures he only made notes, putting the experiments very distinctly
apart, and he kept very much to this plan during the rest of his life.
     It was
          in this year also that Faraday published his first paper, an analysis
of native caustic lime, in the Quarterly Journal of Science. In the volume
of his * ExperimentalResearches on Chemistry and Physics,' he has added a
note   :   —"     I
           reprint this paper at full length ; it was the beginning of my
communications to the public, and in its results very important to me.      Sir
Humphry  Davy  gave  me the analysis to make  as a first attempt in chemistry,
at a time when my fear was greater than my confidence, and both far greater
than my knowledge ; at a time, also, when                          I
                                                 had no thought of ever
writing an original paper on science.  The addition of his own comments,
and the publication of the paper, encouraged me to go on making, from
time to time, other slight communications, some of which appear in this
                                                         '               '

look back on what successive communications have led to, I still hope,
much as their character has changed, that I have not either now or forty
years ago been too bold."

  Early in February he thus wrote to his friend Abbott : — Be not of
fended that           I   turn to write you a letter, because I feel a disinclination to
do anything            else  ; but rather accept it as a proof that conversation     with
you has more power with me than any other relaxation from business, —
business      I                 I
            say; and believe it is the first time for many years that have                     I
applied it to my own occupations.     But at present they actually deserve
the name        ;     and you must not think me in a laughing mood, but in earnest.
It   is now       9    o'clock p.m., and  I
                                         have just left the laboratory and the pre
paration for to-morrow's two lectures.  Our double course makes me work
enough   ; and  to them  add  the attendance required by Sir H. in his re
searches, and then if you compare my time with what is to be done in                               it,
you will excuse the slow progress of our correspondence on my side. Un
derstand me,    am not complaining
                      I               the more  ; have to do the more
                                                                  I                                I
learn, but   wish to avoid all impression on your side that
              I                                                 am lazy —              I

     In consideration of the additional labour                  caused       to him by   Mr. Brande's

                                             xii
   lectures in the laboratory, his salary at the Institution         was   increased    to
  £100 per annum.
      This year Faraday      began a common-place book, in which he continued
  to make entries on all subjects for fifteen years. Some of the earliest are on
  the production of oxygen, on the combustion of zinc and iron in condensed
  air, on a course of lectures on geology delivered at the Royal Institution
  by Mr. Brande, and an account of Zerah Colburn, thirteen years old, the
  American calculating boy. Sir H. Davy sent him with a note, saying "his
  father will explain to you the method the son uses, in confidence ; I wish
  to ascertain if it can be practically used."
      He wrote in this year : — " When Mr. Brande left London in August, he
  gave the Quarterly Journal in charge to me ; it has very much of my time
  and care, and writing through it has been more abundant with me. It
  has, however, also been the means of giving me earlier information on some
  new objects of science."
                                     JEt.  25  (1817).
      Iu  1817   he gave five lectures at the    City Philosophical Society on the
  atmosphere, on sulphur and phosphorus, on carbon, on combustion, and
 on the metals generally.        He had a paper in the Quarterly Journal on the
 escape of gases through capillary tubes.             The entries in his common
  place   book  consist  of geological notes   of  South  Moulton Slate, Tiverton,
  Hulverston, Taunton, Somerton, and Castle Cary ; a multitude of che
 mical queries or questions to be worked at, among which are the exciting
 effects of different vapours and gaseous mixtures ; compounds of chlorine
 and carbon made out in the autumn of 1820; electricity, magnetism; a
 pyrometer ; extracts from Shakspeare, Lalla Rookh, Rambler, &c.
     At the end of the year he tells his friend Abbott that he can see less of
 him, " in consequence of an arrangement I have made with a gentleman
 recommended to me by Sir H. Davy ; I am engaged to give him lessons in
 mineralogy and chemistry, three times a week, in the evenings,             for     a few
 months."
                                   At.   2G  (1818).
     In  1818   five lectures were given by Faraday at the City Philosophical
Society,    on   gold, silver, &c, on copper and iron, on tin, lead, and ziuc,
and on alkalies and earths. He had six papers in the Quarterly Journal,
of which the most important         was on sounds produced by flame      in tubes.
     In his common-place book there is a long course of lectures on oratory,
by Mr. B. H. Smart ; questions for Dorset Street ; an experimental agitation
of the question of electrical induction, " Bodies do not act where they are
not — query, is not the reverse of this true ?          Do not all bodies act where
they are not ; and do any of them act where they are ? Query, the nature
of courage ; is it a quality or a habit ?
                                              " Chemical
                                                            questions.
     On  July  1st he gave a lecture to the City   Philosophical Society.      It is en
titled " Observations      on the Inertia of the Mind."     As this lecture  is wholly

                                               xiii
written out, it probably was one of the essays contained in the class-book
of the Society.
     Towards the end of the year Faraday wrote his first letter to M. G. De la
Rive, the father of the present M. Auguste De la Rive. He says : —
     " Dear Sir, — Your kindness, when here, in requesting me to accept the
honour of a communication with you on the topics which occur in the
general progress of science, was such as almost to induce me to overstep
the modesty due to my humble situation in the philosophical world, and
to accept of the offer you made me. But I do not think I should have
been emboldened thus to address you had not Mr. Newman since then
informed        me that you again expressed a wish to him that           I  should do so  ;
and fearful that you should misconceive my silence I put pen to paper,
willing rather to run the risk of being thought too bold than of incurring
 the charge of neglect towards one who had been so kind to me in his ex
 pressions. My slight attempts to add to the general stock of chemical
 knowledge have been received with favourable expressions by those around
 me ; but I have, on reflection, perceived that this arose from kindness on
 their parts, and the wish to incite          me on to better things.      I  have always,
 therefore,      been fearful  of advancing on what       has  been  said, lest   I should
 assume more than was intended; and               I hope that a feeling of this kind will
  explain to you the length of time which has elapsed between the time
  when you requested me to write and the present moment when I obey you.
       " I am not entitled, by any peculiar means of obtaining a knowledge of
  what is doing at the moment in science, to deserve your attention, and I have
  no claims in myself to it. I judge it probable that the news of the philoso
  phical world will reach you much sooner through other more authentic and
  more dignified sources, and my only excuse even for this letter is obedience
  to your wishes, and not on account of anything interesting for its novelty."
  He     then describes a new process       for the preparation of    gas    for illumina
   tion.     He  ends,  "I  am  afraid that, with all my reasons,       I   have not been
  able to    justify this letter.     If my fears are true I regret at least ; it was
   your    kindness  that  drew  it from    me, and to your kindness I must look for
   an excuse."
                                       JEt.  27 (1819).
       In 1819 he had no paper in the Quarterly Journal. He gave one lec
   ture at the City Philosophical Society on the Forms of Matter.                   Matter
    he classifies into four states, which depend on differences in the essential
    properties,    and cautiously says, " thus a partial reconciliation is esta
    blished to the belief that all the variety of this fair globe may be con
    verted into three kinds of radiant matter."
       His common-place book contains scarcely any scientific notices.
       On July the 10th he started by coach for a three weeks' walking tour in
    Wales, with his friend     Magrath.       He kept   a journal,  and his descriptions
    of the scenery,    of the copper works of Swansea, the mines of Anglesea,
    and the   slate-quarries of Bangor, are still of interest.

   This                of
            year was one  the most important in the life of Faraday; he had
his first paper read to the Royal Society on two new compounds of chlo
rine and carbon, and on a new compound of iodine, carbon, andhydroetn;
and with Mr. Stodart, the surgical instrument maker, he published, in the
Quarterly Journal of Science, experiments on the alloys of steel, made
with a view to its improvement.
    In his common-place book, among the chemical questions, we find che
mical lessons, or a plan of lessons in chemistry, and processes for manipu
lation, the germ of his work on Chemical Manipulation.       There is also a
list headed   " Lecture Subjects," including application  of statics to che
mistry, approximation of mechanical and chemical philosophy, application
of mathematics to actual service and use in the arts, series of mechanical
arts, as tanning.
   On the 20th of       April           M. G. De la Rive : — " I never in my
                                he writes to

permit me to correspond with you by letter.          Mr. Stodart and myself

with the hope of improving       and    it,

have lately had some important trials for oil in this metropolis, in which
I,with others, have been engaged.     They have given occasion for many
experiments in oil, and the discovery of some new and curious results one         ;
of the trials only    finished, and there are four or five more to come.
                        is                                                As

           in
   June 26 he sends long abstract of the paper on Steel, and ends — " Now

I   think  have noticed the most interesting points at which we have
            I
arrived.  Pray pity us, that after two years' experiments we have got no
further but;   am sure
                  I        you knew the labour of the experiments you
                              if
would applaud us for our perseverance at least. We are still encouraged
to go on, and   think the experience we have gained will shorten our future
                    I
labours.
     "   If you
            should think any of our results worth notice in the    Biblio-   '
theque,' this letter  free to be used in any way you please.
                         is                                   Pardon my
vanity for supposing anything     can assist
                                        I    in doing can be worth  atten
tion  but you know we live in the good opinion of ourselves and of others,
       ;
and therefore naturally think better of our own productions than they
deserve."
     Early the following month there          is   evidence that an entire change took

                                              XT
place in the state of his mind. Among his friends was Mr. Edward Barnard,
one of a family living in Paternoster Row, with which he had long been
intimate,    and which        agreed   with his own family in its religious     views.
Faraday proposed          to,   and ultimately     was   accepted by,  Mr. Barnard's
sister, Sarah.
                                       JEt. 29  (1821).
     March 1 1, Sir H. Davy wrote : — " Dear Mr. Faraday, I have spoken to
Lord Spencer, and I am in hopes that your wishes may be gratified ; but
do not mention the subject till I see you."                This wish was probably to
bring    his wife   to  the   Institution.   In  June   he  was appointed superinten
 dent of the house and laboratory, in the absence of Mr. Brande.
     All obstacles were removed, and the marriage took place on the 1 2th of
 June. Mr. Faraday, desiring that the day should be considered just like
 any other day, offended some of his near relations by not asking them to his
 wedding.
     In a letter to his wife's sister, previous to the marriage, he says, " There
 will be no bustle, no noise, no hurry occasioned even in one day's proceeding.
 In externals, that day will pass like all others, for it is in the heart that
 we expect and look for pleasure."
     A  month later, at a meeting of the congregation, he was fully admitted
 as a member      of the Sandemanian Church.
     His common-place book shows that he read little. In a letter, May 1 9,
 to M. G. De la Rive, he says, " Mr. Stodart and myself are continuing our
 experiments on steel, which are very laborious."
      On July 12, a paper was read to the Royal Society on a new Compound
 of Chlorine and Carbon, by Phillips and Faraday. This, as well as Faraday's
  previous paper on two Chlorides of Carbon, was printed in the Philoso
  phical Transactions.         In the Quarterly Journal he had a short paper on
  the Vapour of Mercury at common temperatures.
      On the 12th of September he writes the following letter to M. G. De la
  Rive :—
      " You partly reproach us here with not sufficiently esteeming Ampere's
  experiments on electro-magnetism.             Allow me to extenuate your opinion a
  little on this point.      With regard to the experiments, I hope and trust that
  due weight is allowed to them ; but these you know are few, and theory makes
  up the great part of what M. Ampere has published, and theory in a great
  many points unsupported by experiments, when they ought to have been ad
  duced.     At the    same time,     M. Ampere's experiments are excellent, and his
  theory ingenious      ; and   for myself,  I had thought very little about it before
  your letter came, simply because, being naturally sceptical on philosophi
  cal theories,   I  thought there was a great want of experimental evidence.
  Since then, however, I have engaged on the subject, and have a paper in
  our Institution journal, which will appear in a week or two, and that will,
  as it contains experiment, be immediately            applied by  M. Ampere in sup

                                          XVI
port of his theory much more decidedly than it is by myself.    I intend                   to
enclose a copy of it to you, and only want the means of sending it.
     "   I
      find all the usual attractions and repulsions of the magnetic needle                 by
the conjunctive wire are deceptions, the motions being not attractions                     or
repulsions, nor the result of any attractive or repulsive forces, but the
result of a force in the wire, which, instead of bringing the pole of the needle
nearer to or further from the wire, endeavours to make it move round it
in a never-ending circle and motion whilst the battery remains in action. I
have succeeded not only in showing the existence of this motion theoreti
cally, but experimentally, and have been able to make the wire revolve
round a magnetic pole, or a magnetic pole round the wire, at pleasure.
The law of revolution, and to which all the other motions of the needle and
wire are reducible, is simple and beautiful.   Conceive a portion of connect
ing wire north  and  south, the north end  being attached to the positive pole
of    a battery, the south to the negative     ; a north magnetic       pole would then
 pass round   it continually   in  the  apparent   direction   of  the  sun  from east to
west above, and from west to east below. Reverse the connexions with the
battery, and the motion of the pole is reversed.               Or if the south pole is
made to revolve, the motions will be in the opposite directions, as with the
north pole.
   " If the wire be made to revolve round the pole, the motions are according
to those mentioned.      For the apparatus I used there were but two plates,
and the direction of the motions was of course the reverse of those with a
battery of several pair of plates, and which are given above.                      I
                                                                            Now have
been  able experimentally     to  trace  this motion   into  its  various  forms, as ex
hibited by Ampere's helices, &c., and in all cases to show that dissimilar
poles repel as well as attract, and that similar poles attract as well as repel,
and to make, I think, the analogy between the helice and common bar-
magnet far stronger than before ; but yet I am by no means decided that
there are currents of electricity in the common magnet.                I have no doubt
that electricity puts  the   circles  of  the helice into the same state as those
circles are in that may be conceived in the bar-magnet ; but          I
                                                                  am not cer
tain that this state is directly dependent on the electricity, or that it can
not be produced by other agencies, and therefore, until the presence of elec
trical currents be proved in the magnet by other than magnetical effects,                  I
shall remain in doubts about Ampere's theory."
     Oct. 8th   he writes to   J.
                            Stodart, Esq. : —
  " I hear every day more and more of those sounds, which, though only
whispers to me, are,      I
                        suspect, spoken aloud amongst scientific men, and
which, as they in part affect my honour and honesty, I am anxious to do
away with, or at least to prove erroneous in those parts which are disho
nourable to me.     You know perfectly well what distress the very unex
pected reception  of my paper on Magnetism in public has caused me, and
you will not therefore be surprised at my anxiety to get out of            it,   though
I give trouble to you and others of my friends in doing so.   If          I       under-

                                             xvii
  stand aright, I am charged (1) with not acknowledging the information I
  received in assisting Sir H.'Davy in his experiments on this subject ; (2)
 with concealing the theory and views of Dr. Wollaston ; (3) with taking
 the subject whilst         Dr. Wollaston was at work on it ; and (4) with disho
  nourably      taking Dr. Wollaston's thoughts, and pursuing them without
  acknowledgment to the results I have brought out.
     " There is somethiug degrading about the whole of these charges ; and
 were the last of them true, I feel that I should not remain on the terms I
 now stand at with you or any scientific person.             Nor can I indeed bear to
 remain suspected         of such a thing.    My love for scientific reputation is not
 yet so    high     as to induce   me to obtain    it at the  expense   of honour, and
 my anxiety to clear away this stigma is such, that I do not hesitate to
 trouble you, even beyond what you may be willing to do for me."
     He proceeds then to justify himself, and says, " The cause of my making
  the experiments detailed in my paper, was the writing of the historical
 Sketch of Electromagnetism that has appeared in the last two Numbers of
 the ' Annals of Philosophy.'
                                      "
     On the 30th of October he writes directly to Dr. Wollaston, saying : —
 " heard from two or three quarters that it was considered that I had not
    I
 behaved honourably, and that the wrong I had done I had done to you ; I
 immediately wished and endeavoured to see you, but was prevented by the
 advice of my friends, and am only now at liberty to pursue the plan I in

     "  If I   have done any one wrong          it was quite unintentional, and the
charge of behaving dishonourably is not true.               I am bold enough, sir, to
beg    the   favour    of a few  minutes'   conversation   with  you on this subject,
simply for these reasons, that I can clear myself, that           I owe obligations to
you, that        I   respect you, that   I  am  anxious   to escape   from unfounded
impressions against me, and, if         I  have done any wrong, that       I may apolo
gise for it."
    The following day Dr. Wollaston writes : — "You seem to me to labour
under some misapprehension of the strength of my feelings upon the sub
ject to which you allude.           As to the opinions which others may have of
your conduct, that is your concern, not mine ; and if you fully acquit your
self of making any incorrect use of the suggestions of others, it seems to me
that you have no occasion to trouble yourself much about the matter.               But
if you are desirous of any conversation with me, and could with conveni
ence call to-morrow morning between ten and half-past ten, you will be sure
to find me."
    In   a letter to    M. G. De la Rive a fortnight later, he does not allude to
the distress       of mind   he had gone through.
    On Christmas Day he succeeded in making a wire through which a
current of voltaic electricity was passing obey the magnetic poles of the
earth in the way it does the poles of a bar-magnet.

                                        JEt.   30 (1822).
   In    1822, a paper on theAlloys of Steel by Stodart and Faraday was
read to the Royal Society, and printed in the Transactions. In the Quar
terly Journal of Science he had two papers on the Changing of Vegetable
Colours as an alkaline property, and on some Bodies possessing it ; and on
the Action of Salts on Turmeric Paper.
   The results of the paper on steel were of no practical value, and this,
one  of his first and most laborious investigations, is strikingly distin
guished from all his other works by ending in nothing.
   This year he began a fresh manuscript volume, which he called " Che
mical Notes, Hints, Suggestions, and Objects of Pursuit."       To it he trans
ferred many of the queries out of his common-place book, but he separated
his subjects under different heads.   He puts as a sort of preface, " already               I
owe much to these notes, and think such a collection worth the making by
every scientific man.    I am sure none would think the trouble lost after '
year's experience."    When   a query got answered, he drew a pen through                             it,
and wrote the date of the answer across it. In this book are the first germs,
 inthe fewest possible words, of his future work.
   The last week in July he went with his friend Richard Phillips to Mr.
 Vivian's, near Swansea, to introduce     new process into the copper-works,
                                                    a
 and for trial at Hereford, which was put off.
                 a                                  At the end of a fortnight
 he returned to London.
    His letters to Mrs. Faraday, who went to Ramsgate, are full of affection,
                          "
 and the account of his escape from the large mansion and high company

    Two papers this year were read to the Royal Society, and printed in the
 Transactions — one on Fluid Chlorine, the other on the Condensation of seve
 ral Gases into Liquids and he had four papers in the Quarterly Journal
                                  ;                                                                   of

tube, and again obtained fluid chlorine.   Hence what    called chlorine gasis

other explosion on Saturday evening, which has again laid up my eyes.                                  It

   On May the 1st his certificate was read for the first time at the Royal

  certificate had to be read        at ten    successive   meetings before the ballot
  came on.
     On the 30th of May         he wrote   to  H. Warburton, Esq. : — " Sir, I have
  been   anxiously waiting the opportunity you promised me of a conversation
  with you, and from late circumstances am now still more desirous of it
 than at the time when         I saw you in the Committee.          I am sure you will
 not regret the opportunity you will afford for an explanation ; for             I do not
  believe   there is anything you would ask after you have communicated with
 me, that     I should not be glad to do.        I am satisfied that many of the feel
 ings you entertain on the subject in question would be materially altered
 by granting my request.          At the same time, as I have more of your opi
 nions by report than otherwise, I am perhaps not well aware of them.                   It
 was only lately       that  I  knew   you   had    any feeling  at all  on  the subject.
 You would probably find yourself engaged in doing justice to one who can
 not help but feel that he has been injured, though he trusts unintention
 ally.     I feel satisfied you are not in possession of all the circumstances of
 the case, but     I am also sure you will not wish willingly to remain ignorant
 of them.       Excuse my earnestness aud freedom on this subject, and consider
 for a moment how much I am interested in it."
     At the foot of the copy of this letter Faraday      made the following    notes  : —
 " In   relation to Davy's opposition to my election at the R. S.        : Sir H. Davy
 angry, May 30 ; Phillips's report through Mr.            Children, June 5 ; Mr. War-
 burton called first time, June 5, evening ; I called on Dr. Wollaston, and he
 not in town, June 9 ; I called on Dr. Wollaston and saw him, June 1 4 ; I
 called at Sir H. Davy's, and he called on me, June 1 7."
     Many years ago he gave a friend the following facts, which were
 written down at the time : Sir H. Davy told him that he must take
 down his certificate.       Faraday replied that he had not put it up : that he
 could not take it down as it was put up by his proposers.                Sir Humphry
 then said, he must get his proposers to take it down.              Faraday answered
 that he knew they would not do so.                Then, said Sir H., I, as President
 will take it down. Faraday replied, that he was sure Sir Humphry Davy
 would do what he thought was for the good of the Society.
    One of Faraday's proposers told him that SirH. had walked for an hour
round the courtyard of Somerset House, trying to convince Faraday's in
formant that Faraday ought not to be elected.              However, the storm passed
away, but not without leaving its effects ; and on the 29th of June Sir
H. Davy ends       a note — "lam, dear Faraday, very sincerely,       your well-wisher
and friend."
    July   8,   Mr. Warburton wrote : — " I have        read the article  in the Royal

say that upon the whole it satisfies me, as I think it will Dr. Wollaston's
other friends.       Having everywhere admitted and maintained that, on the

a party in private to oppose you. What I should have done would have been
to take the opportunity, which the proposing to ballot for you would have
afforded me, to make remarks in public on that part of your conduct to which
I objected. Of this I made no secret, having intimated my intention to some
of those from whom I knew you would hear of              it,   and to the President
himself.   When meet with any of those in whose

    "I thank you sincerely for your kindness in letting me know your opinion

his own experiments in 1823.         He joined Mr. Brande in the delivery of the
morning course of chemical lectures at the Institution.         In July   he went
to the Isle of Wight with Mrs. Faraday, and returned again          in August   to
bring her home.        He  was elected  an  Honorary Member    of the Cambrian
Society of Swansea, and a       Fellow of the Geological Society.      This year
the President and Council of the Royal Society appointed a committee for
the improvement of glass for optical purposes, consisting of Fellows of the
Royal Society and members of the then Board of Longitude.
                                  &t.  33 (1825).
    Faraday was made Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Institution,
and therein he had three or four evening meetings of the members of the
Institution, from which came the Friday evening meetings of the members.
He    was elected a   Member of the Royal Institution, and      a Corresponding
Member of the Society of Medical Chemists, Paris.            He had a paper on
new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products
obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat, read to the Royal Society,
and printed in the Transactions ; one of these substances was benzol.          He
had a paper in the Quarterly Journal on some cases of the formation of
ammonia, and on the means of testing the presence of minute portions of
nitrogen in certain states.
    In May a subcommittee, consisting of Mr. Herschel, Mr. Dollond, and
Mr. Faraday, was appointed to have the direct superintendence and per
formance of experiments on the manufacture of optical glass.         " It was my
business to investigate particularly the chemical part of the inquiry.        Mr.
Dollond was to work and try the glass, and ascertain practically its good
or bad qualities, whilst Mr. Herschel was to examine its physical proper
ties, reason    respecting their influence and utility, and make his competent
mind bear upon every part of the inquiry.         In March 1829 the committee
was    reduced to two by the retirement       of Mr. Herschel,  who about that
period went to the Continent."
    In July   he left  London by steamboat for Scotland.       After visiting the
damask works, he went to Leith to see the glass works.          He minutely de
scribes the geology of Salisbury Craig, Arthur's Seat, and Craigleith
quarries, and then went to Rubislaw (Bleaching Liquor Works), Aberdeen.
 Here he made many experiments for the proprietors, with whom he stayed.
                                  JEt.  34 (1826).
    He had   a paper on the Mutual Action of Sulphuric Acid and Naphthaline
printed   in  the Philosophical Transactions, and another on the existence of
a limit to Vaporization, and in the Quarterly Journal of Science four papers —
on Pure Caoutchouc        and the Substances by which it is accompanied in the
state of Sap or Juice, on the Fluidity of Sulphur at common temperatures,
on a peculiar perspective appearance of aerial light and shade, and on the
confinement of Dry Gases over Mercury.

    There were seventeen meetings of the members of the Royal Institution
held on Friday evenings during this season, and at these Faraday gave
seven discourses — on Pure Caoutchouc ; on Brunei's Condensed Gas-engine;
on Lithography ; on the existence of a limit to Vaporization ; on Sulpho-
vinic and Sulphonaphthalic Acid; on Drummoud's Light; on Brunei's
Tunnel at Rotherhithe.
     This year he was relieved from the duty of chemical assistant at the
lectures given at the Institution, because of his occupation in research, and
he was made an honorary member of the Westminster Medical Society.
     In his chemical notes there is an analysis of "committee glass" and Saxony
gunpowder, and remarks on calico printing and soap making, and soda from
common salt.
     In July he again was in the Isle of Wight.
                                  JBt.  35 (1827).
     Faraday gave his first course of lectures in the theatre of the Institution
 in   April on Chemical Philosophy.
      He writes: — "The     President and Council of the Royal Society ap
 plied to the President and Managers of the Royal Institution for leave
 to erect on their premises an experimental room with a furnace, for the
 purpose of continuing the investigation on the manufacture of optical glass.
 They were guided in this by the desire which the Royal Institution has
 always evinced to assist in the advancement of science ; and the readiness
 with which the application was granted showed that no mistaken notion
 had been formed in this respect.           As a member of both bodies, I felt
 much anxiety that the investigation should be successful.             A room and
 furnaces were built at the Royal Institution in September 1827, and an
  assistant was engaged, Sergeant Anderson of the Royal Artillery.                He
  came on the 3rd     of December."
      He had four papers in the Quarterly Journal of Science : — 1, on the
  Fluidity of Sulphur and Phosphorus at common temperatures.
                                                                          " In this,"
  he says,  " I published some time ago [the year previous] a short account of
  an instance of the existence of fluid sulphur at common temperatures ; and
  though I thought the fact curious, I did not esteem it of such importance
  as to  put more than my initials to the account. I have just learned through
       '                    '
  the    Bulletin Universel   for September, p. 78, that Signor Bellani had ob
  served the same fact in 1813, and published it in the 'Giornale di Fisica.'
  M. Bellani complains of the manner in which facts and theories which          have
  been published    by him are afterwards given by others as new discoveries ;
  and though     I find  myself classed with Gay-Lussac, Sir H. Davy, Daniell,
  and Bostock, in having thus erred, I shall not rest satisfied without making
  restitution, for  M. Bellani in this instance certainly  deserves it at my hand."
   2, on the probable decomposition     of certain  gaseous  compounds of carbon

  Disinfecting Soda Liquid. There were nineteen Friday evening meetings at
 the Royal Institution.      Faraday gave an account of the magnetic pheno
 mena developed by metals in motion, on the chemical action of chlorine
 and its compounds as disinfectants, and on the progress of the Thames
  tunnel.    In this year he published his " Chemical Manipulations," in one
  volume, 8vo.     A second edition appeared in 1830, and a third in 1842.
     He  was made a Correspondent      of the Societe Philomathique, Paris.
                                  JEt.  36 (1828).
    He had a few words in the Quarterly Journal on anhydrous crystals of
 sulphate of soda. He gave four of the Friday evening lectures : Illustra
 tions of the new Phenomena produced by a current of Air or Vapour
 recently observed by M. Clement ; on the reciprocation of Sound ; and
 also a discourse on the Nature of Musical Sound.            The matter belonged
 to Mr. Wheatstone, but was delivered by Mr. Faraday.             The last evening
 was on the recent    and present state of the   Thames   tunnel.
    He was made a Fellow of the Natural Society of Science of Heidelberg.
    He was invited to attend the meetings of the Board of Managers of the
 Institution ; and he received his first (gold) medal, one of a series of ten
 given to Members of the Royal Institution (as a reward for chemical dis
 coveries) by Mr. John Fuller, a Member.
                                 m.    37 (1829).
    He gave the Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society on the Manufacture
 of Glass for Optical purposes.
    This most laborious investigation led to no good in the direction that
was originally expected, but the use of the glass manufactured, as described
afterwards, became of the utmost importance in his diamagnetic and mag
neto-optical researches, and it led to the permanent engagement, in 1 832,
of Mr. Charles Anderson       as Faraday's    assistant in all his researches, "to
whose rare steadiness,     exactitude, and faithfulness in the performance of
all that was committed to his charge Faraday was much indebted."
    He gave Friday evening discourses on Mr. Robert Brown's discovery            of
Active Molecules in bodies, either organic or inorganic; on Brard's test of the
action of weather on building stones ; on Wheatstone's further investiga
tions on the resonances    or reciprocal vibrations of volumes of air ; on Bru
nei's block machinery at Portsmouth ; on the phonical or nodal figures of
elastic laminae ; on the manufacture of glass for optical purposes.
    He   was made a member      of the Scientific Advising Committee of the
Admiralty, Patron of the Library of the Institution, Honorary Member of
the Society of Arts, Scotland.
    At the end of June he writes to Colonel Drummond, Lieutenant-Governor
of the Royal Academy, Woolwich : — " I should be happy to undertake the
duty of lecturing on chemistry to the gentlemen cadets of Woolwich, pro
vided that the time    I should have to take for the purpose from professional

reasons [which he gives] I wish you would originate the terms rather than
I               I consider the offer a high honour, and beg you to feel
assured of my sense of it.      I   should       have   been glad   to have accepted or
declined   it,
            independent of pecuniary           but my time

estate,and that which would be occupied in the duty of the situation must
be taken from what otherwise would be given to professional business."
    At Christmas     he for the first time gave the       Juvenile Lectures.

                                   38 (1830).
   This year he had paper in the Institution Journal supplementary to
                        a
his former paper in 1826 on the limits of vaporization.
   His Friday evening discourses were on Aldini's proposed method of pre
serving men exposed to flame; on the Transmission of Musical sounds
through solid conductors and their subsequent reciprocation on the Flow   ;
ing of Sand under Pressure on the application of New Principle in the
                                ;                             a

   The following recollections from about 1823 to 1830 are        Mrs. Fara   by
day's youngest brother, Mr. George Barnard, the artist —              :
   " All the years    was with Harding
                      I                   dined at the Royal Institution.
                                                   I
After dinner we nearly always had our games just like boys — sometimes at
ball, or with horse chestnuts instead of marbles, Faraday appearing to enjoy
them as much as    Idid, and generally excelling us all.   Sometimes we rode
round the theatre on       velocipede (and
                            a                 tradition  remains that in the
earliest part of summer morning Faraday has been seen going up Hamp-
                 a
stead Hill on his velocipede).
   " At this time we had very pleasant conversaziones of artists, actors, and
musicians at Hullmandel's, sometimes going up the river in his eight-oar
cutter, cooking our own dinner, enjoying the singing of Garcia and his
wife and daughter (afterwards Malibran), indeed of all the best Italian
singers, and the society of most of the Royal Academicians, such as Stan-
field, Turner, Westall, Landseer, &c.
    " After Hullmandel's excellent suppers, served on dozen or two small
                                                                  a
tables in his large rooms, we had charades, Faraday and many of us tak
ing parts with Garcia, Malibran, and the rest.
    " My  first and many following sketching trips were made with Faraday
and his wife.     Storms excited his admiration at all times, and he was never
tired of looking into the heavens. He said to me once,              'I
                                                             wonder you artists
don't study the light and colour       the sky more, and try more for effect.'
                                      in
Ithink this quality in Turner's drawings made him admire them so much.
He made Turner's acquaintance at Hullmandel's, and afterwards often had
applications from him for chemical information about pigments.       Faraday
always impressed upon   Turner  and other artists the great  necessity   there
was to experiment for themselves, putting washes  and tints of all their  pig

                                          xxvi
ments in the bright sunlight, covering up one half, and noticing the                     effect
of light and gases on the other.
  " On   one    of our   sea-side excursions we were   bathing together,         when Fara
day, who was a fair swimmer, on coming in was overtaken by a tremendous
wave which overtopped his head, and dashed him with violence on the
beach, bruising him much.          He impressed on never to think any one
                                                          me
could stand against such a breaker ; that one should turn round and dive
through   it,
            throwing one's self off the ground.   Faraday did not fish                            at
all during these country trips, but just rambled about geologizing or
botanizing."
   If Faraday's                              might well have been called
                    scientific life had ended here   it                                           a
noble success. He had made two leading discoveries, the one on electro-mag
netic motions, the other on the condensation of several gases into liquids.
He had carried out two important and most laborious investigations on
the alloys of steel and on the manufacture of optical glass. He had made
many communications to the Royal Society, and many more to the Quar
terly Journal of Science.    From assistant in the laboratory he had                              be
come its director.   He was constantly lecturing in the great theatre, and
he had probably prolonged the existence of the Royal Institution     taking         by
the most active part in the establishment of the Friday evening meetings.
   But when we turn to the eight volumes of manuscripts of his Experi              '
mental Researches,' which he bequeathed to the Royal Institution, we
 find that he was just going to begin to work.                  The first   of   these     large
 folio volumes begins in 1831 with paragraph                   1,   and continues        in   the
 seventh to paragraph 15,389       1856.
                                     in   The results of this work he has
 collected himself in four volumes octavo.     The three volumes on elec
 tricity were published in 1839, in 1844, and in 1855   the last volume, on
                                                                    ;
 chemistry and physics, he published in 1859.        Whenever he was about
 to investigate   subject,
                    a      he wrote out, on separate slips of paper, different
 queries regarding    which his genius made him think were " naturally pos
                         it
 sible" to     be answered
                         by experiment.   He slightly fixed them one beneath
 another, in the order in which he intended to experiment.      As slip was       a
 answered     was removed, and others were added in the course of the
             it                                                                                in
 vestigation, and these in their turn were worked out and removed.        no             If
 answer was obtained, the slip remained to be returned to at another time.
 Out of the answers the manuscript               volumes       were formed,       and      from
 these   the papers were written for the Royal Society, where they were
 always read before the popular account of them was given to the Royal                         In
 stitution at   Friday evening meeting.

 want of memory and giddiness that he thought he should be unable                                 to
 do any more, and in his most exact way he drew up the following table
 of the work he had given up temporarily during the first ten years                           that
 his experimental investigations in electricity had lasted —            :

Arago's    Magnetic    Phenomena.         He had also in the Transactions a
paper on a peculiar       class   of acoustical      figures, and on certain forms
assumed    by groups of particles upon vibrating elastic surfaces.                    In the
Quarterly    Journal of Science he had a paper on a peculiar class of
optical deceptions, which gave rise to the chromatrope.
   He gave five Friday discourses on a peculiar class of Optical Deceptions ;
on Oxalamide, discovered by M. Dumas ; on Light and Phosphorescence
(being an account of experiments recently made in the Royal Institution
by Mr. Pearsall, Chemical Assistant) ; on Trevelyan's recent Experiments

say I have  not received your Pharmacopoeia."            Three months later he thanks
him for the last edition of the Pharmacopoeia, and says, " I am busy just now
again on electro-magnetism, and think I have got hold of a good thing,
but can't say.    It may be a weed instead of a fish that, after all my labour,
I may at last pull up. I think I know why metals are magnetic when in

a paper     that always knocks         in health, but now I feel well again
                                       me up
and able to pursue my subject, and now I will tell you what it is about.
The title will be, I think, 'Experimental Researches in Electricity' : — I.
On the Induction of Electric Currents ; II. On the Evolution of Electri
city from Magnetism ; III. On a new Electrical Condition of Matter ;
IV. On Arago's Magnetic Phenomena. There is a bill of fare for you,
and, what is more, I hope it will not disappoint you.  Now the pith of all
this I must give you very briefly, the demonstrations you shall have in the
paper when printed.
   " I. When an electric current is passed through one of two parallel
wires, it causes at first a current in the same direction through the other,
but this induced current does not last a moment, notwithstanding the in
ducing current (from the voltaic battery) is continued ; all seems un
changed, except that the principal current continues its course. But
when the current is stopped, then a return current occurs in the wire
under induction, of about the same intensity and momentary duration, but
in the opposite direction to that first formed. Electricity in currents there
fore exerts an inductive   action like ordinary electricity, but subject to
peculiar laws.  The effects are a current in the same direction when the
induction is established, a reverse current when the induction ceases, and
a peculiar state in the interim.  Common electricity probably does the
same thing ; but as it is at present impossible to separate the beginning
and the end of a spark or discharge from each other, all the effects are
simultaneous and neutralize each other.
    " II. Then I found that magnets would induce just like voltaic cur
rents, and by bringing helices and wires and jackets up to the poles of
magnets, electrical currents, were produced in them, these currents
being able to deflect the galvanometer, or to make, by means of the helix,
magnetic needles, or in one case even to give a spark.  Hence the evolu
tion of electricity from magnetism.    The currents were not permanent ;
they ceased the moment the wires ceased to approach the magnet, because
the new and apparently quiescent state was assumed just as in the case of
the induction of current ; but when the magnet was removed, and its in
duction     therefore ceased,       the return currents appeared as before.  These
two kinds of induction          I   have distinguished by the terms volt a-elec tric
and magneto-electric        induction.              of action and results
                                           Their identity                         is,
I think, very powerful proof of M. Ampere's theory of magnetism.
            a
    "III.The new electrical condition which intervenes          by
                                                            induction between
the beginning and end of the inducing current gives rise to some very curious
results.  It explains why chemical action or other results of electricity have
never been as yet obtained in trials with the magnet.    In fact the currents
have no sensible duration.     believe
                                    I     will explain perfectly the transfer
                                               it
ence of elements between the poles of the pile           in
                                                     decomposition    but this
                                                                         ;
part of the subject  I     have reserved until the present experiments are com

                                           xxix
pleted   ; and it is so analogous, in some of its effects, to those of Bitter's
secondary piles, De la Rive and Van Beck's peculiar properties of the
poles of a voltaic pile, that      I  should not wonder if they all proved ulti
mately to depend on this state.          The condition of matter I have dignified
by the term      Electrotonic,   The     Electrotonic State. What do you
think of that   ?    Am   I  not a bold man, ignorant as     I am, to coin words    ?
but   I have consulted the scholars, and now for IV.
    " IV. The      new state   has    enabled me to make out and explain all
Arago's phenomena of the rotating magnet or copper plate.                 I believe,
perfectly   ; but  as great  names   are  concerned  (Arago,   Babbage,   Herschel,
&c), and as I have to differ from them, I have spoken with that mo
desty which you so well know you and I and John Frost * have in common,
and for which the world so justly commends us.             I  am even half afraid
to tell you what it is.      You will think     I am hoaxing   you, or else in your
compassion you may conclude I am deceiving myself.              However, you need
do neither, but had better laugh, as I did most heartily, when I found
that it was neither attraction nor repulsion, but just one of my old rota
tions in a new form.        I cannot explain to you all the actions, which are
very curious ; but in consequence of the electrotonic state being assumed
and lost as the parts of the plate whirl under the pole, and in consequence
of magneto-electric induction, currents of electricity are formed in the direc
tion of the radii, — continuing, for simple reasons, as long as the motion con
tinues, but ceasing when that ceases.          Hence the wonder is explained that
the metal has powers on the magnet when moving, but not when at rest.
Hence is also explained the effect which Arago observed, and which
made    him contradict     Babbage and Herschel, and say the power was re
pulsive ; but, as a whole, it is really tangential.        It is quite comfortable
to me to find that experiment need not quail before mathematics, but
is quite   competent to rival it in discovery ; and I am amazed to find
that what the high mathematicians have announced as the essential con
dition   to the rotation,    namely, that time is required, has so little foun
dation, that    if  the time could by possibility be anticipated instead of
being required, i. e. if the currents could be formed before the magnet
came over the place instead of after, the effect would equally ensue.

faithfully."

    The second series of Experimental Researches in Electricity was this year
the Bakerian lecture on Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction, and on the
Force and Direction of Magneto-electric Induction generally.
    His Friday discourses were, ( 1) on Dr. Johnson's Researches on the Re
productive Power of Planariae ; ('2) recent experimental Investigation of
Volta-electric and Magneto-electric          Induction ; (3) Magneto-electric In-
   * A pushing acquaintance, who, without claim of any kind, got himself presented at
Court,

                                          XXX
duction, and the explanation it affords of Arago's Phenomena of Magne
tism exhibited by moving Metals ; (4) Evolution of Electricity, naturally
and artificially,   by the inductive      action of the Earth's Magnetism     ; (5)
on the Crispation of Fluids lying on vibrating Surfaces ; and on Morden's
Machinery for manufacturing Bramah's locks.
     He was made Hon. Member of Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and
of Chemical and Physical Society, Paris ; Fellow of the American Aca
demy of Arts and Sciences, Boston ; Member of the Royal Society of
Science, Copenhagen ; D.C.L. of Oxford University ; and he received the
Copley medal.
     He collected    the   different   papers, notes, notices, &c. published in
octavo up to this year, and he added this preface to the volume : — Papers
                                                                           "
of mine published in octavo in the Quarterly Journal of Science and else
 where, since the time that Sir     H. Davy encouraged me to write the 'Analysis
 of Caustic Lime.'      Some    I think (at this date) are good, others moderate,
 and some bad ; but I have put all into the volume, because of the
 utility they have been to me, and none more than the bad in pointing out
 to me in future, or rather after times, the faults it became me to watch
 and avoid.      As I never looked over one of my papers a year after it was
 written without believing, both in philosophy and manner, it would have
 been much better done, I still hope this collection may be of great use
 to me."
     In December, the Royal Institution being in trouble, a committee re
 ported on all the salaries.
                                 " The Committee are certainly of opinion that no
 reduction can be made in Mr. Faraday's salary, ^100 per annum, house,
 coals, and candles, and beg to express their        regret that the circumstances
 of the Institution are not such as to justify their proposing such an increase
  of it as the variety of duties which Mr. Faraday has to perform, and the
  zeal and  ability with which     he performs them, appear to    merit."
                                      Mt.  41  (1833).
      The third series of Experimental Researches contained the Identity of
  Electricities derived from different sources, and the relation by measure of
  common and voltaic electricity.        The fourth series consisted of a new law
  of Electric Conduction, and on Conducting-power generally.              The fifth
  series was on Electro-chemical       Decomposition, new conditions of Electro
  chemical Decomposition, influence of Water in Electro-chemical Decom
  position, and Theory of Electro-chemical Decomposition.           The sixth series
   was on the Power of Metals and other Solids to induce the combination of
   gaseous bodies.
      He  sent   a short note to the editors of the Philosophical Magazine on
   a means    of  preparing the Organs of Respiration so as considerably to
   extend the time of holding the breath, with remarks on its application
   in cases in which it is required to enter an irrespirable atmosphere, and
   on the precautions necessary      to be observed in such cases.

    His Friday discourses    were on the Identity of Electricity derived from
different sources  ;  on the practical prevention of Dry Rot in Timber ; on
the investigation of the Velocity and Nature of the Electric Spark and Light
by Wheatstone ; on Mr. Brunei's new mode of constructing Arches for
Bridges   ; on the mutual     relations of Lime, Carbonic      Acid, and Water ;
on a new law of Electric Conduction ; and on the power of Platina and
 other solid substances to determine the combination of gaseous bodies.
    In the early part of the year Mr. Fuller had founded a professorship of
chemistry at the Royal Institution, with a salary of about £100 a year.
Mr. Faraday was appointed for his life, with the privilege of giving no
lectures.    He was made Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of
Sciences of Berlin, and Hon. Member of the Hull Philosophical Society.
                                  Mt.   42 (1834).
    The seventh  series  of Experimental     Researches was on Electro-chemical
Decomposition (continued)      : on some general conditions of Electro-decom
position ; on a new measure of Volta Electricity ; on the Primary and
Secondary character of bodies evolved in Electro-decomposition ; on the
 definite nature and extent of Electro-chemical         Decomposition ; on the
 absolute quantity of Electricity associated with the Particles or Atoms of
 Matter.
    The eighth  series  was on the    Electricity of the Voltaic Pile, its source,
 quantity, and general characters ; on simple Voltaic Circles; on the Intensity
 necessary for Electrolyzation ; on associated Voltaic Circles on the Voltaic
 Battery ; on the resistance of an Electrolyte to Electrolytic Action ; general
 remarks on the active Voltaic Battery.              The ninth series was on
 the influence by induction of an Electric Current on itself, and on the
 inductive action of Electric Currents generally.
     He gave four Friday discourses, the first on the principle and action of
 Ericsson's Caloric engine.      The other lectures were on Electro-chemical
 Decomposition ;     on the  definite  action of Electricity ; and on new appli
 cations of the products of Caoutchouc.
     He was made Foreign Corresponding             Member of the Academy of
  Sciences and Literature of Palermo.
                                   JEt. 43 (1835).
     The tenth series of Experimental Researches was on an improved form
  of the Voltaic Battery, some practical results respecting the Construction
  and Use of the Voltaic Battery.
     He gave Friday discourses on Melloni's recent discoveries on Radiant
  Heat ; on the Induction of Electric Currents ; on the Manufacture of Pens
  from Quills and Steel, illustrated by Morden's machinery ; on the Condi
  tion and Use of the Tympanum of the Ear.
     In July he went with Mrs. Faraday from Brighton to Dieppe, spending
  a week in Paris, and some days at Geneva ; he stayed two days at Cha-
  mouni. He writes to his friend Magrath : — " We are almost surfeited with

                                                        xxxii

                                        would rather not see it than see
it with an exhausted appetite.  The  weather  has been most delightful,
and everything in our favour, so that the scenery has been in the most
beautiful condition.  Mont Blanc, above all, is wonderful, and     could                                I
not but feel,         what   I   have often               painting is very far

beneath poetry in cases of high expression, of which this is one.          No
artist should try to paint Mont Blanc, it is utterly out of his reach.     He
cannot convey an idea of             it,

in light and darkness before he can paint Mont Blanc. Yet the moment
one sees       Lord Byron's expressions come to mind, and they seem to
               it
apply.    The poetry and the subject dignify each other."
   On the 20th of April Sir James South wrote to him to say that he would
have    letter from Sir Robert Peel acquainting him with the fact that, had
          a
Sir R. Peel remained in office, pension would have beeu giveuhim.

the 23rd he wrote letter to Sir James South, which, however, his father-in-
                         a
law prevented him from sending. He said, " hope you will not think that I
I    am unconsciousof the good you meant me, or undervalue your great
exertions for me, when     say that

approbation has been intended me, that my humble exertions have been
worthy, and    think that scientific men are not wrong in accepting the

   In the 'Times' of Saturday, 28th Oct. 1835, under the head of Tory
and Whig Patronage to Science and Literature,    the following conver            is
sation, copied from Fraser's Magazine —                        :
     " Mr. F.     I   am here, my          Lord, by your desire              ;    am  I    to understand    that
it   is   on the business whichhave partially discussed with Mr. Young?
                                           I
(Lord M.'s Secretary.)    Lord Melbourne. You mean the pension, don't
you?   Mr. F. Yes, my   Lord.   Lord M. Yes, you mean the pension, and
I mean the pension too.     hate the name of the pension.
                                     I                        look upon                          I
the whole system of giving                  pensions to literary and scientific persons as                     a
piece of gross humbug            ;   it    was not done for any good purpose, and never
ought to have been done.                   It is   gross humbug from beginning to end.
                                                     a
Mr. F. (rising, and making  bow). After all this, my Lord,
                                             a                 perceive                            I
that my business with your Lordship      ended.     wish you      good is              I               a
morning." Faraday said that the report of this conversation was full of
error     ;   however he wrote       :   —
"   To the Right Hon.        Lord Viscount Melbourne, First Lord of the Treasury.
                                                                                             "   October 26.
     " My Lord, — The         conversation with which your Lordship honoured me

                                       xxxiii
this afternoon, including, as it did, your Lordship's opinion of the general
character of the pensions given of late to scientific persons, induces me
respectfully to decline the favour which I helieve your Lordship intends
for me ; for I feel that I could not, with satisfaction to myself, accept at
your Lordship's hands that which, though it has the form of approbation,
is of the character which your Lordship so pithily applied to it."
    This note, Mr. F. says, " was left by myself, with my card, at Lord Mel
bourne's office on the same evening, i. e. of the day of our conversation."
    On the fith of November Faraday wrote to Sir James South : —
    " And    now, my dear Sir, pray let me drop                 I know you have
serious troubles of your own.         Do not let me be one any longer either to
you    or to others.     You have my most grateful feelings for all the kindness
you have shown to him who is ever truly yours."
    The intervention of Miss Fox and Lady Mary Fox,            caused  Lord Mel
 bourne to write the following letter :—
                                                              " November 24.
    " Sir, — It   was with much concern that  I received your letter declining the
 offer which   I  considered myself to have made in the interview which      I  had
 with you in Downing Street, and it       was with still greater pain that   I  col
 lected from that letter that your determination was founded upon the cer
 tainly imperfect, and perhaps too blunt and inconsiderate manner in which
 I  had expressed     myself in our conversation.    I am not  unwilling to admit
 that anything in the nature of censure upon any party ought to have been
 abstained from upon such an occasion ; but I can assure you that my ob
 servations were intended      only to guard myself against the imputation of
 having any political advantage in view, and not in any respect to apply to
 the conduct of those who had or hereafter might avail themselves of a
 similar   offer.   I  intended to convey that, although I did not entirely ap
 prove of the motives which appeared to me to have dictated some recent
 grants, yet that your scientific character was so eminent and unquestionable
 as entirely to do away any objection which I might otherwise have felt,
 and to render it impossible that a distinction so bestowed could be ascribed
 to any other motive than a desire to reward acknowledged desert and to
 advance the interest of philosophy.
     " I cannot help entertaining    a hope that this explanation may be suffi
 cient   to remove any unpleasant      or unfavourable    impression which may
 have been      left upon your mind, and that I    shall have the satisfaction of
 receiving your consent to my advising His Majesty to grant to you          a pen
 sion equal in amount to that which has been conferred upon              Professor
 Airy and other persons of distinction in science and literature."
     The   same
                                          "
                   day Faraday wrote : — My Lord, your Lordship's letter,
 which I have just had the honour to receive, has occasioned me both pain
 and pleasure — pain, because     I should have been the cause of your Lord
 ship's writing such a one, and pleasure, because it assures me that          I  am

  " As,  then, your Lordship feels that, by conferring on me the mark of
approbation hinted at in your letter, you will be at once discharging your
duty as First Minister of the Crown, and performing an act consonant with
your own kind feelings, I hesitate not to say I shall receive your Lord
ship's offer both with pleasure and with pride."
   The pension was granted December 24, but in the interval he was much
troubled by some, who thought that a contradiction to the injurious state
ment in the ' Times against Lord Melbourne ought to be made.
                   '
  To   one Faraday writes   :   — " The pension is  of indifference to me,
                                                        a matter
but other results, some of which have already come to pass, are not so.
The continued renewal of this affair, to my mind, tempts me at times to
what might be thought very ungenerous under the circumstances,                namely,
even at this late hour a determined refusal of the whole."
   On the 8th of December he, however, published a letter in the ' Times,'
in which he says, " I beg leave thus publicly to state that neither directly
nor indirectly did I communicate to the Editor of Fraser's Magazine the
information on which that article (an extract of which was published in the
' Times ' of the
                 28th) was founded, or further, either directly or indirectly,
any informationto or for any publication whatsoever."
  This year he was made Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy
of Medicine, Paris ; Hon. Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
Institution of British Architects, and Physical Society of Frankfort ; Hon.
Fellow of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London; and he was awarded
one of the Royal Medals by the Royal Society.

                                      (1836).
   This year the whole course of Faraday's scientific work was changed by
his appointment as Adviser to the Trinity House. He published one paper
in the Philosophical Magazine on the general Magnetic Relations and Cha
racters of the Metals, which he begins by saying,
                                                     " general views have long
since led me to an opinion, which is probably also entertained by others,
though I do not remember to have met with             that all the metals are
                                                           it,
magnetic in the same manner as iron."
   He gave four Friday discourses on Silicified Plants and Fossils    on Mag
                                                                          ;
netism of Metals as   a general character      on Plumbago, and on Pencils,

Morden's Machinery and considerations respecting the nature of Chemical
                      ;
Elements.
  The 3rd of February       he wrote to Capt.           Pelly, Deputy Master of the
Trinity House:    —
  "I  consider your letter to me as  great compliment, and should view
                                               a
the appointment at the Trinity Honse, which you propose, in the same
light but
      ;     Imay not accept even honours without due consideration.
  " In  the first place, my time    of great value to me, and
                                     is                         the appoint
                                                                     if
ment you speak of involved anything like periodical routine attendances,          I
do not thinkI    could accept it. But      meant that in consultation, in the
                                           if  it

                                         XXXV
examination of proposed plans and experiments, in trials, &c. made as my
convenience would allow, and with an honest sense of a duty to be per
                  I
formed, then think it would consist with my present engagements. You
have left the title and     the sum in pencil.  These  I look at mainly as regards
the character of the appointment ; you will believe me to be sincere in this,
when you remember my indifference to your proposition as a matter of
interest, though not as a mailer of kindness.
     " In consequence of the goodwill and confidence of all around me I can
at any moment convert my time into money, but I do not require more of
 the latter than is sufficient for necessary purposes. The sum therefore of
 36200 is quite enough in itself, but not if it is to be the indicator of the cha
 racter of the appointment ; but I think you do not view it so, and that you
 and I understand each other in that respect ; and your letter confirms me
 in that opinion. The position which I presume you would wish me to
 hold is analogous to that of a standing counsel.
      " As to the title, it might be what you pleased almost. Chemical ad
 viser is too narrow ; for you would find me venturing into parts of the
 philosophy of light not chemical. Scientific adviser you may think too
 broad (or in me too presumptuous) ; and so it would be, if by it was under
  stood all science.    It was the character I held with two other persons at
  the Admiralty Board in its former constitution.
      " The thought occurs to me whether, after all, you want such a person
  as myself. This you must judge of ; but I always entertain a fear of taking
  an office in which I may be of no use to those who engage me.          Your ap
  plications are, however, so practical, and often so chemical, that I have no
  great doubt in the matter."
      On the 4th he was made Scientific Adviser in experiments on lights to
  the Corporation.
      For thirty years nearly he held this post. What he did may be seen in the
  portfolios, full of manuscripts, which Mrs. Faraday has given to the Tri
  nity House, in which, by the marvellous order and method of his notes and
  indices, each particle of his work can be found and consulted immediately.
      His first work was to make a photometer.       Throughout the whole year
   he was busy on the subject, making three photometers, and ascertaining
   the capability and accuracy of the instruments.       He also experimented on
   the preparation of oxygen for the Bude light, drawing up the most exact
   tables for the record of the manufacture; for example, the 10th of November
   he says, " hence oxygen costs very nearly twopence per cubical foot ; exactly
   1-909 pence."
      He was made Senator of the University of London ; Hon. Member of the
   Society of Pharmacy of Lisbon and of the Sussex Royal Institution ; Fo
   reign Member of the Society of Sciences of Modena, and the Natural-His
   tory Society of Basle.
                                       45 (1837).
      This year the 'Eleventh Series of Experimental     Researches in Electricity'
                                                                     c 2

                                      XXXVI
was communicated to the       Royal Society.   It was on Induction  :  Induction
an action   of contiguous particles ; absolute charge of Matter ; Electrometer
and Inductive Apparatus employed ; Induction in Curved Lines ; Specific
Inductive Capacity ; general results as to Induction.
    His work for the Trinity House consisted in examining the Trinity lamp,
the French lamp, and the Bude lamp, as to intensity of light and price :
" pressed Mr. Gurney, by letter, to give us his best lamp at once and not to
lose time."     Two of his four Friday discourses were on the views of Pro
fessor Mossotti as to one general law accounting for the different Forces in
Matter; on Dr. Marshall Hall's views of the Nervous System.
    He was elected Honorary Member of the Literary and Scientific Institu
tion, Liverpool.
                                 JEt. 46 (1838).
    The twelfth  series of Researches  was published this year. — On   Induction
(continued) : Conduction or Conductive Discharge ; Electrolytic Discharge;
Disruptive Discharge, Insulation, Spark, Brush, Difference of Discharge at
the positive and negative surfaces of conductors.     The thirteenth series was
also on   Induction (continued) : Disruptive Discharge (continued). Pecu
liarities of positive and negative discharge either as spark or brush ; Glow
Discharge ; Dark Discharge.       Convection or Carrying Discharge.      Relation
of a vacuum to Electrical Phenomena.          Nature of the Electrical Current.
The fourteenth series was on the nature of the Electric Force or Forces.
Relation of the Electric and Magnetic Forces, and notes on Electrical Exci
tation.    The fifteenth series was a notice of the character and direction of
the Electric Force of the Gymnotus.
    For the Trinity House he a second time reported on the new Gurney
lamp, comparing it in light and cost with the French lamp.
    He gave four Friday discourses this year.
    He was made Honorary Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers ;
Foreign Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Stockholm ; and he
received the Copley Medal.
                                 8£t. 47 (1839).
    At the end of July   he was four days at Orfordness for the Trinity House,
measuring and comparing at sea and on land the Argand lamp, the French
lamp, and the Bude lamp.
    He gave four Friday discourses, two of which were on the Electric powers
of the Gymnotus and Silurus. An account of Gurney's oxv-oil-lamp.
    During thirteen years, Miss Reid, a niece of Mrs. Faraday s, had lived at
the Institution, and she has thus given her recollections of Mr. Faraday
 during these and the following six years : —
    "There could be very few regular lessons at the Institution;      there were
so many breaks and interruptions.        Sometimes my uncle would give me a
 few sums to do, and he always tried to make me understand the why and
wherefore of everything I did.       Then occasionally he gave me a reading-
lesson. How patient he was, and how often he went over and over the

                                        xxxvii
same passage when        I was unusually dense.     He had himself taken lessons
from Smart, and he used to practise reading with exaggerated emphasis
occasionally.
     " In the earlier days of the juvenile lectures he used to encourage me to
tell him everything that struck me, and where my difficulties lay when I
did not understand him fully.         In the next lecture he would enlarge on
those especial points, and he would tell me my remarks had helped him to
make things clear to the young ones.          He never mortified me by wondering
at my ignorance,      never  seemed to  think   how stupid I was.   I might begin
 at the very beginning again and again      ;  his patience and kindness were un
 failing.
     "A   visit to the laboratory used to be a treat when the busy time of the
 day was over.
     " We often found him hard at work on experiments connected with his
 researches, his apron full of holes.        If very busy he would merely give a
 nod, and aunt would sit down quietly with me in the distance, till pre
 sently he would make a note on his slate and turn round to us for a talk,
 or perhaps he would agree to come upstairs to finish the evening with a
 game at bagatelle, stipulating for half an hour's quiet work first to finish
 his experiment.       He was fond of all ingenious games, and he always ex
 celled in them.       For  a time he took     up the Chinese puzzle, and, after
 making all the figures in the book, he set to work and produced a new set
 of figures of his own, neatly drawn, and perfectly accurate in their propor
 tions, which those in the book were not.         Another time, when  he had been
 unwell,    he amused himself with Papyro-plastics, and with his dexterous
 fingers made a chest of drawers and pigeon-house, &c.
     " When dull and dispirited, as sometimes he was to an extreme degree,
 my aunt used to carry him off to Brighton, or somewhere, for a few days,
 and they generally came back refreshed and invigorated.           Once they had
 very wet weather in some out of the way place, and there was a want of
 amusement, so he ruled a sheet of paper and made a neat draught-board,
 on which they played games with pink and white lozenges for draughts.
 But my aunt used to give up almost all the games in turn, as he soon be
 came the better player, and, as she said, there was no fun in being always
  beaten.     At bagatelle, however, she kept the supremacy, and it was long a
 favourite, on account of its being a cheerful game requiring a little moving
  about.
     "  Often of an evening they would go to the Zoological Gardens and find
 interest in all the animals, especially the new arrivals, though he was al
 ways much diverted by the tricks of the monkeys.               We have seen him
 laugh till the tears ran down his cheeks as he watched them.            He never
  missed   seeing   the wonderful   sights   of the day — acrobats and tumblers,
  giants and dwarfs ; even Punch and      Judy was an unfailing source of delight,
  whether he looked at the performance or at the admiring gaping crowd.
      " He was very sensitive to smells ; he
                                                   thoroughly enjoyed a cabbage

                                       xxxviii
   rose, and his friends   knew that one was sure to be a welcome gift.      Pure
   Eau de Cologne he liked very much ; it was one of the few luxuries of the
   kind that he indulged in ; musk was his abhorrence, and the use of that
   scent by his acquaintance annoyed him even more than the smell of tobacco,
   which was sufficiently disagreeable to him. The fumes from a candle or
   oil-lamp going out would make him very angry. On returning home one
   evening, he found his rooms full of the odious smell from an expiring lamp ;
   he rushed to the window, flung it up hastily, and brought down a whole
   row of hyacinth-bulbs and flowers and glasses.
      " Mr. Magrath used to come regularly to the morning lectures, for the
  sole purpose of noting down for Mr. F. any faults of delivery or defective
  pronunciation he could detect. The list was always received with thanks;
  although his corrections were not uniformly adopted, he was encouraged to
   continue his remarks with perfect freedom.      In early days he always lec
  tured with a card before him with Slow written upon it in distinct cha
   racters.   Sometimes he would overlook it and become too rapid ; in this
  case Anderson had orders to place the card before him.          Sometimes he
                  '      '
  had the word Time on a card brought forward when the hour was nearly
  expired."
                                   Mt. 48 (1840).
      Early in this year the sixteenth series of Experimental Researches ap
  peared. It was on the Source of Power in the Voltaic Pile : — 1. Exciting
  electrolytes, &c., being conductors of thermo and feeble currents ; 2. Inac
  tive Conducting Circles containing an electrolytic fluid ; 3. Active Circles
  excited by solution of Sulphuret of Potassium.       The seventeenth series
  came a few days after.      Also on the Source of Power in the Voltaic Pile
'
  (continued):    4. The  exciting Chemical Force by temperature ; 5. The ex
  citing Chemical Force affected by dilution ; 6. Differences in the Order of
  the Metallic Elements of Voltaic Circles ; 7. Active Voltaic Circles and
  Batteries without metallic contact ; 8. Considerations of the sufficiency of
  chemical action; 9. Thermoelectric evidence; 10. Improbable nature of
  the assumed    Contact Force.
      He gave three Friday discourses.
      The previous year, Dr. Hare, Professor of Chemistry in the University
  of Pennsylvania, wrote his objections to Faraday's theoretical opinions on
  Static Induction. At the end of Faraday's reply, he says: — "The paragraphs
  which    remain unanswered refer, I think, only to differences of opinion,
  or else not even to differences, but opinions regarding which I have not
  ventured to judge.      These opinions I esteem of the utmost importance ;
  but that is a reason which makes me the rather desirous to decline entering
  upon their consideration, inasmuch as on many of their connected points I
  have formed no decided notion, but am constrained by ignorance and the
  contrast of facts to hold my judgment as yet in suspense.      It is indeed to
  me an annoying matter to find how many subjects there are in electrical
  science on which,   if I  were asked for an opinion, I should have to say I

                                         xxxix
cannot tell — I do not know     ;  but, on the other hand, it is encouraging to
think that   these are they which,     if pursued industriously, experimentally,
and thoughtfully, will lead to new discoveries. Such a subject, for instance,
occurs in the currents produced by dynamic induction, which you say it
will  be admitted do not require for their production         intervening ponderable
atoms.     For my own part, I more than half incline to think they do re
quire these intervening particles.       But on this question, as on many others,
I  have not yet made up my mind."
    On the   1st  of January the following year, Dr. Hare           sent a reply.  In
Faraday's answer to this, he says       :—
                                            " You    must excuse me, however, for
several reasons, from answering it at any length.            The first is my distaste
for controversy, which is so great that         I would on no account our corre
spondence should acquire that character.             I have often seen it do great
harm, and yet remember few cases in natural knowledge where it has helped
much either to pull down error or advance truth.             Criticism, on the other
hand, is of much value     ;  and when criticism        such as yours has done its
duty, then it is for other minds than those either of the author or critic to
decide upon and acknowledge the right."
   This year he reported to the Trinity House on the necessity and method
of examining lighthouse dioptric arrangements, and he had to examine the
apparatus intended for Gibraltar.            Between Purfleet and Blackwall he
made a long comparison between English and French reflecting lamps and
between English and French refracting prisms.
   To Professor Auguste De la Rive, the son of his early friend, he wrote : —
" Though    a miserable correspondent      I take up my pen to write to you, the
moving feeling     being a desire   to  congratulate you on your discernment,
perseverance, faithfulness, and success in the cause of Chemical Excitement
of the current in the Voltaic Battery.             You will think it is rather late
to do so ; but not under the circumstances.             For a long time I had not
made up my mind ;      then  the  facts   of  definite electrochemical action made
me take part with the supporters of the chemical theory, and since then
Marianini's paper with reference to myself has made me read and experi
ment more generally on the point in question.                In the reading, I was
struck   to see how soon, clearly, and constantly you had and have sup
ported that theory, and think your proofs and reasons most excellent and
convincing. The constancy of Marianini and of many others on the opposite
side made me, however,     think it not unnecessary       to accumulate and record
evidence   of the truth, and   I  have therefore written        two papers, which   I
shall send you when printed, in which I enter under your banners as re
gards the origin of electricity or of the current in the pile.             My object
in experimenting was, as I am sure yours has always been, not so much to
support a given theory as to learn the natural truth ; and having gone to
the question    unbiassed by any prejudices, I cannot imagine how any one
whose mind is not preoccupied by a theory, or a strong bearing to a theory,
can take part with that of contact against that of chemical action.             How

                                           xl
ever,   I am perhaps wrong saying so much, for, as no one          is infallible, and
as the experience      of past times may teach        us to doubt a theory which
seems to be most unchangeably           established,   so we cannot    say what the
future may bring forth in regard to these views."
     He was made Member of the American Philosophical Society, Phila
delphia, and Honorary Member of the Hunterian Medical Society, Edin
burgh.
     He was in the autumn of this year ordained Elder in the Sandemanian
 Church, and he held the office three years and a half.
                                   Mt.    49  (1841).
     On the 2nd of September Faraday wentdown to St. Catherine's lighthouse
 in the Isle of Wight, to remedy the condensation of moisture on the glass in
 the inside. On the 6th he returned home, "quite satisfied with the chimney,
 and have no doubt we shall have a lantern quite clear from sweat, and also
 much cleaner, both as to the mirrors and roof, from soot and blackness, than
 heretofore."
      The 30th of June he left London for three months, with Mrs. Faraday
 and Mr. and Mrs. George Barnard, for Ostend and Switzerland.            The journal
 which he kept contains many most beautiful descriptions. That of Brienti
  Lake and the Giessbach is perhaps one of the most striking : — " George and
  I crossed the lake in a boat to the Giessbach, he to draw and I to saunter.
  The day was fine, but the wind against the boat ; and these boats are so
  cumbrous, and at the same time expose so much surface to the air, that
  we were about two hours doing the two miles, with two men and occa
  sionally our own assistance at the oar.         We broke the oar-band ; we were
  blown back and sideways.         We were drawn against the vertical rock in a
  place where the lake is nearly 1000 feet deep ; and I might tell a true tale,
  which would sound very serious, yet after all there was nothing of any con
  sequence but delay.      But such is the fallacy of description.       We reached
   the fall and found it in its grandeur ; for, as much rain fell last night,
   there was perhaps half as much more water than yesterday.              This most
   beautiful fall consists of a fine river, which passes by successive steps down
   a very deep precipice into the lake.        In some of these steps there is a clear
   leap of water 100 feet or more ; in others, most beautiful combinations of
   leap, cataract, and rapid — the finest rocks occurring at the sides and bed
   of the torrent.    In one part a bridge passes over it ; in another a cavern
   and path occur under     it.  To-day every fall was foaming from the abun
    dance of water, and the current of wind brought down by it was in some
    parts almost too strong to stand against.       The sun shone brightly, and the
    rainbows seen from various parts were very beautiful.        One at the bottom
    of a fine but furious fall was very pleasant ; there it remained motionless,
    whilst the gusts and clouds of spray swept furiously across its place          and
    were dashed against the rock.        It looked like a spirit strong in faith    and
    steadfast in the midst of the storm of passions sweeping across it ;            and

                                                                xli
though it might fade and revive, still it held on to the rock as in hope and giv
ing hope, and the very drops which, in the whirlwind of their fury, seemed as
if they would carry all away, were made to revive it and give it greater beauty.
How often                  are the things we fear and esteem                 as troubles    made to become
blessings to those who are led to receive them with humility and patience !
In one part of the fall the effect of the current of air was very curious.
The great mass of water fell into a foaming basin, but some diverted por
tions struck the rock opposite the observer, and, collecting, left it at the
    various projecting parts ; but, instead of descending, these hundred little
    streams rushed upwards into the air, as if urged by a force the reverse of
    gravity ; and as there was little other spray in this part, it did not at first
    occur to the mind that this must be the effect of a powerful current of air,
    which, having been brought down by the water, was returning up that face
    of      the rock."
            Into the pages of this journal                   he has fixed,    with the most extreme neat
    ness, the different mountain-flowers                          that he gathered in his walks.
       Mrs. Faraday wrote for him part of a letter to Mr. Magrath : — " I
    think Mr. Young would be quite satisfied with the way my husband em
    ploys his time. He certainly enjoys the country exceedingly ; and though
    at first he lamented our absence                           from home and friends very much, he
    seems now to be reconciled to                       it            of improving his general health.

     He resumed the Friday evening lectures, and gave one on the Conduc
 tion of Electricity in Lightning-rods, and one on the Principles and Practice
 of Hulhnandel's Lithotint.         This year he made four reports to the Trinity
 House    :  — 1, on comparison     of the amount of Light cut off by French glass
 and by Newcastle glass ; 2, on a new Mode of suspending the Mirrors ;
 3, its application to the Lundy Lighthouse, so as to save light ; 4, a Report
 on the Ventilation of the Tynemouth Light ; and he went to see the opera
 tion of the grinding-apparatus for lenses at Newcastle.
     To Dr. T. M. Browne, who had asserted the isomerism of carbon and
 silicon, and who asked Faraday to witness his experiments and give him a
 written testimonial if they were satisfactory, he writes : — " That which
 made me inaccessible to you makes me so in a very great degree to all my
 friends — ill health connected with my head ; and I have been obliged, and I
 am still, to lay by nearly all my own pursuits, and to deny myself the
 pleasure of society, either in seeing myself in my friends' houses or them
 here. This alone would prevent me from acceding to your request.                    I
 should, if I assented, do it against the strict advice of my friends, medical
 and social.
     " The   matter of your request makes me add a word or two, which         I hope
 you will excuse.        Any one who does what you ask of me, i. e. certify if
 the experiment is successful, is bound, without escape, to certify and publish
 also  if itfail  ; and   I think you may consider that very few persons would
 be willing to do this.      I  certainly would not put myself in such a most un
pleasant condition."
    This year he was made Chevalier of the Prussian Order of Merit (one
of thirty), and Foreign Associate of the Royal Academy of Sciences,
 Berlin.
                                    JEt. 51 (1843).
                                                                '           '
    Early this year he sent the eighteenth series of his Researches to the
Royal Society.        It was on the electricity evolved by the friction of water
and steam against other bodies.           This had been first observed by Sir W.
Armstrong, and was attributed to evaporation, and was thought to be related
to atmospheric electricity.       He concluded, " the cause being, I believe, fric
tion, has no effect in producing, and is not connected with, the general
electricity of the atmosphere."
    He read a paper at the Institution of Civil Engineers on the ventilation
of lighthouse lamps, the points necessary to be observed, and the manner
in which these have been, or may be, attained.
    He gave three Friday discourses on some Phenomena              of Electric In
duction    ;  on the Ventilation of Lamp-burners,        and on the Electricity of
Steam.
    For the Trinity House he went           to the South  Foreland lighthouses   re-

                                          xliii
 garding their ventilation.      He inspected the dioptric light of the first order,
 which had just been constructed in France and put up by French work
 men, and compared its consumption of oil with the 1 5 Argand burners which
were previously in use.
     He sent to the Philosophical Magazine a paper on Static Electrical Induc
tive Action.      Among his notes the following occurs : — " Propose to send to
the Phil. Mag. for consideration the subject of a bar, or circular, or spherical
 magnet — first, in the strong magnetic field; then charged by it; and, finally,
 taken away and placed in space. Inquire the disposition of the dual force, the
 open or the related powers of the poles externally, and if they can exist un
 related.     The difference between    the state of the power, when related and
when not, consistent with the conservation of force.           Avoid any particular
 language. Should not pledge myself          to answer any particular observations,
 or to any    one, against open consideration     of the subject.     Want to direct
 the thoughts of all upon the subject, and to tie it there ; and especially to
gather for myself thought on the point of relation or non-relation of the
antithetical    force or polarities."
    He  was made    Honorary Member of the Literary and Philosophical Society
of   Manchester, and Useful Knowledge Society, Aix la Chapelle.
                                   JEt.  52 (1844).
    He communicated to the Royal Society          a paper on the    Liquefaction and
 Solidification of Bodies generally existing      as Gases.   His object was to sub
ject the gases to considerable pressure, with considerable depression of
temperature.       Though he did not condense oxygen, hydrogen, or nitrogen,
the original objects of his pursuit, he added six substances, usually gaseous,
to the list of those that could previously be shown in the liquid state, and
he reduced seven, including ammonia, nitrous oxide, and sulphuretted hy
drogen, into the solid form.
    He sent to the Philosophical Magazine a speculation touching electric
conduction and the nature of matter. Elsewhere he calls this " a speculation
respecting that view of the nature of matter which considers its ultimate
atoms as centres of force, and not as so many little bodies surrounded by
forces, the bodies being considered in the abstract as independent of the
forces, and capable of existing without them.            In the latter view these
little particles have a definite form and a certain limited size.      In the former
view such is not the case ; for that which represents size may be considered as
extending to any distance to which the lines of force of the particle extend.
The particle, indeed, is supposed to exist only by these forces, and where
they are it is."
    This was the subject of his first Friday discourse.            He also gave the
last discourse on recent improvements in the Manufacture and Silvering of
Mirrors.
    For the Trinity      House    he only    examined    different   cottons for the
lamps.

    In October     he was sent by Sir James Graham with Mr.        Lyell   to attend
the inquest on those who had died by the explosion in the Haswell colliery.
   The following account is by Sir Charles : —
    " Faraday undertook the charge with much reluctance, but no sooner
had he accepted it than he seemed to be quite at home in his new vocation.
 He was seated near the coroner, and cross-examined the witnesses with as
much talent, skill, and self-possession as if he had been an old practitioner
at the bar.       We spent eight hours, not without danger, in exploring the
galleries where the chief loss of life had been incurred.            Among other
questions, Faraday      asked in whatVay they    measured   the  rate at which the
current of air flowed in the mine.       An inspector took a small pinch of gun
powder out of a box, as he might have taken a pinch of snuff, and allowed
it to fall gradually through the flame of a candle which he held in the
other hand.        His companion, with a watch, marked the time the smoke
took going a certain distance.       Faraday admitted that this plan was suf
ficiently accurate for their purpose ; but, observing the somewhat careless
manner in which they handled their powder, he a«ked where they kept it.
They    said they kept it in a bag, the neck of which was tied up tight.         But
where, said he, do you keep the bag ? you are sitting on it was the reply ; for
they had given this soft and yielding seat, as the most comfortable
one at hand, to the Commissioner.             He sprang up on his feet, and,
in a most animated         and expressive style, expostulated with them for
their carelessness,    which, as he said, was especially discreditable to those
who should       be setting an example of vigilance and caution to others
who were      hourly exposed to the danger of explosions                   Hearing
that a subscription had been opened for the widows and orphans of the men
who had perished by the explosion, I found, on inquiry, that Faraday
had already contributed largely.        On speaking to him on the subject, he
apologized for having done so without mentioning it to me, saying that he
did not wish me to feel myself called upon to subscribe because he had
done so."
    To  a lady   of the highest talent, who proposed   to become    his disciple, to
go   through with him all his own experiments, he wrote       :—
                                                                  " That I should
rejrice to aid you in your purpose you cannot doubt, but nature is against
you.     You have all the confidence of unbaulked health and youth, both in
body and mind.         I am a labourer of many years' standing, made daily to
feel my wearing out.        You, with increasing acquisition of knowledge, en
large your views and intentions.        I, though I may gain from day to day
some little maturity of thought, feel the decay of powers, and am constrained
to a continual process of lessening my intentions and contracting my pur
suits.     Many a fair discovery stands before me in thought which I once
intended, and even now desire, to work out       ; but I lose all hope respecting
them when      I  turn my thoughts to that one which is in hand, and see how
slowly, for want of time and physical power, it advances, and how likely it
is to be not only a barrier between me and the many beyond in intellectual

                                             xlv
view, but       even the last upon the list   of those practically wrought out.     Un
derstand       me in this  ; I am not saying that my mind is wearing out, but those
phy     sico-mental   faculties by which the mind and body are kept in conjunction
and     work together, and especially the memory, fail me, and hence a limitation
of all I     was once able to perform      with a much smaller extent than hereto
fore. It is this which has had a great effect in moulding portions of my
later life, has tended to withdraw me from the communion and pursuits of
men of      science  my cotemporaries, has lessened the number of points of in
vestigation      (that might at some time have become discoveries) which I now
pursue, and which, in conjunction with its effects, makes me say most un
 willingly that I dare not undertake what you propose — to go with you
 through even my own experiments.               You do not know, and should not now
 but that I have no concealment on this point from you, how often I have
 to go to my medical friend to speak of giddiness and aching of the head,
 and how often he has to bid me cease from restless thoughts and mental
 occupation and retire to the seaside to inaction.              You speak of religion,
 and here you will be sadly disappointed in me.            You will perhaps remember
  that I guessed, and not very far aside, your tendency in this respect. Your
 confidence in me claims in return mine to you, which, indeed, I have no
  hesitation to give on fitting occasions ; but these         I think are very few, for
  in my mind religious conversation is generally in vain. There is no philo
  sophy in my religion.         I am of a very small and despised sect of Christians,
  known,     if known at all, as Sandemanians, and our hope is founded on the
  faith that is in Christ.        But though the natural works of God can never
  by any possibility come in contradiction with the higher things which be
  long to our future existence, and must with everything concerning him ever
  glorify him, still    I do not   think it  at  all necessary   to tie the study of the
   natural sciences and religion together ; and in my intercourse with my
   fellow creatures that which is religious and that which is philosophical have
   ever been two distinct      things."
      In answer to Mr. Magrath, who sent him, from the ' Journal des Debats,'
   notice of his election as one of the eight foreign associates of the Academy
   of Sciences, Paris, he said : —     "I received by this morning's post notice of
   the event in a letter from Dumas, who wrote from the Academy at the
   moment of the deciding the ballot, and, to make it more pleasant, Arago
   directed it on the outside."
       He  was also made     Honorary Member of the Sheffield Scientific Society.
                                      Mt.   53 (1845).
       This year produced the nineteenth series of Researches on the Magnetiza
   tion of Light and the Illumination of Magnetic Lines of Force: — 1. Action of
   Magnets on Light ; 2. Action of Electric Currents on Light ; 3. General
   considerations.      Also the twentieth series, on new Magnetic Actions, and on

Condition of all Matter (continued) : 5. Action of Magnets on the Magnetic
Metals and their compounds; 6. Action of Magnets on Air and Gases;
7.   General considerations.
   For the Trinity House he made a long and exact comparison of the con
sumption and light of sperm and rape-oil.     He gave a Friday discourse on
the Condition and Ventilation of the Coal-mine Goaf, and another on the
liquefaction and solidification of bodies usually gaseous ; another on ana
static painting, and on the Artesian well in Trafalgar Square.
   Early in the year he thus wrote to Prof. Auguste De la Rive : —
                                                                      " have        I
waited and waited for a result, intending to write off to you on the instant,
and hoping by that to give a little value to my letter, until now, when the
time being gone and the result not having arrived, I am in a worse condi
tion than ever ; and the only value my letter can have will be in the kind
ness with which you will receive it.    The result I hoped for was the con
densation of oxygen ; but though I have squeezed him with a pressure of
60 atmospheres at the temperature of 140° F. below 0°, he would not settle
down into the liquid or solid state ; and now, being tired and ill and obliged
to prepare for lectures, I must put the subject aside for a little while.
   " Nitrogen is certainly a strange body. It encourages every sort of guess
about its nature and will satisfy none.   I have been trying to look at it in
the condensed state, but as yet it escapes me.
     "Ithank you most truly, not only for the invitation (to the scientific
meeting) you have sent me, but for all the favour you would willingly show
me. Do you remember one hot day (I cannot tell how many years ago)
when      I
        was hot and thirsty in Geneva, and you took me to your house in
the town and gave me a glass of water and raspberry vinegar                 ?   That glass
of drink      is refreshing to me   still."
   Late in the year he        writes to M. De la Rive : — "       I

                                                                        a
pound of silica, boracic acid, and lead, which       will now call heavy glass. It

electric forces.       Now,   if

thick and two inches long, be very freely suspended between the poles of
                                                                                        is a
powerful horseshoe electromagnet, immediately that the magnetic force
developed, the bar points, but         it   does not   point from pole to pole, but equa

torially or     across the magnetic lines of force, i. e. east and west in respect
of the      north and south poles.              If
                                        it be moved from this position it returns
to   it,   and this continues as long as the magnetic force       in action.
                                                                           is This
effect     is         still simpler action of the magnet on the bar than
                the result of     a
what appears by the experiment, and which may be obtained at          single              a
magnetic pole. For      cubical  or

by   a     fine thread   6   or   8    feet long, and allowed

magneto-electric pole (not as yet made active), then, on rendering the pole
magnetic, the glass will be repelled until the magnetism ceases.       This
effect and power        I             through great number of its forms and
                             have worked out                  a
strange consequences,  and  they will  occupy two series of the Experimental
                                                                                 '
Researches.'   It belongs to all matter (not magnetic as iron) without excep
tion so that every substance belongs to one or the other class of magnetic
      ;
or diamagnetic bodies. The law of action in its simplest form     that such          is
matter tends to go from strong  to weak   points of magnetic  force, and in
doing this the substance will go in either direction along the magnetic
curves, or in either direction across them.It curious that amongst the
                                                                   is

   In July he went with Mrs. Faraday and Mr.                        G. Barnard    to France for
three weeks, partly to inspect the lighthouses at                    Fecamp,   Havre,  Harfleur,
and Cap de    Haye.la  His chief object was to be                   received into the Academy.
At the same time he gained all the informationhe could regarding French
lighthouses from M. H. Le Ponte and M. Fresnel.      M. Dumas was his
most constant companion in his visits to Chevreul, Milne-Edwards, Biot,
 Arago, the Well of Grenelle, and the water-works at Chaillot. On the 30th
 of July he went to the Institute. " Many of the members were gone out of
 town, but all that were there received me very kindly.     was glad to seeI
 Thenard,   Dupuis, Flourens, Biot, Dumas of course, and Arago, Elie de
 Beaumont,    Poinsot, Babinet, and   great many others whose names and
                                                     a
 faces sadly embarrassed my poor head and memory.      Chatting together,
 Arago told me he was my senior, being born in 1786, and consequently 59
 years      of age."
    He finishes his journal thus — " We left George at the London Bridge
                                               :
 Station   thanks be to him for all his kind care and attention on the journey,
             ;
 which     better worth remembering than anything else of all that which
            is
 occurred in it."
    He was made Corresponding Member of the National Institute, Wash
 ington, and of the Socteté d'Encouragement, Paris.

                                                     (1846).
   Early in the year he               gave a Friday discourse on the relation of Magnetism
 and Light, and another                on the Magnetic Condition of Matter, and, later in

                                            xlviii
the season, another on Wheatstone's Electro-magnetic Chronoscope, at the
end of which he said he was induced to utter a speculation long on his
mind, and constantly gaining strength, viz. that perhaps those vibrations
by which radiant agencies, such as light, heat, actinic influence, &c, convey
this force through space, are not vibrations of an ether, but of the lines of
force which, in his view, equally connect the most distant masses together
and make the smallest atoms or particles by their properties influential on
each other and perceptible to us.             A little later he sends these views to
the Philosophical Magazine as thoughts on ray vibrations ;
                                                                        " but, from first
to last, understand that I merely throw out, as matter for speculation, the
vague impressions of my mind ; for I give nothing as the result of sufficient
consideration or as the settled conviction, or even probable conclusion, at
which I had arrived." His last Friday discourse was on the Cohesive Force
 of Water.
     He reported     to the    Trinity   House     on   drinking-water of the Smalls
Lighthouse, and on a ventilation apparatus for rape-oil lamps.
    To the Secretary of the Institution, who consulted him regarding evening
 lectures, he said,
                       " I see no objection to evening lectures if you can find a
 fit man to give them.        As to popular lectures (which at the same time are
 to be respectable and sound), none are more difficult to find.                 Lectures
which really teach will never be popular ; lectures which are popular will
 never really teach.        They know little of the matter who think science is
 more easily to be taught or learned than ABC; and yet who ever learned
 his  A B C without pain and trouble?             Still lectures can (generally) inform
 the  mind   and  show    forth to  the  attentive   man what he really has to learn,
 and in their way are very useful, especially to the public.               I think they
might be useful      to us   now,  even  if they only gave     an answer  to those who,
judging by their own earnest desire to learn, think much of them.                  As to
agricultural chemistry, it is no doubt an excellent and a popular subject ;
 but  I rather suspect that those who know least of it think that most is
known about      it."
     He received both the Rumford and a Royal Medal, and was made
 Honorary Member of the Society of Sciences, Vaud.
                                     JEt.  55  (1847).
     He  gave  Friday discourses on the Combustion of Gunpowder; on Mr.
 Barry's mode of ventilating the New House of Lords ; and on the Steam-jet
chiefly as a means of procuring ventilation.
     He reported to the Trinity House on the ventilation of the South Foreland
lights, and on a proposal to light buoys by platinum wire ignited by
electricity.
     He writes to the First Lord of the Admiralty from Ediuburgh : — " For
years past my health has been more and more affected ; and the place
affected is my head.         My medical advisers say it is from mental occupa
tion.    The result is loss of memory, confusion, and giddiness               ; the  sole

                                              xlix
  remedy, cessation     from such occupation and head rest.            I  have in conse
  quence given up, for the last ten years or more, all professional occupation,
  and voluntarily resigned a large income that I might pursue in some degree
  my own objects of research.            But in doing this   I  have always, as a good
  subject, held myself ready        to assist the  Government    if still in my power —
  not  for pay,  for, except in one instance (and then only for the sake of the
  person joined with me), I refused to take it.           I have had the honour and
  pleasure  of  applications,     and   that  very recently, from the Admiralty, the
  Ordnance, the Home Office, the Woods and Forests, and other departments,
  all of which    I have    replied to, and will reply to as long as strength is left
  me ; and now it is to the condition under which I am obliged to do this
  that I am anxious to call your Lordship's attention in the present case.
  I  shall be most happy to give my advice and opinion in any case as may
  be at the time within my knowledge or power, but I may not undertake
  to enter into investigations or experiments.          If I were in London I would
  wait upon your Lordship, and say all           I could upon the subject of the dis
  infecting fluids,  but   I  would   not  undertake  the experimental investigation ;
  and in saying this     I   am sure that I shall have your sympathy and appro
  bation when     I  state that it is now more than three weeks since I left
  London to obtain the benefit of change of air, and yet my giddiness is so
 little alleviated that      I don't feel in any degree confident that I shall ever
 be able to return to my recent occupations and duties."
     To Professor Schiinbein he writes, three months later : — " I shame to
 say that I have not yet repeated the experiments (on ozone), but my head
 has been    so giddy that my doctors have absolutely forbidden me the               pri
 vilege and pleasure of working or thinking for a while ; and so                   I  am
 constrained to go out of town, be a hermit, and take absolute rest.                   In
 thinking of    my own case       it makes me rejoice to know of your health and
 strength, and look on whilst you labour with a constancy so unremitting
 and so successful."
     He was made Member            of the Academy of Sciences, Bologna, Foreign
 Associate of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Belgium, Fellow of the Royal
 Bavarian Academy of Sciences, Munich, and Correspondent of the Aca
 demy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.
                                       Mt.  56 (1848).
     He this year communicated his twenty-second             series of 'Researches' as
 the Bakerian lecture.         It was on the Crystalline    Polarity   of Bismuth (and
 other bodies), and on its relation to the Magnetic form of Force.             1 . Crys
 talline Polarity of Bismuth ; 2. Crystalline Polarity         of Antimony ; 3. Crys
talline Polarity of Arsenic.           The second part of this series on the same
subject was (4) on the Crystalline Condition of various bodies, and (5) Na
ture of the Magnecrystallic Force, and general observations.
     " I cannot conclude this series of Researches," he says, " without remark
ing how rapidly the knowledge of molecular forces grows upon us, and

how strikingly every investigation tends to develope more and more their
importance and their extreme attraction as an object of study.    A few
years ago magnetism was to us an occult power affecting only a few bodies ;
now it is found to influence all bodies, and to possess the most intimate
relations with electricity, heat, chemical action, light, crystallization, and,
through    it,
             with the forces concerned in cohesion and we may, in the
                                                                 ;

   He gave three Friday discourses                     Condition of Flame
                                             on the Diamagnetic

   He was made Foreign Honorary Member (one of eight) of the Imperial
Academy of Sciences, Vienna, and Doctor of Liberal Arts and Philosophy
in the University of Prague.
                                    JEt.    57 (1849).
  He   gave two        Friday discourses,   one on   Pliicker's repulsion     of the   Optic
Axes of Crystals by the Magnetic Poles    and the other on De la Rue's
                                                   ;
Envelope Machinery.
  He reported to the Trinity House on the ventilation of Flambro' Head,
Dungeness, Needles, and Portland Lighthouses.
  He was made Honorary Member, First Class, Institute Royale des Pays-
Bas, and Foreign Correspondent of the Institute, Madrid.

   The twenty-third series of Researches in Electricity appeared, on the Polar
or other Condition of Diamagnetic Bodies.       The twenty-fourth series was
the Bakerian  lecture, on the possible relation of Gravity to Electricity. He
finishes this paper, saying, " Here end my trials for the present.    The
results are negative     they do not shake my strong feeling of the exist
                            ;
ence of    arelation between gravity and electricity, though they give no
proof that such      relation exists."
                        a              The twenty-fifth series was on the
Magnetic and Diamagnetic Condition of Bodies: —      Non-expansion   1.                   of
Gaseous Bodies by Magnetic Force. 2. Differential Magnetic Action.                        3.

                                      :

   He gave    Friday discourse on the Electricity of the Air, and another
               a
on certain conditionsof Freezing Water.
   He reported on the adulteration of whitelead for the Trinity House.
   To Prof. Schonbein he writes — " By-the-by, have been working with
                                       :                     I
the oxygen of the air also.   You remember that three years ago        dis        I

tinguished it         as a magnetic gas in my paper on the diamagnetism                               of   flame
and gases, founded on Bancalari's experiment. Now I find in it the cause
of all the annual and diurnal and many of the irregular variations of the
terrestrial magnetism.  The observations made at Hobarton, Toronto,
Greenwich, St. Petersburg, Washington, St. Helena, the Cape of Good
Hope, and Singapore, all appear                       to me to accord with
                                                        and support my
hypothesis.  I will not pretend to give you an account of it here, for it
would require some detail, and I really am weary of the subject."  Later
he writes : — "        I think I
                         told you in my last how that oxygen in the atmo
sphere,                   I
                 pointed out three years ago in my paper on flame and
              which
gases as so very magnetic compared with other gases, is now to me the
source of all the periodical variations of terrestrial magnetism, and so I
rejoice to think and talk at the same time of your results, which deal also
with that same atmospheric oxygen. What a wonderful body it is !"
    Miss Martineau had said, on the authority of the Annual Register, that
he countenanced the Acarus Crossii.                               "
                                         Faraday corrects her : — I hope
you will forgive me for writing to you about this matter. I feel it a great
honour to be borne on your remembrance, but I would not willingly be
there in an erroneous point of view."
   In the summer he was asked by a friend to stay in the country.       He
 writes, August 24, from Upper Norwood : — " I have kept your picture to
 look at for a day or two before I acknowledge your kindness in sending it.
 It gives the idea of a tempting place ; but what can you say to such per
 sons as we are who eschew all the ordinary temptations of society                                ?        There
 is one thing, however, society has which we do not eschew   ; perhaps it is
 not very ordinary, though I have found a great deal of         and that                 it,                  is
 kindness, and we both join most heartily in thanking you for     even when                 it,
 we do not accept  that which  offers.    must tell

 We have taken                a   little house      here on the       hill-top, where   I   have      a    small
 room to myself, and have, ever since we came here, been deeply immersed
 in magnetic cogitations.    write and write and write until nearly three

 of the Friday evenings at present     must not say more.
                                       ;              I     After writing                                     I
 walk out in the evening, hand-in-hand, with my dear wife to enjoy the
 sunset  for to me, who love scenery, of all that
          ;                                         have seen or can see,  I
 there  none surpasses that of Heaven

 thousand thoughts that delight me."
      Earlier the         same     friend asked him, for the first time, to dinner.                           He
 writes    from Brighton: — "Your note           very kind one, and very grate
                                                             is   a
 fully received     wish

                      ;   on  some accounts    that  nature had given me habits
 more fitted to thank you properly for          by acceptance than those which
                                                                 it
 really belong  to me.   In  the present case,   however, you will perceive that
 our being here supplies                   an answer (something            like   a   lawyer's objection)

without referring to the greater point of principle.      should have been
                                                                      I
very sorry in return for your kindness to say no to you on the other ground,
and yet  I fear  Ishould have been constrained to do so."
   At the end of the year he had another invitation from the Honourable
Col. Grey. " If you could make         convenient to come down to Windsor
                                           it
any afternoon in the course of next week, would give His Royal Highness
                                                         it
great satisfaction to have the opportunity of having some conversation with
you on this interesting subject (the magnetic properties of oxygen)."
  He was made Corresponding Associate of the Accademia Pontificia, Rome,
and Foreign Associate of the Academy of Sciences, Haarlem.
                                      JEt.     59 (1851).
   The twenty-eighth series of Researches were sent to the Royal Society on
Lines of Magnetic Force, their definite character, and their distribution
within Magnet and through Space also the twenty-ninth series, on the

covery, the evolution of electricity from magnetism then          ;continued to ter
                                                                          it

                     ;                                          Then came electro
chemical decomposition        then the electricity of the voltaic pile
                                ;                                          then the;
induction of     a current on itself; then static induction. Then the nature
of the electric force or forces, and the character of the electric force               in
the Gymnotus.        Then the source of power in the voltaic pile          then the;

and the magnetic condition of all matter           then the crystalline polarity of

 nerism  ;  then the lines of magnetic    force,  and  the employment of induced
magneto-electric         currents as their test and measure.
   The record of this work, which he has left in his manuscripts and re
published in his three volumes from the papers in the Philosophical Trans
actions, will ever remain Faraday's noblest monument — full of genius in the

                                           liii
conception, full of finished and most accurate work in execution           ;  n quan
tity   so vast that   it  seems impossible    one man could have done so much ;
and this will appear still more when it is remembered that Anderson's
help may be summed up in two words, blind obedience.
      The use of magneto-electricity in induction machines, in electrotyping,
and in lighthouses are the most important practical applications of the
' Experimental Researches in Electricity;' but who can attempt to measure
or imagine the stimulus and the assistance which these researches have
given, and will give, to other investigators ?
     Lastly, if we look at the circumstances under which this work was done,
 we sh all see that during the greater part of these twenty years the Royal
 Institution was kept alive by the innumerable Friday lectures which he
 gave at it.
                 " We were living," as he once said to the managers, " on the
 parings of our own skin."         He had no grant from the Royal Society, and
 during the whole of this time the fixed income which the Institution could
 afford to give him was .£100 a year, to which the Fullerian professorship
 added nearly a£100 more.
              '
     By the Experimental Researches in Electricity,' Faraday's scientific life
 may be divided into three parts.          The first lasted to 1830, when he was
 thirty-eight; the second, or "research period," lasted to 1851 ; and the
 third and final period began in 1852, and continued to his last report to
 the Trinity House (in 1865) on the foci and descent of a beam of light
 336 feet at St. Bees Lighthouse.
                                   JEt. 60 (1852).
     The first  and last   Friday discourses of the season were on Lines of Mag
 netic Force.     In the Philosophical Magazine there was a long paper on the
  Physical   Character   of the Lines of Magnetic Force. He begins with a note :
 — " The following paper contains so much of a speculative and hypothetical
 nature that I have thought it more fitted for the pages of the Philosophical
                                                                             " " The
 Magazine than for those of the Philosophical Transactions
 paper, as is evident, follows series xxviii. and xxix., and depends much for
 its experimental support on the more strict results and conclusions contained
 in them."
      He made many reports to the Trinity House, among others: — on adul
 terated white-lead ; on oil in iron tanks ; on impure olive-oils ; on the
  Caskets lighthouse.       And the question of the use of Watson's electric light
  was first moved by a letter of Dr. Watson to the Trinity House.
     In October he wrote a long letter to M. He la Rive.           "...        Do not
 for a moment suppose I am unhappy.              I am occasionally dull in spirits,
  but not unhappy.        There is a hope which is an abundantly sufficient re
  medy for that    ; and as that hope does not depend on ourselves, I am bold
  enough to rejoice in that     I may have it.
      " I do not talk to
                          you  about philosophy, for I forget it all too fast to make
  it easy to talk about.      When   I have a thought worth sending you, it is in

                                                          liv
the shape of a paper before it is worth speaking of ; and after that it is
astonishing how fast I forget it again ; so that I have to read up again
and again my own recent communications, and may well fear that, as regards
others,       I   do not do them justice.                 However,   I   try     to avoid   such   subjects
as other philosophers are               working        at, and for that reason have   nothing im
portant in hand just now.                   I    have been      working hard, but nothing of value
has come of it."
   Two months later he writes to Professor Schonbein from Brighton : —
   " I am here
               sleeping, eating, and lying fallow, that  may have sufficient        I
energy to give half a dozen juvenile Christmas lectures.       The fact                                 is,
                                                                                                          I
have been working very hard for       long time to no satisfactory end. All
                                                      a
the answers        Iobtained from nature have been in the negative

though they show the truth of nature as much as affirmative answers, yet
they are not so encouraging   and so for the present am quite worn out.
                                                                                I I
                                           ;
I   wish possessed some of your points of character
          I                                             will not say which,     ;
for Ido not  know where  the list might end, and you might think me simply
absurd, and, besides that, ungrateful to providence."
                                            JEt.      61 (1853).
    Early    the year he gave
              in                 Friday discourse on observations on the Mag
                                           a
netic Force,  and he gave the last lecture of the season on MM. Boussingault,
Fremy, and Becquerel's experiments on oxygen.
   He gave five reports to the Trinity House — on          comparison of the French
                                                                        a
lens and Chance's lens            on the lightning-rods at Eddystone and Bishop's
                                   ;
Lighthouses         ;   on the ventilation of St. Catherine and the Needles Light
houses, and that at Cromer    and on fog-signals.
                                           ;                                A       Company was formed
to carry out Watson's electric light, but no trial of                       it      took place.
    In June        he sent to the Athenaeum an experimental investigation             of table-
                  At the end       he
                                                  "      must bring this long description to
moving.                                  says,    I                                                           a
close.     I      am   a   little ashamed of       it,   forI think in the present age and in
this part of the world    ought not to have been required.

                                                                     I
but I  may be allowed to say  that  cannot undertake
                                                 I    to answer such objec
tions as may be made.        state my own convictions as an experimental
                                       I
philosopher, and find   no more necessary to enter into controversy on this
                                  it
point than on any other in science (as the nature of matter, or inertia, or
the magnetization of light) on which  may differ from others.

will    decide sooner or later in              all such    cases, andI      have no doubt very soon
and correctly in the present instance."
     month later he writes to Professor Schonbein                            —
    I A
                                                                            :
    "     have not been at work                 except in turning the tables upon the table-
turners.          Nor should      I    have done that, but that so many inquiries poured
in upon me that thought    I  better to stop the inpouring flood by letting
                                          it
all know at once what my views and thoughts were. What           weak, cre                  a
dulous, incredulous, unbelieving, superstitious, bold, frightened, what                                   a

ridiculous world ours is     as far as concerns the mind     of man  !  How full of
inconsistencies,    contradictions,   and absurdities it is!  I declare that, taking
the average of many minds that have recently come before me (and apart
from that spirit which God has placed in each), and accepting for a moment
that average as a standard, I should far prefer the obedience, affections, and
instinct of a dog before it. Do not whisper this, however, to others. There
is One above who worketh in all things, and who governs even in the midst
of that   misrule to which the tendencies and powers of men are so easily
perverted."
    After this year, as Director of the Laboratory and Superintendent of the
 House, he received     £300 from the Royal Institution.
    He was made Foreign Associate of the Royal Academy of Sciences,
Turin, and Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences,
Mauritius.
                                    mt.  62 (1854).
    At the end of this year       he sent a long paper to the    Philosophical Ma
gazine on some points of magnetic philosophy.                He begins saying : —
"Within the last three years I have been bold enough, though only as
an experimentalist, to put forth new views of magnetic action in papers
having for titles, 'On Lines of Magnetic Force,' Phil. Trans. 1852; and
 'On Physical Lines of Magnetic Force,' Phil. Mag. 1862.               I propose to
call the attention of experimenters in a somewhat desultory manner to the
subject again, both as respects the deficiency of the present physical views
and the possible existence of lines of physical force."
    A course of lectures on education was given by different eminent men at
the Royal Institution.       Prince Albert came to Faraday's " Observations
of Mental Education" on the 6th of May. In reprinting them, he said,
 " They   are so immediately      connected in their nature and origin with my
own experimental life, considered either as cause or consequence, that I have
thought the close of this volume (of Researches on Chemistry and Physics)
not an unfit place for their reproduction."        He ends his lecture by saying,
" My thoughts would flow back amongst the            events and reflections   of my
past life, until  I  found nothing present itself but an open declaration —
almost a confession — as a means of performing the duty due to the subject
and to you."
    He  gave two   Friday discourses    on Electric Induction, associated   cases of
Current and Static Effects      ;  and on Magnetic Hypotheses.
   The Parliamentary Committee of the British Association applied to him
through Lord Wrottesley for his opinion whether any and what measures
could  be   adopted by the Government or the Legislature to improve the
position of science or of the cultivators of science in this country.       He an
swers : —  "I  feel unfit to give a deliberate opinion.      My course of life and
the circumstances which make it a happy one for me are not those of per
sons who conform to the usages and habits of society.           Through the kind
ness of all, from my Sovereign downwards, I have that which supplies all

                                            Ivi
my need; and in respect of honours, I have as a scientific man received
from foreign countries and sovereigns those which, belonging to very
limited and select classes, surpass in my opinion anything that it is in the
 power of my own to bestow.
         I
      " cannot say that I have not valued such distinctions ; on the contrary,
 I esteem them very highly, but I do not think I have ever worked for or
 sought them.         Even were such to be now created here, the time is passed
 when these would possess any attraction for me, and you will see therefore
 how unfit        I am, upon the strength of any personal motive or feeling, to
judge      of  what   might be influential upon the minds of others.      Neverthe
 less    I will make   one or two remarks   which have often occurred to my mind.
 .     .   .   .    A Government should,    for its own sake, honour the men who
 do honour and service to the country.          The aristocracy of the class should
 have distinctions which should be unattainable except to that of science.
       .   .    .   But, besides, the Government should, in the very many cases
 which come before it having a relation to scientific knowledge, employ men
 who pursue science, provided they are also men of business.           This is per
 haps now done to some extent, but to nothing like the degree which is
 practicable with advantage to all parties.         The right means cannot have
 occurred to a Government which has not yet learned to approach and dis
  tinguish the class as a whole."
      He sent five reports to the Trinity House, one of which, in two parts, was
  on Dr. Watson's electric light (voltaic), and on Prof. Holmes's electric light
  (magneto-electric).       The conclusion was that he could not recommend the
  electric light, that it had better be tried for other than lighthouse uses first.
  To Dr. Watson he wrote that he " could not put up in a lighthouse what
  has not been perfectly established beforehand, and is only experimental."
      He was made Corresponding Associate of the Royal Academy of Sciences,
  Naples.
                                      JEt. 63 (1855).
      His first Friday discourse was on some Points of Magnetic Philosophy
  and on Gravity.         Later he gave a discourse on Electric Conduction ; and
  another on Ruhmkorffs Induction-apparatus.
      For the Trinity House he only went to Birmingham to examine some
  apparatus of Chance's.
      This year, on the application of his friend M. Dumas, he was made Com
  mander of the Legion of Honour, and received the Grand Medal of Honour
  of the French Exhibition for his discoveries.
       He was made Honorary Member of the Imperial Society of Naturalists,
   Moscow, and Corresponding Associate of the Imperial Institute of Sciences
   of Lombardy.
                                      mt. 64 (1856).
       This year he sent to the Royal Society his last paper, Experimental Rela
   tions of Gold (and other metals) to Light.          It was read as the Bakerian
  lecture early the following year.

                                             Ivii
     " At    one  time   I had hoped that I had altered       one   coloured ray into
another by       means   of gold, which would have    been equivalent to a change    in
the    number of undulations      ; and though I have not confirmed that result as
yet, still those       I  have obtained seem to me to present a useful experi
mental entrance into certain physical investigations respecting the nature
and action of a ray of light.         I do not pretend that they are     of great value
in   their present state, but they are very suggestive, and they may save
much trouble to any experimentalist inclined to pursue and extend this line
of investigation."
     He gave two Friday discourses, the first on certain magnetic actions and
 affections    ; and the second on M. Petitjean's        process for silvering glass,
 and some observations on divided gold.
     He   gave five reports to the      Trinity House, and he entered into an en
 gagement regarding the Board of Trade Lighthouses, and made four re
 ports, two on Cape Race Lighthouse, and one on Dr. Normandy's distilled
 water-apparatus.
     He   was made Corresponding        Member of the Netherland Society of Sci
 ences, Batavia, and Member of the Imperial Royal Institute of Padua.
                                     Mt.  65 (1857).
     Two Friday discourses were given, the first on the Conservation of Force,
 and the second on the relations of Gold to Light.
     " Various circumstances," he
                                         begins,
                                                  " induce me at the present moment
 to put forth a consideration regarding the conservation of force. .
          .    .    There is no question which lies closer to the root of all
 physical knowledge than that which inquires whether force can be de
 stroyed or not                           Agreeing with those who admit the con
 servation of force to be a principle in physics as large and sure as that of
  the indestructibility of matter, or the invariability of gravity, I think that
  no particular idea of force has a right to unlimited and unqualified accep
  tance that does not include assent to it.         .  .  .  Supposing the truth of
  the principle is assented to, I come to its uses.         No hypothesis should be
  admitted nor any assertion of a fact credited that denies the principle. . . .
  The received idea of gravity appears to me to ignore entirely the principle
  of the conservation of force, and by the terms of its definition, if taken in
  an absolute sense, ' varying inversely as the square of the distance,' to be
  in direct opposition to it."
     To Mr. Barlow he writes : —
      " I   am in town, and at work        more or less every day.        My memory
  wearies me greatly in working ; for       I  cannot remember from day to day the
   conclusions I come to, and all has to be thought out many times over.             To
   write it down gives no assistance, for what is written down, is itself for
   gotten.     It is only by very slow   degrees that this state   of mental muddi-
   ness can be wrought either through         or under ; nevertheless  I  know that to
   work somewhat, is far better than to stand still, even      if nothing comes of it.

                                         Iviii
It  is better for the mind itself — not being quite sure whether              1  shall ever
end the research, and yet being sure that, if in my former state              of memory,
I could work it      out in a week or two to a successful      result."
    He gave six reports to the Trinity House.           The most important was on
Holmes's magneto-electric light, which was put up at Blackwall, and ob
served from Woolwich, and compared with a Fresnel lamp in the centre of
Bishop's lens, and also in the focus of a parabolic reflector.             He critically
examined the cost of the apparatus, the price of the light, the suppositions
regarding its intensity and advantages, and the proposition to put one up
in a lighthouse.        He agreed to its being tried at the South Foreland.
    He was made Member of the Institute of Breslau, Corresponding As
sociate of Institute      of Sciences, Venice, and Member of the Imperial
Academy, Breslau.
                                 JEt.  66  (1858).
    He   wrote a short paper on Regelation, which he sent with a           letter to Dr.
Tyndall     on Ice of irregular fusibility.    These were printed in Dr. TyndalFs
paper on some Physical Properties        of Ice   in the Philosophical Transactions
 tor this year.
    He gave two Friday discourses.        The first was remarks on Static Induc
tion ; and the other on Wheatstone's Electric Telegraph in relation to Sci
ence (being an argument in favour of the full recognition of science as a
 branch of education).
    This year Prince Albert offered him a house on Hampton Court Green.
It required repair, and he doubted whether he could afford to do it up.
    He writes to a niece : —
    " The case is settled. The Queen has desired            me to dismiss   all thoughts
of the repairs, as the house is to be put into thorough repair both inside and
 out.    The letter from Sir C. Phipps is most kind."
    To Sir C. Phipps he writes : —
    " I find it difficult to write my thanks or express my sense of the grati
tude I owe to Her Majesty ; first, for the extreme kindness which is offered
to me in the use of the house at Hampton Court, but far more for that
condescension and consideration which, in respect of personal rest and
health, was the moving cause of the offer.             I feared that I might not be
able properly to accept Her Majesty's most gracious favour.                 I would not
 bring myself     to decline  so honourable    an   otfer, and  yet I  was   constrained
 carefully to consider whether its acceptance was consistent with my own
 particular and peculiar circumstances.         The enlargement of Her Majesty's
 favour has removed all difficulty.         I accept with deep gratitude, and I
 hope   that  you   will help me to  express fitly to Her Majesty my thanks and
 feelings on this occasion."
    To M. De la Rive he thus writes on the death of Mrs. Marcet                 : —
     " Your subject interested    me deeply every way, for Mrs. Marcet was a
good    friend  to  me, as she  must  have been to many of the human race.                 I
entered the shop of a bookseller and bookbinder at the age of 1 3 in the year

                                            lix
1804, remained there eight years, and during the chief part of the time bound
books.      Now it was in those books in the hours after work that I found
the beginning of my philosophy.             There were two that especially helped
me, the 'EncyclopseliaBritannica,' from which I gained my first notions of
                                       '
electricity, and Mrs. Marcet's           Conversations on Chemistry,'      which gave
me my foundation in that science.
    " Do not                   I                        thinker, or was marked as a
                suppose that     was a very deep
precocious person.        I  was  a very lively,     imaginative person, and could
believe in the Arabian Nights as easily as in the Encyclopaedia ; but
facts were important to me and saved me.              I could trust a fact, and always
cross-examined an assertion.        So when I questioned Mrs. Marcet's book by
such little experiments as I could find means to perform, and found it true
to the facts as I could understand them, I felt that I had got hold of an
anchor in chemical knowledge, and clung fast to it. Thence my deep
veneration for Mrs. Marcet : first, as one who had conferred great per
sonal good and pleasure on me, and then as one able to convey the truth
and principle of those boundless fields of knowledge which concern natural
things to the young, untaught, and inquiring mind.
    " You
             may imagine my delight when I came to know Mrs. Marcet
personally ; how often I cast my thoughts backwards, delighting to con
nect the past and the present        ;   how often, when sending a paper to her
as a thank-offering,    I thought of my first instructress; and such like thoughts
will remain with      me.
    "I   have some such thoughts even as regards your own father, who was,
 I  may say, the first who personally, at Geneva, and afterwards by corre
spondence, encouraged, and by that sustained me."
     He  made twelve reports to the      Trinity House.       The most important was
 on the    electric light at the South Foreland.         He went there, with   a Com
 mittee of the Trinity House, to see it from sea and land.              The light was
in the centre of the Fresnel apparatus, in the upper light, as a fixed light,
 and   so comparable with the lower fixed light, which consisted of oil-
 lamps in reflectors.      They went to the Varne light-ship.          The upper was
 generally inferior to the lower light. Next morning they went to the light
 house,   and examined it by day and also at night.
     He   was made     Corresponding      Member of the Hungarian Academy           of
 Sciences,   Pesth.
                                    m.     67 (1859).
    He gave two Friday discourses on Schonbein'sOzone and Antozone; and on
 Phosphorescence, Fluorescence, &c.             He sent eleven reports to the Trinity
 House, and one to the Board of Trade.              On the 28th of March, the mag
 neto-electric light was again exhibited at the South Foreland.            On the 20th
 of April he went to sea to examine it.          " The upper light," he says, " is far
 superior to the lower light ; the electric light very fine." He visited the
 lighthouse ; he found new lamps by Duboscq, and silvered reflectors be
  hind.    He writes : — " As a light unexceptionable ; as electric light won

                                                       lx
derful."   He had before drawn up instructions to lighthouse keepers and
pilot cutters ; and on the 29th of April he reports the sufficiency of the
light as established.
    He reported this year on Way's mercurial electric light ; the one advan
tage it had was that the place of the light was unchangeable.
    He was one of a Commission appointed to consider the subject of light
ing public galleries by gas ; and he reported favourably on the experimental
attempt at the Sheepshanks Gallery.
    To Mr. Barlow he writes from Hampton Court : — " As            have been            I
out here with only runs into town, I really know very little of what
is going on there, and what I learn I forget.        The Senate of the Uni
versity accepted  and  approved   of the report  of the Committee for Scien
tific Degrees ; so that that will go forward (if the Government ap
prove), and will come into work next year.   It seems to give much satis
faction to all who have seen                   it,
                                though the subject     beset with difficul  is
ties ; for when the depth and breadth of science came to be considered,
and an estimate was made                      of how much        a   man ought to know to obtain
a   right to    a     degree     in   it,   the amount in words seemed           to be so enormous
as to make me hesitate    in demanding     from the student it     and though       ;
in the D.S. one could divide the matter and claim eminence in one branch
of science rather than good general knowledge in all, still in the B.S., which
is  a   progressive         more extended, though
                            degree,     a               more superficial ac
                                                                          a
quaintance seemed to be required.       In fact the matter      so new, and        is
there   so little that can serve as previous experience in the founding and
          is
arranging these degrees, that one must leave the whole endeavour to shape
itself as the practice and experience accumulates."
                                               JEt.   68   (1860).
     Hegave two Friday discourses on Lighthouse Illumination by the Elec
tric Light   and on the Electric Silk-loom.
                ;
     He            reports to the Trinity House, and he examined three
          gave eleven
Red-Sea lighthouses for the Board of Trade.   On the 13th of February he
went to Dover, but was prevented by snow from reaching the lighthouse                            ;
on the 17th he tried again, and on the 28th he gave his final report
on the practicability and utility of the magneto-electric light. He says,
"Hope          it   will   be On the 14th of March the magneto-electric
                                applied."
light was proposed for Dungeness.     On the 21st he gives his reply, and
says  there  no difficulty.
                    is
   He was appointed with Sir Roderick Murchison to report upon the
means of preserving the stonework of the new Palace at Westminster.
   At Christmas he gave his last course of juvenile lectures on the chemical
history of candle.
                a
   He was made Foreign Associate of the Academy of Sciences, Pesth, and
Honorary Member of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow.

     He resumed the office of Elder in his Church in the autumn, and in little
more than three years and a half he finally resigned it.
                                       JEt.    69 (1861).
     He   gave  Friday discourses on Platinum, and on Warren De La Rue's
Photographic Eclipse results.
    He gave ten reports to the Trinity House.                The most important work
 was a visit on 31st of October to Dungeness, to see the new magneto-electric
lamps, the machines, and the steam-engines. He drew up forms of observa
tions to be made        at Dungeness,        at other lighthouses,       and by the pilot
cutters.
    To Prof. Schonbein he writes         : — " You   really startle me with your inde
pendent antozone. . . . Surely you must hold it in your hand like a little
struggler ; for, if I understand you rightly, it must be a far more abundant
body than caesium.         For the hold you have already obtained over it I con
gratulate you, as     I  would do   if  you had obtained a crown, and more than
for a new metal.        But surely these wonderful conditions of existence cannot
be confined to oxygen alone.            I am waiting to hear that you have disco
vered like parallel states with iodine, or bromine, or hydrogen, and nitro
gen — what of nitrogen 1 is not its apparent quiet simplicity of action all
a  sham? not a sham, indeed        ;   but still not the only state in which it can
exist.     If the compounds which a body can form show something of the
state and powers it may have when isolated, then what should nitrogen be
in its separate state 1 You see             I do not work ; I cannot ; but          I   fancy,
and stuff my letters with such fancies (not a fit return) to you."
    In another letter he says, " I am still dull, stupefied, and forgetful.                   I
wish a discovery would         turn   up    with  me,  that   I  might  answer     you in a
decent,    respectable way ; but it will not."
    Still later he says : — " I look forward to your new results with great
interest ; but   I  am becoming more and more timid when I strive to collate
hypotheses relating to the chemical constitution of matter.                  I cannot help
thinking    sometimes    whether  there    is not some  state   or condition   of which our
present notions give us very little idea, and which yet would reveal to us a
flood,   a  world of real knowledge, — a world of facts available both by prac
tical application and their illustrations of first principles ; and yet I cannot
shape the idea into a definite form, or reach it by any trial facts that                 I can
devise ; and that being the case, I drop the attempt and imagine that all
the preceding thought has just been a dreaminess and no more ; and so
there is an end of     it."
    In October    he  wrote to the Managers of the Institution             : — " It  is   with
the deepest feeling that I address you.                I entered the Royal Institu
tion in March 1813, nearly forty-nine years ago, and, with exception of
a comparatively short period, during which I was abroad on the continent
with Sir    H. Davy, have      been    with you     ever   since.    During that time        I
have been most happy in your kindness, and in the fostering care which

                                             Ixii
 the Royal Institution has bestowed upon me. Thank God, first, for all his
 gifts.    I have next to thank you and your predecessors for the unswerving
 encouragement and support which you have given me during that period.
 My life    has been   a happy      one, and all I desired.     During its progress I
 have tried to make        a  fitting return for it to the Royal Institution, and
 through it to science.       But the progress of years (now amounting in num
 ber to threescore and ten) having brought forth first the period of deve
 lopment, and then that of maturity, have ultimately produced for me that
 of gentle decay.      This has taken place in such a manner as to make the
 evening of life a blessing ; for whilst increasing physical weakness occurs,
 a full share of health free from pain is granted with it, and whilst me
 mory and certain other faculties of the mind diminish, my good spirits
 and cheerfulness do not diminish with them.
     " Still I  am   not able to do as       I  have done.    I am not competent    to
 perform as     I  wish the delightful duty of teaching in the Theatre of the
 Royal   Institution,   and I now ask you (in consideration for me) to accept
 my resignation of the juvenile lectures.           Being unwilling to give up what
 has always been so      kindly received and      so pleasant to myself, I have tried
 the faculties essential                                           I
                            for their delivery, and I know that ought to retreat ;
 for the attempt to realize (in those trials) the necessary points brings with
 it weariness, giddiness, fear of failure, and the full conviction that it is
 time to retire   ; I desire therefore to lay down this duty.        I may truly sav
 that such has been the pleasure of the occupation to me, that my regret
 must be greater than yours need or can be.
    " And    this reminds me that       I ought to place in your hands the whole
 of my occupation. It is no doubt true that the juvenile lectures, not being
 included in my engagement as professor, were when delivered by me un
 dertaken as an extra duty, and remunerated by an extra payment.                 The
 duty of research, superintendence of the house, and of other services
 still remains ; but I may well believe that the natural change which incapaci
 tates me from lecturing,      may also make me unfit for some of these. In such
 respects,   however,   I will  leave you to judge, and to say whether it is your
 wish that I should still remain as part of the Royal Institution.             I am,
gentlemen, with all my heart, your faithful and devoted servant."
                                                            "
    Shortly afterwards he wrote to the Secretary : — You know my feelings,
in regard to the exceedingly kind manner in which the Board of Managers
received my letter, and you therefore can best convey to them my deep
thanks on this occasion.           Please do this for me.       Nothing would make
me happier      in the things of this life than to make some scientific discovery
or development, and by that to justify the Board in their desire to retain
me in my position here."
    Sir Emerson Tennant wished Mr. Faraday to witness the phenomena
produced by Mr. Home.              Mr. Faraday says, in his reply, " You will see
that I consent to all this with much reserve and only for your sake."         Three
days afterwards Sir E. Tennant says,            "  As Mr. Home's wife is dying, the

                                             Ixiii
probability       is that the meeting, at which      I wished you       to be present, on
the 24th may not take place.             From the same cause I am unable to see
Mr.     Home       previously,  or  to make    the inquiries of himself necessary to
satisfy the queries in your letter."
     He was made Honorary Member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh.
                                       m.    70   (1862).
     On the 20th of June he gave his last Friday discourse, on Gas furnaces.
     He gave seventeen reports to the Trinity House, and two to the Board
of   Trade.       The most important of the Trinity House reports were still on
the magneto-electric light.           On the 12th of February          he went to  Dunge-
ness, examined the engine-room, the machines, the lanthorn, the lamps, and
the photometric effects.           The keepers he examined, and found them not
intelligent enough.           At night he went to sea, testing at five miles off the
 effects of oil-lamp reflectors and the electric light, Prof. Holmes himself
 being in charge of the lamps for the trials.              Then he went to the Varne
 floating-light, and compared Dungeness, Grisnez, and the South Foreland
 lights. In the morning he went to Dover to examine the upper South
 Foreland new hydrostatic lamp ; and, in the course of the year, the dif
 ferent observations         made at South Foreland,        Varne,  Dungeness, and the
 pilot-cutters had to be considered and reported on.                The House of Com
 mons this year called for copies of his reports on the magneto-electric light
 to be printed.         At the International Exhibition he saw Berlio's magneto-
 electric machine and light, and he reported on the construction of it.
     This year he was examined at great length by the Public School Com
  missioners.        His most important     answers were      these  : — " that the natu
  ral knowledge which had been given to the world in such abundance during
  the last fifty years, I may say, should remain untouched, and that no suf
  ficient attempt should be made to convey it to the young mind, growing
  up and obtaining its first views of these things, is to me a matter so strange
  that  I   find it difficult to understand     ;  though I think I see the opposition
  breaking away, it is yet a very hard one to be overcome. That it ought to be
  overcome I have not the least doubt in the world."               In answer to the ques
  tion at what age it might be serviceable to introduce the physical sciences,
  he says, " I think one can hardly tell that until after experience for some
  few years.        All I  can say is this, that at my     Juvenile Lectures,   at  Christ
  mas time,     I   have never found a   child   too young to understand intelligently
  what    I  told him   :  they came to me afterwards with questions which proved
  their capability."
      Again     he   says,
                            " I do think that the study of natural science is so
  glorious a school for the mind, that with the laws impressed on all created
  things by the Creator, and the wonderful unity and stability of matter and
  the forces of matter, there cannot be a better school for the education of
  the mind."
      In September he wrote his last letter             to   Prof. Schonbein    ;  he says,

                                           Ixiv
 " Again   and again I tear up my letters, for I write nonsense.           I cannot
 spell or write a line continuously.          Whether   I shall recover this confu
 sion, do not know.       I will not write any more. My love to you."
    The Duke of Devonshire at his installation would have the University of
 Cambridge confer the degree of LL.D. on Faraday.                 He was also made
Knight Commander of the Order of St. Maurice and Lazarus, Italy.
                                    Mt.  71  (1863).
    He  made twelve reports to the      Trinity House.     In February he was again
at Dungeness examining a new optic apparatus, and           comparing the reflectors
with the electric light, and new and old apparatus.           He reported on the ob
servations regarding the magneto-electric light, and on a French applica
tion to the Board of Trade about the magneto-electric light.
    To the Registrar of the London University he wrote : — " Many of your
recent summonses have brought so vividly to my mind the progress of time
in taking from me the power of obeying their call, that I have at last re
solved to ask you to lay before the Senate my desire to relinquish my sta
tion and render up that trust of duty which I can no longer perform with
satisfaction either to myself or to others.
    " The position of    a Senator is one that should not be    held by an inactive
man to the exclusion of an active one.          It has rejoiced my heart to see the
progress of the University and of education under its influence and power ;
and that delight I hope to have so long as life shall be spared to me."
    He was made Foreign Associate of the Imperial Academy of Medicine,
 Paris.
                                    Mt. 72 (1864).
    Twelve reports were made between January and October to the Trinity
House.       One was on a new magneto-electric machine ; another on draw
ings, proposals, and estimates for the magneto-electric light at Portland. He
made seven examinations of white and red leads, and two examinations of
waters from Orfordness and the Fog-gun station, Lundy Island ; and he
reported on two 4th-order lights for the River Gambia.
    He replied to an invitation of the Messrs. Davenport : — " I am obliged
by your courteous invitation ; but really I have been so disappointed by the
manifestations to which my notice has at different times been called, that
I  am not encouraged to give any more attention to them, and therefore
I leave  these to which you refer in the hands of the Professors of Legerde
main.     If spirit communications, not utterly worthless, should happen to
start into activity,   I will leave the spirits to find out for themselves how
they can move my attention.          I am tired of them."
    A few weeks    later he replied to another different invitation : —
    " Whenever     the spirits can counteract gravity or originate motion, or
supply  an   action  due to natural physical force, counteract any such action, —
whenever they can pinch or prick me, or affect my sense of feeling or any
other sense, or in any other way act on me without my waiting on them, or,

                                          Ixv
  working in the light, can show me a hand, either writing or not, or in any
  way make themselves visibly manifest to me — whenever these things are
  done, or anything which a conjuror cannot do better, or, rising to higher
  proofs, whenever the spirits describe their own nature, and, like honest spi
  rits, say what they can do, or pretending,     as their supporters do, that they
  can act on ordinary matter whenever they initiate action, and so make
  themselves    manifest, — whenever by such-like signs they come to me and
  ask my attention to them, I will give it. But until some of these things
  be done,   I have no more time to spare     for them or their believers, or for
  correspondence about them."
      At the end of the year he was asked by Mr. Cole to be a Vice-President
  of the Albert Hall. He replied : — " I have just returned from Brighton, to
  which place my doctor had sent me under nursing care.           Hence the delay
  in answering your letter, for I was unaware of it until my return.         Now,
  as to my acceptance     of the honour you propose to me.       With my rapidly
 failing faculties, ought I to accept it ? You shall decide.       Remember that
  I  was obliged   to  decline lecturing before Her Majesty and the Royal
 Family at Osborne ; that I have declined and am declining the Presidency
 of the Royal Society, the Royal Institution, and other bodies ; declaring
 myself unfit to undertake any reponsibility or duty even in the smallest
 degree.     Would it not therefore be inconsistent to allow my name to
 appear amongst those of the effectual men who delight, as I should
 have done under other circumstances, to honour in every way the me
 mory of our most gracious and regretted leader? These are my diffi
 culties. It is only the name and the remembrance of His Royal High
 ness which would have moved me from a long-taken           resolution."
     Mr. Cole decided, "without a moment's doubt," that he was to be             a
 Vice-President.
     To a friend he writes : — " I find myself less and less fit for communi
 cation with society, even in a meeting of family — brothers and sisters.        I
 cannot keep pace in recollection with the conversation, and so have to
 sit silent and taciturn.      Feeling this condition of things, I keep myself
out of the way of making an exposure of myself."
     He was    made   Foreign   Associate of the Royal Academy        of Sciences,
Naples.
                                  Mt.  73 (1865).
     He  made   his last report   for the  Trinity House in May this year      on
St. Bees Light.
    He wrote to the Deputy Master : — " I write to put myself plainly be
fore you in respect of the matter about which I called two days ago.
At the request of the then Deputy Master I joined the Trinity House
in February 1836, now near upon thirty years since. I find that time has
had its usual effect upon me, and that I have lost the power of remem
bering and also of other sorts, and     I desire to relieve my mind.     Can this
    vol. xvii.                                                         e

                                          Ixvi
be done     without my retiring altogether,        and can you help      me in this
matter?"
     In looking back to his work for the Trinity House, going down to           ana
lyses of cottons, oils, paints, and waters, and recalling his words "that
j6200 a year is quite enough in itself, but not if it is to be the indicator of
the character of the appointment," one is rejoiced to find that he received
the highest reward which the scientific man can obtain.         After himself test
ing the results by the most complete and searching trials, he was able to
 recommend that his own grandest discovery should be applied to
                                                                                " the
 great object of guiding the mariner across the dark and dreary waste of
 waters."
     To the Managers of the Royal Institution he wrote, March 1 : —
      " Unless it be that as I get older I become more infirm in mind, and
 consequently more timid and unsteady, and so less confident in your warm
 expressions, I might, I think, trust more surely in your resolution of the
 2nd of December, 1861, and in the reiterated verbal assurances of your
 kind Secretary than I do ; but I become from year to year more shaken
 in mind, and feel less able to take any responsibility on me.        I wish, there
 fore, to retire from the position of Superintendent of the house and labo
 ratories.     That which has in times past been my chiefest pleasure has now
  become a very great anxiety ; and I feel a growing inability to advise on
 the policy of the Institution, or to be the one referred to on questions both
  great and small as to the management of the house.
      " In a former letter, when laying down the juvenile lectures, mentioned
                                                                        I
  ' that other duties, such as research, superintendence of the house, and
  other services still remain ;' but I then feared that I might be found unfit
  for them   ;  I am now persuaded that this is the case.       If under  these cir
  cumstances you may think that with the resignation of the positions         I have
  thus far filled the rooms I occupy should be at liberty, I trust that you
  will feel no difficulty in letting me leave them ; for the good of the Institution
  is my chief desire in the whole of this action.        Permit me to sign myself
  personally, your dear, indebted, and grateful friend."
      " Resolved unanimously —
      "That the Managers thank            Professor Faraday for the scrupulous
  anxiety   which   he has  now   and ever  shown to act in every respect for the
  good of the Royal Institution.        They are most unwilling that he should
  feel that the cares     of the laboratories and the house weigh upon him.
  They beg that he will undertake only so much of the care of the house as
   may be agreeable to himself, and that whilst relinquishing the duties of
   '
     Director of the laboratory,' he will retain his home at the Royal In
   stitution."
       Sir David Brewster sent him a pamphlet on the Invention and Intro
   duction of the Dioptric Lights, and asked him to give his opinion on the
   value and importance of these lights. He replied : — "      ....  I would rather
   not enter as an arbitrator or judge into the matter, for I have of late been

                                              Ixvii
resigning all my functions as one incompetent to take up such matters,
and the Royal Institution as well as the Trinity House have so far accepted
them as to set me free from all anxiety of thought in respect to them.                     In
fact my memory          is gone,   and  I  am   obliged  to refrain   from reading argu
mentative matter or from judging of it.               I am very thankful for their ten
derness in      the   matter ; and   if it please Providence to continue me a year or
two in this life,      I hope  to bear the decree patiently.         My time for contend
 ing   for temporal        honours    is at an end,       whether it be for myself or
others."
    In the fine summer at Hampton Court he sat in his window delighting
 in the clouds and the holiday-people on the green.                        A friend from
 London asked how he was.                 "Just waiting," he replied. This he more
 fully  said    in  a  note.    " I  bow    before him who is Lord of all, and hope
 to keep waiting* patiently for His time and mode of releasing me ac
cording to His divine word, and the great and precious promises whereby
 His people are made partakers of the divine nature."
    To Sir James South, who wished to have some account of Anderson's
 services, Faraday wrote : — " Whilst endeavouring to fulfil your wishes in re
 lation to my old companion, Mr. Anderson,                   I         I
                                                                think cannot do better
 than accompany some notes which he has himself drawn up and had printed,
 by some remarks of mine, which will show how and how long he has been
 engaged     here.
     " He   came to assist in the glass house for the service of science in Septem
 ber   1827,    where he remained working until about 1830.               Then for a while
 he was 'retained by myself.             In 1 832 he was in the service of the Royal
 Institution, and paid by it. From that time to the present he has remained
 with that body, and has obtained their constant approbation.                    In January
  1842 they raised his pay to £100 per annum with praise.                     In 1847 they
 raised it   in  like  manner   to  £1  10.    For  the same   reason  in 1853    they raised
 it to £120 ; and in 1860, in a minute, of which I think Mr. Anderson
 has no copy, they say that, in consideration of his now lengthened services
 and the diligence exhibited by him, they are of opinion that his salary
 should be raised to £130.
     " Mr.    Anderson still remains with us, and is in character what he has
 ever been.        He and I are companions in years and in work and in the
 Royal    Institution.       Mr. Brande's testimony when he left the Institution
 is to the    same purport as the others.           Mr. Anderson was 75 years of age
 on the    12th    of last month    (January). He is a widower, but has a daughter
 keeping his house for him.             We wish him not to come to the Royal Insti
 tution,   save when he is well enough           to make it a pleasure     ;  but he seems
 to be happy being so employed."
                                        Mt.   74  (1866).
     Early in January Anderson died. Sir James South wished some monu
 ment to be put up to him, and wrote to Faraday.                             He replied: —
                                                                                e 2

                                      Ixviii
"My     dear old friend,  I would fain write to you, but, indeed, write to
no one, and have now a burn on the fingers of my right hand which
adds to my trouble ; so that I still use my dear J.'s hand as one better
than my own, and fear I give her great work by so doing.                    She has,
I understand, written to you this morning, and told you how averse I
am   to meddling with sepulchral honours in any case.               I shall mention
your good will to Anderson" [here Faraday took the pen, because his niece
made some objection to the words       "  mention the good will to Anderson,"
who was dead] ;   " but I tell them what are my feelings.          I have told seve
ral what may be my own desire ; to have a plain simple funeral, attended
by none but my own relatives, followed by a gravestone of the most ordi
nary kind, in the simplest earthly place.
   "As   death draws nigh to old men or people, this world disappears, or
should become of little importance.                                    I
                                            It is so with me ; but cannot say
it simply to others [here he stopped his writing, and his niece finished the
note], for  I cannot write it as I would.         Yours, dear old friend, whilst
permitted."
   The Society of Arts this summer gave him a medal for his scientific dis
coveries.
   During the winter   he became very feeble      in all muscular power. Almost
the last interest he   showed in scientific things was in a Holtz electric
machine.
   In the spring, for a short time, with decreasing power, there was at
times wandering of mind.      One day he fancied he had made some disco
very somehow related to Pasteur's dextro- and laevo-racemic acid.             He de
sired the traces of it to be carefully preserved,     for  " it might be a glorious
discovery."
   His loss of power became more and more plain during the summer and
autumn and winter : all the actions of the body were carried on with diffi
culty ; he was scarcely able to move ; but his mind continually overflowed
with the consciousness of the affectionate       care of those dearest to him.
                                JEt.   75  (1867).
   At times he could hardly speak        a word,    and with difficulty swallow a
mouthful.
   In the spring he went to Hampton Court.            Gradually he became more
and more torpid, and on the 25th of August he died there.
   He said of himself, " In early life I was a very lively imaginative person,
who could believe in the Arabian Nights as easily as in the Encyclopaedia.
But facts were importaut to me and saved me.                 I  could trust a fact."
And so afterwards this blacksmith's son from Jacob's Well Mews, full of
inborn religion, and gentleness, genius, and energy, searched for and trusted
to facts in his experimental researches,       and thus left to science a monu
ment of himself that may be compared even to that of Newton.
                                                                         H. B. J.

                                           lxix
     On the      11th   of December,      1781, at Jedburgh,    was  born  David
Brewster,          who, having made a telescope when only 10 years of age,
and     having entered on his university course at 12, devoted one of the
longest of lives to discoveries in optics, and at last, laden with academic
and     scientific  honours, sank peacefully to rest on the 10th of February,
 1868.
     He   was one   of four brothers, all educated for the Church of Scotland,
 and he advanced to the position of a licentiate ; but a certain nervousness
 in speaking and delicacy of health, combined with an overpowering love
 for  scientific pursuits, led him to decline a good presentation, and to aban
 don the clerical profession for that of an expounder of natural philosophy.
 Thus he entered on a career of investigation and literary work which for
 magnitude,      as well as importance, has rarely been rivalled.
     As an editor, he commenced in 1 808 a work so large that it occupied
  him for twenty-two years — the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia ; and in the
 mean time he began with Professor Jameson the Edinburgh Philosophical
 Journal, and subsequently the Edinburgh Journal of Science ; and from
  1832 he was one of the editors of the Philosophical Magazine.         Through
 out his connexion with these periodicals he was a frequent contributor of
 original articles to their pages, and he continued to the last to write for the
 North British and other Reviews in a style so polished and so vigorous,
 that multitudes learnt from him the actual state of scientific questions who
 would never have read a merely learned dissertation.
     But his fame rests not so much on this literary work as on his original
  researches, which were so numerous that the ' Catalogue of Scientific
  Papers' now being published by the Royal Society contains the titles of 299
  papers by him, besides five in which his name is conjoined with those of
  other investigators.     And these researches, though principally connected
  with the phenomena of light, spread over many other departments of human
  knowledge.
     Ncr   were Brewster's    labours for the advancement of science confined to
  the laboratory and the desk.        In 1821 he founded the Scottish Society of
  Arts, and in 1831 he was one of the small party of friends who instituted
  the British Association, in the meetings of which he usually took a promi
  nent part.
     During this time honours steadily flowed in upon him.          He was made
  an honorary M.A. of Edinburgh in 1800, and seven years afterwards an
  honorary LL.D. of Aberdeen.           From 1838 to 1859 he was Principal of
  the United Colleges of St. Salvador and St. Leonard's at the University of
  St. Andrews ; and for the last eight years of his life he held the same im
  portant office in the leading University of Scotland.
     Having been chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1808,
  Sir David acted for a long time as its Secretary, and he was President at
  the time of his death.       In 1815  he obtained both the Copley Medal    and

the Fellowship of our Society ; and this was followed three years after
wards by the Rumford Medal, and subsequently by one of the Royal
Medals ; and, singularly enough, in each case for discoveries concerning the
Polarization      of Light.         In 1816 the French Institute awarded him a
pecuniary prize,       and     nine   years afterwards he became a Corresponding
Member of that body; while in 1849 there was conferred upon him the
distinguished honour of being chosen one of the eight Foreign Associates of
the Academy of Sciences.
    It would be tedious to enumerate his other honours from learned bodies
at home and abroad          ;  suffice it to add that he was made a Chevalier    of the
Prussian Order of Merit, and was knighted by his sovereign in 1832.
    Sir David    was twice married        : first to the daughter of James Macpher-
son,   M.P., of Belleville,        the translator of Ossian, and afterwards to Jane
Kirk, second daughter of the late Thomas Purnell, Esq., of Scarborough.
    To give any     adequate      idea of the discoveries made known in those scien
tific papers which Sir David Brewster published every two or three months
for sixty years, would be a task of gigantic magnitude.              There seem to be
thirty papers by him in our Transactions, principally in the earlier part of
his career, and, with two exceptions, they are all on optical subjects.              In
1813 he commenced with a communication
                                                       " On some Properties of Light,"
and in the two succeeding years our Society published for him no less than
nine papers — on the polarization of light by oblique transmission, by its
passage through        unannealed glass, by simple pressure, or by reflection, and
on the optical properties of mother-o'-pearl, on calcareous spar.             The phe
nomena of double         refraction     were   indeed treated of in several subsequent
papers    ;  but  there   is  a  gap  between    1819 and 1829, when he wrote on the
periodical colours produced by grooved surfaces, investigated elliptic polari
zation by metals, and reverted to the optical nature of the crystalline lens.
Two papers, one on the Diamond and the other on the Colours of Thin
Plates,     terminate    this series in 1841      ; and the only paper he afterwards
sent to our Transactions was one in conjunction with Dr. Gladstone on the
Lines of the Solar Spectrum. But there seems never to have been any long
intermission in his researches on light ; for he was constantly sending com
munications on this subject to the Royal Society of Edinburgh or some
other learned body, or to the various scientific serials with which he was
connected.        Thus in the first Number of the Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal      we  find two papers from his pen, the first on new optical and
mineralogical structure exhibited in certain specimens of Apophyllite and
other minerals, the second on the Phosphorescence of Minerals.
    It was as a laborious         observer and ingenious experimenter that he ex
celled  ;   he cared rather to collect a multitude of facts than to deduce from
them general laws.            Wonderful proofs of perseverance are his Tables of
refractive    indices,  of    dispersive powers, and of the polarizing angles of va
rious reflecting bodies ; and he seems to have submitted to optical exami

                                        Ixxi
nation every mineral that came in his way.          Frequently one of these sub
stances would form the subject of a monograph, as diamond, or amber, the
double cyanide of platinum and magnesium, the felspar of Labrador with
its changeable tints, or Glauberite with its one axis of double refraction for
the violet, and two axes for the red ray.       The prismatic spectrum arrested
his attention, and in 1834 he announced the absorption of certain rays by
 the earth's atmosphere, and by nitrous gas ; while eight years afterwards
he pointed out the existence of luminous lines in certain flames correspond
ing to those defective in the light of the sun ; but he missed the beautiful
explanation of Kirchhoff.      He also investigated the phenomena of diffrac
tion and dichroism, and of late years exhibited to the British Association
the tints of a soap-bubble, or of decomposing glass rendered still more lively
 by being viewed through a microscope.          Indeed his last legacy to science
 was a paper on Film forms.
     The  best monument to his fame is perhaps his investigation      of polarized
 light.    Malus had first set foot on this domain, but his premature death
 left it open to the entrance of Brewster, and what wonderful regions did he
 explore ! It not unfrequently happened that some other philosopher, with
 perhaps a profounder knowledge of mathematics, stepped in and deduced
 important laws ; but sometimes he himself arrived at the higher generali
 zations ; as, for instance, may be cited that of the refractive index of a sub
 stance being the tangent    of its polarizing    angle.   But he was not always
 fortunate in his theories ; thus his ingenious view of solar light, as composed
 of three primary colours (red, yellow, and blue) forming coincident spectra
 of equal length, has been shown to be completely fallacious.        Yet he never
 abandoned his theory ; a fact which we are disposed to attribute, not to a
  want of conscientious truthfulness,    but rather to an inability to appreciate
  the real bearing of an argument, and to an over confidence in his own
  memory and the testimony of his senses.
     During his optical investigations Sir David often turned from the phe
 nomena seen to the organ of sight, and experimented on that wonderful eye
  which saw bands in the red rays less refrangible than Fraunhofer's A. Of
  late years especially he examined the functions of the retina, the foramen
  centrale, and the choroid coat of the eye of animals ; he wrote several
  papers on the musca volitantes, and explained many peculiarities of single
  and binocular vision, and not a few optical illusions.
     While pursuing these researches on light, he made frequent excursions
  into other regions of science ; he discovered fluids in the cavities of some
  of the minerals he was examining, and these must be investigated ; he
  wrote much on the mean temperature of the globe ; his attention was
  attracted at one time to fossil bones from Ava, at another to the varnish-
  trees of India ; while systems of double stars, and the pyro-electricity of
   minerals shared the notice of his comprehensive mind.
      As an inventor of new apparatus Brewster also acquired no little renown.
   His first paper on this subject appears to have       been
                                                               " Some  remarks on

                                          Ixxii
  Achromatic Eyepieces" in Nicholson's Journal for 1806 ; and seven years
  afterwards he published a separate " Treatise on new Philosophical Instru
  ments for various purposes in the Arts and Sciences."            In 1816, while
  repeating some experiments of Biot with a glass trough, he noticed that
  peculiar method of reflection which is the principle of the Kaleidoscope; and
  no sooner was this pretty instrument before the public than it became
  marvellously popular, and that not only as a toy for old and young, but
  large expectations were raised of its usefulness to the artist and designer of
  patterns. We are also indebted to him for many other ingenious contri
  vances  for micrometers, burning-glasses, &c., and his writings frequently
 contained the germs of future inventions.          Hence it is not easy to deter
 mine his precise share of merit in such appliances as the lenticular stereo
 scope, or the polyzonal lenses used in lighthouses.       In regard to the latter,
 however, it may be safely maintained that while the chief credit of elaborating
 the dioptric system of illumination must be given to Fresnel, the persistent
 advocacy of Brewster materially contributed to its adoption on the shores of
 our own island.
     In addition to the treatises already mentioned he wrote several distinct
 works of a biographical character : — the Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton,
 Euler's Letters and Life, and the Martyrs of Science, viz. Galileo, Tycho
 Brahe, and Kepler.        Nor must be omitted his letters on Natural Magic,
 and his ' More Worlds than One, the Creed of the Philosopher, and the
 Hope of the Christian.'
     Sir David's anonymous writings were nearly as numerous as those to
 which his name was attached, and they spread over a wider range of sub
jects.    The elaborate treatises on Optics in the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia
 and in the recent editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica are both from his
 pen, and to each he contributed the articles on Hydrodynamics and Elec
 tricity.   In the older work he also wrote on Astronomy,         Mechanics,  Mi
 croscopy, and Burning instruments, while in the later work he turned his
 attention among other subjects to that of photography.
     To the Edinburgh Review he contributed twenty-eight articles, which
 are comprised between the Nos.        LVII.    and  LXXXI.     They include bio
 graphical notices of such men as Davy and Watt ; reviews of such philoso
                                   '
 phical works as Whewell's           History and Philosophy of the Inductive
                                  '
 Sciences,' Mrs. Somerville's        Connexion of the    Physical Sciences,' Lord
                 '
 Brougham's        Discourse  on the Study of Natural Philosophy,' and even
             '                         '
 Compte's      Philosophie Positive : they pass from Buckland's Geology or
 Daguerre's photogenic drawings to the lighter subjects of deer-stalking or
salmon-fishing ; they follow Sir James Ross or Sir George Back in their
arctic researches, and describe the British lighthouse system or the phe
nomena of thunder-storms.
    To the Quarterly Review he seems to have contributed five articles, and
in them he gives his estimate of works by Babbage, Herschel, and Aber-
crombie ; while the subjects he treats are as wide apart as the production

                                         Izziii
of sound,      and the analysis of the intellectual powers, the supposed decline
of science     in England, and the philosophy of apparitions.
   ' Meliora ' and the Foreign Review each contain two articles from his
                                                                              pen,
one in the latter being a notice of Dutrochet's ' Observations sur Endos-
mose et Exosmose.'
     But it   was in the North British Review that the longest series of articles
appeared.        We have a list before us of seventy-six in the first thirty-nine
parts of that quarterly serial, and we doubt whether the enumeration is
complete.        This shows that, on an average, Sir David wrote two of these
literary productions for each part, and suggests the idea that he must have
reviewed every book of note that he read.          The first Number of the North
British commences with an article by him on Flourens's 'Eloge Historique
de Cuvier ;' and further on in the same part he discusses the ' Lettres Pro
            '
vinciates and other writings of Blaise Pascal.          In the second Number he
describes the Earl of Rosse's great reflecting telescope ; and shortly we find
him engaged with such serious works as Humboldt's ' Cosmos ' or Mur-
chison's ' Siluria.' The rival claimants for the honour of having discovered
                                                       '
Neptune divide his attention with Macaulay's             History of England,' or
the '.Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.'         With Layard he takes
his readers to Nineveh, with Lyell he visits North America, and with Ri
chardson he searches the Polar seas.          The Exhibition of 1851, the Peace
Congress, and the British Association come in turn under his descriptive
notice ; or, turning from large assemblies to individual philosophers, he
sketches Arago, Young, or Dalton.               In one Number we have " The
                                         "
Weather and its Prognostics," and The Microscope and its Revelations ;"
elsewhere he describes the Atlantic telegraph, whilst in a single article he
groups together
                       " the life-boat, the lightning-conductor, and the light
house." He reviews in turn Mary Somerville's ' Physical Geography,'
and Keith Johnston's ' Physical Atlas ;' the History of Photography
engages him at one time, and at another Weld's History of our Society.
Under the guidance of Sir Henry Holland he investigates the curious
mental phenomena of mesmerism and electro-biology, and under that of
George Wilson he inquires into colour-blindness.            He criticises Goethe's
scientific works, expounds De la Rive's ' Treatise on Electricity,' and
Arago's on Comets ; or, turning from these severer studies, he allows Hum
boldt to exhibit the ' Aspects of Nature in different lands to the multi
                                                '
farious readers of the Review.
    In addition to all this Sir David issued some pamphlets of a personal
nature — controversial writings which some objected to as unnecessarily per
sistent, though it should be recorded to his honour that he was ready to
profit by friendly remonstrance.
    Few of his living companions will remember this Nestor in science
otherwise than as a venerable form full of vivacity and intelligence,
 keenly alive not to physical questions alone, but to the various social, politi-

    Charles Giles Bridle Daubeny*                  was born      February 11, 1795, at
 Stratton in Gloucestershire, third son of the Rev. James Daubeny, entered
Winchester School in 1 808, and was elected to a demyship in Magdalen
 College, Oxford, in 1810.             In 1814, at the age of 19, he took the
 degree    of  B. A.  in  the   second   class, according to the old style of the
 Oxford Examinations.            In 1815 he won the Chancellor's Prize for the
 Latin Essay, the prize for the English Essay in the same year being gained
 by Arnold.
    Destined for the profession of medicine, he proceeded to London and
 Edinburgh as a medical student (1815-18).                  The lectures of Professor
 Jameson     in  Edinburgh     on   Geology and Mineralogy attracted his earnest
 attention, and strengthened the desire to cultivate natural science which
 had been awakened by the teaching of Dr. Kidd at Oxford. In Dr. Kidd's
 class-room the future historian of volcanoes had frequently met Buckland
 and the Conybeares, Whateley and the Duncans — men of vigorous minds
 and various knowledge.            The change from thoughtful Oxford to active
 Edinburgh was the crisis in Daubeny's career. The fight was then raging
 in the modern Athens between Plutonists and Neptunists, Uuttonians and
 Wernerians, and the possession of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Craig was
 sternly debated by the rival worshippers of fire and water.                     Daubeny
 entered keenly into this discussion, and, after quitting the University of
 Edinburgh, proceeded, in 1819, on a leisurely tour through France, every
 where collecting evidence on the geological and chemical history of the
 globe, and sent to Professor Jameson from Auvergne the earliest notices
  which had appeared in England of that remarkable volcanic region f.
  Some of the views afterwards advanced by the young physicist touching
  the elevation of the hills and the geological age of the valleys of Auvergne           J
  have    been   reexamined and discussed by later eminent writers, such as
  Scrope, Murchison, Lyell — not always in agreement with him, or, indeed,
  with one another ; while the prehistoric antiquity of the volcanoes them-

 selves has been questioned even       within a few years, and defended by none
 more effectually than by Dr. Daubeny*.
    From the beginning to the end of his scientific career, volcanic pheno
mena    occupied the attention of Dr. Daubeny ; and he strove by frequent
journeys through Italy, Sicily, France and Germany, Hungary and Tran
sylvania, to extend his knowledge of that interesting subject. In 1823-25,
he had by this means prepared the basis of his great work on volcanoes,
which appeared in 1826, and contained careful descriptions of all the re
gions known to be visited by igneous eruptions, and a consistent hypothesis
of the cause of the thermic disturbance, in accordance with the view first
proposed by Gay-Lussac and Davy.              Water admitted to the uncombined
bases of the earths and alkalies existing below the oxidized crust of the
globe, was shown to be an efficient cause of local high temperature, and a
real antecedent     to the earthquake movements, the flowing lava, and the
expelled gas and steam.        In later yearsf Dr. Daubeny freely accepted, as
at least very probable, a high interior temperature of the earth ; but he
 did not allow that the admission of water to a heated interior oxidized mass
would account for the chemical effects which            accompany and follow an
eruption.     On this point there are still data to be gathered and inferences
 to be examined.
    Four years previously to the publication of the 'Description of Volcanoes,'
 Dr. Daubeny was appointed to succeed Dr. Kidd as Aldrichian Professor
of Chemistry, and took up his abode in, or rather below, the time-honoured
 Museum founded by Ashmole.             In these rather gloomy apartments nearly
all the scientific teaching of Oxford had been accomplished since the days
of Robert Plot; in them were still collected, as late as 1855, by gas-light
and furnace-fires,    the most zealous      students of Practical Chemistry ; but
now they are filled with Greek sculpture, and Chemistry has flitted to the
magnificent laboratories of the University Museum, directed by Sir Benja
min Brodie.
    In  1834  he was appointed        Professor  of Botany, and migrated to the
" Physic Garden,"       as it  was called, which    had been founded in the early
part of the reign of Charles       I.
    Under his diligent and generous management, with liberal aid from the
 University, Dr. Daubeny lived to see the old Garden entirely arranged,
enriched with extensive houses, extended in area, and made both attractive
 and beautiful.
    In the pleasant residence at the Botanic Garden, Dr. Daubeny               passed
the remainder of his life — the third of           a  century.    Here,   incessantly
 active, he instituted many experiments on vegetation under different con
 ditions of soil, on the effects of light on plants, and of plants on light,
on the distribution of potash and phosphates in leaves and fruits, on

  on the effect of varied proportions of carbonic acid on plants analogous to
  those of the coal-measures*.        These last-mentioned experiments are among
  the very few which     can be referred to as throwing light on the curious
  question whether the amazing abundance of vegetable life in the carboni
 ferous ages of the world may not have been specially favoured by the pre
 sence, in the palaeozoic atmosphere, of a larger proportion of carbonic acid
 gas than is found at present.
     A  favourite subject of research with Dr. Daubeny, naturally springing
 from his volcanic explorations, was the chemical history of mineral waters.
 The presence of iodine and bromine in some of these formed the subject
 of  a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1 830 ; and a Report to
 the British Association in 1836 included a general survey of mineral and
 thermal waters. This subject was not neglected in his ' North-American
 Tour' (1837-38), which contains          a great number of interesting observations
 on the character of the country which he traversed, as well as the educa
 tional institutions, where he was heartily welcomed.
     Dr. Daubeny    was a great traveller, almost an annual visitor          to the con
 tinent, usually, at least in his later years, accompanied           by some scientific
 or literary friend, some member of his family, or some young Oxonian of
 cultivated taste, to whom the sight of Auvergne and the Tyrol in the com
 pany of such a guide was a gift of priceless value.
    In one of his journeys to Spain in 1843, for the purpose of studying
 the geological relations and agricultural value of the great phosphatic de
 posit of Estremadura, he was accompanied by Captain Widdriugtoa, ILN.
 It was a journey prompted by benevolence and attended by hardship. No
 doubt, in some future day, railways will carry heavy loads of this valuable
substance to enrich the agriculture of Spain f.             In another year he might
be found in Norway, or musing in the Garden at Geneva, where he was
always welcomed by the great botanist whose friendship he gained in early
life, and to whose memory he has devoted a careful critical essay, which
was read to the Ashmolean Society in 1842 J.
    It was at Geneva that he
                                    " began   to estimate at their true weight the
pretensions    of Botany   to  be   regarded as a science, and to comprehend the
principle on which it might be inculcated as constituting an essential
part of a liberal education."          Here he first pursued his botanical studies
under the guidance of Decandolle in 1830, and thus qualified himself
for the Professorship to which, as already observed, he was appointed in
1834.
    Chemistry,    however,    was     the thread which bound          together   all the
researches    of Dr. Daubeny ; not that he was personally a dexterous

 manipulator    of chemical instruments,     though   a diligent   practical  ana
 lyst.   He was rich in chemical knowledge, profound and varied in his
 acquired views of chemical relations, always prompt and sagacious in fix
ing upon the main argument and the right plan for following up success
 ful experiment or retrieving occasional failure.        In 1831 appeared his
 ' Sketch of the Atomic Theory,' a work which well
                                                             sustained the repu
 tation of the author as a master of language and a conscientious teacher
 of science.
     So soon as the arrangements were made for the location of Chemistry in
 its new   abode Dr. Daubeny took the occasion of resigning the Chair of
 Chemistry, and used all his influence to increase the efficiency of the office
 and secure the services of the present eminent Professor.
     In his position as a teacher of Botany, he took pleasure in drawing at
 tention to the historical aspects of his subject, and specially, as a part of
 his duty, treated of Rural Economy both in its literary and its practical
 bearings.    Hence arose the "Lectures on Roman Husbandry" (1857),
 written in a style very creditable to the classical training of his early years,
 and containing a full account of the most important passages of Latin
 authors bearing on crops and culture, the treatment of domestic animals,
 and horticulture.    To this is added an interesting Catalogue of the Plants
noticed by Dioscorides, arranged in the modern natural orders.           This was
followed, after a few years, by a valuable Essay on the Trees and Shrubs of
the Ancients, and a Catalogue of Trees and Shrubs indigenous in Greece
and Italy (1865).
    To facilitate his researches in Experimental Botany, Dr. Daubeny had
obtained possession of a piece of land lying some half a mile or so from
Oxford ; but of late years symptoms of ill-health interfered both with his
enjoyment of the recreation of his little farm, and the experiments for
which it was destined.
    During a few late winters Dr. Daubeny found it desirable to exchange
his residence in Oxford for the milder climate of Torquay.              Here his
activity of mind was equally manifested by public lectures on the tempera
ture and other atmospheric conditions of that salubrious resort, and by ex
periments on ozone and the usual meteorological elements, in comparison
with another series in Oxford. By this connexion with Devonshire he
was induced to join the Association in that county for the Advancement of
Science, Literature, and Art ; and one of his latest public addresses was
delivered to that body, as President, in 1865.
    In his whole career Dr. Daubeny was full of that practical public spirit
which delights in cooperation, and feeds upon the hope of benefiting
humanity by associations of men.         When the British Association came
into being at York, in 1831, Daubeny alone stood for the Universities of
England.
    In  1856  he was its   President,  at Cheltenham,    in his native county,

  the only occurrence of this kind in the annals of the Association.
      The same earnest spirit was manifested in all his academic life. No pro
  ject of change, no scheme of improvement in University Examinations, no
  modification in the system of his own college, ever found him indifferent,
   prejudiced, or unprepared. On almost every such question his opinion was
   formed with rare impartiality, and expressed with as rare intrepidity. Firm
   and gentle, prudent and generous, cheerful and sympathetic, pursuing no
   private ends, calm amid jarring creeds and contending parties
                                                                         — the personal
   influence of such a man on his contemporaries for half a century of active
   and thoughtful life fully matched the effect of his published works.              His
                                                                 '
  latest labour was to gather his ' Miscellaneous Essays into two very inter
   esting volumes, and then, after patiently enduring severe illness for a few
   weeks, he sank to that rest which, often in his thoughts, had ever been
   expected, with the calmness of the philosopher and the hopefulness of the
   Christian. He died at five minutes past twelve a.m., December 13, 1867,
   in his 73rd year.
       His remains were laid in a vault adjoining the walls of Magdalen Col
   lege Chapel, in accordance with his own expressed wish
                                                                       " that he might
   not be separated in death from a society with which he had been connected
   for the greater part of his life, and to which he was so deeply indebted,
   not only for the kind countenance and support ever afforded him, but also
   for supplying him with the        means of indulging in a career of life at once
   so congenial to his taste       and the best calculated to render him a useful
   member of the community."
       In the preceding brief notices no mention has been made of             Dr. Dau-
   beny's short career     as a  medical man, for which     he had prepared     himself
   by professional study in Edinburgh and London.              In Oxford he justified
   his title of M.D. and his Fellowship with the                College of Physicians
   by attaching     himself   to the  Badcliffe  Infirmary.    In  this capacity, how
   ever, he did not long remain ; nor did he continue his medical practice,
   though during all his life the progress of medical science was much at
   his heart, as may be seen in the Harveian Oration which he delivered
   before the College of Physicians in 1845. In that elegant address he
   speaks     of himself  as   "...  quern, a medicince castris tanquam profugum,
    Physicarum Scientiarum         amor, aut Otii Literati dulcedo, ad aliam vitae
•  normam jam tot per annos transtulit,            ut ne inter   commilitones    vestros
   recenseri merear."
       In these words we have the key to the valuable life         which was passed so
   busily   and  so gracefully among his academic brethren, and to the works of
    scientific and literary interest which are all that now remain to us of Charles
   Daubeny.       What he has said of these works is perhaps the truest and most
   modest comment that will ever be made on them and on the circumstances
   under which they were produced.            For they are
                                                            " some of the fruits of      a

life chiefly spent in tranquil intellectual occupation, under the fostering
wing of one of those great semimonastic establishments which are peculiar
to this country ; and however slight their intrinsic value, considered as
contributions to the stock of human knowledge, may be, they will serve at
least to show, by their number and variety, what might be accomplished by
persons gifted with greater energy and more profound attainments, through
the aid of foundations in which an exemption from domestic cares, and a
liberal provision for all the reasonable wants of a celibate life, afford such
facilities for the indulgence of either literary or scientific tastes."
     Under the influence of the traditions of former scientific culture in Ox
ford, and
                         " Not mindless of those mighty times
                                                                "
when the leading spirits of remote antiquity committed to posterity the
priceless records of early philosophy, was Charles Daubeny conducted to
 the School of Chemistry, and the School of Geology.                In them, but espe
 cially in the former, he imbibed sound and various knowledge.             From them
 he passed at once to researches and publications which have contributed
 as much as those of any physicist of this century to sustain the credit of
 the University and guide the progress of useful knowledge.                And the in
 fluence of these publications was in no slight measure due to the pure
 classical taste, and the sure employment of appropriate language, which
 were the gift of the foundations of William of Wykeham and William of
 Waynflete.
     The same accuracy appeared in the frequent addresses which he was
 called on to make on social or public occasions.             He affected no grace 01
 oratory  ;
                      " His words succinct, yet full, without a fault,
                        He said no more than just the thing he ought j"
 but the calm and reasonable views which he might be trusted to present on
 all subjects of scientific interest or administrative reform, never failed to
 have their due influence even over the agitations of controversy — from
 which he never shrank if his sense of justice and love of truth called
 for vindication.     Any one accustomed to a considerable degree of inti
 macy with Dr. Daubeny would be able to declare that he never met with
 any man more entirely truthful and just-minded. You might absolutely
 rely upon him, in regard of deeds, thoughts, and motives.                    To con
 vince his judgment was to enlist his sympathy and secure his active help ;
 to be censured with overmuch strictness was a passport to such pro
  tection as he could honestly give.          In defence of a friend whose Essay
  was unpopular, in opposition to a course of University mutation which
  he did not think was reform, in advocating what he believed to be de
  sirable changes, his arms were ever ready ; nor did he throw a pointless
  dart.
     With reference to the influence of Dr. Daubeny in scientific discussions,

                                        lxxx
one may venture to say that         it would have been greater had his early
studies been more turned in the direction of mathematics, especially as ap
plied to physical research.      In the beginning of his career, indeed, Che
mistry was only acquiring numerical exactness, and Geology was quite un
provided with mechanical laws of earth-movement.                But no one knew
better than Dr. Daubeny that right geometrical conceptions are always
necessary to a student of science, and laws of proportion indispensable
elements of sound philosophy.
    The published writings     of Dr. Daubeny      are very numerous.       Besides
what have appeared as independent works, the list of his Memoirs in
Transactions    and Journals up to 1863, as given in the Royal Society's
" Catalogue of Scientific Papers," amounts to seventy-too. Many of
these, scattered   through various periodicals and not conveniently accessible,
were collected and arranged by their author in two volumes of Miscellanies.
 In this collection appeared twelve Experimental Essays, ten Geological
Memoirs,     eight Essays on Scientific       Subjects,  and twelve on Literary
Subjects.     Besides these were several     papers   of  interest, some published
separately, which, having been       composed after the first edition of the ' De
 scription of Volcanoes,' were employed in the preparation            of the second
edition, or noticed in supplements to that work.
    By these arrangements Dr. Daubeny has rendered it unnecessary, for
 those who desire to know his views on the various subjects which occupied
 his mind, to refer to such publications as the Edinburgh Philosophical
 Journal, Edinburgh New Philosophical         Journal, or Journal of the Geolo
 gical Society, or even to the Linnean Transactions, Royal Society's Trans
 actions, or Reports of the British Association, except from a desire to
learn his first thoughts from his first words.       The following is a list of the

literary labours   : —

  Julius PlOcker,      Foreign Member of the Royal Society, was born on
the 16th of   July        1801, at Elberfeld.
                                          After studying in the Gymnasium
of Diisseldorf, and in the Universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Heidelberg, he
passed some years in Paris.    In 1825 he became a Privatdocent of Mathe
matics in Bonn, and in October 1828 was appointed Professor extraordi-
narius in that University. In 1833 he went to Berlin in the same capacity,
and lectured also in the Friedrich-Wilhelm's          Gymnasium.     In 1834 he
obtained the Professorship of Mathematics         in the University of Halle, and
in 1836 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics              in the University
of Bonn. The treatises and memoirs on Analytical Geometry written
by him during the twenty years that followed his return from Paris
secured for him a place among the first mathematicians of his time. He
now entered upon a new career; for the superintendence of the Physical
Museum   having been entrusted to his care, he turned his attention to
experimental research, and was appointed to the Professorship of Physics
in 1847. A series of brilliant discoveries soon placed him among the
foremost labourers in this department of science.          These researches     occu
pied him till 1856.
  In repeating         of Faraday's experiments, he was led to the discovery
                     some
of magnecrystallic action,— that          is,
                                        that     crystallized body behaves dif
                                                  a
ferently in the magnetic field according      to  the orientation of certain di
rections in the crystal.   These researches occupied him till 1856, when he
turned   his attention to the action of powerful magnets on the luminous
electric discharge in glass tubes containing highly rarefied gas.       In wide
                                                                              a
tube the light of such     gas  a too faint
                                     is      to  permit    asatisfactory observa
tion of its spectrum     he found, however, that by employing tubes which
                            ;
were capillary in one part, brilliant light and definite spectra were obtained
in the narrow part. These spectra were found to be characteristic of the
several gases and to indicate their chemical nature, though the gases
might be present in such minute quantity as utterly to elude chemical
research.
   In continuing these researches he next made the remarkable discovery
of the two totally different spectra of each of the elementary substances,
nitrogen, sulphur, selenium, hydrogen, iodine, lead, manganese,        and copper,
according as    it submitted to the instantaneous discharge of
                     is                                             Leyden jar
                                                                       a
charged    by
            an induction coil, or  rendered  incandescent  by  the  simple dis
charge of the coil, or else, in some cases,           by
                                                  ordinary flames.     The two
spectra were found to exhibit     difference
                                     a       in character, and  are not merely
different in the number and position of the lines which they show.      This
difference he attributed, with the greatest probability,  to   difference
                                                                   a      in
the temperature of the gas when the two are respectively produced.    These

        Jean Bernard Leon FoucAULT.Foreign            Member of the Royal Society,
     was born in Paris on the 18th     of September 1819.      He began the study
    of medicine, but soon gave the preference to physics and the sciences
    of observation. At the age of twenty he employed himself in improving
    the processes of photography.       For three years he assisted M. Donne*
    in preparing the illustrations of his lectures on microscopic anatomy,
    and was associated with M. Fizeau in conducting a variety of original
   researches.     They investigated the comparative intensities of the light
   of the sun, of the voltaic arc between carbon poles, and of lime heated
   before the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.        They read memoirs on the interference
   of calorific rays, on the interference of two rays of light in the case of a
   large difference in the lengths of their routes, and on the chromatic pola
   rization of light.   In December of 1849 Foucault described an electromag
   netic regulator of the electric light.   Conjointly with Regnault he was the
   author of a paper on binocular vision.         He contributed besides several
   memoirs on colour, on voltaic and frictional electricity,]and on the employ
   ment of the conical pendulum as a time-keeper.
       M. Arago had suggested the employment of Wheatstone's revolving
   mirror, in a manner resembling its use in measuring the propagation of the
  electric current in a wire, to decide whether the velocity of light within a
  refractive medium is greater or less than its velocity in air.        The former
  result implies the truth of the emission theory, the latter that of the
  undulatory theory.      The experiment, as devised by M. Arago, was nearly
  (perhaps quite) impracticable, inasmuch as it depended upon the observa
 tion of an image of momentary duration formed in an unknown part of the
  field of view.   By the happy introduction of a concave mirror having its
 centre in the axis of the revolving mirror, a fixed image was obtained ; and
 the experiment thus rendered possible proved that the velocity of light
 is greater in air than in water.      This experiment was made in 1850, not
 long    after M. Fizeau   had  approximately determined the velocity of light
 in air by measuring the time it occupied in travelling from the place of the
 observer to a station 8633 metres distant, and back again.          Foucault also
 suggested the means of measuring the velocity of propagation of radiant
 heat.
      In February   1851 he communicated to the Academy the results of his
observations    on  the rotation of the plane of oscillation of a freely suspended
pendulum in the direction east-south-west, and thus supplied an ocular
demonstration of the diurnal motion of the earth.           By the construction of
the gyroscope, in September       1852, he gave a second demonstration of the
same      phenomenon.     For these discoveries the Copley Medal for the year
1855 was awarded to him.         About this time     he was   appointed Physical
Assistant to the Imperial Observatory.        In September of the same year he
exhibited a new instance of the conversion of work into heat.             A copper

                                     Ixxxiv
disk being made to revolve rapidly in its own plane, on bringing a horse-
sboe magnet into such a position that the disk revolved with its rim be
tween the poles of the magnet, the moving force required to maintain the
velocity of rotation increased, and the temperature of the disk was raised.
     On the 16th of February 1857 he described a reflecting telescope,
having a speculum formed of glass coated with chemically reduced silver
and afterwards polished, of 10 centims. aperture and 50 centims. focal
length, without being aware that a telescope on the same principle and
nearly of the same dimensions had been described by Steinheil in the
Allgemeine Zeitung of the 24th of March 1856.             In the following year
Foucault succeeded in giving the speculum the form of a spheroid or of a
paraboloid of revolution, and described a new process for finding out the
configuration of optical surfaces.     A reflector of this description, having
an aperture of 40 centims. and 2-5 metres focal length, was mounted in the
Imperial Observatory of Paris in June 1859. Another of these reflectors,
having an aperture of 78 centims. and a focal length of 4'5 metres, was
constructed for the Observatory in 1862.       The polarizer known as his was
invented in 1857.
   The project of determining the absolute velocity of light in air with the
aid of Wheatstone's revolving mirror, conceived in 1850, was carried out
in 1862. The value Foucault obtained for it was 298,000 kilometres in a
second  of time, instead of 308,000 kilometres, the previously received value.
Combining the newly found velocity with the constant of aberration, 20-445,
the sun's equatorial parallax is found to be 8" -86, the value deduced by
Mr. Stone in his recent discussion of the transit of Venus in 1769 being
8"-91, and the value adopted in the 'Nautical Almanac' for 1870 being
8''-95.   In this year Foucault was elected a Member of the Bureau des
Longitudes.
    In the years 1863, 1864, 1865 he appears to have been occupied with
the task of investigating the conditions of isochronism of Watt's governor,
and modifying its construction so as to render the time of revolution inva
riable.   These improved governors are applied to the transit-recorders con
structed for the use of the Indian Survey.      In January 1865 he was elected
a Member     of the Mechanical Section of the Institute. In 1866 he invented
a new and improved      regulator for the electric light, and a telescope for
viewing the sun, in which the light is rendered endurable to the eye by
coating the outer surface of the object-glass with a film of chemically re
duced silver so thin as to be transparent.      This process was applied with
complete success to a refractor having an aperture of 25 centims.
    In July 1867 he was attacked by paralysis, and died on the 1 1th of
 February, 1868. The date of his election as Foreign Member of the
 Royal Society is June 9, 1864.

      Antoine Francois Jean Claudet was born at Lyons in 1/97. He
 received a good commercial and classical education in his own country, and
  at the age of 21 he entered the office of his uncle, M. Vital Roux, an emi
  nent banker, who a few years after placed him at the glass-works of Choisy-
  le-Roi, as director, in conjunction with M. G. Bontemps, the well-known
 glass-manufacturer.      Eventually M. Claudet came to London to introduce the
 productions     of Choisy. In 1833 he invented the machine now generally used
 for cutting cylindrical glass. For this invention he received the medal of
 the Society of Arts in 1853.       But all this while he was a student of science
  training and waiting for the object to which his true life was to be devoted.
 The path was opened to him by the discovery of M. Daguerre.
      In January    1839  that discovery was first announced to the world, and
  specimens of the results were exhibited, the modus operandi being still pre
  served secret.     The French Government at once entertained the project of
  rewarding     the discoverer, and in the following June assigned to M. Da
  guerre    a pension   of 6000 francs annually, and to M. Niepce, jun., a
 pension of 4000 francs annually, that the new art might be presented a
gift to the world.
     In the month of August       1839  the new discovery was published to the
 world.      It was received with enthusiasm, and rapidly adopted as a means
 of delineation, portraiture being its most early and extensive application.
 England alone failed to partake freely of this " gift to the world," M.
 Daguerre       having entered into negotiations which secured a patent in this
 country whilst the question of his claims was under the attention of the
 French Government.         M. Claudet became the possessor of a part of this
 patent, and commenced in 1840 the practice of portraiture in the Adelaide
  Gallery, where his studio remained for many years.           There, as a zealous
 worker, he devoted himself to the improvement and development of pho
 tography, perfecting known processes and inventing new ones. His earliest
 contribution to the art was a mode of obtaining vastly increased sensitive
 ness by using chloride of iodine instead of iodine alone.       His paper on this
 subject was read before the Royal Society in June 1841 ; and, by a curious
 coincidence, it followed Mr. Fox Talbot's description of his own photogra
phic process, the calotype.       From this period till his death his contribu
tions to photographic literature were copious and interesting, the idio
matic excellence and elegance of his English being remarkable.
     In 1847, discussing the properties of solar radiation modified by         co
loured     glass media, he made a bold attempt to lay the foundation of a
more complete theory of the photographic phenomena, and he was re
warded by the publication of his paper in the Philosophical Transactions,
and by his subsequent election (in 1853) as a Fellow of the Royal Society.
At    this time the collodion process had supplanted the method of Daguerre        ;
and Claudet was one of the first to appreciate and adopt it.
    The marvellous phenomenon of objects in relief was now brought before
him in the stereoscope, and seemed to him a greater charm than the cx-

 quisite detail of the Daguerreotype.        He assisted Sir Charles Wheatstone
 in the early application of the stereoscope to photography ; and in his
 admirable treatise on the stereoscope he gives the history of the art and
 the theory of the principles of binocular vision.         His great aim was the
 elevation of photography by rendering her work scientifically true ; and
 the Reports of the British Association during a period of twenty years
 bear ample testimony to the ingenuity and originality of his inventions.
 His dynactinometer, his photographometer, his focimeter, his stereomono-
 scope, his system   of unity of measure for focusing enlargements, his system
 of photosculpture, and other results of his experimental researches are fa
 miliar to most photographers.
    In the later years of his life he became convinced that one of the greatest
 deficiencies of photography, in the representation of solid figures, is the in
 capability of obtaining an equally well-defined image of all the various parts
 situated on different planes.      Hence it became his object to remove from
 photographic     portraiture the mechanical harshness which marked and
 marred the plane situated in the exact focus of the lens, and so to pro
 duce, as in the best works of art, a uniformly soft and harmonious treat
ment.      His success in the first instance was partial, inasmuch as the
 adopted motion of the posterior lens only of the optical combination slightly
 altered the size of the superimposed images, and thus introduced a theo
 retical, though hardly visible, amount of blurring. Dr. Sommer, M. Voigt-
 lander's stepson, supplied a series of formulae showing that, although for
 all practical purposes in photography the movement of one lens attained
 the object in view, yet the simultaneous motion of the two lenses, receding
 from or approaching a fixed point between them, was the only legitimate
 mode of reconciling practice with theory, and of securing in every plane an
 exact uniformity of image.       To fulfil this condition was a difficult pro
 blem, the solution of which was most perplexing.         But, says Claudet, with
 a determination   which commands success,       "I  did not like that it should
be said my plan was not entirely       in accordance with the mathematical laws
 of optics, and I set to work to find a mechanical means by which         I could
avail myself of the calculations of Dr. Sommer.        I have found such means ;
 and it proves that the differential movement can be effected, not only as
 readily, but with a greater command and steadiness than by moving only
 one lens."    His ingenious automatic arrangement is described in his last
paper    read before  the Royal Society, in 1867, and published in the Pro
ceedings, entitled "Optics of Photography : on a Self-acting Focus-Equa
lizer, or the means of producing the Differential Movement of the two
Lenses of a Photographic        Optical Combination, which is capable, during
the exposure, of bringing consecutively all the Planes of a Solid Figure into
Focus, without altering the size of the various images superposed."
    After this, and in the same year, he had an interesting correspondence
with his veteran collaborateur Sir David Brewster, who held that the most
perfect photographic      instrument is a single lens of least dispersion, and

                                       lxxxvii
least aberration, and least thickness.        Claudet realized these views in his
portraiture with a small topaz lens, which reached with equal distinctness
every plane of the figure.     He then communicated the nature and result
of his experiments to the British Association at Dundee ; and his work-was
done. His last illness, in December 1867, was of very brief duration.          He
 suddenly passed away from us, in the 70th year of his age, while his mental
powers retained the vigour and freshness of youth ; and by his death pho
tography lost a father, and very many photographers a friend.
    The scientific life of Claudet is given at length in a " Memoir " pub
lished in the 'Scientific Review,' and reprinted for distribution at the
 Meeting of the British Association at Norwich in August 1868. In an
 Appendix there is a list of forty papers communicated from 1841 to 1867
 to the Royal and other Philosophical Societies and to photographic and
 philosophical publications in England and France.           Here also we have a
 striking portrait of this zealous photographer, obtained with his Focus-
 Equalizer, and printed from the only negative preserved when his "Temple
 to Photography" in Regent Street was destroyed by fire, " a few weeks
 after its chief priest had quitted it for ever."
     In recognition of his merits M. Claudet received awards of eleven medals,
 including the Council Medal of the Universal Exhibition, 1851, besides
 that, being on juries, on other great occasions he was excluded from the
 awards.      He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1853, and in
  1865 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. — J. B. R.
     Charles James Beverly, F.R.S., F.L.S.,             was born in August 1788,
  at Fort Augustus in the Highlands, where his father's        regiment was then
  quartered.     He entered the Navy in 1810 as Assistant       Surgeon, and was
  employed in that capacity during four years on the Baltic and Mediterra
  nean stations, but chiefly the latter, in H. M. SS. ' Pyramus,' 'Resistance,'
  and 'Caledonia,' during which period he was frequently sent in boats on
  cutting-out expeditions, and was present at the capture of Porto d'Auzo in
  1813. He was then placed on Lord Exmouth's list for promotion, but,
  falling into bad health, was sent to England in charge of sick and wounded
  from the fleet.

     On his recovery he was appointed to the ' Tiber as Assistant Surgeon,

  then about to proceed to the polar regions under the command of Sir John
  Ross.    In  1819 and 1820 he served in     Sir Edward Parry's first expedition,
  and passed    the winter at Melville    Island,  discovered in that well-known
  voyage.     On his return  he was   promoted to the rank of Full Surgeon,
  having seen more than ten years' service in sea-going ships as Assistant
  Surgeon, and being highly commended for his skill and care in his at
  tendance on the sick.     He subsequently suffered from an affection of his
  eyes,  and immediately on his recovery was nominated most unexpectedly

to the Flagship     on the Barbadoes     Station  as  Supernumerary Surgeon.
The risk of changing from       an arctic to a tropical climate while in weak
health forced him to decline the appointment, and he was removed from
the list of surgeons.     He served in 1827 as a volunteer under Sir Edward
Parry in the capacity of Surgeon and naturalist in the long and perilous
ice-journey on the Spitzbergen seas.      He was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society in May   1 83 1 .
   After retiring from the Navy, Mr. Beverly entered into private practice
in London.     He died on the 16th of September, 1868, a short time after
attaining the age of 80.
