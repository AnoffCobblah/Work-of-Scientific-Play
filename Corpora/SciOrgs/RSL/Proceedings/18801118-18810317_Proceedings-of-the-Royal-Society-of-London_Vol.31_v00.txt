"Researches on the Action of Organic Substances on the Ultra

        of Essential Oils." By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.E., &c, Pro
        fessor of Chemistry in the Royal College of Science for
        Ireland, Dublin, and A. K. Huntington, F.C.S., Associate of
        the Royal School of Mines. Communicated by Professor
        Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received July 22. Read November 20,
         1879.
    Much chemical and physical research has been devoted to the class
•of bodies    known    as essential oils, as, for instance, the investigations of
 Dr.   J.  H. Gladstone (" Journal of the Chemical Society," vol. xviii,
  p. 1; vol. xxiii, p. 147; vol. xxv, p. 1), of Dr. C. R. A. Wright
  (" Isomeric     Terpenes   and their Derivatives," vol. xxvi, pp. 549 and
  686 ; vol. xxvii, pp. 1, 317, and 619), and of Dr. W. A. Tilden (lac.
 cit., vol. xxviii, pp. 514 and 1258), as well as many others.
     It is  now well known that essential oils consist       for the most part of
 isomeric hydrocarbons,        which may      be   divided into three polymeric
groups, possessing the composition denoted by the formulas —
                         Gloria         C15H04          C50HS2.
    To    the first class belong the hydrocarbons derived from turpentine,
orange, nutmeg, myrtle, and several others, while the second group
includes the hydrocarbons from rosewood, cubebs, calamus, cascarilla,
patchouli, and cloves. The third group is represented by colophene.
Though of unknown constitution, these bodies exhibit a close rela
tionship to benzene derivatives.
    Many of the oils are articles of great commercial value and conse
quently are subject to adulteration, a fact which, in addition to the
scientific interest they possess, led ns to submit a number of specimens
to examination in the spectroscope.
    We     have to acknowledge     assistance    rendered to us by the kindness
of several     gentlemen    who supplied us with samples, namely, Dr. Glad-
    VOL.    XXXI.                                                      B

stone, from whom we obtained               many oils which he had previously
examined, Mr. Farries, of the firm of Burgoyne, Bnrbidges, Cyriax,
and Farries, Dr. Septimus Piesse, and Dr. W. A. Tilden, who has
given us some remarkably pure preparations derived from turpentine
and from Portugal essence.             The diagrams which explain the optical
characters of the various substances examined, and particulars concern
ing which here follow, were made in the same way as those appertaining
to the Parts      I  and  II  of this research.   The wood cuts made from our
diagrams have had the light and dark parts reversed, so that they
differ from the lithographs of the same character published in the
Phil. Trans., Part I, 1879 : they have of course been greatly reduced
in dimensions, but not all to the same scale. The layer of liquid
examined was 15 millims. instead of 19 millims. thick.
    We have found that the following essential oils and hydrocarbons
transmit continuous spectra : —
    The four isomeric terpenes (Diagrams 1, 2, 3, and 4) prepared by
Dr. Tilden—
    Australene,     from     common      turpentine   obtained from the Pinns
Ausiralis. Boiling-point 156-157°, specific gravity at 0° C. =0-876, 100
millims. rotate the polarised ray of light 22° to the right. — Undiluted,
this hydrocarbon transmits rays lying between the 12 and 17 Cd. lines.
Solutions of the substance in alcohol were examined containing too^
 »5o> 1660' an(l "s oVo °f their volume of theft terpene.         No absorption
band was seen.
    Terebene,* prepared from American turpentine by precipitating with
sulphuric acid.         Boiling-point 156°, specific gravity not ascertained,
optically inactive. — The spectrum of the undiluted substance was much
the same as that of australene.            Further examinations were made of
solutions containing                          -j^,         of the volume of the
liquid.    The    spectrum was continuous.
    Terebenthene,      from French turpentine.          Boiling-point 156-157°,
specific gravity at 0° C^O'876, 100 millims. rotate the polarised ray
                      — The transmitted rays were much the same as before.
 27^° to the left.
 Solutions containing             yfoy, -g^y,       and 75Vrr of their volume of
 the substance were examined.
    Hesperidene, from Portugal essence. Boiling-point 176-177°, specific
 gravity at 0° C.=0'859, 100 millims. rotate the polarised ray 96° to the
 right. — Dilute solutions containing T^s, j-J^, and -j^Vo °f their volume
 of the liquid were photographed.
     The four diagrams drawn from the photographs obtained from these
 substances show the rays transmitted by 15 millims. of the liquid alone
  and when diluted ; all rays to the right of the curves are those
  absorbed by the liquid, while those to the left are transmitted.

    Nutmeg Hydrocarbon. — This is the specimen specially referred to in

 fraction condensed in a turbid state and contained water. It boiled
  between 159° and 162°'5.        The second fraction, equal to one-third
 the whole quantity of liquid, boiled between 1620-5 and 1643.           The

Dilution to 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 times yielded a curve some

   Oil of Vitivert (Dr. Gladstone). — Two fractions of this substance
were distilled off the specimen, which was small in quantity.         The
first part contained a little water, and the oil was yellow ; the second
portion was of a peculiar greenish tint, doubtless because of the
presence of some blue oil common to camomile and patchouli being
here in presence of a yellow oil.
   A brown resinous mass was left in the retort. The fraction photo
graphed boiled between 280° and 285°.          This is one of those sub
stances which still absorb some of the more refrangible rays even
when diluted 30,000 times, while a dilution of 10,000 transmits no
rays beyond the line 18 Cd. (Diagram 7.)
   Oil of Turpentine. No. IV in Dr. Gladstone's paper, " Journal of the
Chemical Society," vol. xviii, p. 18. — This substance had become greatly
altered by keeping. Its original boiling-point was 160° C. It had
oxidised and no doubt become polymerised, since many fractions with
high boiling-points were distilled off.
   The following are the boiling-points of different portions of the
entire distillate : —
        150 — 160°, contained    water.
        160—165°,
        165-180°,         „
        180—205°,
        205—228°,     slightly turbid.
        228—310°,     the greater portion boiled between 238° and 280°.
        310—365°.
   At  320° the liquid was greenish in colour, and at 365° a yellowish-
green vapour was evolved.        The oxidised products evidently split up
by the action of heat with the production of water and a hydrocarbon.
The fraction boiling between 228° and 310° was very much more
soluble in alcohol containing 30 per cent, of water than that with
a boiling-point of 160 — 165°.
   The fraction boiling between 228° and 310° did not transmit ray
12 Cd when diluted 1,000 times, and the spectrum was cut off at line
17 Cd, after diluting with 10,000 volumes of alcohol.
   The fraction boiling above 365° did not differ much from the pre
ceding till a dilution with 10,000 volumes of alcohol was reached.

     Oil of Cubebs (Mr. Fairies). — There were two portions of this oil,
  one boiling at 260—265°, the other between 266—275°.                The first was
  examined, when diluted 1,000 and 5,000 times ; the second portion
  after diluting 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000 times. As far as line
  Cd 17 the spectrum was freely transmitted, but a dilution of 10,000-
 times only feebly transmitted the more refrangible rays. (Diagram 7.)
     Oil of Calamus (Dr. Gladstone). — This oil belongs to the group of
 substances with the formula C^H^.                    The portion boiling at 260°

 20,000, and 30,000 times, and throughout exhibited the same absorp
 tive power, or nearly so, as that displayed by the oil of turpentine of
 highest boiling-points.          (Diagram 7.)
    Otto of Citron (Dr. Gladstone). — On the second distillation, twa
fractions were separated: the first boiled between 110° and 200°, the
 distillate containing at first a little water ; the thermometer then rose
 rapidly to 200°.        The second fraction boiling between 200° and 245°
was photographed.            This is one of those substances exhibiting a
strong absorption,       even     after dilution with alcohol to 20,000 times its
original volume.        (Diagram 7.)
    Oil of Patclwuli. No. 1. (Obtained by Dr. Gladstone from Mr. E.

following temperatures          : —
          1st.   250—259°      ;   distillate turbid.
          2nd. 259—275°.
          3rd. 275—290°; this portion was blue.
          4th. 290 — 360° ; this appeared to yield a blue vapour.
    The second portion was photographed after             diluting 1,000 and  5,000-
times.     (Diagram 8.)
    Patchouli.     No.    2. — This blue       oil was rectified, and the portion
boiling    between     275°       and 277° was photographed after diluting
5,000, 8,000, 10,000, and 50,000 times.
    A very distinct absorption band was noticed lying between lines
12   and 17 Cd.       (See diagram.)
    Perfect transparency to the more refrangible rays was not obtained
by a dilution with 50,000 volumes of alcohol.                 This blue oil may be
considered a benzene derivative, since it yields an absorption band be-

    This oil, like several others, polymerises easily during distillation ;
consequently, a freshly distilled specimen on redistillation leaves a
resinous residue in the retort.       The portion boiling between 265° and
2/0° was examined after diluting 1,000, 3,000, 6,000, and 10,000
times.    (Diagram 7.)
    An examination of the diagrams which contain the results of ob
servations on the preceding substances will show that in bodies of the
same constitution the absorption of the ultra-violet rays is greater the
larger the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.             That is to say,
the oils with the higher boiling-points such as calamus, patchouli, and
the denser turpentine oil, are those which are the least transparent
after dilution with alcohol.
    With two exceptions, none of the substances already examined
exhibit absorption bands.          The exceptions alluded to are the first
specimen    of  carraway hydrocarbon, which we shall show further on,
containing a small quantity of cymene, and the blue oil from
patchouli.
    As we shall have occasion to remark on the evident presence of
cymene in several essential oils, it may be convenient to give an
account of specimens of cymene which we have examined, and direct
attention to the absorption bands which are made to appear by
dilnting the liquid to various degrees, as shown in the diagram.
    Cymene No. 1. — This specimen was prepared by Dr. C. R. A. Wright,
and examined optically by Dr. Gladstone.             Its source was probably
oil of lemons.     It began to distil at 172°, and nearly all the liquid
came over below 176" C.
    The portion boiling between 173° and 175° was completely soluble
in fuming sulphuric acid with only a pale brownish coloration. It
was examined first without dilution, and subsequently when diluted
to 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 5,000, 8,000, 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000
volumes.     Three well-defined absorption bands are visible with a dilu
tion of 4,000 and 5,000 times ; a band similar to that lying below the
 line 17 Cd appears to be characteristic of the hydrocarbons derived
 from benzene.      See diagrams of benzene, ethyl-benzene, mesitylene,
 toluene, 4c., in Part   II  of this research (" Phil. Trans.," Part 1, 1879).

exhibited absorption bands coinciding with those shown in No. 1.
    These bands are noticeable in the carraway hydrocarbon.

   The cnrve shown is interesting, because it enables us to make an
approximate estimation of the proportion of cymene contained in the
hydrocarbon, for since the absorption exhibited when the dilution to
•^Ljf  coincides as nearly as possible with that given by cymene at
YiToffi it '8 evident that the thyme hydrocarbon must contain about
i  its volume of this liquid.        The rounding off of the more refrangible
portion of the spectrum is a modification caused by the terpene.

cases by the proportion of cymene present ; hence the diagram repre
senting the absorption in the case of the thyme hydrocarbon gives
the best idea of the modification of the terpene spectrum caused by an
admixture of cymene by reason of the greater number of photographs

 Substances     causing strong absorption bands in the spectrum transmitted by
                                   dilute solutions.
    The following oils and derivatives of essential oils show strong1
absorption bands in their photographed spectra.               For the most part
they     are  bodies  known  to contain   the  aromatic   nucleus as an essential
part of their constitution.        Thus the oils of bay, pimento, and cloves
contain the substance eugenol, C6H3.OH.OCH3.C3H5 ; oil of cassia con
sists of cinnamic aldehyde, C6H5.C2H3.COH ; and oil of aniseed contains
anethol, CgH4.OCH3 C3H. ; and oil of thyme, thymol, C„H3.OH3.C3H7,
    Some other oils, such as bergamot and oil of peppermint, as like
wise the bodies menthole, carvole, and myristicol, have an unknown
constitution.        The three latter substances are known to be isomeric.
(" Journ. Chem. Soc," Gladstone, vol. xxv, p. 1.)
    Great interest is attached to our examination of these, since we con
sider it to be proved from the character of the spectra they transmit,
that the nucleus of menthole is a terpene, while the benzene ring is
the inner basis of carvole and myristicol.            Bergamot appears to be a
terpene      mixed,   with some  derivative   of  the aromatic  series, but oil of
peppermint on the other hand is essentially a substance belonging to
the   latter class.

    The first absorption band commenced midway between lines 12 and
17 Cd, and in a solution containing ao1oa of the oil, this continues
 nearly to the line 18 Cd ; at this point a narrow band of rays is trans
mitted.        The widening out of this band is somewhat rapid between
 s oVoi and nr5TT5> alter which it is somewhat more gradual, there being
 still some absorption     at 1 in 50,000.
     The fraction boiling      between 220 — 240° solutions containing 1 in
 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 were photographed.             The absorption in these
 solutions appears at nearly the same points, but is more intense.           This,
 is quite what one might expect supposing the fraction with the higher
 boiling-point to contain a greater proportion of the absorbing body
 than the other.

                                 Myristicol.
   When a mixture of two substances exhibits absorption bands which
are due to only one of them, the following characters are generally
noticeable : — 1st. There is not unfrequently a haziness about the
transmitted rays ; 2nd. The absorption bands are not well defined ;
3rd.  A comparatively limited amonnt of dilution suffices to obliterate
the chief features of the absorption spectrum. All these points may
be to some extent observed in the spectra of this myristicol, but the
bands are yet so strong that they evidently belong to the predominant
compound.
   On referring to the refractive equivalent of myristicol (Gladstone,
Chemical Society's Journal, vol. xxiii, p. 149), we find that it corre
sponds well with numbers characteristic of compounds of the aromatic
series.    Hence, the conclusion is obvious, that the greater part of the
liquid consists of some benzene derivative.

   The following is a summary of our conclusions with regard to the

the power of absorbing the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, though
they are inferior in this respect to benzene and its derivatives.
   2. Terpenes, with composition C15H.,4, have a greatly increased
absorptive    power.
     Neither the terpenes themselves nor their oxides nor hydrates,,
     3.
exhibit absorption bands under any circumstances when pure, but
always transmit continuous spectra.
  4. Isomeric terpenes transmit spectra which generally differ from
one another in length, or show variations on dilution.
  5. The process of diluting with alcohol enables the presence of
bodies of the aromatic series to be detected in essential oils ; and even
in some cases the amount of these substances present may be approxi
mately determined.

   Preliminary Remarks. — If nitric acid be added to a solution of bile

 By treating a solution of dog's bile with hydrochloric acid, the same

                                                                        ;*
 researches have been called in question by some physiological chemists
 who profess to have repeated his experiments with a negative result,
yet the conclusions drawn by him are practically correct, and have
 led, in my hands, to the discovery of urobilin in the bile of various
animals, in human urine, and to its complete isolation from the latter
fluid.
    Most specimens of high-coloured urine, provided the high colour            is
not due to blood or unchanged bilirubin or biliverdin, show, when
examined with the spectroscope, a dark band at                        F,
                                                           which disappears
completely when the urine           treated with ammonia, and which
                                            is                                 is
moved towards the red end of the spectrum by treatment with solutiou
of caustic soda. The band can be made to reappear after the am
monia treatment by the addition of nitric, hydrochloric, or acetic
acid.
    Since almost all specimens of urine which             examinedI    showed
a band at   F,I   had concluded that this band was due to urobilin, but        I
could not account for the fact that ammonia did not always cause its
disappearance.      I now find that there are two 'pigments in urine which
give   a band  at F.   This discovery was made while         was engaged in
                                                                        I
studying urobilin, for, on treating normal human urine, which was              of
a pale straw colour, in the same manner as that adopted for the
separation of urobilin,      found a pigment of a brownish colour, which,
                                   I
when dissolved in ether, gave two faint bands, one of which was
placed over   F, the other between     and     (see 18 of fignre). The band
                                                 b       D
at   F was not made to disappear by ammonia, nor did acids intensify it.
As a similar band       found in blood sernm, in yelks of eggs, in butter,
cheese, &c., which         is is
                         due to Thudichum's "lutein,"        see no objection
                                                                        I
in accepting that author's name, urolutein, for this pigment. My
object in mentioning this       to call attention to the fact that urobilin
                                       is
is  not the only pigment which gives       band at   a  but urobilin appears
                                                                 F;
to be the only pigment which behaves on treatment with acids and
alkalies in the manner           have described.
                                   I                 The presence of this
pigment urolutein in urine containing urobilin as well, has also led to
the statement which appears in some text- books of physiological
chemistry, that caustic soda, when added to urine containing urobilin,
causes two bands to appear.       The reason is, that caustic soda moves
the urobilin band towards the red, but leaves untouched the band               of
urolutein ;   consequently, two bands are seen instead of one.          When
urobilin alone      present, ammonia causes the complete disappearance
of the band at     F, is
                     and caustic soda moves      towards the red. Accord

  urobilin alone is present, and the neglect of this observation has led to
 disappointment.
     Examination of the Bile- Spectra of various Animals. — If urobilin be
 formed from bile, the question naturally arises, is urobilin present as
 such in the bile of any animal ?          If so, its biliary origin is made more
 certain.    To enable me to reply to this question, I proceeded to
 examine    this fluid in various animals, using in each instance fresh
 bile, and  examining the spectra by means of a Sorby-Browning micro-
 spectroscope, and checking observations — when the amount of fluid at
 my disposal was sufficient for the purpose — by means of a one-prism
chemical spectroscope.
    The bile of the following        animals was examined        : — man, pig, dog,
cat, guinea-pig, rabbit, mouse, sheep, hedge-hog,            ox, crow, blackbird,
chicken, goose, wild duck, duck, frog.
    Among these animals, the bile of the following gave a characteristic
spectrum : — guinea-pig, rabbit, mouse, sheep, ox, crow.                    t
    The darkest green or golden-red bile gave the least characteristic
spectrum.       I have fully described, in the "Spectroscope in Medicine,"
the    colour and spectrum of each specimen, but I shall here merely
mention those facts which throw light upon the origin of urobilin,
namely, that by careful dilution or by examination in a sufficiently
thin depth, a band at F is always visible, that this band is made
darker by acids,      and is made to disappear by adding ammonia.              This
is very    striking    in the case of the bile of the mouse (Chart II,
sp. 12*), which gives a black band, resembling exactly that seen in
febrile human urine.          If Chart    II  be inspected, the most noticeable
appearance     is the  presence   of this  band  in so many spectra.      And one
cannot help also noticing the general resemblance between these bile-
spectra    and those shown in the figure, which are the spectra of
urobilin in various solutions, and treated by various reagents.
   I also attempted to extract urobilin from the liver of the pig, by
means of various solvents, the pounded liver having been extracted
with water, alcohol, ether, chloroform, and acidulated alcohol re
spectively, but without success.
   Separation of Urobilin from Human Urine. — Before describing the-
method which I adopted for the separation of urobilin,             I may make one
or two preliminary observations.               The reagents used were perfectly
pure, and pure ethyl alcohol was used in every instance ; this is a
matter of great importance, as methylated spirit is not suitable for the
separation of such easily decomposed bodies as urobilin.
   The readings of the spectra are those of a photographed scale
adapted to the micro-spectroscope ; and before taking the readings, the
precaution was always adopted of narrowing the slit until the sodium
   •
      The Chart II referred to aboye is reproduced in the " Spectroscope in Medi
cine  |" and accordingly  does not accompany this paper.

30             Dr. C. A. MacMunn.        Researches  into tfie
line stood at the same number on the scale. Of course this would
have been unnecessary if the jaws of the slit had been made to open
¦equally.
   The readings are also given in wave-lengths, the latter having been
¦calculated by means of an interpolation curve ; they are expressed in
millionths of a millimetre.
   Since preliminary observation had shown that there are two pig
ments in urine which give a band at F, it was necessary, if possible,
to get a specimen of urine which contained urobilin only. Accordingly,
the urine of a case of phthisis was chosen, which gave the band at P,
in very slight depths ; this band could be made to disappear by
ammonia, and was moved towards the red by caustic soda.               The
colour of the urine was orange-red.        The urine therefore contained
urobilin, and on six different occasions     I  separated urobilin by the
following method from it ; on each occasion the result was the same.
I may mention that no play of colours was produced by nitric acid
•(containing   nitrous.)
   Experiments. — 230 cub. ceutims. of urine was precipitated by
neutral lead acetate, and filtered, the filtrate which still showed the
urobilin band was precipitated with basic lead acetate and filtered;
the filtrate now showed no band.        The precipitates were united and
extracted with alcohol acidulated with sulphuric acid, and again
thrown on a filter. The filtrate was a fine, clear red fluid giving in
slight depths a well-marked black band at F. Some of this fluid was
put into a separating funnel, a large quantity of water added, and then
chloroform ; the whole well shaken and allowed to stand, the red
chloroform layer separated off and examined, when it was seen to give
the same black band. The remainder of the alcoholic fluid was treated
in the same manner. I had now a fine red fluid, being a solution of
 urobilin in chloroform, with, however, a little turbidity at its surface,
which disappeared after filtration, which was twice repeated.
    An attempt was made to separate some of the colouring matter from
the chloroform with acidulated water, but with a negative result.
    The chloroform was now distilled off, the residue redissolved in
 chloroform, which was again distilled off (in both cases over a water-
bath). The residue was brown-red in colour, glistening on the surface,
 perfectly amorphous, and gave, when examined on the stage of the
 micro-spectroscope,    with a strong light condensed upon its surface, a
 black band at F. It is perfectly soluble in alcohol, chloroform, nitric
 acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, acidulated water,
 partially in ether, both ethereal solution and residue when dissolved
 in alcohol, giving same spectrum ; partially in benzol and in water;
 insoluble in bisulphide of carbon.
    The chloroformic solution gives no precipitate with chloride of
 barium, nor after treatment with ammonia.

     This also gave    a band  near D when treated with ammonia, which
 also caused the disappearance of band a.
    At first it seemed possible that the appearance of these bands s and
 S might have been due to the action of heat on the pigment during
 the evaporation, but on evaporating the chloroformic solution tinder
 the receiver of the air-pump the same result was arrived at.
    Action of Caustic Soda on Solutions. — If the solutions were examined
 in a depth sufficient to show band at F distinctly and caustic soda
 were added, in each case this band disappeared and was replaced by
 another nearer the red.        Thus in ethereal solution the band read
 42 —  47 (or wave-length 517 — 502) ; and in chloroformic solution the

came to     the conclusion that if this supposition were correct there
would be an absence of sulphur in the pigment prepared by a method
in which hydrochloric acid would be used instead of sulphuric.
   Separation of Urobilin by means of Hydrochloric Acid. — This method
was exactly similar to the first, with the exception, that instead of
using alcohol acidulated with sulphuric acid,          I  now used alcohol
acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and the pigment was separated on
four different occasions ; the residue obtained resembled exactly that
got by   the first method, both as to its appearance and as to its solu
bility in different media.
   The spectra of these solutions differed (as I expected they would)
in regard to the band near D, but that at F was exactly the same as
before, and acted in the same manner when treated by ammonia and
sodic hydrate respectively.
   I now proceed to the spectra observed in the solutions of urobilin
obtained by this method.

    In a slight depth the band at P had disappeared. The pigment was
 also soluble in nitric acid and in lactic acid ; in the former there were
no bands, except that at F, visible ; in the latter they resembled those
of the acetic acid solution.
    All   the spectra which I have described will suffice to show that tho
same pigment was evidently present in every solution ; there were
many more observed and measured, but they were not of sufficient
importance to call for their being mentioned here.
    It now became necessary to test the urobilin prepared by the hydro
chloric acid process for sulphur, which was accordingly done ; and not
only was sulphur found to be absent, but the presence of chlorine was
detected, showing that my inference was correct, and that the sulphur
found in the urobilin prepared by the sulphuric acid process was due
to the sulphuric acid used in its preparation, and that the chlorine
found in the urobilin prepared by the hydrochloric acid process was
due to the hydrochloric acid.       But in neither case was there free sul
phuric acid or free hydrochloric acid, and hence the conclusion follows
that the urobilin was in combination with those acids respectively.
    I   think it will be allowed that the bands visible only at certain
depths of the solution belong to the same pigment that gives the band
 at F, hence they all belong to urobilin.    As they are not visible in the
 aqueous    solution, we  can understand why   they are not visible in urine.
 And I may also mention that, although water only appears to take up
 a pigment giving a band at F, yet after evaporation of the water and
 solution of the residue in alcohol, ether, or chloroform, the same bands
 rgain become visible.
                                   Summary.
    1.   Urobilin has been separated from urine.
    2. It has been separated in combination with hydrochloric acid and
 with sulphuric acid respectively.
     3. The spectra of solutions of urobilin obtained by these methods
 respectively differ in the position of certain feeble bands, but agree in
 all having a black band at F, which can be made to disappear on adding
  ammonia in excess, and which is replaced by another band nearer the
 red end of the spectrum on the addition of sodic hydrate.
     4. Urobilin is an amorphous brownish-red pigment, which contains
 carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.         It is soluble in alcohol,
 chloroform, acidulated water, acids ; partially in ether, benzol, and
 water, i.e., if the pigment be separated in combination with hydro
 chloric or sulphuric acid.
     5. Urobilin appears capable of existing in different states of oxida
 tion.
     6.  Urobilin is derived from one of the colouring matters of bile.

36        Researches into the Colouring-matter             of Human Urine.
    7.  Urobilin, is the colouring matter of the bile of the mouse.
    Before concluding this paper             I  should like to call attention to a
peculiarity which the band « of urobilin exhibits : in certain depths it
appears very broad, but in less depths it is seen that the portion of the
band nearest the violet has disappeared.               In other words, the redward
part of the band is the most persistent and is the last to disappear on
dilution. Thus, taking the alcoholic solution of urobilin prepared by
the second process mentioned before, we find that when the extent of
the spectrum is 8 to 80 (or wave-length 694 — 432) this band reads
42 — 67 (or wave-length 517 — 453), but when the extent is 7 to 85 (or
wave-length 702 — 425) then the band reads 47 to 53 (or wave-length
502 — 485.)        Urobilin, like hromaglobin and hrematin, appears to be a
very unstable body, which easily splits up on treatment with reagents
into decomposition products, each giving a peculiar spectrum.                         This
accounts for the differences observed in the spectra obtained by the
different methods       I have    described.

      In this paper we wish to call attention to some experimental facts
which   may give a clue to the real nature of beryllium, an element
which since the beginning of this century has been the enigma of
inorganic chemistry.
  The oxide of beryllium was discovered in 1795 by Vauquelin.        It
was considered a monoxide, BeO, until 1815, when Berzelius* ranged
it,principally on account of its basic sulphates, among the sesqui-
oxides. The weighty reasons for this arrangement, never since refuted,
which Berzelius added later in the fifth edition of his " Lehrbuch d.
Chemie," p. 1225, are too well known to be recorded here.
  In 1842 Awdeefff analysed the double sulphates and fluorides of
beryllium, which showed qualities not agreeing entirely with the analo
gous compounds of aluminium, iron, chromium, &c. As the formula
of these compounds could be written
                                     KO,S03         +   BeO,S03,
                                     SFi+Be¥l,
this was considered by the chemists of that time to support strongly
the old theory. Still the classification of Berzelius prevailed and was
confirmed by H. Rose,J who showed the correspondence of the mole-

Subsequently an elaborate work, De Glucium et de ses Composees,"
1855, by Debray,f once more caused a change in the prevalent opinion.
     Debray regarded beryllia as an isolated member of the series occupy
ing a position intermediate between the monoxides and the sesqui-
oxides, and showing marked analogies with both groups, but not
intimately connected with either of them by isomorphism.                            As the
analyses of its compounds in most cases agreed better with the simple
formula BeO, this was preferable to Be303.
     Klatzo,J in 1868, endeavonred to decide this matter finally by the
assumption of a complete isomorphism between the sulphates of Be
and Mg, Co, Fe, Ni, and though Marignac,§ in 1873, proved that
this pretended isomorphism did not exist, and was founded on a grave
mistake, the opinion that beryllia was a monoxide was at this time
universally accepted by chemists.                   Theoretically this opinion was
founded on the " periodic law
                                          " of                        The classification of
                                                  Mendeleeff.||
beryllium at the head of the second group among the diatomic elements
is a leading point in the theory of MendeleefB.
     If the composition of beryllia was Be203, and the atomic weight of
beryllium=13'8, instead of 9"2, the place of Be=9'2 in the system
would be vacant, and the order of the series partially reversed, the
" atomic analogies " would be overthrown, and, still worse, beryllium
 = 13"8 would find no place at all in the system, except in the fifth
group among the five-atomic elements, to which it certainly does not
belong.
     The final decisive proof still wanting to confirm the ideas of
Mendeleeff's         was furnished, 1877, by Reynolds,^ who found the
specific heat of metallic beryllium=0,642, which (Be=9'2) makes the
atomic heat=5'9, in accordance with the law of Dulong and Petit.
     About a year before the publication of Mr. Reynolds, we had suc
ceeded, by means of a new method, in isolating metallic beryllium from
its chloride.         We employed** a massive crucible of wrought iron,
hermetically closed by a screw-plug, wherein equivalent quantities of
beryllium chloride and metallic sodium were heated to redness.
Metallic beryllium was thus obtained, partly fused into globules, partly
forming aggregations of little prismatic crystals, which in brightness

   We next determined its specific heat by the method of Bnnsen (ice-
calorimeter). "We here met with quite unexpected difficulties ; but,
having given up the original arrangement of the experiment described
by Bunsen* as impracticable, we, by means of an arrangement
similar to that recommended by Schuller and Wartha,f obtained the
following results : — J
           Specific heat of Be=0"4084 between 0° and 100°.
           Atomic heat of Be=5-64 [Be=13 8].
   These results, not in accordance either with those recently obtained
by Mr. Reynolds or the periodic law of Mendeleeff, were not accepted
without hesitation by chemists.      Notwithstanding that, the editor
of the new edition    of  Gmelin's " Handbuch d. Chemie," Professor
Kraut, altered the formulae of beryllia and its compounds in the part of
the great encyclopedia of chemistry then passing through the press,
several other chemists publicly or privately commented on our work,
and urged us to pursue our inquiries further. Among the objections
thus made we deem the following most worthy of discussion.
   Mr. Lothar Meyer § hints that the equivalent of beryllium may be
wrong, and suggests a revision of that number.   If it should be found
lower than 4'0, instead of higher, beryllium may still be considered a
three-atomic element, without upsetting the periodic law.      In that
case it would only be necessary to interpose a new group of metals
between the trivalent and quadrivalent elements.    We had no reason
to doubt the accuracy of the old number (=4-6), which we had found
and verified by many analyses, but we redeemed our promise to Mr.
Lothar Meyer, || and undertook the following determinations of the
atomic weight of beryllium.
   In order to determine this value with the utmost accuracy, we
thought it safest to choose the simplest possible method, viz., the

analysis of its sulphate.         Originally we also thought of analysing the
chloride by titration with silver nitrate, but having found that sublimed
beryllium chloride could not be obtained entirely pure, on account of
its corrosive action on glass, we gave up the idea.
   Sulphate of beryllium is undoubtedly a neutral salt, and is easily
obtained in beautiful crystals, which do not change in the air ; but at
100 — 110° C. it loses half of its water, at 250° it becomes anhydrous,
and after heating to light redness pure beryllia remains.              Still there is a
difficulty in the analysis ; for anhydrous sulphate and pure beryllia,
as obtained by calcination, are both very hygroscopic substances.                   We
therefore chose the hydrated sulphate, which conld be weighed with
the greatest accuracy, as the most fitting substance to start with ; this
salt allowing pulverisation and pressure* without losing a trace of its
constituent water.        The sulphate was prepared by heating to dryness
an aqueous solution of sublimed chloride with an excess of pure sul
phuric acid. By repeated crystallisation the sulphate could easily be
purified from a slight trace of calcium sulphate, originating from
the action of the gaseous chloride on the glass tubes.
   The analyses I, II, refer to beryllium sulphate obtained in this
manner ; for III, IV, the chloride was precipitated with ammonia
and the hydrate treated with sulphuric acid. The sulphate was
repeatedly crystallised.        The difficulty in the analysis is the weighing
of the calcined beryllia.          For this purpose the crucible, still red hot,
was placed in an exsiccator filled with anhydrous phosphoric acid, and
after cooling placed immediately on the scale pan of a Bunge's balance,
the equilibrium being beforehand approximately established.                    In this
manner the whole operation required only a few seconds.
   By spectroscopieal test Professor Thalen has found the beryllia used
for these determinations to be absolutely pure.
   The hydrated beryllium sulphate has given in the determinations,
thus executed, the following values : —

    All  these numbers are higher than 4'0, and consequently the atomic
 weight of beryllium, if trivalent, must be 13-65, consequently higher
 than that of carbon.            The before-mentioned           supposition is conse
 quently proved to be unfounded.
    Mr. Lothar Meyer further observes that the atomic heat of the
 oxygen in beryllia, if a sesquioxide, would be less than in any other
 oxide known.          In the next paper we give the whole series of our
 determinations of the molecular heats of the rare earths and their
 sulphates.      From this survey, which shows that beryllia, with regard
 to heat and volume, occupies its proper place at the head of the
sesqnioxides, we here only extract a few determinations.* If c signifies

    According to the determinations made by ns under identical con
 ditions, and therefore strictly comparable, the atomic heat of oxygen
 in beryllia=Be303 is the same as that in alumina ; this, however, can
 by no means be considered as exceptional. Alumina and beryllia are
the leading members of a group of sesquioxides, wherein the atomic
 heat and (as will be seen from the following paper) the atomic volume
of oxygen increases with increasing values of the atomic weights of
the metals.
    We will now refer to another objection raised to our former re
searches.    Mr. Brauner* admits the specific heat of beryllium to be
0-4084    between 0 — 100°, but supposes that it may rapidly increase
with the temperature in the same way as does the specific heat of
C and Bo. If this were the case, he thinks beryllia could be
BeO, the atomic heat of beryllium =3' 76 between 0 — 100°, and
normal=6'4 first at a much higher temperature.                  In our detailed
paper, we have tried to meet such an objection, by pointing out that no
metallic element is as yet known, the atomic heat of which does not
agree with the law of Dulong and Petit.        However, in order to remove
any doubt in this respect, we have determined the specific heat of
beryllium at different temperatures lying between 0 — 300° C. We
sifted the metal used in our former determinations through a gauze
of platinum, the holes of which were 0 25 sq. millim.                     For the
following experiments we used only that part which did not pass
through the gauze, on the supposition that this, consisting of globules
and larger crystals, was the purer metal.            The analysis confirmed
this opinion, for the composition was found to be —

removed by the results above mentioned.      Fixed at 13' 65, according
to our determinations, the value of its atomic heat becomes perfectly
harmonious    with the law of Dulong and Petit.
    We will, in conclusion, say a few words upon a paper wherein the
results of our former researches have been criticised. In the " Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society," 1879, Mr. Carnelley applies a new
method of calculating the fusion points of halogen compounds, and
applying it to those of beryllium, argues in the following manner : —
    Beryllium must be either a dyad or a triad, and must belong either
to the second or to the third group of Mendeleeff 's series ; if a dyad or
Be=92, its chloride, BeCl2, can be calculated to fuse at + 547 —
+ 600° C, which is confirmed by experiment; if a triad or Be=13"8,
the chloride, BeCl3 or Be3Cl6, ought to fuse about 500 degrees lower,
i.e., at+50°     (-100° C, which it obviously does not; ergo, beryllium
is a dyad, and Be=9"2.
    We presume that Mr. Carnelley's knowledge of the physical pro
perties of the triads        is,
                              like our own, very limited.       With the
exception of aluminium, we really know little or nothing of the
melting or boiling points of chlorides, bromides, and iodides belong
ing to this group, and we think analogies taken only from one
member, aluminium, to be too narrow a base for a calculation
which is    meant to apply to the whole group.     There may be chlorides,
bromides, and iodides which do not behave like A12C18, in regard
to boiling and fusion points. We will, in the following paper, give
reasons for our opinion that beryllium and aluminium are each
leading members of two different groups of trivalent metals.           The
nearest relatives of beryllium among these        are neither calcium and
magnesium, with which         has, in fact, little or nothing in common,
                             it
nor aluminium, with which          has very much more in common, but
                                   it
rather the rare elements, scandium, yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium.
We believe that Mr. Carnelley ought to try his calculation on the
halogen compounds       of the rare elements before asserting " that
Nilson's and Pettersson's determination of the specific heat of
 beryllium must be incorrect."     If the properties of the halogen com
 pounds of these elements should be found to agree with the calcula
 tion, then we confess that the matter becomes somewhat uncertain,
 for then one will have to choose between the law of Dulong and
 Petit and that of Carnelley.*
    Our above-mentioned experimental researches, confirmed still more
 by the experiments, which will be quoted in a second paper, lead ns
 to the conclusion that the real atomic weight of beryllium is=13"65.
 But with this value the periodic law cannot admit this element among
 the metals nearest related, and this fact obviously militates against its

general applicability. Before concluding this memoir, we will just point
out that this is not an isolated case of its kind.       For the element which
should take its place between Sb=122 and 1=127, the periodic law
requires an atomic weight =12-5 ; with regard to its general properties
tellurium is quite admissible in this place, but its atomic weight=128
is too high. Although this number was the result of the determina
tions of Berzelius and v. Hauer, this want of accordance with the
 periodic law induced Willis* to make a new determination,              but he
 only confirmed the former results.         Thus neither tellurium nor beryl
lium can be fitted into MendeleefPs system.                  And further, after
Conncler'sf discovery of the boroxychloride, BoOCl3, boron may
be considered as five-atomic, but it certainly cannot be placed among
elements of that valence ; and when once the chemistry of the rare
earth-metals shall be made clear, where can be placed all these
elements, the number of which has already become very great and
doubtless will be still augmented ? Already erbium and ytterbium,
with the now fixed atomic weights of 166J and 173,§ for the pure
metals (the earths=Er203 and Yb203), can scarcely bo ranged in
Mendeleeff's system in places indicated by their relation to the other
earth-metals or by their " atomic analogies."
   In consequence of what has been indicated here, the periodic law in
its present condition cannot be said to be quite an adequate expression
for our knowledge of the elements ; this theory, however, having
given the most striking proofs that the truth in many respects has
been found (as for example : the new formulas for the rare earths
=1^03 instead of RO, and the discovery of gallium and scandium,
the existence    of which the law has foreseen in the elements eka-
aluminium and eka-boron), we may expect that tho periodic law may
be so modified and developed        that it can embrace and explain every
fact, stated by experiment.

       and then- Sulphates."                By L. F. Nilson and Otto
       Pettersson.           Communicated by Warren De La Rue,
       D.C.L., F.R.S. Received June 21, 1880.
   At   the request of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, we
some years ago undertook an extended research into the physical pro
perties   of the rare earth-metals         and their compounds.          Having per
formed the laborious task of separating and purifying their oxides, we
are now able to publish our first series of determinations                concerning
their principal properties, which chemically are of the greatest im
portance, viz., molecular heat and molecular volume.
    The rare earths, with a few exceptions (CeO,,, Th02, ZrO»), belong
co a group of sesquioxides.           In order to obtain a larger number for
comparison, we have extended our research not only to the rare earths,
but also to some other nearly related compounds, the molecular heat
and volume of which were hitherto unknown.                      As to these values,
previously known for some other oxides, A1203, Fe203, Cr203, according
to Regnault, Kopp, and others, we have already observed in our pre
ceding paper ""On the Essential Properties and Chemical Character of
Beryllium," that only such determinations                 are strictly comparable
which are made by the same method, under the same circumstances,
and referred to the same unit of measure.
    The specific densities and molecular volumes, which are given in
the following tables, are obtained by means of a method, specially
adapted to prevent the errors arising from adhesion of air to pulve
rulent substances.*         The densities taken by this method will there
fore generally.be found a little higher and the molecular volumes a
little lower than the numbers usually given by others.
    The specific heats of the different compounds are determined with
Bunsen's ice-calorimeter, by means of the same process which we have
more fully described in our detailed memoir on beryllium.                  f   All the
numbers given are the means of at least two determinations, which
agree perfectly, the experiments being made under the most favourable
circumstances.        As to the values obtained, we beg to observe that the
specific and molecular heat will be found a little smaller by the ice-
melting method than by other methods, on account of the different
unit of comparison.
    The molecular weight of the different oxides was determined by a
special analysis or synthesis of the sulphates, and the very same chemi-

   Hitherto it was supposed to be a general rule, that the atomic heat
of oxygen     in any oxide was not less than 3'5 or greater than 5"1. The
numbers above given compel us, however, to assign a still lower value
to the atomic heat of oxygen in alumina and beryllia, viz., 2-34.§                   Into
these oxides it enters with a minimum capacity of heat and volume.
From these earths upwards the molecular heat and volume of the ses-
quioxides gradually increase with increasing molecular weights.
   The following table shows that the molecular heat (1) of Er2Og,
YbjOg, LatjOj, and Di203 nearly agrees with those for other sesqui-
oxides, determined         by Regnault;        (2) that of Be203, approaches to
the same for alumina ; and (3) that of Zr02, Ce02, and Th02 is as
high as the values for Sn02, Ti02, and zircon, determined by the
same author, and for Mn02 according to Kopp.                          The validity of
Neumann's       law  receives   hereby   a  new   confirmation.

    The molecular heat of the anhydrous sulphates of the sesquioxides
 varies only within very narrow limits ; 61'60 — 68 96 for yttrium and
 didymium sulphate.          The values for the salts of chromium, iron, in
 dium, lanthanum,      cerium, and didymium are nearly identical ; whilst
 even the values of the remainder approach each other very nearly.
    As the following hydrated sulphates are decomposed when heated
 to 100°, their capacity of heat was determined between 0" and 46°
 in the Vapour of boiling CS2 ; the beryllium sulphate not bearing even
 that temperature without losing water, its molecular heat could not
 be ascertained.

   The molecular heat and volume                 of free water being =18, it will be
seen that by entering into combination                with the sulphates of the rare
earth-metals, its heat and volume are reduced in an extraordinary
degree.      In fact, the molecular heat and volume of water in these
salts descends to a minimum value hitherto unknown.
   Comparing the values given above, we readily find that in those
groups of compounds intimately connected by isomorphism, the
molecular heat of the compounds increases and the molecular volume
decreases with increasing molecular weight of the compound or atomic
weight of the element.              This will be shown by the following table, in
which the different isomorphous compounds, partly of yttrium, erbium,
and ytterbium, partly of lanthanum and didymium, are brought into
comparison       : —

   Especially   with   regard to beryllia, and the question of its real
composition, the values given above are of the greatest importance.
In respect of this we observe that : 1st, the atomic heat of oxygen in
beryllia is identical with that in alumina and nearly identical with the
same value in other closely related oxides, if beryllia =Be503 (see our
preceding paper, p. 42) ; 2nd, under the same supposition the
molecular heat and volume of beryllia and alumina are nearly identical,
whether the latter earth be examined in the state of crystallised
sapphire or of an amorphous powder, and, further, if we consider
                                                     Al»*

                                                     ^
yielded   identical values  ;  3rd, the molecular heat and value           of beryl
lium sulphate, compared with the same values for the other nearly
allied sulphates of aluminium, scandium, gallium, and yttrium, support
the formula Be203 which we have given.
   Taking into consideration the above-mentioned circumstances, and
those related in our former papers, with the fact that the atomic heat
 and volume of metallic beryllium, as well as the molecular heat and
volume of beryllia and its sulphate, would assume values quite ex
ceptional, if the formula for the oxide were BeO, we think, there
fore, the question of the valence of beryllium may be considered
as finally decided.     In fact, there is no physical property of beryllium,
beryllia, or its sulphates, which does not testify to our view
being the correct one, and from a chemical point of view the same
holds good.     It is, we think, unnecessary to take up space here with
a repetition of the various reasons which support this conclusion.
We refer, therefore, to our detailed paper on beryllium, above quoted,
and only mention here that this metal belongs on account of its

  beryllium, namely, that the chloride fuses and sublimes at a higher

 difficultly fusible and volatilisable chlorides, many analogies exist for
 beryllium, not only in this but in many other respects.

    The  following investigation was commenced with Mr. Lockyer, and
although he has been unable to continue the work, the author is
indebted to him for much aid and many suggestions.
    The cobalt salt first examined was the anhydrous chloride. In order
to establish clearly its absorption spectrum, different samples of this salt
were    made   by various processes. All, however, gave the same spec
trum.      The bromide of cobalt yields a similar spectrum, but its posi
tion is different, it is nearer to the red.

   On fusing cobalt chloride with potassic chloride, a greenish-bine
mass is formed, which gives a spectrum entirely different from that of
the chloride when alone. Judging from the fusing-point of the mix
ture being lower than that of the components, and the cobalt salt not
decomposing in this mixture on fusion in contact with air, it seemed
natural to suppose that a new compound had been formed, and that it
gave rise to the new spectrum.        Further experiment showed, how
ever, that this is not the case for other solid chlorides, such as of
sodium and zinc give with cobalt chloride the same spectrum ; and
liquids in which the cobalt chloride easily dissolves, such as ordinary or
amylic alcohol, the saline ethers, glycerine, and hydrochloric acid, also
give this same spectrum ; in fact, this spectrum is produced whenever
cobalt chloride dissolves freely in any menstruum without definitely
combining with it. A careful set of experiments were made in the
case of the solid chlorides, to exclude the presence of water, for it
was possible that the spectrum in all the above cases might be due to
a trace of water, which, by its combining with the cobalt chloride,
formed    in every instance the spectrum-giving body.
   The bromide and iodide of cobalt, when fused with potassium
bromide and potassium iodide respectively, give results corresponding
to those of the chloride, but the bands in the spectrum of the
bromide, and still more so those of the iodide, are nearer to the red
than the corresponding bands of the chloride. The aciion of heat
and of water on the bodies producing these spectra is discussed, and it
is pointed out how the definite compound with zinc was indicated by
the spectrum.   The action of liquids which easily dissolve the cobalt
chloride is next described, and as all give the same spectrum, and
this spectrum is identical with that obtained with the fused chlorides,
the conclusion drawn is, as before stated, that this spectrum must
be that of the cobalt chloride, only, owing to solution, it is in a mole
cular state, different from that obtained on fusing this salt alone.
This spectrum, when obtained in the hydrochloric acid solution, is
remarkable for its persistence under varying circumstances, and for its
being a reaction of great delicacy.
   Hydrochloric acid as a solvent for the cobalt chloride differs in one
respect from all the other solvents which have as yet been examined,
namely, that, whether much or little cobalt be dissolved in      it,
                                                                 the spec
trum is  the same ; whereas with dry alcohol, for instance, a saturated,
or nearly saturated, solution gives the spectrum above mentioned, but
a dilute solution, one containing about 20 grms. of the chloride in 100
cub. centims. of nlcohol, gives a spectrum somewhat different         new
                                                                       :   a
band appears and others which were present fade out     :    this dilution
                                                            if
be carried on still further, so that only about 0'008 grm. of the
chloride be present in 100 cub. centims. of alcohol, an entirely different
spectrum    isobtained, but on carrying the dilution beyond this no

further change takes place.      With other liquids which dissolve the
cobalt salt freely, a similar series of changes occur, but if liquids in
which the chloride is much less soluble be used, then according to their
solvent power only the first (or most dilute stage), or the first and
second stage, is obtainable ; for instance, if dry ether is used as the
solvent,it yields only a spectrum corresponding to the first stage.
With anhydrous acetic acid, in which the cobalt chloride is more freely
soluble,   both    the first and second stage are obtainable.  If the dry
chloride   in   fine powder be shaken up with a liquid in which it is inso
luble, such     as carbontetrachloride, then only a spectrum similar to
that of the fused chloride is visible.
   The anhydrous cobalt chloride dissolved in water gives a pink solu
tion.    This solution, when it contains as little as O'l grm., or as much
as 25 grms., of the salt in 100 cub. centims. of water, gives only a
wide absorption-band, shading off on both sides, and whether a short
column of the strong solution or a correspondingly long column of
the dilute solution be examined, identical spectra are obtained, so that
within these limits the same compound appears to exist in the solution.
If, however, the solution approaches saturation (100 cub. centims. of
water can dissolve at 10° 32 grms. of the cobalt chloride), then another
spectrum is visible, and this is again the spectrum of the dissolved
¦chloride :   the same spectrum as is obtained either by dissolving
cobalt chloride in fused potassium        chloride, or in alcohol, or in
hydrochloric acid, thus apparently the anhydrous chloride exists in
an aqueous solution.      The action of heat, and the action of bodies
capable     of combining with water, in aqueous solutions of cobalt
chloride, are identical, both tending to destroy the broad absorption
band of the hydrate, and to form the banded spectrum of the dissolved
anhydrous chloride.
   The very characteristic spectrum of the oxide of cobalt is well known.
The precipitate obtained by the addition of potash or soda in excess to
any cobaltous salt, shows well this spectrum.       If ammonia be the pre
cipitant, a somewhat simpler spectrum is obtained.       Vogel has already
pointed out the similarity of the spectrum of a piece of cobalt glass
and this oxide spectrum.       The glass spectrum is apparently similar
to the spectrum formed       by the precipitate with potash and soda,
probably then the extra band visible in these cases and not when
ammonia is used, is due to a compound of the alkali and cobalt.        The
bearing of these spectra on Winkler's supposed cobaltate of potash is
then discussed.     Further, it is shown that if the above precipitation
of oxide be made in solutions in which the cobalt salt is in excess, or
even if precipitated oxide be warmed or shaken up in the cold with a
solution of cobalt chloride, a new compound is formed, an oxychloride
which gives a different spectrum ; its formation and its decomposition
by water is well traced in the varying spectra producible from         and it,

goes band in hand with the chemical changes which occur.              From the
spectroscopic appearance      it  is argued  that  the bine precipitated oxide
is not a hydrate, but that it does very readily undergo change as the
mere alteration of colour which takes place shows.          Aqueous solutions
of the bromide and iodide of cobalt when acted on by alkalies undergo
changes similar to those which the chloride undergoes, and, as in the
former cases, the iodide spectrum is always nearer the red end of the
spectrum than the corresponding bromide spectrum, and the bromide
than the chloride spectrum.
    The salts of the oxygen acids when in aqueous solution do not give
sharp banded spectra as the haloid salts do, but only a large shading
off absorption like the hydrate of the cobalt chloride.
    The other points discussed in detail are, first, the nature of the
precipitate formed by the action of sodic or potassic carbonate on a
cobaltous salt, and it is shown that the formation of the oxide always
found in this precipitate is owing to an after decomposition, the pre
cipitate as first formed being entirely free from all oxide, and it
 gradually appearing after a short time.         The other point is the action
of heat on cobalt phosphate dissolved in fused microcosmic salt ; when
cold there appears somewhat indistinctly a banded spectrum of a
phosphate, on heating this the spectrum disappears, and the spectrum
 of the oxide very distinctly takes it place ; on cooling, the first
 spectrum returns, and this change may apparently be repeated any
 number of times.
    Drawings of all the different spectra are given in the full paper.

                                     (Abstract.)
    These   experiments    relate to the friction of fluids when flowing
 ns?ainst rough solid surfaces.       It is well known that a boari dragged
 through    water  suffers a  resistance    which, at speeds not very small,
 varies nearly as the square of the velocity.          The fluid surrounding
 the board does not behave as a solid, but shearing and eddying motions
 are set up which give rise to losses of energy distributed throughout
 the fluid mass.
    Most of the existing knowledge of fluid friction has been derived
 from the observation of the flow of water in pipes and canals.          But in

   1880.J                On the  Friction of Water,   $-c.                    55
  these cases,  the motion of the fluid is complex, and the observations
  themselves are difficult.      The principal direct experiments on fluid
  friction are those of Coulomb and of the late Mr. W. Froude.             Cou
  lomb's experiments were made by oscillating a thin disk, suspended in
  the fluid by a wire, in its own plane.     The gradual diminution of the
  range of the oscillations gave a measure of work lost in fluid friction, on
 the surface of the disk. Coulomb's experiments were made at very low
  velocities, and, indeed, the method which he employed would be quite
 unsuitable for greater speeds of oscillation.       The results at which he
                        —
 arrived were these : (a.) The frictional resistance to the motion of
 the disk varied nearly as the velocity ; (6.) The friction was nearly
 independent of the roughness of the surface ; (c.) The friction was
 very much increased if the viscidity of the fluid was increased.
     Mr. Fronde's experiments were made in a very different way.
 He towed boards of lengths varying from 5 to 50 feet, in a still
 water canal, and measured by a spring dynamometer the resistance to
 the motion.      His experiments were all made at speeds much higher
 than those employed by Coulomb. His results may be summarised
 thus : — (a.) The friction varies nearly as the square of the velocity of
 the board, the precise index of the speed to which the friction is pro
 portional depending on the nature of the surface of the board ; (6.) The
frictional resistance per square foot of the surface of the board is
greater for short than for long boards ; (c.) The frictional resistance
 varies very greatly with the roughness of the surface of the board.
     The differences between the results of the experiments of Coulomb
and Froude show that the phenomena of fluid friction at very low
and at high, speeds are essentially different. It appeared to the author
that it would be useful to make some experiments at speeds similar to
those in Mr. Froude's experiments, but with an apparatus on a smaller
scale, which would permit a greater variation of the conditions of the
experiments.        A series of disks, of 10 inches to 20 inches in diameter,
were rotated     in water by an engine, and the resistance to continuous
rotation at different speeds was measured.            Thus the experiments
were virtually the same       as Mr. Froude's,  but with   a surface of infinite
length substituted for surfaces of limited length.          The roughness of
the surface of the        disk  was  varied,  the smoothest disks being of
turned and polished brass ; the roughest having surfaces of sand and
gravel cemented on to the metal disk.
    The disks were rotated in a cylindrical chamber, the size of which
could be varied, so that the mass of water operated on, or the thickness
of the layer of water in contact with the disk, could be modified at
will. Further, the roughness of the surface of the chamber in which
the disks were rotated was varied in the same way as the roughness of
the disks themselves. . To determine the effect of the viscidity of the
liquid in altering the amount of friction, experiments were made with
                                                                   f 2

a solution of sugar in water.      Lastly, a series of experiments were
made with water at different temperatures.            Altogether several
hundred observations of the resistance      of the disks under different
conditions were recorded.
   The figure shows a section of the apparatus employed. DD is the disk,
the friction of which, when rotated in fluid, is to be measured.    This
is keyed on a shaft, SS, which was driven from a hot-air engine by
means of a catgut belt. The disk is placed in a cast-iron cistern, CC,

 containing the fluid.       Between the disk C and the outer cistern, how
 ever,  is the   light cylindrical copper chamber, AA, suspended by three
 fine wires    from a crosshead, B. EE is a diaphragm, which could be
 moved up or down so as to alter the volume of water in the chamber
 in which the disk rotates.        K is a brake for regulating the speed of
 the disk. W is the position of a counting arrangement for determining
 the speed of the disk.       G is a scale-pan in which weights were placed.
 This was connected by a fine silk cord with an arc attached to the
 chamber AA.          The weight in this scale-pan exactly measures the
 tendency of the chamber AA to rotate, in consequence of the rotation
of the fluid inside it.        But since action and reaction are equal, the
tendency of the chamber AA to rotate is, when the motion is uniform,
exactly equal to the friction of the surface of the disk, DD.               This
method of measuring the friction of the disk, by measuring the re
action of the vessel containing it, was first used (so far as the author
is aware) by Professor James Thomson. A short note on some experi
ments made in this way was communicated by him to the Royal
Society in 1855, but the details of these experiments have never been
published.       The principle is the same as that employed by Mr. Froude,
in his     " Fluid Dynamometer." The general results of the experi
ments made with the apparatus                described above are in striking
numerical agreement with Mr. Fronde's results, so far as the con
ditions of the experiments are similar.             But, from the small size of
the apparatus, it has been possible to vary the conditions somewhat
more than would be possible with the great canal of Mr. Froude.
The results obtained may be summarised as follows : —
    (1.) The resistance of disks of different diameters, but similar in
other respects, varies as the fifth power of the diameter nearly, or,
more exactly, as the 4'85th power.
    (2.) The resistance varies with the roughness of the surface of the
disk to an extent quite as great as in the experiments of Mr. Froude.
    (3.) The friction increases in every case with the size of the
chamber in which the disk is rotated.                This result was certainly
unexpected.         Even  if the increase of resistance is due to the increase
of the surface of the chamber, this result indicates another marked
difference between the phenomena of fluid friction at high and at low
speeds.      At very low speeds the resistance would decrease considerably
as  the size   of the chamber increased.
    (4.) Roughening the surface of the chamber in which the disk is
rotated increases the resistance of the disk considerably ; in some
cases   the increase is as great    as  when the disk itself is roughened.
    (5.) The resistance of the disk at different speeds varies nearly as
the square of the speed.         But the exact power of the speed to which
the resistance is proportional varies a little for different surfaces.      The
indices     of  the  powers   of the   speed  to  which   the resistance is pro

portional are almost exactly the same for similar surfaces, in these
experiments, as in Mr. Fronde's experiments.
   (6.) A series of experiments were made on the influence of the
temperature of the water on the friction, and the author is not aware
that any direct experiments on fluid friction, at different temperatures,
have previously been made.       The experiments show that the friction
diminishes rapidly with increase of temperature.       The alteration is so
great  that even  five degrees variation of temperature alters the friction
by about one per cent.
   (7.) When the viscidity of the fluid was increased by dissolving
half a hundredweight of sugar in the water of the cistern, the f rictional
resistance of the disk was increased.       But the proportionate increase
of resistance was much less than that observed by Coulomb, in a similar
experiment at a very low velocity.
   At  the close of the Meeting Professor Graham       Bell made    experi
ments with his Photophone.

readily and completely in saturated NaCl solution ; but if they have
been previously treated with ether they only become vacuolated.
    b. Chemical Observations. — The seeds were ground in a hand-mill,
and treated with alcohol or ether to remove the oil.
    The watery extract of the seeds gives no precipitate on boiling. On
concentrating the fluid, and then allowing it to filter into alcohol, a
dense precipitate is formed.      This substance is readily soluble in dis
tilled water, and its solution gives the xanthoproteic and Millon's
reactions, a rose colour with KHO and CuS04, a precipitate on the
addition of HN03) and an immediate precipitate on the addition of
potassic ferrocyanide after acidification with acetic acid.
    The 10 per cent. NaCl extract gives a precipitate on boiling, and on
saturation with NaCl.
    The saturated NaCl extract gives, when the seeds have previously
been treated with alcohol, a dense precipitate on boiling, and on
dilntion; if the seeds have been previously treated with ether, the
amount of the precipitate is much less ; boiling produces little more
than a turbidity.
     These observations, taken together, show that these grains contain :
 (1) a substance (vegetable peptone or hemialbumose) which is soluble
 in water ; (2) a substance which is soluble in 10 per cent. NaCl solu
 tion, precipitable from its solution by saturation with NaCl, and which
 therefore belongs to the group of myosin-globulins ; (3) a substance
 which is soluble in saturated NaCl solution, whether the grains have
 been treated with alcohol or ether, and which therefore belongs to the
 group of the vitellin-globulins ; and (4) a substance which, like the
 crystalloids of Ricinus described in a previous communication, is
 soluble in satnrated NaCl solution only after previous treatment with
 alcohol.
       V. The Aleurone-Grains of the   Brazil-Nut (Bertholletia excelsa).
     a. Microscopical Observations. — Like those of Ricinus, the grains of
 this plant present no indication of a complex structure when mounted
 in alcohol ; on the addition of water they become transparent, and the
 crystalloid, as well as the curiously irregular globoid, can be seen.
     On treatment with 10 per cent. NaCl solution, the whole grain
 (excepting, of course, the globoid) dissolves.
     Treatment with saturated NaCl solution produces the same result,

and        it is not affected by previous treatment of the grains with ether or
alcohol.
     Chemical Observations. — The seeds were crushed in a mortar, and
      b.
then treated with either alcohol or ether to remove the oil.
   The watery extract of the seeds gives a slight precipitate on boiling ;
the filtrate gives no     precipitate on boiling ; it gives the reactions of a
fluid       holding peptones in solution ; it also gives a precipitate with
HN03.
   The 10 per cent. NaCl extract gives a dense precipitate on boiling,
as well as on dilution, and on saturation with NaCl.
   The saturated NaCl extract gives a dense precipitate on boiling and
on    dilution.
     From           these observations      it appears that these grains consist   of
vegetable peptone and                of   globulins, the one belonging to the myosin,
the otherto the vitellin group.
   Weyl has shown ("Zeitschr. f. Physiol. Chem.," Bd. I, 1877) that
the crystalloids of these grains consist of pure vitellin ; hence the
peptone and the myosin must be contained in the ground-substance of
the    grains.
                                           General EemarJcs.
  The investigation of the aleurone-grains of a number of different
species of plants has shown that, with a few exceptions mentioned
below, they may be classified under the five types which have been
described           in this and previous communications.          I
                                                          find, contrary to
the  opinion  of Pfeffer (" Jahrb. f. wiss. Bot." viii, 1872),  that all the
alenrone-grains which                 I
                           have examined are soluble to some extent at
least in water ; they are also all soluble to some extent in 10 per cent.
NaCl solution. In the cases which have been described in detail, the
grains were found to be completely soluble in this solution, but in
others          I
           found that the grains were only partially soluble in                    it,
residue dissolving either in     per cent. Na^COa solution, or in dilute

may be regarded as altered globulin.

that the observations upon which this arrangement          depends are,

      From     the Physiological Laboratory of University            College, London.
   In    a preliminary note on the ossification of the terminal phalanges
of the digits,* it was stated that the diaphyses of the ungual phalanges
differed in their mode of ossification from those of other long bones.
The object of the present paper is to give an account of the process of

ossification in these phalanges, the peculiar features of which have been
found, with slight modifications, to remain constant throughout the
whole series of Vertebrata.
     It will be remembered that all long bones are at an early stage pre
formed in cartilage, and that simultaneously with the calcification of
the cartilaginous shaft a deposit of true bone takes place in the invest
ing subperiosteal tissue ; so that at a certain stage in development the
so-called " primary
                           " or
                                  cartilage bone of the shaft is surrounded by a
hollow cylinder of " secondary
                                           " or true bone. An
                                                                       irruption of the
osteoblastic subperiosteal           tissue into the cartilage then takes place,
which results eventually in the absorption of the primary bone and
its replacement by true osseous tissue, to be in its turn alternatcly
absorbed and renewed so long as the process of growth goes on.
     Cartilage that is about to undergo calcification presents certain
characteristic appearances ; the cells with their cell-spaces become
larger, flatten out, and usually show a tendency to arrange themselves
in parallel rows, between which, if the change has already been in
progress for some time, the lines of calcification may be seen advancing.
 J3ut whereas in the long bones as a whole,* including the first and
second phalanges of the digits, the alteration of the cartilage cells,
followed by calcification of the matrix, appears first in the centre of the
 shaft and spreads thence pari passu towards the two extremities ; in the
ungual phalanx it is first seen to arise in tho tip or distal extremity of
the cartilage, from which point it spreads gradually backwards towards
the base of the phalanx (figs. 2, 3).                   Similarly the subperiosteal
deposit      of  membrane        bone   in  all other   cases   begins as a thin and
narrow ring surrounding the shaft and placed midway between the
two extremities, that is to say, in direct relation with the spot where
the cartilage first begins to calcify ; in the ungual phalanx, however,
 still preserving its relation with the point of commencing calcification
 in the cartilage, the deposit of subperiosteal bone first appears as a thin
 layer closely applied to the tip of the cartilage and fitting over it like
 a cap.       The ring or hollow cylinder of bone formed in ordinary
 cases enlarges in two ways, becoming thickened by the continual
 deposition of new osseous tissue on its outer surface, and at the same
 time growing at its edges towards the extremities of the shaft, thus
 accompanying along the outer surface of the cartilaginous diaphysis
     * Dec. 9. —Further observations have shown that the received account as given
 above requires some modification.         In the ordinary phalanges, which differ from
  most  other  long bones by having only one epiphysis, the changes accompanying the
 calcification of the cartilage do not go on in precisely the same manner towards each
  extremity.    The well-known lines of advancing calcification which run between
  ro«"s of single cells parallel with the axis of the shaft, are in the ossifying phalanx
  only visible towards the proximal end ; that is to say, the end which will be crowned
  by the future epiphysis.      As might be expected, there is no difference in this respect
  between the proximal ends of the last and of the other phalanges.

   1880.]     Ossification of the Terminal Phalanges     of the Digits.     65
  the changes    that are taking place within ; the whole process resulting
  in the assumption by the bony cylinder of the form of a dice-box with
  both ends open, and the median constriction partially or entirely filled
  in from the outside.     Subject to its peculiar conformation, the growth
  of the bony layer in the ungual phalanx is analogous to the foregoing
  process.    A thickening takes place by the addition of new bone to the
  outer surface of the cap, and simultaneously with this its edges grow
  backwards along the cartilage from the tip towards the base (in the
 same direction as that previously taken by the process of cartilage
 calcification), so that the cap becomes deeper and deeper, and finally
 reaches a stage in which it may be compared to a thimble fitting over
 the cartilaginous phalanx and enclosing it almost up to its base (see
 figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, p,p).  The deposition of new bone along the outer surface
of this cap or thimble may take place relatively much more quickly at
the summit than at the sides, so that an expansion is formed, which
may be of considerable size, and which no doubt bears a relation to the
conformation of the future nail, hoof, or claw (see fig. 2). The next
stage in the development of the bone is marked by the irruption of the
subperiosteal tissue with blood-vessels and osteoblasts into the shaft at
or near the point where the cartilage first began to calcify. This point
in all other cases will be found about the middle of the shaft, but in
the ungual phalanx, as has been seen, at the tip.             In fig. 1, which
represents a section in the sagittal plane through the growing ungual
phalanx of a foetal cat, the irruption is seen to have taken place at a
point just below the tip on its plantar aspect, and this would appear to
be the most usual locality.       In figs. 2, 3, representing similar sections
from the pig and the human subject at an earlier stage of development,
the points at which the invasion will probably begin are indicated by
the letters i, i. The advance of the osteoblastic tissue into the carti
laginous diaphysis, its gradual absorption of the primary bone, and the
laying down of true osseous tissue in its stead, follow in all cases the
direction already taken by the previous process of calcification ; that is
to say, in other long bones from the middle towards the two ex
tremities, in the ungual phalanx from the tip towards the base. Thus,
to sum up, in the development of the ungual phalanx the three pro
cesses of cartilage calcification, growth of the subperiosteal       intramem-
branous bone, and deposition of true bone in the shaft along the line of
advance of the osteoblastic ingrowth, take the distal extremity of the
shaft instead of its middle for their starting-point, and proceed in one
uniform direction from tip to base, instead of advancing in two
contrary directions at the same time. Hence it seems that the distal
extremity of the ungual phalanx corresponds morphologically with the
centre of the diaphysis in other long bones.
    At a period of growth subsequent to the complete ossification of the
diaphysis, an epiphysis forms, as is well known, in the cartilaginous

  head which     still remains at the proximal end of the phalanx, and this
  becomes nnited to the shaft           in the usual manner.
     The process of ossification in the terminal phalanx having now been
  described in general terms, it only remains to notice certain special
  points of interest that have come under observation during the investi
  gation of the subject.
     It should be first mentioned that the peculiarity described appears
  to be universal, the same general description applying to any terminal
  phalanx, whether taken from the manus or pes, and whether belonging
  to a fully functional or to a mere aborted digit, such as the second
  and fifth in the manus of the pig. An examination of the growing
  bone with a view to this point would probably suffice to decide whether
  the phalanx missing from certain digits in the manus of Pteropus and
  other bats is really the third (as described, see Flower, " Osteology
  of the Mammalia," 1876, p. 264), or whether it may not rather be the
  second.
     A comparison of a series of specimens taken from man, the mole,
  the rat, the pig, and other animals, seems to indicate that the primitive
 cartilaginous terminal phalanx exists normally as a subcylindrical bar
 of comparatively simple conformation ;* while the remarkable modifi
 cations of shape which the adult phalanx assumes throughout the
 whole range of the mammalia are due to the superstructure erected on
 this basis by purely intramembranous ossification in the form of the
 subperiosteal cap, and of what may be called the ungual expansion at
 its summit. Thus, in the mole, the primitive cartilaginous terminal
 phalanx presents no distinctive character ; it resembles in shape the
 cartilage of the young pig, as seen in fig. 3, but is relatively a little
 shorter and thicker. When, however, the subperiosteal growth begins,
 it is seen that a separate centre for the accumulation of the bony
 deposit has established itself on each side of the tip of the phalanx,
 the two being connected by a film of bone over the tip itself, so that
 the resulting cap has two summits instead of one.                      At a later stage
 these two summits are found to have increased considerably in height
 and thickness, and to have encroached upon and partly filled up the
 interval between them. In this way the growth of the bifid cap pro
ceeds until, after the normal changes, the ungual phalanx of the manus
in the adult mole presents a highly modified appearance, being un
usually long and deeply cleft at its extremity, thus contrasting strongly
with the cartilaginous basework on which it was fashioned.                         Again,
in the cat and other carnivora, the hood-like expansion of bone which
in the adult is reflected over the base of the claw must owe its origin
entirely to a process of intramembranous ossification, since no trace
    * This sliape is liable to a slighf modification from the growth of the cartilage at
its proximal end after    the process of calcificat ion has already begun at the tip. See
description of fig.  2.

    1880.]     Ossification  of the Terminal Phalanges       of  the  Digits.     67
   of it is discoverable     in the specimen drawn in fig.         1, in which the-
   cartilaginous diaphysis has received its final development,                and is
   already   in process   of being  destroyed.    That  this  structure   makes   its
   first appearance at a very late stage in the development of the phalanx,
   is shown by the fact that it had not yet begun to be formed in another
   cat embryo 8 centims.         long.   An examination of the process of
   growth   in  the long tapering ungual phalanges of certain seals might
   show that for the greater portion of their length they were formed
   entirely from the ungual expansion of the subperiosteal cap, and had
   never pre-existed as cartilage. Illustrations of the simple outline of the
   primitive cartilaginous diaphysis, and of the variety of the forms that
   may be assumed by its bony superstructure, are afforded by figs. 2, 3r
  in neither of which has any absorption of the cartilage yet taken place.
  In fig. 3, taken from a foetal pig, the young phalanx, which is destined
  to support a hoof, is seen to have its subperiosteal cap greatly enlarged
  on the   palmar aspect.
     As an example of the process in birds, the terminal phalanges of the
  secoud and third digits of the manus, and of all the digits of the pes,
  were examined in a young sparrow.            The calcification of the cartilage
  and its attendant changes, and the formation of the subperiosteal cap,
  were seen to be starting from the tip, and proceeding in exactly the
  same manner as already described ; specimens, however, to show the
  invasion of the cartilage by osteoblastic tissue could not at that time
  be  conveniently obtained.
     Among reptiles, a young alligator showed the same processes with
 •Treat clearness ; but it was again impossible to procure a specimen
 sufficiently advanced to exhibit the course of the osteoblastic irruption.
     An interesting modification of the process is furnished by the am
 phibia.      Fig. 4 represents a section in the sagittal plane through the
 last two phalanges of the middle digit of the fore-foot of the Proteus.
 In this specimen, which there was every reason to suppose adult, no
 irruption whatever of osteoblastic tissue has taken place in the last
two phalanges, which accordingly consist each of a core of partly
calcified cartilage ; in the case of the penultimate phalanx surrounded
 by the hollow cylinder or dice-box of true bone already alluded to, in
the case of the terminal phalanx plunged into a deep receptacle, also
of true bone, which is in fact the subperiosteal cap.*              Thus a state of
things which in the higher Vertebrata belongs only to a temporary
stage in embryonic development, is in the Proteus persistent through
out life.      The growth and calcification of the cartilage and the for
mation of the subperiosteal layer of bone proceed, it may be assumed,
in the regular manner ; but having advanced so far the process stops,
    * From the only specimens procurable, no conclusions could be arrived at with
regard to the condition of the proximal phalanx of the digit, or indeed of anv other
of the bones.

 and the final stages marked by the invasion of the calcified cartilage
 and its replacement by true bone are in these two phalanges never
  reached at all.* [Note. — Another instance of arrested development in
  the  digit of the Proteus is afforded               by the interphalangeal joint
 represented      in  the   same  figure.    The   cartilage, with a slight alteration
  in the size and relative number of its cells, is seen to be quite con
 tinuous between the heads of the two phalanges, nor does it exhibit
  the least sign of an articular cavity.            The movement allowed by such
 a joint must be limited, but that some does take place is rendered
 probable by the position of the tendons seen at et and ft. Specimens
 of intramembranous ossification in the Proteus are remarkable as
 showing with great distinctness the original deposition of bone in the
 form of globules, after a manner strictly comparable with the growth
 of dentine.] In the newt the ossification of the terminal phalanx pro
 ceeds in the same way as in the Proteus, and is arrested at the same
 stage ; but the penultimate phalanx undergoes the osteoblastic inva
 sion, and is remodelled in true bone in the usual way.f
     The specimens from which the figures and descriptions were taken
 were all hardened in strong spirit, most of them having been previonsly
 decalcified in weak chromic or saturated picric acid. They were then
 imbedded by the cacao-butter method and cut by hand or by Leiser's
 microtome.          The greater number were stained as sections with
 magenta, but some were stained in bulk with logwood, carmine, or
 both, before being subjected to the process of imbedding.                       The best
 results were obtained by the employment of a freshly-prepared solution
 of magenta in oil of cloves.

    t Dec. 9. — The uncertainty that prevails respecting the homologues of the limb-
elements in fishes, renders it difficult to say how far this class can be brought under
 the rule above laid down for the higher vertebrates. In connexion with this sub
ject, which is still under investigation, the following facts are noticeable : — (1.) That
 in the limbs of all fishes which possess these appendages there is found at an early
 stage a cartilaginous    endoskeleton, which may persist as such, or undergo various
degrees    of subsequent ossification.    (2.) That to this set of element* is superadded
in ninny fishes a series of dermal deposits of bone (with or without lacuna1) , the
local relation of which to the endoskeletal elements corresponds with that of the
subperiosteal    bony growth     to the terminal    cartilaginous   phalanx  in the higher
vertebrates.

           At n, a region occurs where the cartilage presents unusual character

           ance    of primary     bone,    p, the subperiosteal cap of intramembranous
           bone, with osteogenic      fibres and osteoblasts.      Many fibrous bundles, con
           tinuous with the tendons et and ft, are seen as in the last figure to be
           prolonged into the bone. The ungual expansion at the summit of the cap
           consists of two masses (d and pa), separated by a notch, i, which may
           represent the point of future irruption. A series of sections from the same
           digit shows that what appears here as a notch is really a pit sunk in the
           middle of the ungual expansion.          Of the two masses (d and pa), the one
           towards the dorsal surface (d) is characterised by possessing in proportion
           far fewer lacuna; with their included bone-cells than the protuberance (pa)
           on the palmar side.       This distinction applies also to the dorsal and palmar
           sides of the cap as far as they extend.            In  thiB   specimen no irruption
           has yet taken place, and the cartilage        preserves     its original form. The
           conical contour indicated by the figure is due to the fact that expansion
           can only take place in cartilage as yet untouched by the process of
           ossification, its growth when this begins being checked either by the
           calcification of its own matrix or by the obstacle opposed to it by the
           investing subperiosteal layer of bone.         Hence, only the proximal area of
           the cartilaginous phalanx is capable of lateral expansion, and since the
           growth of the cartilage continues for a long time after the beginning of
           the process of ossification at its tip, the conical shape seen in this and
           other instances results. The same cause produces the well-known hour
           glass form   of the cartilage seen during the growth of other long bones.

process, nor to determine how far it is participated in by the cartilage

the nngnal expansion, or the enveloping cap. Moreover, the statements
already quoted from the text of their work are entirely ignored in the

  1380.]      Ossification of the Terminal P/ialanges of   the D'ujits.    71
     A recent paper by Dr. M. Kassowitz (" Die Normale Ossification,
  etc," in S. Strieker's
                              " Medizinische Jahrbiicher," 1880), is accom
  panied by a plate (Taf. X), in which there is diagrammatically repre
  sented a sagittal section through a finger of a human foetus of slightly
  earlier age   than fig. 2, infra. The cartilage of the terminal phalanx
  is calcified at its distal extremity, and the calcified portion is en
  veloped   in a thin cap of subperiosteal bone ; so that if allowance be
  made   for  the diagrammatic nature of the figure, it affords a fair idea
 of the actual condition of the phalanx as above described.          Speaking
 of this figure, however, the author says, " An der dritten Phalanx ist die
 Verkalknng schon bis an das distale Ende vorgedrungen, so dass nur das
 der zweiten Phalanx zugekehrte Ende knorpelig geblieben ist.              In
 der That ist auch schon das ganze Endstiick niit einem periostal
 gehildeten knochernen Ueberznge versehen." (Op. cit., p. 279.) It is
 evident from these words, that the author believes the ossification in
 this phalanx to have begun at some point other than the distal end of
 the shaft (presumably near its middle), and to have proceeded thence
 at different     rates towards the two extremities ; the only distinction
  between this and the other phalanges being that here the area of
 uncalcified cartilage at the distal end has quickly disappeared before
 the advance of calcification from the centre of the shaft ; while at the
 proximal end the corresponding area still persists ; as it does at both
 ends in ordinary cases.         Farther on, he repeats this explanation, and
 seeing the necessity of providing for the future growth of the bone at
its distal extremity, after the disappearance of the supposed cartila
 ginous head, he rightly assigns the entire task to the periosteum,
which has already enveloped the cartilage with its bony cap : — " In
der dritten Phalanx schwindet, wie wir friiher gesehen haben, der
Knorpel an dem distalen Ende vollstandig, indem die Verkalkung
schon fruhzeitig bis an die Oberflache vorriickt und auch die Kuppel
einen knochernen Ueberzug vom Periost aus bekommt, welches
letztere weiterhin auch das sehr geringe Langenwachstum an dem
distalen Ende besorgen muss." (Ibid., p. 280.)            These extracts will
suffice to show that Dr. Kassowitz, while correctly describing the
appearances presented by the terminal phalanx in a certain stage of
its growth, has failed to draw the proper inferences from them.           Had
he compared specimens of a somewhat earlier or later stage with the
one he has figured, he would probably have been led to recognise the
fact that the processes involved in the ossification of this bone spread
gradually backwards from the tip ; instead of, as he imagines, ad
vancing rapidly towards it.

           Lockyer, F.R.S. Received October 26, 1880.
   The recent activity in solar spots has enabled me to test the hypo
thesis  I put before the Society on December 12th, 1878, by observing
whether the velocity of the up-rash or down-rush of the so-called
iron vapour in the sun was registered equally by all the iron lines, as
it should be on the received hypothesis.
   The observations already made, though few in number, indicate
that while motion is shown by the change of refrangibility of some
lines, other adjacent lines indicate a state of absolute rest.    Thus, in
an observation of a sun-spot on August 31st, 1880, when the iron line
at 5207'6 was doubly contorted, indicating an ascending and descend
ing velocity of about fifteen miles a second, the two adjacent iron
lines at X 52037 and 5201'6, visible in the same field of view, were
unaffected.
   I send this paper to the Royal Society with all reserve, in order to
call the attention of other observers to the point, as I fear it is only
too probable that foggy weather will stop all observations here.

   The President then addressed the Society       as follows : —
    " Happy   is the nation that has no history," — none, that is to say, in
the matter of political events, of diplomatic victories or defeats, of
warlike achievements, or other staple topics of record, as history is
wont to be written. And such, in fact, has been the state of our own
community during the past year. We have no great convulsions to
chronicle, nor changes to relate, no controversies with other bodies, nor
grievances at issue between us and the State.          But, as with a nation,
so also with a society, an absence of these more striking, and perhaps
superficial, features, is certainly compatible with a healthful internal
growth, and with a steady development of the purposes for which our
organisation was originally intended.
    In the course of the year now ended, we have, naturally, lost some
of our elder Fellows ; but, numerically at least, our losses have not
been so great as during the previous year, nor have they fallen so
heavily on our younger members.           Among those who have dropped
from our ranks, several had already, on account of declining powers,
 withdiawn from active participation in our proceedings, and had
 thereby prepared us for their final departure.           Among these, two
 stand prominently forward, men who, through long and faithful
 service to science and to our Society, deserve to live a long and oft-
 repeated life in the memory of their friends.
    Of Professor Miller it is difficult adequately to speak. His scientific
 work has been well, but not too fully, described in the obituary
 notice published in our " Proceedings."       Older than myself, and older
 than other existing officers of the Society, he seemed to belong to
 an earlier generation.       Whether it was due to the number of his
 years, to the plenitude of his knowledge, to the judicial character
 of his mind, to his calm but ever ready response to an inquiry, or
 still more probably to a combination of all these qualities, certain it is

  1880.]                      Presidents Address.                       75
 that his  friends generally by a tacit consent regarded him as a mentor
  in the scientific   world. And yet, notwithstanding this gravity of
 demeanour and severity to himself, no one imbibed more thoroughly,
 nor more liberally contributed to the genial spirit which has always
 actuated onr officers, and even to the good stories which sometimes
 circulate about a scientific gathering.
     Of Dr. Sharpey I might speak in almost the selfsame terms, except
 ing only that more constant intercourse on the business of the Society,
 and on other occasions elsewhere, drew our ties of friendship some
 what more closely than in the former case.         Dr. Sharpey's life and
work are too well told in the obituary notice by an old comrade of
his, he was himself too well known, and too widely esteemed, to need
any comment of mine ; and I will not disappoint my own feelings, nor
those of my hearers, by any inadequate words on my part.
    The name of Mr. Lassell is one which, whether regarded from the
point of view of his scientific work, or from that of private friendship,
would be passed over by no one who had the advantage of a know
ledge of the former, or of experience of the latter.       His name seems
to fall in so naturally with those of Herschel and Lord Rosse, that we
are apt to class him with the old school. He was, however, of that school
only in the best sense ; he carried the weight, and earned the dignity
which we accord to them ; but to his last days, he was as fresh and
sympathetic with modern work as the generation which is now suc
ceeding to his. The details of his achievements            in instrumental
construction, themselves real contributions to science, and of his
astronomical     discoveries,  will be given elsewhere.   I  will here only
add, that in him we have lost a Fellow whose presence was always
welcome, and whose assistance and advice were as valuable as they
were   freely given.
  ¦
    In Professor Ansted we have lost a familiar face, a pleasant writer
on science and its accompaniments,         and an active promoter of its
applications.
    I turn now to another who has passed away, and find in him
another type of character among our Fellows, namely, Lord Belper.
From the member of his family best able to judge, I have the
following account of the chief occupations of Lord Belper's life.
From his early years his attention was engaged in all questions
of political and social interest, especially in free trade, law reform,
political economy, and the advance of education.           He enjoyed the
society of Jeremy Bentham, and an intimate and frequent intercourse
with James Mill and John Stuart Mill. Among the friendships formed
in his youth, and terminated only by their death, I may mention the
names of Macaulay, John Romilly, McCulloch, John and Charles
Austen, George Grote, and Charles Buller. And, to use his own words,
"
    Days passed in the society of such men can never be forgotten."

 76                          Anniversary     Meeting.               [Nov.   30,
 Throughout his life he loved and honoured science.                To this he
 had an hereditary claim.          His father, Mr. William Strutt, was for
many years     the   centre  of   all philosophical and scientific interest in
 Derby, and the intimate friend and associate of Dr. Darwin.               Lord
Belper   loved  to  recall  this  while  delighting  in the researches  of  Dr.
Darwin's far more illustrious grandson.           Although he never devoted
himself to any special branch of science, he maintained the deepest
interest in all scientific research, and in every new discovery.            His
life had comprised a period of great and active progress, the
development of which he had watched with an interest which
appeared to deepen as he grew older ; and the great solace of his
declining years was the thought (which would often rouse him to
enthusiasm) of what had been achieved within his memory towards
advancing the comfort and happiness of mankind. During his long
connexion with University College, of which he became President at
Mr. Grote's death, in 1871, few things gave him greater satisfaction
than the generous endowment by his friend, Mr. Jodrell, of the Pro
fessorship at that College for the furtherance of Physiological Science.
   If in Lord Belper we have an example of one of the many ties which
link our body with the outer world, in Mr. E. W. Cooke we have
another.    Art as well as Politics may have a scientific aspect ; and the
faithful delineation of the features of nature is an aid with which
science could not easily dispense.         Mr. Cooke was a keen observer of
natural objects, which he viewed with a trained eye and a cultivated
mind ; and much as he rejoiced in sketching the busy scenes of the
seaboard towns of Europe, he never was more happy than when pro
ducing, among the rocks, pictures which may almost be described as
geological.
    On the last of our fallen leaves is inscribed the name of Sir Ben
jamin Collins Brodie, son of our late President; himself no mean
contributor to the science which he cultivated, and no unworthy
representative     of the firmness      of character and independence o*
thought which have always been connected with his father's name.
    Others there are, whom we have lost, to a full tale of twenty ; hut
the narration of their story would be both sad and long.
    In regard to our property, I have little to report. The regulations
respecting the income arising from the Fees Reduction Fund have
been duly carried out by our Treasurer ; and the other special funds
stand much as at last anniversary.
   Several improvements          have been effected in the Acton Estate,
under the sanction of the Council ; and some negociations have been
entered into for the sale of the entire estate, which are still pending.
   The Society's finances generally are, as the balance-sheet will show,
in a healthy condition, and appear to justify the hope that they will
su race for the large claims upon them for printing our publications.

     Although we are more concerned with the quality than with the
 quantity of communications made to the Society, it may not be with
 out interest to observe that the number of papers received this year
 has been in excess of that in any previous year, at all events since
 1872, inclusive.      The following is a table of the numbers during the
 last nine years : —
                   1872                     99 papers received.
                   1873                     92    „
                   1874                     98'   „
                   1875                     88   „
                   1876                   113     „
                   1877                     97   „

                   1880                   123     .,
and we may conclude that these have contained good matter from the
fact that of the " Philosophical Transactions
                                                      " for the current
                                                                         year,
 Parts   1 and   2, already published,  contain  no  less than  900 pages and
 33 plates.    We have reason to hope that the volume will be completed
 very early   in  1881.
            "
    Of the Proceedings," volume 29 was completed in February, and
 volume 30 in August last.
    In my address last year,      I  snggested that the hour of our weekly
meetings might, perhaps,         with    advantage,    be changed from the
 evening to the afternoon.          That suggestion was approved by the
 Council, and by their direction a circular was addressed to all the
 Fellows of the Society, inviting an expression of opinion upon the
 question. Those of the Fellows who, living at a distance, are unable
to attend our meetings, mostly abstained from making a reply.
 But in the answers actually received, the preponderance of opinion
was so strongly in favour of the change, that the Council took
the necessary steps for altering the statute by which the hour
of meeting was formerly fixed. Notice of the alteration was sent
to all the Fellows.       The regulation of the hour of meeting is now
in the hands of the President and Council. The attendance at our
meetings has certainly not diminished since the change, and some
of our Fellows, to whom the evening hour was inconvenient, have
become constant attendants.
    The Council now usually meet at 2.0 p.m., instead of 3.0 p.m.,
in order to be ready for the meeting of the Society at 4.30 p.m. ; and
I am happy to add that it has not yet been found necessary to call the
Council or the Committee of Papers together on any other than the
usnal days.
   In the permanent staff       of the Society no change has taken place.

 78                          Anniversary     Meeting.              [Nov. 30,
 T  regret, however, to record the death of Mr. Henry White, •who for
many years was chief assistant in the compilation of the great
 Catalogue of Scientific Papers. At an earlier stage of the work his
 loss would have been        still more    serious ; but in a long course of
training      he succeeded    so  well  in   imparting his own careful and
 methodical mode of work to those under him, that the Council felt
justified in making trial of his son to take his place. With the result
of this trial, as shown in continuing the preparation of a new edition
of the catalogue of the Society's Library, the Council have reason to
be satisfied.
     Of this new edition, the first portion, 220 pages, containing our
                                         " and "              " of Academies
large collection of " Transactions                Proceedings
and Societies, and other scientific periodicals, is in type, and will
 shortly be printed off. The verification of titles of our scientific
 books generally is so far advanced as to warrant the expectation
 that a large instalment of this portion of the catalogue will soon be
 in the printers' hands ; after which we anticipate no further delay.
     In regard to the Library, a question -has arisen as to how far
 purely literary works, which occupy much space, should be retained.
 Among them there are doubtless some which add neitber to the utility
 nor to the scientific importance of our Library, but there are also some
 early printed books, bibliographical treasures, which are worthy of a
 place in any collection.       It is proposed to have these carefully put in
 order,  and   to place them   in a case by themselves.   Among these, there
 may be mentioned       : —¦
          Caxton's Chaucer, 1480.
          Pynson's Chaucer, 1492.
           Speght's Folio Chaucer, 1598.
           Ciceronis Officia et paradoxa, Fust. 1466, vellum.
          The generall historie of Virginia, Lond. 1632.
          Bonifacius.      Sextus decretalium liber.    Ven. 1566-7.
          Plautus, 1482.                   Seneca, 1490.
           Ovid, 1485.                     Statins, 1490.
           Plutarch, 1485.                Herodotus, 1494.
           Homer, 1488.
  For bringing      into prominence these as well as other features of
  our miscellaneous, i.e., non-scientific, books, we are greatly indebted
  to the care and knowledge brought to bear on the subject by Mr.
  Tomlinson, and by our Treasurer.
     Although it is doubtless undesirable to propose, without sufficient
  cause, alterations in our Statutes, or even in our practice, it is still
  often worth while from time to time to discuss questions involving
  such alterations in order that we may be prepared for a deliberate
 judgment whenever occasion may arise. Among such questions there

1880.]                    President's Address.                          79
is   one  upon which I have often heard opinion erpressed, and
npon    which   opinion has always weighed in the same direction :       I
allude to the period of office of those elected to serve on the Council of
the Society. By the terms of our charter ten of the ordinary members
retire every year ; and as it is our custom to remove six according
to seniority and four in respect of least attendance, it rarely happens,
although the contrary is possible, that any Fellow, except those
holding the posts of President, Treasurer, or Secretary, should remain
in office more than two years. Experience, however, appears to show,
that for a member serving on the Council for the first time, there is so
much to learn, so many heads of business demanding attention which do
not in general come before the Fellows at large, that his first year is
occupied quite as much in ascertaining his duties as in actively per
forming them. This objection is in some degree met by selecting for
the ten incoming members five who have served before and five who
have not so served ; but, nevertheless, there is usually an interval of
several years between two periods of office, and as a matter of fact
we often lose a member of Council at the moment when his advice is
becoming most valuable to our body.
   I am aware of the great convenience attaching to our present im
personal mode of selecting the members to retire in each year, and
am not at present prepared to Buggest any specific alteration. But
the great confidence which the Society has, especially of late years,
placed in its more permanent officers, and the power which naturally
accrues to them from the comparatively short tenure of office by the
other Members of Council, appear to me to be points of which the
Society should not lose sight. On the part of the officers,    I   think it
right to state that we are very sensible both of the honour which is
thns done to us, and of the responsibility which is thereby entailed,
and that we hope never to discredit the one, nor to abuse the other.
And having said so much, we are quite willing to leave the matter in the
bands of the Society to be taken up whenever they see reason so to do.
   It will be in the recollection of the Fellows that the position of the
Royal Society in respect of the Government Fund of £4,000 per annum
is different from that in relation to the Government Grant of £1,000 per
annum. In the latter case the sum is placed unreservedly in the hands
of the Society for promoting scientific investigation, subject only to an
annual report to the Treasury of the sums granted ; and, in admi
nistering  it,  the Society has in no case applied    it   to the personal
remuneration     of the applicant.   In  the former  case,  the Society has
been requested to advise the Science and Art Department as to the
distribution of the grant, not only for the direct expenses of investiga
tions but also for personal remuneration for the time expended on
them, whenever the circumstances and wishes of the applicant appeared
to render this desirable. The responsibility of this advice lies with a

80                         Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov.  30,
 Committee similar to that of the Government Grant, but with the
addition of the Presidents of certain learned bodies and societies,
nominated for that purpose by the Government.
    The recommendations made by the Committee each year are annually
                   "
published in the Proceedings," so that the public will have had full
information as to the distribution of the grant ; while the Fellows have
the opportunity of seeing the nature of applications made, and the
extent to which it has been found practicable to meet them, as re
corded in the minutes of the Council of the Society.
    One of the points which is perhaps beset with the greatest difficulty
is that of the so-called
                           "          "            On the one hand, it has
                             personal   grants.
been argued that it is desirable to enable the man of small means
to devote to research a part of his time which he could not otherwise
afford to give ; but, on the other, the question has been raised whether
it be wise, even in the interests of science, to encourage anyone not yet
of independent income to interrupt the main business of his life. It is
too often assumed that a profession or a business may be worked at
half speed, or may be laid down and taken up again, whenever we
like. But this is not so, and a profession temporarily or even partially
laid aside, may prove irrecoverable ; and the temptation to diverge
from the dull and laborious path of business may prove to have been
a snare.    Without proposing to exclude from possible aid in some
shape or other those cases where personal assistance may be safely
offered, it has been suggested that many such cases may be practically
met by grants for the employment of an assistant, instead of grants to
the applicant himself.
    There is another fundamental difference between tlie position of the
Government Grant of £1,000 per annum and the Government Fund
of £4,000 per annum, which appears to me to be of material im
portance in the interests of science.     The former is an absolute grant
from the Treasury made to the Society for scientific purposes.      It may
be used wholly, or in part, during the year in which it is made, and
the balance, if any, may be carried over by the Society to the next or
even to succeeding years.      The latter is a vote.to the Science and Art
Department, on the disposal of which the Society is consulted.         Like
all  other similar votes, any  unused   balance  reverts  to the Treasury,
and is to that extent, lost to the purpose for which it was intended. I
cannot help thinking that, if any such balances could be reserved and
kept in hand, provision might be made for some larger purposes than
those to which the fund has hitherto been devoted. And, even if having
this end in view, the Committee should not see its way to recommend
some of the smaller applications, it may be fairly questioned whether
the smaller grants might not find a more appropriate place among
those of the Donation Fund of this Society, or of the British Asso
ciation, or among some of those separate funds which, through the

liberality of individuals, are now growing up among            the   special
societies.
    I  am glad to record the fact that, upon the recommendation           of
men of science, Her Majesty has been pleased to giant pensions on the
Civil List to the widows of two of our late Fellows, viz., to Mrs.
John Allan Broun and to Mrs. Clifford,
    Last year two volumes containing a collection of the late Professor
 Clifford's general lectures and essays were brought out.       It is hoped
that during the present winter a collection of his mathematical papers
will be published. The contributions to science by the late Pro
fessor Rankine have recently been placed in the hands of the public.
While very sensible of the obligations under which the scientific
world is placed by these posthumous publications, I cannot refrain
from alluding to our obligations, even greater if possible, to those
who during their lifetime are willing to re-issue their own scientific
memoirs, and to give us thereby not only the convenience of ready
access, but also the advantage of their own subsequent reflections
on the subjects of which they have treated.         And at this moment I
desire to mention more particularly the mathematical         and physical
papers    of our Senior  Secretary,   Professor G. G. Stokes  ; and, while
expressing our gratitude for the volume which has already appeared,
I  would express also our sincere hope that another instalment from the
same source may shortly fallow.
    Among the subjects which at one period of the last session of Par
liament engaged the attention of the Government was that of the law
relating to vaccination ; and a Bill was introduced intended to remove
some of the practical difficulties in carrying out the existing law.
While fully admitting the difficulties in question, the remedy proposed
appeared to trench so closely upon the application at least of a scien
tific principle, and at the same time to be so important in its practical
aspect, that I ventured (although the Council was not sitting) to con
sult the Presidents of the Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons, and
that of the Medical Council, about addressing the Government on the
subject. This resulted in a joint deputation to the President of the
Local Government Board, in which         I took part as President of the
Royal Society^      The Council    on  my reporting the matter to them
at their first meeting after the recess, expressed their approval. The
Bill in question was withdrawn.
    The Royal Commission on Accidents in Coal Mines, the appointment
of which I mentioned in my address of last year, have been occupied
principally in bringing together a body of valuable evidence on the
causes and prevention of accidents in mines generally.          The Com
mission have also visited a number of mines in which serious accidents
by explosion have taken place, or in which certain phenomena con
nected with the occurrence of fire-damp were to be studied.           They

82                         Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov.   30,
have also instituted a series of experiments on the behaviour of various
safety lamps in mixtures of natural fire-damp and air.        These experi
ments they are about to renew during the winter.         They also contem
plate carrying out experiments     in blasting rock and coal by     methods
which will check the production     of flame, and which are thereby cal
culated to obviate the danger of igniting fire-damp.
   The report of the voyage of H.M.S. " Challenger," to which
the scientific world has been looking forward with so much interest,
is now so far advanced that one volume of the " Zoological Memoirs
                                                                            "
will appear immediately. In addition to this a second volume may be
                                                                  "
expected within a year. The first volume of the whole work, contain
ing a short narrative of the voyage, with all necessary hydrographical
details, an account of the appliances and methods of observation, a
running outline of the results of the different observations ; and a
chapter epitomising the general results of the voyage," together with
the second volume containing the meteorological, magnetic, and hydro-
graphic observations, will probably be published within the same
            " The
period.            general report on the zoology of the expedition will
consist of about fifty distinct memoirs, which will occupy from ten to
twelve volumes."        It has been arranged " to print the Zoological
 Reports as they are prepared, and to publish them as soon as a
 sufficient bulk of memoirs is ready to form a volume.       Copies of each
 memoir may also be had separately, in order that working naturalists
 may have them in their hands at the earliest possible date."           Two
 more volumes on the geology and petrology, and one on the general
 chemical and physical results, will probably complete the series.       Into
 zoological details     I am not competent to enter, but one among
 them is of great interest, namely, the fact that notwithstanding the
 pressure and absence of light, there is no depth-limit to animal life.
    As the Council of the Meteorological Office is nominated by the
 Council of the Royal       Society, and  as  the  Annual   Report of     the
 Office is submitted   to the Royal Society,  I think it right to mention a
 few points connected with the work of that Department during the
 past year.
    1. A method     of recording the duration of bright sunshine by the
 charring    of an object placed in the focus of a glass sphere, freely
 exposed to the rays of the sun, was devised by Mr. J. F. Campbell,
 of Islay, in 1856 ; and instruments, being modified forms of that
 originally proposed, have been employed for some time at Greenwich,
 at Kew, and at a few private observatories.         Certain difficulties in
 adjusting the paper about to be charred to the path of the burning
 spot, which had hitherto prevented the adoption of Mr. Campbell's
 invention as a part of the ordinary equipment of a meteorological
 observing station, have been at last successfully overcome by an
  arrangement designed by Professor Stokes ; and thirty stations in the

  1880.]                    President's Address.                         83
  British Isles have now been supplied with instruments of the pattern
  proposed by him.     We may thus hope to obtain in future a sufficient
 record of a meteorological     element, which is of primary importance
 in its relations to agriculture, and to the public health, but which has
 hitherto been very imperfectly registered.
    2. The climatology of        the Arctic regions, in addition to its
 importance     as a part of  the  general physics of the globe, possesses a
 special interest in connexion with geographical exploration.          As a
 contribution    to our knowledge of      this subject, the Meteorological
 Office has entrusted to Mr. R. Strachan the task of bringing together,
 and discussing     on an uniform plan, the results of the observations
 taken at intervals during the last sixty years, in the region extending
 from the meridian of 45° W. to that of 120° W., and from the
parallel of 60° to that of 80°, either at land stations or at the winter
quarters of British and American expeditions.           A considerable por
tion of this discussion has been already published ; the remainder
may be expected in the course of next year.
    3. Another publication of the Meteorological Office may be men
tioned as serving to mark the advance in meteorological theory, which
has been achieved during the last fifteen years.       The old " Barometer
Manual and Weather Guide" of the Board of Trade has been
replaced, so far as it relates to the weather of the British Isles, by a
work entitled " Aids to the Study and Forecast of Weather," pre
pared under the direction of the Meteorological Office by the Rev. W.
Clement Ley.       Though some of the views put forward in the later
 work may, perhaps, be regarded as not sufficiently established by
observation, yet a comparison of the two works cannot fail to leave
npon the reader's mind the impression that in the interval between
their respective dates of publication, some real progress has been
made in meteorology.           Perhaps this is most conspicuous in the
enlarged ideas that are now entertained concerning the conditions
upon which the changes of weather depend.            Local weather was first
discovered to be contingent upon travelling areas of disturbance, each
of which averaged many hundreds of miles in diameter, while, at the
present time, tha relation of these areas to one another, as parts of a
single terrestrial system, has become a prominent topic of inquiry.
If meteorology has thus been, to a certain extent, rescued from the
ever accumulating chaos of numerical tabulations, which threatened
to engulf the whole science, the improvement is mainly due to the
development in recent times of the synoptic study of weather over
large regions of the earth's surface, to which so great an impetus has
been given by the extended facilities of telegraphic communication.
    4. Balloon ascents, with a view to military purposes, are now
systematically carried on under the direction of the War Office ; and
the endeavour has been made to take advantage of these ascents for

  84                        A nniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
  observations of the thickness of the aerial cnrrent which causes our
  winds, and of the peculiarities of the currents above it in the upper
  strata of the atmosphere.    The military authorities have offered their
 co-operation    in the  most  cordial manner ; but the attention of an
 aeronaut is often so much engrossed by the operations necessary for
 working his balloon, that he has but little leisure for taking systematic
 records.     Nevertheless,  observations   of considerable interest have
 already been obtained, relating especially to the velocity and direction of
 the upper air currents ; and there can be no doubt that a continuance of
 such observations affords the best prospect at present open to us of add
 ing to the very scanty knowledge which we possess of the movements of
 the atmosphere, even at a moderate height above the earth's surface.
    Among the various duties which the President of the Royal
 Society is called upon to fulfil there are those of a Trustee of the
 British Museum ; and, as an operation of great importance to Science,
 namely the removal of the natural history collections to the new build
 ing at South Kensington, is now going on, the Fellows may be in
 terested to hear what progress has been made in the work.
    The plans for the new building were approved as long ago as
 April, 1868 ; but the works were not commenced until the early part
 of 1873. Their progress was retarded by difficulties in the supply of
 the terra cotta with which the building is faced within and without,
 and in which the mouldings of arches and other ornamental features
 are executed.
    The building was finally handed over to the Trustees in the month
 of  June of the present year. It contains cases for three only of the
 Departments for which it is intended, namely, Mineralogy, Geology,
 and Botany ; the necessary funds for the Zoological Department not
 having been yet voted. As the latter collections are equal in bulk to
the other three collectively, it follows that half only of the new building
 can at present be actually occupied       The removal of the collections
for which cases had been provided, commenced in the last week of
July, and was virtually completed by the end of September.
    Geology, which was very inadequately displayed in the old build
ing, is now more commodiously accommodated than heretofore.               It
occupies a gallery 280 feet in length by 52 in breadth, forming
the ground floor of the east wing of the new museum, together with
eight other galleries covering an area of 2U0 x 170 feet at the back,
and admirably adapted for the exhibition of the specimens.              One
of these galleries will be devoted to the illustration of stratification.
    The principal part of the minerals has been moved and replaced
in the cases in which they were arranged in the old building.          This
collection now occupies the first floor of the east wing of the new
museum, and the space devoted to it is 280 x 50 feet in area.          It is
already arranged    for exhibition.

       Botanical collections are placed in the gallery over the minerals,
      The
 where the space for exhibition and the conveniences for study are
 much greater than in their old quarters.
   The construction of the cases for the Zoological specimens, and the
 ultimate removal        of these collections, must depend upon the amount
 of      Parliamentary vote for the purpose ; but under the most
       the
 favourable conditions it can hardly be hoped that this Department can
 be open to the public or to students in less than two years from the
present time.
  The "Index Museum," designed by Professor Owen, will form a
prominent feature in the new museum.    The object of   in his words,
                                                                  it,

is              type characters of the principal groups of organised
beings;" and "to convey to the great majority of visitors, who are
not naturalists, as much information                   notions of its aim
                                             and general
as the      hall they will first enter and survey could          afford."

   One of the principal difficulties attending the transfer of the Natural
 History Departments to separate building consists in the provision
                               a
of books for the use of the keepers and their staff, as well as for
students who may visit the museum. Hitherto the separate collections
of books, known as departmental libraries, supplemented as occasion
might require from the main library of the museum, have sufficed for
all purposes.   But now, when the departmental libraries have to stand
 by themselves,   is impracticable to carry on even the current work of
                    it
arrangement without additional resources.       For an adequate supply of
the necessary works a very large outlay would be required, supposing
that the works were in the market. But many of them are out of
print and have become scarce and a large grant of public money would
                                   ;
perhaps raise the market price almost in proportion to its magnitude.
This being so,    has been thought best, on the whole, by the Govern
                    it
ment to make an annual grant to be expended from time to time as
favourable opportunities for purchase may offer. If          should prove
                                                                 it
possible, and on other grounds desirable, to allow the Banks' Library
to follow the collections with which         has always been practically
                                             it
connected, the wants of the Natural History Departments would (so
far as books up to the date of its bequeathment are concerned) be in a
great measure supplied.
  Another of the duties which falls         officially on your President    is   to
take part      in the organisation of technical education        as promoted     by
the   City and Guilds of London Institute, which           is   now incorporated
under the Companies Acts, 1862-80 as a registered association, and of
which the Presidents of the Royal Society, the Chemical Society, the
Institute of Civil Engineers, and the Chairman of the Council of the
Society of Arts, are members.      In the Memorandum and Articles of
Association of the Institute, its objects are fully set forth. They may
be summarised under the following heads —         :

tion in the application of science and art to productive industry.

and in the country.

tions held at the Central Institution, or at other places.
   4th. To assist by means of grants existing institutions in which
technical education is being promoted.
    5th. To accept gifts, bequests, and endowments, for the purposes of
the Institute.
    The Institute is supported by subscriptions from sixteen of the City
Companies, of which the largest contributors are the Mercers, Drapers,
Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, and Clothworkers.
    The Institute has been in active operation not much more than a
year, and during the last six months the work of the Institute has
developed considerably in each of its several departments.          These
may be considered under the following heads :    —
    1. Technical Instruction.
    2. Examinations in Technology.
    3. Assistance to other Institutions.
    1. Since November last, courses of lectures and laboratory instruc
tion have been given in the temporary class rooms of the Institute, at
the Cowper Street Schools, under the direction of Professor Arm
strong, F.R.S., and of Professor Ayrton.      The subjects of instruction
have included Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, with special refer
ence to their industrial applications ; Fuel, Electro-depositions of
Metals, and Photographic Chemistry ; General Physics, Steam, Elec
trical Engineering, Electrical Instrument Making, Electric Lighting,
 Weighing Appliances, and Motor Machinery.
    During the term ending July last, the number of tickets issued to
students, most of whom belonged to the artizan class,, exceeded three
hundred. A considerable accession of students is expected as soon as
the building in Tabernacle Row, the plans of which are already
 settled, shall be erected.   This building, which is estimated to cost
 £20,000, will provide accommodation for schools of Technical Physics,
 Technical Chemistry, and Applied Mechanics. Many of the day
 students at these classes are pupils of the Cowper Street Schools, and
 it is hoped that, by adaptiug the course of technical instruction to
 be given in the College to the wants of these boys, a very complete-
 technical school for the children of artizans will have been established.
    The evening lectures and laboratory instruction, which are more
 advanced and more special, are attended very largely by external
 students, for whom the present temporary accommodation         is already
 too limited.
     At Kennington, schools have been established in which practical

instruction   is given in various art subjects,    such as Painting and
Drawing, Modelling, Designing, and Wood Engraving. These schools
are attended by both sexes, and are under the immediate direction of
Mr. Sparkes.     The numbers in attendance last term were    as follows : —
   "Wood Engraving                     8 Students,   3 Men,   5  Women.

    The Central Institution for instruction in the application of the
higher branches of science to industrial pursuits is about to be erected
on a plot of ground in Exhibition Road, granted by the Commissioners
of 1851. The construction of this building, which, when completed,
will cost £50,000, has been entrusted to Mr. Alfred Watorhouse, who
is now engaged in the preparation of plans.
    2. In the year 1879, the examinations      in Technology, which had
been initiated by the Society of Arts, were transferred to this Insti
tute. Various changes were introduced into the regulations.            New
subjects were added, and, in order to stimulate the teaching of
 Technology throughout the country, the principle of payment to
 teachers on the results of the examinations      was adopted.     The en
couragement thus afforded to teachers gave a great impetus to the
 formation of classes throughout the country in technological subjects.
 Last year the number of candidates for examination was 202, while at
 the recent examination, held in May, 816 candidates presented them
selves, of whom 515 satisfied the Examiners.         During the last few
months the number of classes throughout the country, in which
technical instruction is being given,, has considerably increased, and,
judging from the returns already received, there is reason to believe
that the number of candidates who will present themselves for exami
nation next May will be- much greater than in either of the preceding
years. The new programme, which is just issued, contains a syllabus
of each subject of examination, and every effort has been made, short
of testing the candidate's practical skill, to make the examinations as
efficient as possible.  To obtain the Institute's full certificate, each
candidate is required to give evidence of having obtained some preli
minary scientific knowledge.
   3. In order to take advantage of efforts that are already being made
to advance technical edncation, the Institute has given sums of money
for specific objects to several institutions in which technical instruc
tion is provided. The schools, colleges, and other bodies to which grants
have been made by this Institute, are University College and King's
College, London, the School of Art, Wood Carving, and Mining
Association of Devon and Cornwall, the Nottingham Trade and
                                                            h 2

88                         Anniversary    Meeting.             [Nov.   30,
Science    Schools, the Artizans'   Institute, the Birkbeck Institute, the
Lancashire and Cheshire Union, and the Horological Institute.
   The Artizans' Institute gives practical instruction in several of the
humbler crafts in which artizans are engaged, such as carpentry,
zinc work, and plumbers' work ; and corresponds, therefore, to some
slight extent, with the apprenticeship schools of the Continent, from
which, however, it differs in many important particulars. A similar
experiment is being tried at the Horological Institute, where, at the
expense of the Guilds, classes have been organised in which appren
tices are practically instructed in the various branches of the watch
making trade.
    It is found that the demand for technical instruction in London
and throughout the provinces is very great, and the efforts that have
been so far made by the City and Guilds of London Institute, have
afforded considerable satisfaction to artizans and others engaged in
industrial pursuits, and promise, when further extended, to be of the
utmost service in the development of technical education in this
country.
    Turning now more particularly to the progress and the applications
of science,   I venture to make mention of a few topics which have
come under my own observation : —
    The aspect of spectrum analysis has become much complicated by
two sets of facts.    First, the increased dispersion, the improved de
finition, the enlarged electrical power at our command, and, above all,
the substitution of photography for eye observations, have revealed
to us an almost overwhelming array of lines belonging to each sub
stance.    And, secondly, the same means have shown that many sub
stances present different spectra when in different molecular states.
These complications have led spectroscopists to seek some relief in
theories of simplification.    Lecoq de Boisbaudran, Stoney, Soret, and
others, have suggested that many of the lines, or groups of lines, may
 be regarded as the harmonics of a fundamental vibration ; and they
 have shown that in certain cases this view will account for the phe
 nomena observed.       Professors Liveing and Dewar have contributed
 largely to our knowledge of the subject, by their observations on the
 reversed lines. Looking in another direction, Mr. Lockyer considers that
 in increased temperature we have the means not only of resolving com
 pound bodies into their elements, but even of dissociating bodies
 hitherto regarded as elementary into still more simple substances.
 There still remain serious difficulties connected with Mr. Lockyer's
 views ; but it is to .be hoped that his indefatigable energy will in some
 way or other ultimately overcome them.
    The outlying parts of the spectrum, beyond the visible range, must
 always be a subject of interest ; and while MM. Cornu and Mascart,
 and others, have extended our knowledge of the ultra-violet end,

 1880.]                       President's Address.                          8«>
 Captain Abney has opened ont to ns a new region beyond the red.
Lord Kayleigh and others before him have, however, proved that
there must be a limit at the least refrangible end of the spectrum.
Professor Stokes, long since, noticed the difference in length between
the spectrum of the sun and that of the electric arc ; and M. Cornu
has recently shown by observations at elevated stations that the great
rapidity of atmospheric absorption must preclude the hope of any
great extension of the solar spectrum toward the more refrangible
end.
   The     striking advances made in electricity during the last few years,
and    marked by, among other things, the inventions of the telephone
and the microphone,      have been followed by a step not less daring in
 its conception, nor less successful in its execution ; I allude, of course,
 to the photophone, the result of the researches of Mr. Graham Bell
 and Mr. Sumner Tainter.        The principle of this instrument is already
 known.     A  powerful beam of light is first thrown upon a flexible
 mirror, the curvature of which is modified through vibrations set up
 in it by the human voice.         The reflected beam is then received by
a selenium
               " cell," forming part of an electric circuit. The in
 tensity of the light so received, and with it the resistance in the
 circuit due to the selenium, varies with the varying curvature of the
 flexible mirror.    A large parabolic mirror is used at the distant station
to concentrate the light on the selenium "cell;" and a telephone in
 the circuit reproduces the variations in the form of sound.
    Mr. Bell has, however, also shown that rays from the sun, or an
electric lamp, when rendered intermittent by any convenient means,
will set up in a plate of almost any substance vibrations corresponding
to the intermittence.        The substances as yet tried are : metals of
various kinds, wood, india-rubber, ebonite, and many others, and
among them zinc appears to be one of the best suited for the purpose.
This result, which is independent of any electric action,            is,perhaps,
due to beat rather than to light.
    In these, as in many other issues of scientific research, we can
hardly fail to be impressed by the almost inexhaustible resources
which lie ready to hand,        if we only knew how to use them, for the
interpretation    of nature, or  for the practical purposes of mankind.
    During the past year Professor Hughes employed his induction
balance for the detection of very minute impurities in small masses
of gold.      Mr. Preece also has shown how slight increments of
temperature in fine wires transmitting                telephonic    currents of
electricity, will suffice to reproduce sonorous vibrations       ;    and even
articulate speech at      a   distant   station by   their   influence on thin
platinum wires, only six inches in length.
    Mr. Stroh has shown that, at the point of contact of two metals
carrying strong electric currents, adhesion takes place, varying with

 the nature of the surfaces    in contact ; and that many of the effects at
  points of contact, previously attributed to induction, may be due to
 the peculiar action now for the first time brought under notice.
    It is worthy of record, that two Atlantic cables have been success
 fully laid during the present year ; but success in cable-laying
 has become so much a matter of course, that its occurrence             has
 attracted  little public attention.   Two   cables, each of more than  500
 miles in length, have been laid across the Mediterranean ; and the Cape
 Colony has been placed in telegraphic communication with this
 country, by a cable of not less than 4,400 miles.
    Constant attention is paid in the General Post Office to the intro
duction of improved methods for the furtherance of the telegraphic
communication throughout the country.
    Steady progress has been made in bringing the electric light into
practical use.      The illumination of the Albert Dock of the London
and St. Katherine's Dock Company, the Liverpool Street Station of
the Great Eastern Railway, the St. Enoch's Station of the Glasgow
and South-Western Railway, and last, but not least, that of the read
ing room of the British Museum, has become an accomplished fact ;
while the city authorities, have decided to extend the use of this light
over various thoroughfares under their control. The subdivision of
the light for domestic purposes is a problem which appears to ha\e
found a solution in the incandescent carbon lamp of Mr. Swan.
Beside this, Mr. J. H. Gordon has devised, for the same purpose,
a very ingenious application of rapid sparks from alternating machines,
such as that of De Meritens, to produce incandescence in refractory
metals.     Lamps constructed on this principle completely fulfil the
conditions of subdivision, but some difficulties of detail still retard
their adoption for general use.       There is, however, every reason to
hope that the experience already gained, and the intelligence at present
brought to bear upon the subject, will before long supply us with
more than one form of domestic light.
    The chief question of interest which has occupied the attention of the
 Iron and Steel Institute has been the adaptation of the " basic " pro
cess to the production of steel from pig metal containing a considerable
 percentage of phosphorus.       Hitherto only pure hjematite and spathic
 ironstones have been used for the production of steel ; but it has now
 been shown that, by the employment of basic linings and basic slags,
the metal is almost completely cleared of its phosphorus, and that
steel of good quality may be produced from inferior ore.
    The Conference on Lightning Conductors, composed of delegates
from the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Society of
Telegraph Engineers, the Physical Society, and the Meteorological
 Society, is steadily pursuing its labours.       A large mass of facts has
 been accumulated ; several leading questions have been decided ; and

     One of the most interesting, and at the same time useful, applications
 of the dynamo-machines, is that of transmitting mechanical power to
 spots, or under circumstances,    where the ordinary appliances cannot be
 conveniently    used.   Perhaps one of the most remarkable instances
 of the application of the principle, is that by Dr. Werner Siemens
 to the  propulsion of railway carriages in Berlin.     Other applications
 will doubtless by degrees extend themselves over a wide range of
 industry ; especially in localities where water-power is abundant.
    Our Fellow, Dr. C. W. Siemens in London, and M. De Meritens in
 Paris, have demonstrated the use of the high temperature of the
electric arc in fusing refractory metals.       The method of operation,
 while peculiarly convenient for laboratory purposes, and for de
monstration,    promises to be capable of extension,     even to the large
demands     of commerce and manufacture.
    I  should not, moreover, omit mention of the very beautiful ex
periments by Dr. C. W. Siemens, on the effect of the electric light
on the growth of plants, on the opening of flowers, and on the ripen
ing of fruit. On this subject we hope to hear more after the experi
ments which, already commenced, he contemplates continuing during
the coming winter.
    I am not sure how far the fact is known to the Fellows of the Royal
Society, that the Society of Telegraph Engineers have thrown open to
the scientific world a remarkable collection of books on electrical
science,   collected by our late Fellow, Sir Francis Ronalds, and be
queathed by him to that Society.          The catalogue, compiled by the
collector, is a monument of concentrated and well-directed labour.
    As regards the Transit of Venus in 1874, the printing of the
observations is complete for the two groups of stations in the Sand
wich Islands and Egypt, and that for others is in progress.
    Preparations are already being made with a view to the observation
of the Transit of Venus in 1882. As a preliminary step for this
operation, as well as for general purposes, it had been decided that
the longitude of the Cape Observatory should be defini tively deter
mined by telegraphic connexion with Aden, which place is already
telegraphically referred to Greenwich ; and, notwithstanding a tem
porary interruption on the land line, Cape Town-Durban, it may be
hoped that the determination will be effected at no distant period.
Mr. Gill is prepared to undertake the main share of the work.
With the same objects in view, on the urgent representation of the
Astronomer Royal, it has also been determined to connect ono of the
Australian Observatories with Greenwich, through Madras, the longi
tude of which is well known ; and this operation will be very much
facilitated by the share which Mr. Todd, Government Astronomer

and Superintendent of Telegraphs at Adelaide, would be prepared to
take in it under the auspices of his Government. The eastern boundary
of the colony having been defined by Imperial Act as the 141st
meridian, a wish has been expressed officially for the accurate con
nexion of Adelaide with Greenwich, independently of the Transit of
Venus.
    The Astronomer Royal has explained in detail the preparations
which he considers necessary, so far at least as this country is con
cerned, for the effective observation        of the transit, and he has
introduced several alterations in the plan which he had formerly   j
suggested.      The experience of the transit of 1874 points to the de
sirability of sacrificing something in the magnitude of the parallax-
factor for the sake of securing a higher elevation of the sun ; thus,
for retarded ingress, Sir George Airy had at first proposed to refer
principally to the coasts of the Canadian Dominion and the United
 States of North America, where the sun's elevation is from 15° to 18° ;
he now proposes to substitute for this the whole chain of "West India
Islands, from the eastern extremity of Cuba to Barbadoes, or stations
on the neighbouring continent of Central America.          Bermuda is also
 included as a favourable point for observation.         Most, if not all, of
 the longitudes required have been determined with great precision by
 the Hydrographic Department of the United States.              For ingress
 accelerated, Sir George Airy relies entirely upon stations in the Cape
 Colony. For the accelerated egress, all the stations suggested for
 ingress retarded will be available.       For egress retarded, although
 the fixed Observatories at Melbourne and Sydney will contribute to
 the observation    of the phenomenon, they will have the sun at a some
  what low elevation (10 — 14°) ; it is therefore proposed to rely mainly
  upon New Zealand, with which we are in telegraphic communication
 via Sydney. Considerable correspondence has taken place on the
  subject of Australian longitude, and it is expected that the necessary
  steps to effect the connexion of one of the Observatories,         probably
  Adelaide, with Madras, will be taken early in the ensuing year.
     Sir G. B. Airy has completed the laborious calculations in his
  Numerical Lunar Theory, from which the corrections to the co
  efficients of Delaunay's Lunar Theory are to be deduced ; and in con
  nexion with this work, he has made an investigation of the value of
  the Moon's Secular Acceleration, for which he finally obtained the
  value 5"'477, thus confirming the results obtained           by Professor
  Adams, and subsequently       by Mr. Delaunay.        On this important
  question,    Professor  Adams   has   also   published  an investigation.

year inequality, apparently indicated by the observations, is admitted
or not ("Monthly Notices," vol. xl, Nos. 7 and 8). The Sun's

thus found is 8"-96. (" Astronomische Nachrichten," No. 2,288.)
    In continuation of his researches on tidal retardation from the
action of a satellite on a viscons planet, Mr. G. H. Darwin has in
vestigated the secular changes in the orbit of a satellite, deducing the
early history of the earth and moon from the time when they were
initially in contact, each revolving in the same period of from two to
four hours. This leads to the suggestion that the moon was produced
by the rupture of the primeval planet. In another memoir, Mr. G. H.
Darwin gives analytical expressions for the history of a planet and a

    An important work in connexion with the United States Northern
Boundary Commission has been published by Mr. Lewis Boss, on the
Declination of Fixed Stars.        The systematic corrections to some
seventy catalogues     have  been discussed,  and, from the mean of the
whole, standard declinations of 500 stars have been deduced.
    Dr. Gould's " Uranometria Argentina " and M. Houzeau's " TJra-
nometrie Generale," are of especial value as giving important infor
mation on the brightness and distribution of the stars in the southern

    Interesting results as to the diameters of satellites have been ob
tained by Professor Pickering from photometric observations, on the
assumption that their albedos do not differ greatly from those of
their respective primaries. (" Annals Harvard College Observatory,"

ples, the dimensions of the fixed stars, with especial reference to
binaries and variables of the Algol type.         (" Proc. Amer. Acad.,"
vol. xvi.)    Professor Pickering  has   also  commenced    a photometric
survey of the heavens in which the brightness of every star visible to
the naked eye is to be determined.         He has further undertaken a
search for planetary nebulae by a new method, in which, by the use
of a direct-vision prism in front of the eye-piece, the nebula is at once
 detected by its monochromatic spectrum, focussing a point of light
 instead of a coloured line as in the case of a star.     About a hundred
 thousand stars have been examined, and four new planetary nebula?

   From the grouping of the aphelia of certain periodic comets, Pro

planets, and has indicated their approximate positions.            (" Trans.

agreeing with that found by Professor G. Forbes.         So far, the search
for the hypothetical planet with the 26-inch Washington refractor ha8
been unsuccessful.    ("American Journal of Science," September, 1880.)
   Professor Bredichin's researches on the tails of comets have led
him to the classification of these appendages according to the value
of the solar repulsive force which would have generated them.
Having discussed the forms of the tails of thirty-three comets, he
finds that they belong to three types, corresponding respectively to
repulsive forces 11, 1'4 and 0'3 (the sun's gravitation being taken
as 1), and adopting Zollner's hypothesis of a repulsive force, due to
electricity and inversely proportional to the specific gravity, be infers
that the tails of the three types are composed respectively of
hydrogen, carbon, and iron.         In the case of the second and third
types other elements of nearly the same atomic weight may replace or
be mixed with the carbon and iron, and in such a comet as Donati's
a number     of substances may     be  mixed in the tail, which will con
sequently spread out in the plane of the orbit.         The first type com
posed   of  hydrogen    will  always   remain  separated from the others.

   The appearance, at the beginning of this year, of a great comet in
the southern hemisphere, recalling by the length of its tail and the
smallness of its head the remarkable comet of 1843, has excited great
interest, more especially as it was found that the orbits of the two
comets were sensibly the same. The observations of the comet of
1843, however, do not appear to be compatible with so short a period
as thirty-seven years, and Professor Oppolzer has shown that the
action of a resisting medium would not meet the case.               ("Astro-
nomische Nachrichten," Nos. 2314, 2315.)             Under these circum
stances Professor D. Kirkwood has suggested that the two bodies may
be fragments of one original comet, viz., that of 370 B.C., which is
said to have separated into two parts like Biela's comet.          (" Obser
vatory," No. 43.)       Five other comets (including Faye's periodical
comet)    have  been  discovered   this year, but two of them were lost
through cloudy weather before a second observation                 could be

   At the outset of an undertaking one figures to oneself in imagina
tion what may be done ; towards the close of it one sees in actual fact
what has been done.                                       I
                          In commencing this address had hoped to say
something of the progress of mathematics ; before bringing it to a
conclusion,  I find my space filled and my time exhausted.            How far
the good intentions of this year may be realised in the next, cannot
yet be seen ; but the difficulties of a task do not always diminish the
fascination  of making an attempt.
   On the motion of      Mr. Scott Russell, seconded by Mr. Merrifield, it
was resolved :  —  " That the thanks of the Society be returned to the
President for his Address, and that he be requested to allow it to be
printed."
   The President then proceeded to the presentation         of the Medals : —
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor James Joseph
Sylvester, F.R.S. His extensive and profound researches in pure
mathematics, especially his contributions to the Theory of Invariants
and   Covariants, to the Theory of Numbers, and to Modern Geometry,
may be regarded as fully establishing Mr. Sylvester's claim to the
award of the Copley Medal.
   A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Joseph Lister,
F.R.S. Mr. Lister's claims to the honour of a Royal Medal are based
upon his numerous and valuable contributions to physiological and
biological science during the last thirty years.
   By permission      of its author, the Fellow of the Society best
 qualified, by his own     extensive   researches   on the germ theory,      to
 form a judgment,    I quote  the following account of Professor Lister's
 work and achievements     : —

 9ti                        Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
     " In 1836 and 1837 it was proved independently by Cagniard de la
Tour and Schwann, that vinous fermentation was due to the growth
and      multiplication of a microscopic plant.        At the same time
 Schwann described experiments which illustrated and explained the
conditions, now well known, by which flesh may be preserved from
putrefaction. But Schwann's researches were overshadowed by the
views of accepted authorities, and they continued so up to the publica
tion of Pasteur's investigations. From this point forward the view
gained ground that putrefaction is the work of floating microscopic
organisms ; and that if air be thoroughly cleansed of its suspended
particles, neither its oxygen, nor any other gaseous constituent, is
competent to provoke either fermentation or putrefaction.
     " Condensed into a single sentence, the merit of Mr. Lister consists
in the generalisation, to living matter, of the results obtained by
Schwann and Pasteur with dead matter.             He began with cases of
compound       fracture and with abscesses.   In simple fracture the wound
is internal, the uninjured skin forming a protecting envelope.         Here
nature works the cure after the proper setting of the injured parts.
In compound fracture, on the other hand, the wound extends to the
surface, where it comes in contact with the air ; and here the operator
can never be sure that the most consummate skill will not be
neutralised by subsequent putrefaction.
     " In the earliest of his
                              published communications, Mr. Lister clearly
enunciates, and illustrates by cases of a very impressive character, the
scientific principles upon which the antiseptic system rests.            He
refers to the researches of Pasteur, and shows their bearing upon
surgery. He points to the representative fact, then known but un
explained, that when a lung is wounded by a fractured rib, though
the blood is copiously mixed with air, no inflammatory disturbance
supervenes ; while an external wound penetrating the chest, if it
remains open, infallibly causes dangerous suppurative pleurisy. In
the latter case the blood and serum are decomposed by the micro
scopic progeny of the germs which enter with the air ; in the former
case the air is filtered in the bronchial tubes, and all solid particles are
arrested.       Three years subsequently, this inference of Professor
Lister's was shown to be capable of experimental demonstration.
     " After enunciating the theoretic views which guided him, he thus
expresses himself in his first paper : —
     " ' Applying these principles to the treatment of
                                                       compound fracture ;
bearing in mind that it is from the vitality of the atmospheric particles
that all the mischief arises, it appears that all that is requisite is to
dress the wound with some material capable of killing these septic
germs, provided that any substance can be found reliable for this
purpose, yet not too potent as a caustic'
     " This is the thesis to the illustration and defence of which Pro

  feasor   Lister has devoted himself for the last thirteen years. His
  thoughts and practice during this time have been in a state of growth.
  His insight has been progressive ; and the improvement of experi
  mental methods founded on that insight incessant.          By contributions
  of a purely scientific character, which stamp their author as an accom
  plished experimenter, he has materially augmented our knowledge of
 the most minute forms of life.         The titles- of his papers indicate the
 direction of his labours from time to time ; but they give no notion of
 the difficulties which he has encountered, and successfully overcome.
 He performs, without dread of evil consequences, the most dangerous
 operations.      He ventures fearlesslyupon treatment which, prior to the
 introduction of his system, would have been regarded as no less than
criminal.      In the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, when wards adjacent to
his had to be abandoned, he operated with success in an atmosphere
of deadly infectiveness.      Vividly realising the character and habits of
                         '
the ' invisible enemy      with which he has to cope, his precautions are
minute and severe.        This demand for exactitude of manipulation has
rendered the acceptance of the Antiseptic System slower than it would
otherwise have been ; but a clear theoretic conception has this value
among others : it renders pleasant a minuteness of precaution which
would be intolerable were its reasons unknown.
    " The
             operative surgeons of our day have raised their art to the
highest pitch of efficiency.       Their skill and daring are alike mar
vellous.     Mr. Lister urges an extension of this skill from the operation
to the subsequent treatment, contending that every surgeon ought to
be so convinced of the greatness of the benefits within his reach, as to
be induced to devote to the dressing of wounds the same kind of
thought and pains which he now devotes to the planning and execu
tion of an operation.       His impressive earnestness ; his clearness of
exposition ; his philosophic . grasp of the principles on which his
practice is founded — above all his demonstrated success — have borne
their natural fruit in securing for him the recognition and esteem of
the best intellects of the age."

           a letter addressed to the writer on the 29th of September,
1880, Professor Helmholtz expresses himself thus : —

researches.      He is the author of papers which have been translated
into most European languages on subjects of gunnery and gunpowder;
he is perhaps the highest authority we possess on the higher branches
of artillery science, and the best known on the Continent. His great
talents and attainments are not more conspicuous than his singular
modesty, and his indefatigable industry.         He has been engaged on
these subjects     about  twenty years, having published the first experi
ments in this country with Navez' electroballistic apparatus, in 1862.
     The Rumford      Medal has been awarded      to Dr. William Huggins,
F.R.S.      In  1866, a Royal Medal was awarded to Dr. Huggins for his
important      researches.    Since that time he has been continually
engaged in prosecuting his investigations and in extending them over
a wider range.       Thus he has determined the radial component of the
velocity    of  the  heavenly bodies relatively to our earth, by means
of     the alteration of the refrangibility of certain definite kinds of
light which they emit, or which are stopped by their atmospheres.
 The smallness of the alteration corresponding to a relative velocity
 comparable with the velocity of the earth in its orbit makes the deter
mination a matter of extreme delicacy.          But as early as 1868, he
 had obtained such trustworthy determinations, that he was able to
 announce before the Royal Society that Sirius was receding from our
 solar system with a velocity of about 29"94 miles per second.
     In a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1872, he has given the
 results obtained for a lar6e number of stars, and has shown that some
 are receding and some approaching, and that there seems to be
 a balance of recession in those parts of the heavens, from which we
have reason, from the observed proper motions, which of course can
only be transversal, to conclude that the solar system is receding, and
a balance in favour of approach in the opposite direction ; while yet
it does not appear that the motion of the solar system would alone
 account for the whole of the proper motions of the stars in a radial
 direction.
     The same inquiry was extended to the nebulae, the spectrum of
 which consists of bright lines, and in this case it presented greater
 difficulties.    As those nebular lines which appear pretty certainly to be
 identifiable with hydrogen, are too faint to be employed in the in
 vestigation, and the others are not at present identified with those of
 any known element or compound, he was obliged to avail himself of a
 coincidence between the brightest nebular line and a line of lead. But
 as the coincidence is probably merely fortuitous, the results give only
 the differences of approach or recess of different nebulae.   The observa
  tions seem to show that, so far as has been observed, the nebulae are
  objects of greater fixity as regards motion in space, than the stars.
      The other subject to which Dr. Huggins has more particularly

100                       Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
devoted himself of late, is the mapping of the photographic spectra of
stars.   This was a research of great delicacy, partly on account of the
small quantity of light at the disposal of the observer, partly from the
great accuracy with which the comparison had to be made with the
spectra of known substances, in order that satisfactory conclusions
should be deducible as to the presence or absence of such or snch
substances in the stars.    The results obtained, led to a remarkable
division of the stars into two great classes, naturally with transition
cases, namely, white stars, which showed a group of twelve dark
lines belonging, apparently, to the same substance, probably hydrogen,
and the group of stars, of which our own sun may be taken as a type.
   Besides the researches already mentioned, other papers have been
presented by Dr. Huggins to the Royal Society, on the spectra of
comets, on the spectrum of Uranus, and in particular one in which
he showed that it was possible to detect the heat of the stars,
and has given the results obtained for several.
   The Davy Medal has been awarded to Professor Charles Friedel,
Member of the Institute of France.
   From 1856 to the present time, the investigations of M. Charles
Friedel, ranging over widely remote fields of chemical inquiry, have
been continuous, numerous, and important. Mineralogical, theoretical,
and general chemistry are indebted to him for many valuable contri
butions ; but it is in the department of so-called organic chemistry
that he has more especially laboured ; and herein he has done much
to assist in breaking down the barriers at one time regarded as im
passably isolating the chemistry of carbon compounds.
   Among the subjects of M. Friedel's successful work may be men
tioned more particularly the chemistry of the 3-carbon family of
organic bodies, to which belong propionic acid, lactic acid, glycerine,
propylene, and acetone.      The establishment of the constitution of
lactic acid and of acetone, with the determination of the relationships
to one another of the various, and in many cases isomeric, members of
this large family, constituted for a long time one of the most fiercely
contested as it was, and is, one of the most fundamental problems of
organic chemistry. In the labours effecting the satisfactory solution
of this problem, M. Friedel bore a large share.
   Passing to another branch of investigation, M. Friedel, partly bv
himself, but largely in conjunction in some parts of the work wiiH
Mr. J. M. Crafts, and in other parts with M. A. Ladenburg, made out,
or confirmed in a very striking manner, the analogy subsisting between
the modes of combination of carbon and of silicon, the most charac
teristic elements of the organic and inorganic kingdoms respectively.
   To mention but one more subject of M. Friedel's research, he has,
in conjunction with Mr. J. M. Crafts, made out and defined a simple

 method of wide application for effecting the synthesis of organic com
pounds. This method consists iu bringing together a hydrocarbon and
an organic chloride in presence of chloride of aluminum, whereby the
residues of the two compounds enter into combination to form a more
complex, frequently a highly complex body.             Independently of its
utility, this process of synthesis is of remarkable interest from the
part taken in it by the chloride of aluminum, which, though essential
to the reaction, is found unaltered at the end, and seems to act by
suffering continuously, little by little, a correlative transformation and
regeneration.

                            October 31, 1880.
    The operations at the Kew Observatory in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
now constituted as follows :
                 General  Sir E. Sabine, K.C.B., Chairman.
    Mr. De La Rue, Vice-Chairman.         Vice-Adm. Sir G. H. Richards.

       K.C.M.G.
    The work at the Observatory may be considered under seven         sec
tions   : —
    1st.   Magnetic observations.
    2nd. Meteorological observations.
    3rd. Solar observations.
    4th. Experimental, in connexion with either of the above depart
            ments.
    5th. Verification of instruments.
    6th. Aid to other Observatories.
    7th. Miscellaneous.
                         I. Magneto Observations.
    No change has been made in the Magnetographs, which have
 worked continuonsly during the year. The curves have recently
 indicated the approach of a more disturbed period than has occurred
 for some few years, and a magnetic storm of considerable intensity
 was registered from August 11th to 15th.
     Owing to the gradual secular change of declination, the distance
  between the dots of light upon the cylinder of the magnetometer had
 become too small for satisfactory registration, and it was found neces
 sary to readjust the instrument by a displacement of its zero. From
 a similar cause it was also found necessary to readjust the balance of
  the vertical force magnetometer.
     The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined in
  January, in accordance with the usual practice.

 116                  Report of the Kew   Committee.
   The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
 made    regularly, and the results are given in the tables forming
Appendix I of this Report.
   The Sub-Committee, appointed to consider the best means of
utilising the records of the magnetographs, as mentioned in the
 Report for 1878, reported that it was unadvisable, in their opinion,
to proceed with the regular tabulation of the curves, and suggested that
attention should rather be directed to their comparison with synchro
nous curves, taken at other magnetic Observatories in different parts
of the globe, in order to ascertain whether similar disturbances occur
at these several stations, and at what time intervals ; with a view to
the development of the theory of magnetic disturbance.
   In order to carry out this scheme, a circular, inviting co-operation
on the part of observers provided with magnetographs        of the Kew
pattern, was issued to the Directors of the following Observatories : —
Batavia, Bombay, Brussels, Coimbra, Colaba, Lisbon, Mauritius,
Melbourne, Potsdam,      St. Petersburg (Pawlowsk),      San Fernando,
Stonyhurst, Utrecht, Vienna, and Zi-Ka-Wei.        Replies favourable to
the project were received from all those whose instruments were
working under satisfactory circumstances.
   An examination of the records for the year 1879 indicated the
month of March as that most suitable for the purpose of the com
parison.    Accordingly, a further request for copies of the declination
curves for that month was issued, and, in response, they have at
present been received from : —
   Coimbra, Colaba, Lisbon, Melbourne, St. Petersburg, Stonyhurst,
Vienna, and Utrecht.
   The comparison of these magnetic curves has been undertaken by
Professor W. Grylls Adams, who lias already communicated to the
Swansea Meeting of the British Association a preliminary account of
the principal facts which have as yet come to light.     The discussion,
which is still in progress, cannot be completed nntil data from the
more distant stations, as well as the horizontal and vertical force
curves from all stations for the same month, have arrived.
   The Observatory has also received curves from several of the foreign
Observatories, showing the variations recorded by their instruments
during the progress of the magnetic storm already referred to.
   By the kindness of Professor G. Carey Foster, some experiments were
made at the laboratory of University College, London, with a view to
determine whether the magnetisation of dip-needles could be con
veniently effected by means of a coil of wire conveying an electric
current, thereby avoiding certain defects due to their magnetisation
by bars, after the ordinary method.   The results of these experiments
proved that the requisite magnetic intensity could be easily imparted
in the way referred to.

                       Report   of the Kew Committee.                    117
    At  the request  of Dr. E. Van Rijckevorsel, observations have been
 made with dip-needles constructed of nickel, and also with others of
 steel nickel plated in order to avoid the injnrious effects of rust.   The
 nickel plating proved successful ; bnt it was found impossible to
 impart a sufficient degree of magnetism to the nickel needles to allow
 of their giving reliable results.
    The magnetic instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
 their manipulation obtained by Dr. Chistoni and Dr. Harris.
    Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various
 data have been supplied to Professor W. G. Adams, Mr. Adie, Pro
 fessor Barrett, Messrs. Barker and Son, Mr. Casella, Professor G. C.
 Foster, Mr. J. E. H. Gordon, Mons. Marie-Davy, Dr. Rijckevorsel,
and Professor Balfour Stewart.
    The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
 made during the year    : —

                    II. Meteorological Observations.
    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively, of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity,
wind (direction and velocity), and rain have been maintained in
regular operation throughout the year.
   New fume pipes have been fitted over the thermograph and- electro-
gfraph to carry off the products of combustion of the gas more
efficiently than the old ones, which had become much corroded.
    The standard eye observations made five times daily, for the con
trol of the automatic records, have been duly registered through the
year, together with the additional daily observations at 0 h. 45 ra.
p.m. in connexion with the Washington synchronous system, and at
t? h. 45 m. p.m., for the     second synchronous system organized by
M. Mascart, Directeur du Bureau Central Meteorologique, Paris.
   The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
weekly to the Meteorological Office.
   The following is a summary of the number of meteorological         obser

   In  compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
to the Kew Committee,        the Observatories at Aberdeen, Armagh,
Falmouth, Glasgow, Oxford          (Badcliffe), Stonyhurst, and "Valencia,
have been visited     as  usual   and their instruments     inspected by Mr.
Whipple during his vacation.
   With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
of the meteorological resnlts have been regularly forwarded to, and
pnblished by "The Times," "The Illustrated London News," and
" The
       Torquay Directory," and meteorological data have been supplied
                    "
to the editor of      Symons' Monthly Meteorological Magazine," the
Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Messrs. Anderson,
Buchan, Eaton, Greaves, McDonald, Rowland, Wragge, and others.
   Eleetrograph. — This instrument has been in continuous action
through the year.
   During the severe frost of last winter it was found necessary to
heat the water flowing      through     the discharge  pipe   by means of  a
spirit lamp, suspended from the collector.         This precaution enabled
the records   to be maintained throughout the year, with very few in
terruptions due to frost.
   In August the instrument was dismounted, and a fresh supply of
acid placed in the jar, the charge-keeping properties of which had
become slightly deteriorated.
   Some experiments have been made with a view of determining the
effect of the interposition of an air condenser between the collector
and the electrometer, in reducing the extent and rapidity of the
electrical changes registered by the instrument under certain atmo
spheric conditions. These experiments are still in progress.
   No steps have yet been taken as to the discussion of the seven
years' curves now in store, but suggestions as to the means of dealing
with them are under consideration.
   The self-recording instruments, with their attendant photographic
processes and methods of tabulation, have been studied by Professor C.
Niven, who has succeeded the late Professor D. Thomson in the charge
of the Aberdeen Observatory ; by Dr. Chistoni, of the Roman Obser
vatory ; and by M. Perrotint, Director of the Nice Observatory.

                       Report   of the Kew  Committee.                 119
      The spare barograph, thermograph, and Beckley rain gauge, the
   property of the Meteorological Council, formerly deposited at the
   Observatory, having been lent by the Council to the Radcliffe
   Trustees, were set up at their Observatory in Oxford at the beginning
   of the year.
      With a view to prevent certain failures occasionally taking place in
   the photographic system of registration, which are attributed to
   chemical action in the wax used in the preparation of the paper, it
   has been considered desirable to introduce in part of the work, by way
   of experiment, a new process devised by Captain Abney, R.E., P.R.S.,
  in which unwaxed paper is employed.
      At the request of Admiral Mouchez, Directeur de l'Observatoire
  National, Paris, a set of copies of the autographic records, together
  with descriptions of the instruments and other particulars respecting
  the Observatory, has been forwarded to the Museum recently
  established in that Institution.
                          III. Solar Observations.
     The preliminary reductions of the measurements of the Kew solar
 negatives having been completed in January last, a re-examination of
 the pictures was made with the object of classifying the spots ac
 cording to a scale of figure and magnitude ; this being now terminated,
 Mr. McLaughlin is engaged assisting Mr. Marth in the reduction
 to heliocentric elements of the pictures from January, 1864, to April,
 1872.
     These operations have all been conducted under the direction and at
 the expense of Mr. De La Rue.
     The eye observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath
 Schwabe, as described in the Report for 1872, have been made on
 246 days, in order to maintain for the present the continuity of
the Kew records of sun-spots.       The sun's surface was observed to be
free from spots on 27 of those days.
    A catalogue of the whole of the solar photographs taken at Kew
during a decade 1862 to 1872, has been prepared and forwarded to the
Solar Committee of the Science and Art Department.
    At the request of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society,
the valuable collection of MSS. containing the memorable series of
sun-spot observations made by Hofrath Schwabe, of Dessau, during
the years 1825 to 1867, which had been deposited in the Library of
the Observatory, the first volumes since 1865, was transferred to the
Society's Library at Burlington House, London.        In order, however,
to render the collection of sun-spot observations at Kew as complete
as possible, and to prevent the total loss of the observations in case
of fire, the Committee voted the sum of £90 to defray the cost of
making a complete copy of the solar drawings.

120                  Report   of the Kew   Committee.
    This was accordingly done, and accurate tracings made of every one
 of Schwabe's drawings. These were pasted into blank books, and any
 important notes were transcribed at the same time.
    The Observatory, therefore, now possesses a complete record of the
'condition of the sun's surface, extending from November, 1825, to the
present date.
   The work was performed by the members of the Observatory staff,
in extra honrs.
   Transit Observations. — Ninety observations have been made of sun-
transits, for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the Obser
vatory : 102 clock and chronometer comparisons have also been made.
   Sunshine Recorder. — The Campbell sunshine recorder, described in
the Report for 1875, continues in action, and the improved form of the
instrument, giving a separate record for every day of the duration of
sunshine, has been regularly worked throughout the year, and its
curves tabulated.     In April last, the new pattern of card-holder, de
vised by Professor Stokes (" Quarterly Journal Met. Soc," vol.           vi,
p. 83) was substituted for that previously employed, in order that the
records produced by the instrument might be in conformity with
those obtained from the other stations of the Meteorological Council.
Since that date both cards and tabulations have been transmitted
regularly to the Meteorological Office, copies, however, being retained
in the Observatory for reference.
   A similar sunshine recorder has been constructed for the Melbourne
Observatory, and, after trial and adjustment at Kew, was transmitted
together with a set of pattern-cards, through the Crown Agents            to
Mr. Ellery.
                       IV. Experimental Work.
   Winstavlei/'s Recording Radiograph.   — This instrument, designed      by
Mr.    D. Winstanley, as described in    " Engineering," vol. xxx,   316,
                                                                    p.
for the purpose of registering continuously the amount of radiation
from the sky, by mechanical means, upon a sheet of blackened paper,
has been erected on the roof of the Observatory since the beginning       of
August.
   Its indications, which were procured for some weeks, showed        to
                                                                     it
be a  much more delicate appliance than the sunshine recorder or the

a scale value for them.
    Wind Component Integrator. — This instrument, owing to the causes
referred to in last Report, was not kept in action after that date, and
in December      was dismounted.

the Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus at South Kensington, the
costs attendant on its trial at Kew having been defrayed by the Meteo
rological Council.
    Photo-nephoscope. — This instrument is still in the hands of Captain
Abney, R.E., but experiments have been made with several other
forms of nephoscope, and also with a new cloud-camera,         designed by
the    Superintendent.
    Exposure                      —
                 of Thermometers. Experiments have been continued
throughout the year at the Observatory, with the view of determining
the relative merits of different patterns of thermometer screens.      For
this purpose, there have been erected on the lawn a Stevenson's
screen, of the ordinary pattern, and a large wooden cage, containing
a Wild's screen, of the pattern employed in Russia.         Each of these
screens contains a dry and a wet bulb thermometer, and a maximum
and minimum, all of which are read daily, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., their
indications being compared with those of the thermograph at the same
hours.     A third portable metal screen, designed by Mr. De La Rue
for use on board Light-ships, which contains a dry bulb thermometer
only, is also carried into the open air by the observer, and read at the
same time as the fixed instruments.
    The cost of these experiments is borne by the Meteorological Council.
     Glycerine Barometer. — This instrument, devised and erected by
Mr. Jordan, as mentioned in last year's Report, has been in successful
operation throughout the year, and, in compliance with the request of
the inventor, has been continuously observed in conjunction with the
mercurial barometer five times daily.        In April last, with a view to
the more complete removal of the minute quantity of air which had
adhered to the sides of the tube at the time of filling, and had since
risen at intervals into the vacuum, air pressure was applied to the
lower surface of the column by means of a force pump, and the
glycerine driven up to the top of the tube.       The small bubble of air
 was then expelled through the stoppered aperture, its place being
filled by a drop of the glycerine from the cup.
     A complete description of the instrument, by Mr. Jordan, was read
 before the Royal Society, on January 22nd, and has been printed in
 their " Proceedings," vol. xxx, p. 105. As a preparatory step towards
 the discussion of the observations      made with the instrument, Mr.
 Jordan has computed a table for the reduction of its readings to a
 temperature of 32° F., the mean coefficient of expansion of glycerine
 having been determined by Professor A. W. Reinold to be "000303
 for 1° F. between 32° and 212°.      The value of the glycerine barometer
 as   an instrument of precision cannot be determined until the observa
  tions now   in process of reduction by Mr. Jordan have been completed.
 Meanwhile      the  Committee  have decided   to continue the periodical
  readings, and to make several separate series of readings, at frequent

 intervals, during periods of atmospheric disturbance, so as to de
 termine its relative degree of sensibility as compared with ordinary
 mercurial instruments.
    De La Rue Evaporation Gauge. — The Vice-Chairman of the Com
 mittee has devised a small evaporation gauge, by means of which the
 water given off from a continually-wetted sheet of vegetable parch
ment is measured daily. Two of these instruments, constructed by
Messrs. Negretti and Zambia, were set up at Kew, and their indications
noted every day, at 10 a.m., together with those of a Piche Evapori-
metre, until the end of July, when, at the request of the Meteorological
 Council, they were transferred to the care of Mr. Shaw, who is at
present engaged at Cambridge in an experimental investigation on
hygrometry.
    De La Rue Anemograph. — The electrical attachment          to this in
strument    having been successfully        completed   after a somewhat
lengthy series of experiments, its registrations were discontinued and
the instrument was partially dismounted, in order to allow of its vane
being used for certain experiments now in progress with regard to the
working of air-meters.
   Air Thermometer. — The construction of the Standard Air Thermo
meter is still delayed, Professors Thorpe and Riicker not having yet com
pleted their comparisons between the mercurial and air thermometers.
    By the kindness of Professor H. A. Rowland, of the Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, U.S.A., the Committee has had the oppor
tunity afforded it of comparing with a number of Kew standards,
one of the thermometers         which Professor Rowland has employed
in his researches on the deviation of the mercurial from the air
thermometer.       The instrument is that — Baudin, No. 6166 — which
Dr. Joule (" Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts and Sciences, 1880 ") com
pared with the instrument he used in his determination of the
mechanical equivalent of heat (" Phil. Trans., 1878 ").          Professor
Rowland has kindly promised to present the Committee with another
of nis standards, which has been compared with his air thermometer
throughout a greater range of scale than the present instrument.
                     V. Verification of Instruments.
    The following magnetic     instruments have been verified,   and their
constants have been determined      : —
         A Unifilar, by Gibson, for Elliott Brothers.
         Four Dip-circles, by Casella.
         A pair of Dipping-needles for Elliott Brothers.
         Three Dipping-needles for Dr. E. Van Rijckevorsel.
         Two Magnetograph-needles       for M. Dechevrens, Zi-Ka-Wei.
         An Azimuth    Compass for Barker and Son.

                     Report  of the Kew  Committee.                    123
   There have also been purchased on commission     and verified   : —
        A Dip-circle for Dr. Mielberg, Tiflis.
        A Dip-circle for the Russian Expedition    to the Month of the
          Lena.
        Two Magnetograph-needles for Dr. Wild, St. Petersburg.
   There has been a satisfactory increase in the number       of meteoro
logical instruments verified, which was as follows : —

   Besides these, 22 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 14 of
which were subjected in the hydraulic press, without injury, to strainn
exceeding three and a half tons on the square inch, and 165 Thermo
meters have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury, making
a total of 5,531 for the year.
   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 20 cases.
   A special set of Standard Thermometers has been constructed for the
Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, at Paris.
   Seventeen Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated and
divided, and supplied to societies and individuals during the year.
   Three Metre Scales have been divided on glass for the University
College Laboratory.
   The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified : —
           Hydrometers                                          10

   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
40 Barometers,    50 Thermometers, 1 Hydrometer, and 2 Anemometers.
   Anemometer Testing. — The Committee have had before them the
question of the desirability of erecting a suitable apparatus for the

 124                      Report   of the Kew     Committee.
testing of Anemometers       and Air-meters ; but in the opinion of
Dr. Robinson it will be better to postpone its erection for a time.
Meanwhile these instruments, temporarily erected on the roof, are
compared directly with the Standard Anemograph, and tables ot
corrections   supplied to reduce their readings to the same scale of
velocities as that indicated by the latter instrument.
   The experiments made in 1874, and described in the Report for
                                                       " at the
that year, to determine by means of a " steam-circus            Crystal
Palace, the true value of Robinson's factors for Anemometers         at
different velocities, are under discussion by Professor G. G. Stokes,
F.R.S., and have been found to afford valuable results. A paper,
which he intends to communicate on the subject to the Royal Society,
is nearly ready.
   Experiments have been made with one of M. Hagemann's Anemo
meters (" Quart. Jour. Met. Soc," vol. v, p. 203), designed for use at
sea, the results being submitted to the Meteorological Council.
   A Bridled Anemometer, designed by Mr. F. Galton, has also been
tried.
     The Galton Thermometer-tester has had a new water-heater fitted          to
it, and has besides undergone thorough repair and renovation.
   The Winchester Observatory of the Yale College, U.S.A., having
recently established       department
                           a            on the Kew system, for the
verification of thermometers, Professor Newton, Secretary of the
Institution, visited our Observatory, studied the methods employed for
comparing thermometers, and procured copies of the various forms
and certificates used in the work.
   The Sextant-testing apparatus has been improved during the year
by the substitution of reticules, photographed on glass, for the glass
threads in the focus of the collimators. The latter, by their breakage,
rendered frequent re-adjustment of the instrument necessary.
   Standard    Barometers. — Numerous comparisons     have been made
during the year between the two Welsh Standard Barometers, the old
Royal Society Standard (which           itfound cannot without risk of
                                             is
derangement be returned to Burlington House), and Newman, No. 34,
the working Standard of the Observatory.
  Arrangements have been made by means of which the latter may,
when desired, be read by the cathetometer, as well as by its own scale,
the correct value of which has also been re-determined.
                           VI. Aid   to Observatories.
    Waxed Papers, fyc, supplied.     —Waxed       paper has been supplied to the
following Observatories —   :
     Batavia,       Glasgow, Lisbon, Montsouris (Paris), Mauritius,
                Colaba,
Oxford (Radcliffe), and Utrecht.

      Anemograph    Sheets have also been sent to the     Madras Observatory,
    and Mauritius,   and
      Blank Forms for the entry of magnetic observations          to Professor
    Young, Princetown,     U.S.A.
                              VII.   Miscellaneous.
      Loan Exhibition. —"With the exception of the Hodgkinson's Actino-
    meter and the three instruments mentioned in the 1878 Report, the
   instruments specified in the Report for 1876      still remain in chargo of
   the Science and    Art Department, South Kensington.
      At the request of the Secretary of the Royal Society several sets of
   comparisons have been made between the Hodgkinson's Actinometers,
   the property of the Royal Society, and a similar instrument sent home
  from    India by Mr. Hennessey, F.R.S., who has observed with it in
  that country.
     International    Comparison of Standards. — The Committee         received
  an application from the         Secretaries of the Comite International
  de Meteorologie inviting them to assist in the suggested scheme of an
  international    comparison of standard barometers, thermometers, and
  anemometers.       This idea has since been abandoned, but M. Hooremann,
  Chef de     Service of the Brussels Observatory, has visited Kew, with
  several standard instruments, in order to make a direct comparison
  between the Observatories of Brussels and Kew.
     At the request of Miss Ormerod, F.M.S., experiments were made
  on the occasion of testing some thermometers at very low temperatures
 to determine the effect of great cold upon the vitality of certain grubs
 and insects selected by her for trial.
     The Superintendent has, with the consent of the Committee, sub
 mitted a paper to the Royal Society on
                                                 " The Results of an Inquiry
 into the Periodicity of Rainfall," which was printed in the
                                                                    " Proceed
 ings," vol. xxx, p. 200.
     He has also read a paper before the Meteorological Society " On the
 Rate at which Barometric Changes traverse the British Isles," published
 in the " Quarterly Journal," vol. vi, p. 136.
     The Committee, having memorialised the Under Secretary of State
for the Colonies with reference to the establishment of an Observatory
for magnetical and meteorological purposes at Hong Kong, has been
gratified by the receipt of an announcement to the effect that the
Governor of Hong Kong has been authorised to propose a vote for
the establishment of an Observatory in that colony.
     Workshop. — The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as
the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine, procured by Grants
from either the Government Grant Funds or the Donation Fund, for
the use of the Kew Observatory, have been kept in thorough order,

12(5                  Report   of  the Kew Committee.
and many of them are in constant, and others in occasional nse at
the Observatory, but the funds of the Committee do not at present
allow of the employment of a mechanical assistant, although one is
much needed.
   Library. — During the year the Library has received, as presents, the
publications of
   14 English Scientific Societies and Institutions, and
   47 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions.
   Ventilation Experiments. — The Sub-Committee of the Sanitary
Institute of Great Britain is still engaged in experiments on the
ventilating power of cowls of different form, for which purpose space
has been placed at its disposal in the experimental house.    In addition
to this, the Institute has recently erected a wooden hut with an elevated
wooden platform over it in the park, at a sufficient distance from the
Observatory to avoid the eddies in the wind caused by it and the
adjacent buildings.
   Observatory and Grounds. — The buildings and grounds have been
kept in repair throughout the year, and the rooms in the basement and
some of the upper rooms have been painted and whitened by the
Board of Works.                                                           <
   No action having been taken by the Commissioners with respect to
 the footpath across the park, its temporary repair has been carried on
at the expense of the Committee.

                       Report of   the Kew Committee.                   120
                               APPENDIX I.
 Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.,
     Lang. Oh lm 15" 1 W.,for the year October 1879 to September 1880.
    The observations    of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KC1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets N D and N E being employed for
the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3£ inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0"46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
   The value of log irK employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at tem
perature 60°    F.
   The induction-coefficient /i is 0-000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature            t0 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                 00001194(^-35) +0000,000,213(*o-35)*
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked 10 foot and 18 feet, are 1-000075 feet and P300097 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
 of the suspension-thread subsequently.
    No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer          or arc of
 vibration, these being always very small.

    In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
 of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined by the
 late  Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
     The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G. Figg.

I. " On a Simplified Form of the Torsion-Gravimeters of Broua

       Deputy Superintendent, Great Trigonometrical Survey of
       India. Received October 31, 1880.
    The present communication anticipates one of greater length ami
extent, which I hope to be enabled to offer for publication in the
"                " of the
   Proceedings               Society, the subject of which is the gravi-
meters mentioned in the above title.              In case the account which I
there give of these instruments should be delayed, it seems advisable
to hasten, if possible, the time when a serviceable gravimeter shall be
available to geodesista, by pointing out a method by which the same
principle may be embodied in a simpler instrumental shape. It is
not necessary for this purpose that a prior knowledge of the existing
designs should be presumed.            I hope to be able to show all that
is essential without drawing upon any source but a moderate know
ledge of physics.
   Let us imagine a weight, P, suspended by two* parallel lines,
flexible, but inelastic, and offering no resistance on their own account
to torsion.    Let their length be R, and their distance asunder 2r.
Also let 0 be the angle through which P is turned by some external
force.   Then it may be shown that the force which P exerts in a
               * There is no necessary restriction to two suspenders.

this may be represented by the simple function                     P—        sinf?, which varies
directly as the sine of the angle of detortion, being 0 at zero and
180°, and a maximum at 90°.
   This is the ordinary law of torsion of a bifilar balance, in which the
suspending lines are regarded as non-resisting.
   Now suppose the weight P held fast at its position of rest while
the upper ends of the suspending lines, no longer impotent, but
endued with elasticity and a consequent power of resistance to torsion,
are turned, severally, about their own individual axes, through an
angle ij. The force which will be thereby developed, in what we may
now call the wires, will be a true " torsion
                                                  "
                                                    force.  And, if   am                   I
not mistaken, it will vary directly as the angle of torsion, and
inversely as the length of the wire, but not as the tension nor as the
distance of the wires from each other.
   Let T be what I may call the factor of torsion, for the particular
quality of wire in use.    By this I mean the force, measured in grains
(provisionally),  which,  exerted  at a distance unity (in inches) from
the axis, will balance the tendency of the wire, when twisted through

     Again, since 0=— tan0=— sec0                    cos2#
 it is clear that r must       be small,   otherwise 0 would      be large, and  this
would demand         a great   length of wire.     We may, indeed, put       R=6^
as the least allowable,       and this at once gives R=177 r2, at least.           It
seems therefore that we must estimate R first.                 Let us take 3 feet or
36 inches.       This    gives   r<--r^=, or <      "45    inch.   A smaller   value
                                     v 177
would give      a  lower pitch to the twist, which is very desirable.            We
may therefore take r=0'4 inch.                Whence <j>=59ir x '16, in terms of
radius,     or   =-^lx-16=4"7         revolutions.      Finally,   tan0= — 0, and
.-.0=02° nearly.
    We may sum up the results, so far, as follows : — A weight of
200 lbs., suspended by two 0 03 inch steel wires, 36 inches in length,
parallel at four-fifths of an inch apart, will be in unstable equilibrium
at 92° from its normal position, when the upper ends of the wires
have each been turned about their own centres through 4 revolutions
250° +92°, or 4 revolutions 342°, from the same normal position.
    In this condition any addition to the weight will tend to strengthen
the equilibrium, while, on the contrary, any relief of weight will
throw the system over the summit and set it off, allowing it to expend
the torsion in twisting the two wires together.
    I will now show how this arrangement may be adapted as a gravi-
meter, not so much aiming at a description of a finished instrument
as at a sketch of something which will fully illustrate what a more
perfect design would fulfil.
    A piece of wire, of the kind described, 7 feet long, is to be twisted
upon itself, without straining, giving it ten full turns of torsion, and
the ends are then to be secured to each other.                   This can easily be
done so as to give it no chance of relieving itself otherwise than by set,
a term which I understand to be the technical one in this connexion,
meaning that change which takes place in a wire when it is super-
torted or overturned beyond what its elasticity will bear.                A wire so

  1880.]        Torsion- Gravimeters   of Broun and Babinet.           145
 tied tip should retain its torsion indefinitely. The force thus per
 manently stored represents the constant force against which gravity
 is to be measured.
     To use it, I imagine the ends of the double or twisted cord clamped
 in two frames of suitable make. The upper one grasps the junction,
 the lower one the bight. The wires issue from the jaws of the clamps
 at 08 inch from each other.         The upper clamp is attached to a
 support capable of sustaining, without shake, the intended weight of
 "200 lbs.   The lower is attached to the weight so as to have as little
loose motion as may be, but so as also to be easily detached for trans
port. Before detaching it the wires should be allowed to twist upon
 each other.     They would then be placed, with their clamps, in a box
 specially prepared to guard them from all imaginable injury.
    There would be an arrangement above by which, when attached,
 the upper clamp would be raised slowly, so as to take up the weight ;
which would be turned without rising as the wires untwisted, until
finally, it would hang ; the wires then being in a state of torsion, the
lower ends in a different vertical plane from the upper, according to
the weight.       I assume that on thus commencing       the weight is in
excess, so that the angle between the two planes (which will be the
 6 of the theory) will be about 90°.
     In this condition we want means of relieving the suspension of
so much of the weight as will allow the mass to reach the position of
 unstable equilibrium, and of determining exactly how much. This
 I  propose to effect as follows : —
     The weight is to consist of a cylindrical drum, capable of holding
 3 cubic feet of water.      Near the bottom it will have a small stop
cock.     When    the apparatus is in repose, the cock is to be turned.
 The flow of water will relieve the weight, the dram will slowly turn,
under the solicitation of the wires. If allowed to run freely it can bo
shut off when the critical point has been passed. This is the first
approximation. A little water is put back, and now the cock is
turned so as to reduce the flow to drops only. The effect can be
watched with a microscope.        The flow can at any time be stopped or
accelerated.     Experience will enable this determination to be made
with a degree of precision which it is impossible to over-estimate.
    The drum shonld be as light as possible, and silvered inside or pla
tinised. The object is to secure a minimum of friction. As the critical
point is approached the force is so small that it would take long to
move the whole mass if solid ; and if the whole mass were in motion
its momentum would be troublesome.         For the same reason the obser
vation cannot be made until the body of water is at rest.
    The same drum will serve for all weights, and makes it possible to
obtain a series of results with different pairs of wires — all prepared in
the same way, but of different torsions and widths apart.

146           On a Simplified          Form of Torsion- Gravimeter.               [Dec.   9.
  Finally, the desired result will depend on the weights.      consider       I
that to weigh accurately even a large body of water is a thing that can
certainly be done, but how to do it forms no part of my present design.
The drum might conveniently be constructed with a false bottom, the
real bottom of the water space being conical, with the stopcock at the
apex.
   By an easy arrangement    the closing of the cock might be effected
as a consequence   of the critical point of unstable equilibrium being
reached and passed, the swing being checked by a stop pressing on the
cock and shutting it off.    Being thus self-acting, the flow might be
made as slow as desired, with the certainty of the proper result being
reached without further attention.
   The quantity of water remaining could then be measured at leisure.
   The change of gravity which would cause a change of rate of one
second per diem in a seconds pendulum is t3lt>0 part. On a weight
of 200 lbs., or 1,400,000 grs., this would be 32-4 grs., or rather more
than half a fluid dram.
   I am, of course, quite aware that the efficiency of such a gravimeter
depends ultimately on the constancy of the torsion. This is a sine qua
nun in any gravimeter on the torsion principle, and I assume it to
exist.  If it does not exist, no gravimeter on this principle can be
successful.
   Nor am     I regardlessthat this, and all other gravimeters depending
on elasticity, are at the mercy of temperature.    But however impossible
it may be to command a definite and uniform temperature wherever
such an instrument may be instated for observation of the change of
gravity, the converse is possible enough : the constancy of gravity can
be guaranteed* while observations are instituted for determining the
effect of thermometric change. So that if insufficient knowledge of the
variation of elasticity with temperature debars such an instrument
from being used as a gravimeter, it may with the more reason be looked
to to increase that knowledge.
    It seems only necessary to add that the mode of utilising the fact of
a position of unstable equilibrium existing, if desired, between 0=90°
and 0=180°, as here indicated, may be open to objection without pre
venting that fact being capable of utilisation in some better way. The
need of a statical gravimeter is so great that I hope what        have said  I
may    draw  attention to the subject by showing  how  very simple it really
is.    Under correction,     I
                            would hazard the assertion that there is no
instrument which would command a more immediate field of useful
ness than a simply constructed gravimeter, and I think I have shown
that it is possible to construct one.

ine seven specimens of fossilized wood from the Miocene beds of the
Mackenzie River for microscopical examination, and, if possible, de

been commnnicated to the Society at the end of the last session.
    The following are the species which I have been able to de
 termine : —
    1. Sequoia Canadensis, Schroter n. sp. (Specimens 1 and 2).* — This
 wood is very well preserved.             (It belongs to the group Cupressoxylon
 of Kraus.)         Its anatomy shows a great resemblance to that of Sequoia
 gigantea.        The principal differences are the following : —
     (a.) In the cells of the medullary rays of S. Canadensis, the radial
 pores are always arranged in one horizontal row, whilst S. gigantea has
 two rows of pores in the extreme ranges of cells.
     (/}.) The number of superposed ranges of cells in the medullary
 rays in S. Canadensis is 76. In S. gigantea it is only 55.
     The differences between S. Canadensis and S. sempervirens are
 greater than those between the former and S. gigantea, so that S. Cana
 densis cannot belong to 8. Langsdorffii, which occurs at the same
 locality, and which is the Tertiary ancestor of S. sempervirens. It is,
 therefore, probable that the wood which I have examined belongs to
 one of the other Tertiary species of Sequoia (perhaps S. Sternbergii,
 which approaches very closely S. gigantea).                  Until this identity is
  established I designate it provisionally as S. Canadensis.
     2. Ginkgo spec.        (Specimens 4 to 7.) Although not so well pre
  served as the preceding instances of wood, these specimens are easily
  recognisable as belonging to the genus Ginkgo by their very charac
  teristic medullary rays.           Perhaps they should be placed under the
  species G. adiantoides, Ung., which is the commonest of Tertiary
  Ginkgos, and has been found in Saghalien and in Greenland, between
  which two localities the Mackenzie River lies.

    In 1877    I had   the honour of presenting to the Royal Society* the
 results of     some    determinations of specific inductive capacity of
 glasses, the results being obtained with comparatively low electro
 motive forces, and with periods of charge and discharge of sensible
 duration. In 1878 Mr. Gordonf presented to the Royal Society results
 of experiments, some of them upon precisely similar glasses, by a
 quite different method with much greater electromotive forces, and
 with very short times of charge and discharge.               Mr. Gordon's results
 and mine differ to an extent which mere errors of observation cannot
 account for. Thus, for donble extra dense flint glass I gave lO'l,
 Mr. Gordon 8*1, and subsequently 3'89.J These results indicate one
 of three things, either my method is radically bad, Mr. Gordon's
 method is bad, or there are some physical facts not yet investigated
which would account for the difference.                 Two possible explanations
 have been suggested : 1st, possibly for glass K is not a constant, but is
a function of the electromotive force. 2nd. When a glass condenser is
 discharged for any finite time, a part of the residual discharge will be
included with the instantaneous discharge, and the greater the time
the greater the error so caused.             To test the first I measured the
capacity of thick glass plates with differences of potential ranging
from 10 to 500 volts, and also of thin glass flasks between similar
                                I
limits ; the result is that cannot say that the capacity is either greater
or less where the electromotive force is 5,000 volts per millimetre than
where it is ^ volt per millimetre.           The easiest way to test the second
hypothesis is to ascertain how nearly a glass flask can be discharged
in an exceedingly short time. A flask of light flint glass was tested ;
it was charged for some seconds, discharged for a time not greater
than ryJoo second, and the residual charge observed so soon as the

  electrometer    needle came to rest ; the result was that the residual
  charge   under   these circumstances did not exceed 3 per cent, of the
  original charge, also that it mattered not whether the discharge lasted
  TTb'oo second or       second.      These experiments suffice to show that
  neither of the above suppositions accounts for the facts.
     I have repeated my own experiments with the guard ring condenser,
  but with a more powerful battery, and with a new key which differs
  from the old one inasmuch as immediately after the condensers are
  connected to the electrometer they are separated from it. In no case
  do I obtain results differing much from those I had previously pub
 lished.
     Lastly, a rough model of the five plate induction balance used by
 Mr. Gordon was constructed, but arranged so that the distances of the
 plates could be varied within wide limits.             So far as instrumental
 means at hand admitted, Mr. Gordon's method was used.                  A plate of
 double extra dense flint and a plate of brass were tried.             In the first,
 by varying the distances of the five plates, values of K were obtained
ranging from 1 J to 8^, with the latter values from r'g to 3. It is clear
 that the five plate induction balance thus arranged cannot give reliable
 results.
     The explanation of the anomaly, then, is that the deviation from
 uniformity of field in Mr. Gordon's apparatus causes errors greater
 than anyone would suspect without actual trial.              It is probable that
 the supposed       change   of  electrostatic   capacity with time may be
 accounted for in the same way.

      General Form of the Cochlea of the Duckbill or Omithorhynchus.
    This cochlea consists of a somewhat curved tube, about a quarter of
an inch (6-3 millims.) in length, and one-twentieth of an inch (l-26
millim.) in diameter, projecting forwards from the cavity of the vesti
bule and embedded in the substance of the petrous bone.               It is nearly
horizontal, and is slightly curved outwards. N
    In section the tube is first oblong, with its greatest diameter from
top to bottom, then somewhat triangular, and finally oval, with its
greatest diameter from side to side.              It terminates in a slightly
enlarged    rounded   extremity,   flattened  from  top to bottom.

150                              Dr. U. Pritehard.                           [Dec      9,
                 Comparison with Typical Mammals            and Birds.
    In general form the duckbill's cochlea closely resembles that of the
bird, and is very different to the spiral cochlea of the ordinary
mammal.       The two first dilfer, however, in that the duckbill's is
more curved, and curved outwards instead of inwards, as in the bird.
The enlarged apex of the former is rounded, that of the bird oval.
The typical mammalian cochlea tube differs from that of the duckbill,
in being spiral instead of merely curved, in tapering from commence
ment to apex, and in being much longer.                   Lastly, the axis of the
spiral cochlea is horizontal, whereas that of the curved one is vertical.
The Internal Arrangement        and Minute Structure       of the Duckbill's Cochlea.
    The interior of the tube is divided horizontally into two scalse by a
partition, the inner portion of which is thick and bony (lamina
ossea) ; the outer, thin and membranous (lamina membranacea) ; a
third scala is formed by a delicate membrane (membrane of Beissner)
proceeding from the upper surface of the lamina ossea to the inner*
wall of the tube.
    The upper and larger division is the scala vestibuli, and this com
municates posteriorly with the vestibule ; the lower is the scala tympani.
These two are united at the apex of the cochlea by means of an oval
opening, helicotrema.          The third, a small triangular tube, is the
ductus cochleas, or scala media, and this constitutes the membranous
labyrinth ; it contains the endolymph, and is entirely separate from
the other two scales, which contain the epilymph.               The ductus cochleas
 is lined with epithelium ; the scala vestibuli and tympani with
endothelium.
    The lamina ossea is a wedge-shaped mass of modified bone attached
to the lower part of the outer wall and the outer part of the floor of
the tube.      Its inner free margin presents a deep groove (marginal
sulcus), the lower lip of which projects further inwards than the
upper.     The lamina ossea does not extend to the apex of the cochlea,
and thus allows of the communication between the scales vestibuli and
tympani.
    The ductus cochleae is triangular in section, the floor is formed by
the inner portion (limbus) of the lamina ossea and a strong membrane
 (membrana basilaris), which stretches from the lower lip of the sulcus
to a mass of connective tissue (ligamentum cochleas) adherent to the
inner wall of the cochlea.         The inner wall of the ductus is formed of
this ligamentum        cochleas  ; and  the outer wall, or sloping roof, by the
delicate membrane of Reissner, which springs from the upper surface
   * In describing the position of the parts in the duckbill's cochlea, the median
line of the body is taken as the centre ; in the spiral cochlea, the modiolus or axis.

 of the limbus, and is attached         to the upper part of the ligamentum
cochlea?.
    The membrana         basilaris is composed of three fibrous layers; the
lower, longitudinal ; the middle, transverse ; and the upper, formed of
very fine transverse fibres. There are two blood-vessels running longi
tudinally in the lower layer.
    The ligamentum cochleee is a somewhat triangular mass of con
nective tissue with numerous blood-vessels, which in its upper portion
run longitudinally, and, with the epithelium, form the stria vascularis.
   The membrane of Reissner is composed of a delicate basement
membrane, with the endothelium of the scala vestibuli on its upper
surface, and epithelium on its under surface ; here and there blood
vessels may be traced on it, running from the limbus to the ligament,
and in some places these vessels form convoluted knots.
   The epithelium lining the ductus cochlea? varies according to its
position : that lining the membrane of Reissner is composed of a
single layer of hexagonal cells ; in the sulcus they are rounded ; on the
inner part of the membrana basilaris and the lower portion of the
ligament they are cuboid ; on the upper part of the ligament they are
very peculiar, and resemble the transitional variety closely packed
together.       In the deeper part of the layer run numerous longitudinal
blood-vessels, and this forms the already mentioned stria vascularis.
The remaining portion of the epithelial layer that lies on the lower lip
of the sulcus, and on the onter portion of the membrana basilaris, is
developed into the so-called organ of Corti.
   This organ of Corti consists of a double row of rods (of Corti),
united at their upper ends and separate below ; they stand on the
membrana basilaris, and with it form a triangular tunnel.
   The rods of both rows have cylindrical shafts and enlarged ex
tremities; the upper ends of the inner row are rounded, and fit in
corresponding concavities of the outer row. A delicate process pro
jects inwards from the upper part of each of the rods, the processes of
the outer ones lying above those of the inner.
    Rows of hair cells are arranged on either side of these rods — one*
to the outer side and three to the inner.          Below the three inner rows
are situated rows of nuclear cells (cells with well-marked nuclei, but
 no regular cell-wall), the cells of Deiters.         Lying on the lower lip of
the sulcus is a small mass of nuclear cells, and there is a row of these
 cells at each of the lower angles of the triangular tunnel.
    The inner and outer side of the organ of Corti is formed of modified
 columnar cells. A reticulate membrane covers the rods and hair cells,
 the hairs of which project through certain circular meshes of the
 membrane.
   •
       Since presenting this communication  I have discoYered a second row of hair
 cells in this position.

    Covering the limbns, crossing the sulcus, and covering the organ, is
 a mucoid layer, the membrana tectoria.
    Nerve filaments pierce the upper lip of the sulcus and pass to the
 hair cells and nuclear cells of the organ.
    The organ of Corti, with the membrana basilaris below and the
 membrana tectoria above, form the lamina membranacea.
    The ductus cochlere commences as a delicate tube, no doubt con
 nected in some way with the saccule of the vestibule.      Its termination
 is very peculiar; instead of ending with the lamina ossea, where the
 organ of Corti ends, it is continued round the apex of the cochlea to form
 three-fourths of a circle.    Just past the end of the lamina it forms a
 circular tube ; at the other side of the apex, it enlarges into an oval
 chamber (lagena) which terminates at the base of the lamina ossea.
 This lagena is lined by epithelium, chiefly cuboid, but with one large
 patch of nerve epithelium, like the thorn cells and bristle cells fonnd
 in the maculee acusticm of the vestibule.     (" Quar. Jour, of Micros.
 Science," p. 379, 1876.)
    The cochlear branch of the auditory nerve passes through the bone
 on a level with the floor of the tube, but to its outer side.      It gives
 off lateral branches all along to the lamina, and its terminal fibres go
 to the lagena.   The lateral branches pass through a ganglionic mass,
 similar to the ganglion spirale, and then on through the lamina, close
 to its lower surface, finally perforating the upper lip of the sulcus
 by a single row of holes (habenula perforata) and entering the organ
 of Corti as already described.
 Comparison    of the Minute Structure of the Cochlea of  the  Duckbill with
                          that of Typical Mammals.
    From the foregoing description, the duckbill's cochlea is shown to
 be so unmistakably     mammalian in type, that merely the differences
 will here be noted.
    The lamina spiralis membranacea increases in width, and so do its
 component parts, from base to apex of the spiral cochlea ; in the
duckbill's this widening takes place, but not nearly to such an extent
as in the spiral cochlea.
    The rods of Corti in the duckbill are not so well developed as in the
typical mammal.
    The membrane of Reissner in this monotreme presents blood-vessels
on its surface with convoluted knots ; these I have never found nor
read of in this situation in any other mammal. The vas spirale of
the ordinary mammal is represented by two vessels in the duckbill.
   The course of the cochlear nerve necessarily differs in the two
forms of cochlea.
   But the great difference is found in the presence of the lagena at the

   end of the    duckbill's ductus cochleae ; this has never been found in
   mammals,     but is found in birds, reptiles, and amphibians.
                            Comparison   with  the Bird.
      A brief description of the bird's cochlea, will be found in my paper,
  in   extenso ; in this abstract  I propose   only noting the similarities and
  dissimilarities.
      The scales tympani in each type of cochlea correspond.
     There is no scala vestibuli in the bird, the scala media          (ductus)
  occupying the whole of the upper division of the tube.
     The membrane of Reissner and stria vascularis is represented by
 the tegumentum in the bird.
     The lamina ossea corresponds to the quadrilateral cartilage, and the
 ligamentum cochleae to the triangular cartilage of the bird.
     There are no rods of Corti in the bird : the hair cells are more
 numerous and their component hairs are united together into a spine.
    The nerve fibres pierce the quadrilateral cartilage by numerous
 rows of holes, instead of one row, as       in the duckbill and other mam
 mals.
    The lagena, with its macula acustica, is found both in the bird and
 duckbill, but in the former is a direct continuation of the ductus,
 whereas in the latter it is connected by means of a constricted tube.
Moreover, the ductus of the duckbill makes three-fourths of a turn, but
that of the bird is nearly straight.
                  General Conclusions arrived at by the Research.
    Although the outer form of this monotreme's cochlea resembles that
of the    bird in being nearly straight, yet its internal arrangement is
decidedly mammalian.
    The general acoustic       apparatus of the duckbill's cochlea is not
nearly so extensive as that of the ordinary mammal nor is its organ
of Corti so well developed.
   Lastly,     the duckbill's  cochlea  possesses an addition,     the  lagena,
which is not found        in any other mammal, but which is found in the
bird, reptile, and amphibian.        Thus it presents a distinct link between
the cochlea of the higher mammals and that of the lower vertebrates.
   In conclusion, I desire to give my most hearty thanks to the many
Australian friends who, by their zeal in my cause, have provided me
with specimens of the ornithorhynchus in such a good state of
preservation as to allow of their microscopic preparation and
examination.

      B. N. Hennessey, F.R.S., Deputy Superintendent. Great
      Trigonometrical Survey of India. Received May 4, 1880
      (tbe parts witbin Bquare brackets August 28).
   The present actinometrical observations were taken in 1879, in con
tinuation of the series of 1869, published in the " Proceedings of the
 Royal Society," vol. 19 (1870), pp. 225—234; reference is suggested
in these pages for such particulars as are omitted here in order to
avoid needless repetition.       The series of 1869 and 1879 were taken
under identical circumstances as respects stations of observation, actino-
meters, and observers ; in both instances the work was carried on only
in the entire absence of visible cloud or mist between the sun and the
observer, and the sun's declination during the measurements of 1869
was nearly the same as in the observations of 1879. Hence the two
series, separated by an interval of ten years, are thus highly eligible
for comparison with one another ; it may, however, be added that the
work of 1879, now under discussion, is more extensive and systematic
than that of the preceding series.
   2. The two actinometers used are of the kind invented by the Rev.
G. C. Hodgkinson, and described by him in the
                                                      " Proceedings of the
Royal Society," vol. 15, p. 321. The instruments are the property of
the Royal Society.      To distinguish the instruments from each other, I
marked one with the letter A and the other with B, in 1869 ; both are
in exactly the same original good condition, including their glass caps,
and I may add in particular that the same glasses, and in the same
positions, were used in 1879 as in 1869.         Hence the constants deter
mined and employed in 1 869 were also employed on the present occa
sion ; these constants are as follows : —
      Factor No.   1 for actinometer A, to convert results with
        ijlass on into results glass off                          1 *09

 1869 ; it will be seen that only factors Nos. 1 and 3 enter into this
 conversion.     The results of Table IX need no such conversion, as for
 the purpose in view they are compared for each instrument with its own
 mean.    The numbers hereafter discussed are all in terms of A glass off.
    3.  The  co-ordinates of the stations of observations are as follows : —

    The direct distance is thus about nine miles between the stations,
which are nearly on the same meridian and are mutually visible.                 The
 difference of longitude      between   the  two    stations  is  only 62"'5=4'2
 seconds, Mussooree being east of Dehra.
    4. Dehra station is in the Dehra Dun, which is a valley some ten
 miles wide and about forty miles long, and is bounded on the north by
the Himalayas and on the south by the Siwalik range of hills ; at its
eastern and western extremities there flow respectively the well known
rivers Ganges and Jumna.            The large native town and the civil and
military    stations  of  Dehra    lie west and north of the actinometer
station within a distance of some two miles, so that the observer at
Dehra was unavoidably subject to the disadvantages of the usual smoke
and haze envelope which is commonly visible in the winter months
over all large towns when seen from a distance, and especially if viewed
from a height ; on the other hand, the observer at Dehra was not liable
to the disadvantages of strong winds.
    5. Mussooree is eminently suited for an actinometric station, espe
cially in the autumn.       It stands on almost the highest point of an east
and west ridge of hills, which falls precipitately 3,000 or 4,000 feet both
north and south, so that the observer is absolutely free from smoke and
dust, while the atmosphere in autumn is brilliantly clear.                  But the
station from its very prominence is liable to brisk breezes, which some
times blow in strong gusts and always from the south.                 From these,
however, the observer and instrument were protected by means of a
kanat (or canvas wall, some six feet high, of a tent), erected at a
distance of a few feet, a protection found to be absolutely necessary,
for the actinometer is certainly affected by a breeze, especially if blow
ing in gusts.
    [It will thus  be seen that while Mussooree is highly eligible,        a similar

    claim cannot be advanced           for Dehra. Farther, it may be objected
   that the distance     between     the two stations is not sufficiently great,
   being only some nine miles.            To this can be urged, that in view of the
   latitude and the sun's declination, the direct rays to the sun from the
   two stations, about noon, travelled nearly seven miles apart from one
   another through the envelope of the earth's atmosphere : whether this
   be sufficient or not, is perhaps not so readily apparent.                But as a
   matter of fact, the time at our disposal did not permit of our observing
  anywhere but at Mussooree and Dehra, so that the choice lay between
  accepting Dehra or dispensing with a second station. Notwithstanding
  the drawbacks to Dehra individually, its results appear less liable to
  distrust if in accord than if in conflict with those at Mussooree : for
  the latter case visible causes are not wanting, but the former is difficult
  to account for without assuming special conditions. To this may be
  added, that distinct mutual visibility between the stations, and the
  ability at Mussooree to look nearly a mile above Dehra, are not without
  advantages.]
      6. The observations       with B at Dehra were taken by Mr. W. H.

  a differential instrument, it appears desirable to regard the causes, to
  which the measured changes are due, under separate heads, which may
  be briefly and generally indicated by
                                 Instrumental,
                                 Local, and

                      " heads "
    [These three                   may be more definitely expressed symboli
 cally. If V stands for the measured value of change in solar radiation,
 suppose
                              V=S + (L + !) + (I+0
 where S stands for that part of V due to true or unmodified                  solar
 energy, a quantity which appears unattainable by itself, at                   least
 for the present:       (L + Z) and    (I + i) are errors by which S may be
 vitiated, so as to become V.         Of these errors, let (I+t) stand for the
 portion due to the instrument and its manipulation, such that               I   can
 practically be controlled and         eliminated,    while t may imperceptibly
 exist in combination       with S: also let (L-H) denote all the errors
appertaining to the locality, i.e., between the sun and the instrument,
 during the minute of observation, such that L, arising from visible or
otherwise detectable causes, can be excluded, while I, being invisible
and beyond endeavours to evade, may also imperceptibly exist in com
bination with S. Then I and L stand respectively for the errors above
indicated by " Instrumental
                                    " and "Local." Now, if
                                                               by skill, care, and
vigilance, we succeed in making L=0 and 1=0, and obviously acti
nometrical observations are worthless unless there be reasonable pros
pect of securing these conditions, then there remains, as the residual of
V, the quantity
                                    Vjsscs+i+o,
but since by definition I and i are not visible, nor yet detectable, their
presence or absence, in a given result, if generally suspected, can
neither be positively affirmed nor denied , appreciably speaking, nor
yet estimated.       For their presence I use, as already said, the designa
tion  Vj   (i.e., the residual of V) ; in their absence, when 1=0 and i=0,
the designation "intrinsic" seems suitable, for now V, becomes =S.
Hence arose the double designation, adopted above, of " intrinsic or
residual," whereby provision is made for either assumption, without an

attempt     to assert  which prevails : so that, in the sense here employed,
residual and intrinsic        (or other equivalent phrase) are convertible
terms, as is intended throughout this paper.           This admission need not, I
think, be received as a deterrent to the use of the actinometer under
proper conditions, for when we know more of Vl the road to S may
become easier.        Meanwhile, as a matter of fact, the actual radiation
by which we are normally affected, at least in sunny lands, is repre
 sented, perhaps, more nearly by Vx than by S.
     It may also be stated here, once for all, that the conclusions
advanced in this paper, like most others of their kind, are not in
tended to cover more ground than the observations themselves;                     the
former go, of course, no further than the latter.]
     Of these the residual effect alone presents the real object of measure
ment. Complete elimination of instrumental defects, with retention of
excessive sensitiveness, is still a desideratum, and local causes may not
only produce overwhelming effects,* but they are so completely beyond
estimation or control, that the only remaining alternative is never to
observe when they are visible or likely to be present, at any rate if
small quantities are the objects of search.            As, however, the necessity
for placing the actinometer, so far as practicable, beyond local influences,
is now so fully recognised, I need only here dwell on one of the further
conditions necessary to be secured. This suggests itself if only on the
score of fallibility and the necessity to collect in general abundant
evidence.       On these grounds alone a series of observations should be
prolonged as much       as practicable,    so as to yield numerous         instead of
only a few results.        Here, however, apart from instrumental inade
quacy, we are met under even the most favourable local conditions, by
the varying absorptions of our own atmosphere at different zenith
distances, and it thus becomes a matter of primary importance to
establish a time-range, during which inconstancy of radiation from
this cause may be reckoned as certainly absent, at least so far as the
sensitiveness of the instrument can detect, f In fact, while the obser
vations at varying zenith distances may eventually yield valuable
results for reduction to the local zenith, it appears wiser in the first
instance to set aside every complicating cause that can be avoided and
to establish a daily time-range of the kind indicated.
    *  In course of the present observations    I have arrived at the conclusion that
(lie presence of strati, even if distant from the sun, sensibly affect the radiation,
while cumuli are comparatively innocuous.
    t The capability to measure minute changes, besides the power it confers, governs
the duration of a single exposure, which in turn is the less likely to afford means of
detecting short solar periodicities, the more numerous the latter are within the
duration. No doubt a contrivance foryiclding a continuous curve would leave nothing
further to be desired in respect of periodicities, but I am not aware that this has as
vet been achieved, without sacrifice of the essential sensitiveness, accuracy, and
durability.

       8. Accordingly, during the present series, this time-range was made
    one of the objects of inquiry ; it would most probably be found to
    occupy an equal hour angle, + and — from the meridian, a point,
   however, which was itself included in the investigation, by providing
   that the observations       should be made continuous for each day.
   Eventually, the hour angles adopted were 30m E., and 30m W.,
   whereby 21 observations in © and 20 in X would be obtained, yield
   ing ten results before, and as many after apparent noon, by the tabula
  tion of Article 6 ; always provided that the observer missed none of
   the numerous readings, a result which requires some practice to secure"
  in a series exacting continuous attention for so long a period as one hour.
  In addition to these daily time-range series, the observers were also to
  take a long range or hourly series (i.e., at every hour, from 8 a.m. to
  4 p.m.), on two days, each comprising six observations          in © and five
 in shade, so arranged that the middle result should occur at the hour.
 The whole of the simultaneous results thus obtained at Dehra and
 Mussooree are tabulated according to Article 6 in Table V, and may
 be briefly explained, thus : —
      9. Table V. — The times are the means of the times of x observa
 tions : they are given by preference in entire minutes, to avoid the
 needless statement of seconds ; but the exact second, or local apparent
 time, if required, can be readily found by applying to the chronometer
 time the error in seconds given for each day; thus, on October 31st,
 the chronometer was fast on apparent time by 5s ; this error will
 always be found to be under +30".            The angle between the two local
 meridians is 4*'2, Mussooree being east of Dehra. The results in sun,
 or © (heat gained), and those in shade, or x (heat lost), are the
 observed results reduced to 32° Fahrenheit;* from these, for both
A and B, there follows directly the radiation or © + x glass on, which,
in the case of A, was converted, by means of factor No. 1, Article 2,
into glass off ; in the case of B, the factors Nos. 3 and 1, were suc
cessively employed to express in terms of A respectively glass on and
glass off.     Thus the whole procedure in reduction was exactly the
same as that followed in 1869.             Further, the means of the results
before and after noon are given separately together with the estimate of
accuracy indicated by their " mean errors ;" these latter, it need
hardly be stated, cannot recognise errors of a constant nature.              The
table also includes a record of the barometer, and of the thermometers,
wet and dry in shade, and of black bulb in sun, together with an
exact statement as to the wind and aspect of sky.                    In all, the
observations at Mussooree include 392 in ©, and 361 in x ; those at
Dehra, 244 in © and 217 in x , unavoidably excluding at the latter
station several taken on the first four days, because they were beyond

   cally   simultaneous.    The   radiation results hereafter discussed, are
   those in terms of   A, glass off, the unit being a tenth of a millimetre, or
   about 0°-002 Fahrenheit.
       10. Table VI. — To test the constancy of radiation during the time-
   range of         hour adopted, we might compare the successive indi
   vidual results with one another in each half-hour, just as they stand
   in Table V ; this comparison, however, would be burdened by errors
   of single values, which may be reduced with advantage.                 To secure
   this end,  I subdivide each half hour into three similar sub-time-ranges,
   and within these limits    I take the mean of all the available results for
   each day to form a group mean ; hence, each daily series of group
   means will be six in number, provided the series was completely
   observed.     The sub-time-ranges adopted, are —

      Now,   each   group mean is the mean of three to five individual
  results ; the exact numbers of the latter will be found indicated bv
  subscripts.     Entering the group means in their proper columns, we
  obtain in the case of Mussooree, fourteen complete series (omitting the
  nineteenth, as it supplies only four of the six groups) ; and, taking the
  mean for each sub-time-range, we now find mean results from so many
  as from thirty-eight to sixty-one individual results.          These mean sub-
  time- range values may be considered practically      free  from   all variations,
  except those due to intrinsic or residual causes (Article 7) ; no doubt,
" daily instrumental constants are present, but as the latter will be
  eliminated in the proposed comparison, inter se, the results in question
  may be accepted as highly eligible, for the purpose of testing how
  far the radiation is constant within the +^ hour time-range.
      11. As regards Dehra, the group results, from accidental causes
  already explained, present but three complete series.               I pass on to
  notice the exhibits of Tables VII and        VIII  before entering on a brief
  discussion of all the facts.
      12. Table VII. — This table also is compiled          from Table V, and
  shows, daily, the sun's meridional     zenith distance,   and   the mean values

  with readings of barometer and thermometers, and declarations as to
  the wind and aspect of sky at noon.           Finally, individual and mean

which presents the mean facts of the hourly or long series, taken on
the 12th and 14th November, simultaneously, at both the stations of
observation.      Each series furnishes nine mean results, of which the
middle value is at noon.        By comparing the radiation at noon with
the hourly results for each day, we obtain the defect of radiation from
noon corresponding to the change in the sun's zenith distance.

from which      it appears : —
   (1.) The radiation is sensibly constant for each half-hour.
   (2.) The radiation, during the half-hour before noon, exceeds that
prevailing during the halt-hour after noon ; in the present instance,
the excess is only six-tenths of a millimetre, but notwithstanding the
sinallness of this quantity, it appears to be real, not accidental.
   (3.) Apart from constants, it may be inferred from the accordance
of the results that the instrument is susceptible of a high degree of
accuracy.
   Again, the above conclusion (2) is very decidedly confirmed by the
results for Mussooree, from Table VIII, where the sums of the defects
of radiation from the noon value            furnish large test-measures            of the
point in question,     and are as    follows : —

    15. The Dehra results in Table VI are not sufficiently numerous or
 symmetrical to test the conclusions (1) to (3) of Article 14 ; in fact,
 they present but three cmnplete 6eries of groups ; nor may incomplete
 series be admitted in this test, because of the undeniable presence of
 variable daily constants.         And with regard to Dehra evidence, in

 1(12                    Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey.                       [Dec.     16,
 Table   VIII, there are obvious inconsistencies   in these hourly results,
 such, however, as have been experienced on some other occasions
 with similar actinometers.      No doubt, in point of eligibility as a
 station, Mussooree is very far superior to Dehra, as already shown,
 so that email fluctuations may be expected to disappear at the latter,
 through the dissipation of energy exacted by its denser envelope ;
 but the sums of the defects present large measures of comparative
radiation before and after noon, and while Mussooree gives a decided
preponderance of radiation to the former period, this does not hold at
Dehra, as may be thus shown : —
                                                       Not. 12.         Not. 14.

    Mean (indicating excess of radiation before noon)       ....       6
    This discrepancy in evidence may, however, be fully accounted               for
by local haze, which is certainly absent at Mussooree, and as un
deniably is present at Dehra ; accepting this conclusion, the observa
tions show a fact not without interest, viz., that at the last-named
station the local haze absorbs more heat relatively in the forenoon
than in the afternoon, a conclusion which can be supported by other
exhibits from the same table.     And, as regards the inconsistencies in
question, whereby the radiation in some instances decreases with
decrease of zenith distance, these, also, may to some extent arise from
passing local causes, such as are inevitable in the neighbourhood of a
large town. But after all these points have been considered, there
still remains the fact that separate "casts-off
                                                   " of the instrument are
likely to be burdened each with a constant error, by which the whole
series may be affected.
    16. But though ineligible in the form of group means (as given in
Table VI) to test the conclusion (1) of Article 14, the evidence of the
Dehra results may be legitimately employed when presented in the
form given in Table VII, where the mean results are for + half-
hourly time-ranges.      Thus we find

where it will be remembered that M— D is independent of all varia
tions which affected the two stations equally at each epoch. The
 result shows no change of relative radiation in 1879 as compared with
 1809.
    18.  I next compare the radiation results at each station for the two
 epochs,   and  these, no doubt, are subject to all the indicated causes of
change, some of which can be recognised, and even roughly estimated.
 In  the first instance, however,        I accept   the results   as  exhibited, and
compare them thus : —

where the very close accordance of the two results suggests that they
represent intrinsic or residual causes solely.            The magnitude of Dj is,
however, liable to correction, from two causes,+ because its components
are not in the same terms ; both the causes, however, affect the two
stations equally.

   t A third cause (c) may also be noticed, Tie., that presented by    a change in the
earth's radius vector ; reckoning the effect of this inversely as the squares of the
radius, there results a percentage of only 0 4 of the unit of radiation adopted in
this paper, i.e., one-tenth of a millimetre: this result is quite rejeetaneous. It
would tend, however, to   increase  the magnitude of Dp

  hence, to make the results of 1869 strictly comparable with those of
  1879, the former (or Dj) must be increased for (a) and decreased for
  (b).    We might estimate these corrections empirically, proceeding on
  the basis afforded in Table    VIII  of the defect of radiation correspond
  ing to + 1 hour to + 2°'l of sun's zenith distance.                 It appears,
  however, sufficient to note that the effects of (a) and (i>) are of con
  trary signs, and that the excess of (b) may be set down roughly at
  about five units, whence Dj would be reduced to about twenty, of
  which the principal portion, if not the whole, may be ascribed to
  intrinsic or residual variation.       Hence, it may be asserted with
  confidence, on the evidence adduced, that the solar or residual radia
  tion in 1879 was less than in 1869 by so much as 2 per cent. If we
  imagine this result to hold good for the twelve months, some notion
  may be received of its consequences by conceiving that, in point
  of heat-rays at least, the sun was abolished one entire week in 1879.
     [To this may be added, that since the larger radiation of 1869 cor
  responds more nearly than the smaller radiation of 1879 to a period of
 maximum sun-spots, this result confirms, so far as the evidence goes,
  the hypothesis of greater solar energy at maximum than at minimum
  epochs.]
     19.  It will  be seen in the column of mean results for the day,
  Table    VII,  that considerable differences appear on a comparison
  inter se ; at the same time that the several individual results for the day
  (in Table V), of which the means are composed, exhibit comparative
  harmony. This leads to the conclusion that all the results for each
  day contain one or more constants ; but it is by no means a simple
  matter to show by experiment* how these constants may be sub
 divided between intrinsic or residual and instrumental causes ; as to
 local causes, they may be disregarded at least at Mussooree.                 That
 instrumental causes do exist I am strongly inclined to believe, though
 probably they eliminate one another in the mean from a large
 number of days ; but supposing them to be real, these causes are in all
 likelihood connected with the preliminary adjustment of the fluid, by
 which a sufficient quantity of the latter is " cast off " into the surplus
 bulb above, so as to make the head of the column play up and down
    * Some experiments   have been made, but they are not sufficiently numerous to
justify a conclusion.

within the range of the scale.      In  an instrument so essentially differ
ential as the actionometer, any adjustment involving a change of
circumstances cannot be too earnestly deprecated. On the other hand,
without excessive sensitiveness, the instrument can command only a
very limited range of utility.
    20. There remain to notice a few experiments made in view of very
short period fluctuations in the solar or residual radiation ;* these
are given in Table IX. On this occasion the two instruments were
set up at Dehra within three or four feet of one another ; both were
read by means of the same chronometer placed between them, and the
two observers capped and uncapped their tubes at the same times.
Thus, the readings were taken at the same instant, and under pre
cisely identical circumstances, the observations being continuous from
11 h. 39 m. to 0 h. 31 m. apparent time.         Taking for each instrument
the difference between each result and the mean of all, we obtain the
values in columns dA and dB. Now, the magnitudes of these changes
are undoubtedly in excess of fallibility in reading, for the eye can cer
tainly read to one- fourth of a scale division (or less), i.e., to ^ millim.,
or about 0°-005 P., so that apart from calibration errors, which are
not likely to be excessive, and which in the two instruments are
almost certain to be dissimilar, the inference is that these large differ
ences are at loast in part due to solar or residual causes.           This con
clusion is numerically tested in the last columns of the table, where I
have placed every pair of dA or dB, in which either member exceeds
ten in magnitude irrespective of size ; twelve such pairs occur, and it
may be worthy of notice that the two members of every pair without
exception are affected by the same sign ; so that so far as the evidence
goes, both instruments recorded a rise, or both recorded a fall.             To
present large argument of the fact, I take the sums, disregarding
          a
signs, of each column, from which it appears that A recorded 151 units
of change, and that B recorded no less than 138 units, and in the same
directions.    The result, so far as it goes, confirms the conjecture that
 the solar or residual radiation is remittent, and in very short periods
 of unknown duration.
    [I cannot too earnestly express my hopes, that actinometrical observa
 tions will soon be begun on at least two of the several elevated and
 eminently eligible sites which India offers. A series conducted sys
 tematically and skilfully for even one twelvemonth could not fail to
throw much light on a subject which, in its eventualities, concerns
 every individual on this globe far more than is perhaps commonly
 contemplated.     As to the more immediate questions of periodicity, &c,
 these  cannot  be  more than approached by means of desultory observa
tions, such as those here presented, undertaken under the pressure of

my acknowledgements are due to Major-General J. T. Walker, C.B.,
B.E., F.R.S., Surveyor- General of India, whose appreciation of
scientific inquiry is well known.
   22. In concluding my remarks on the Mussooree-Dehra observations,
I gladly avail myself of the opportunity to heartily thank my friend
Mr. W. H. Cole, M.A., whose skill as a trained observer, and whose
co-operation in general have enabled him to render valuable aid.
                Observations by Captain    J. P. Basevi, B.E.
   23.  It only remains to offer  a few   words on the results, exhibited in
Table X, of actinometrical observations made by my friend the late
Captain J. P. Basevi, R.E., of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of
India.
   24. When     this officer, in course, of the pendulum observations,
was about to resume his travels in 1871, it occurred to us that he
might utilise some rare opportunities for actinometrical observations
which would present themselves at points of considerable height above
sea level that he would certainly need to pass over.         With his usual
love for scientific research, Basevi readily consented to use the actino-
meter on suitable    occasions, and he was accordingly provided by me
with the instrument A of the Royal Society.        The intention to observe
at great heights was unhappily frustrated by his lamented death, or
there is no doubt he would have secured valuable results at very con
siderable altitudes, including the Takalung La, or pass, on which he
stood at 18,060     feet above sea level.      He, however, took some pre
liminary observations    at small heights, chiefly at Srinagar, the capital
of Kashmir.      Not being sufficiently numerous for a separate communi
cation, they   have  remained in my hands since 1871, when they were
taken, awaiting an opportunity, such as now presents itself, for placing
them on record.      This is done in Table X.

  II.  " On the Critical Point." By W. RAMSAY, Ph.D., Professor
         of Chemistry in University College, Bristol. Communicated
        by E. J. Mills, D.Sc, F.R.S., Young Professor of Technical
         Chemistry in Anderson's College, Glasgow.             Received
         November 8, 1880.
     The experiments to be described were undertaken with a view to
  determine the difference in behaviour of two pure compounds, and a
  mixture of the two, at high temperatures, and under great pressures.
     The two liquids selected were benzene, C6H6, and ether, C4H10O ;
  for both are remarkably stable bodies, and both can be obtained easily,
  and in a perfectly pure condition.    They are also without action on
  each other.
     The benzene was produced by the distillation of calcium benzoate
  with lime ; it was dried by cohobation with sodium for four days, and
  then distilled. It boiled at 81°'4 at a pressure of 750 millims.   The
  ether was also cohobated with sodium for four days, and boiled at
  34°-4.
     The pressure-apparatus resembled that used by Dr. Andrews in his
  experiments on the critical state of carbonic acid, somewhat modified
  to suit the altered conditions.   The gauge for measuring pressure was
  a carefully calibrated thermometer tube with round bore.     No correc
  tion of capacity was necessary to allow for a conical space at the end,
- as is usual with air manometers, for the sealing of the tube was
  accomplished by drawing up a plug of fusible metal, and allowing it
  to solidify.
     As the gauge lay horizontally, no correction was necessary for
  varying height of mercury. It was carefully filled with dry air, after
  its capacity had been ascertained by filling it with mercury, and sub
  sequently weighing the mercury.      The probable error of the volume
  of one division is 0-23 per cent., and the probable error of the total
  capacity 0"084 per cent. The measurements of pressure may therefore
  be regarded as a close approximation to absolute correctness, and as
  perfectly correct relatively to each other.
     The temperature was corrected for the mercury outside of the heat
  ing apparatus, and after the experiments were over, was compared
  with a good unused new thermometer.         The readings did not differ
  by  more   than 0"5 degree.
     The liquid to be examined was contained in a piece of very narrow
  barometer-tubing, graduated in millimetres, and was introduced at a
  temperature close to its boiling point, after a portion had been boiled
  off, so as to ensure absence of air. While entering the experimental
  tube the liquid never came in contact with air, and from the results
  of experiments it appears that none was present.
     Observations of the condition of the liquid experimented on, and

1880.]                   On  the  Critical Point.                    195
readings of its volume, were taken by means of a telescope placed
about one foot from the tube.     The readings to tenths of divisions are
computed by eye, and are only approximately correct.
   The tube containing liquid was heated in a copper block, in which
a slit was cut open at the upper surface of the block, to permit
observations  being taken.     The block was covered with a plate of
glass and heated.     It was found possible to keep the temperature
constant to within -njth of a degree for several hours by this
arrangement.
   Benzene was selected for the first set of experiments.    While tem
perature was kept constant, volume was altered, and the corresponding
pressure noted.    The volumes are given in divisions of the tube, for
the bore was almost    perfectly uniform, and the unavoidable error in
reading more    than  compensated any correction which might have
been made.
   The numbers refer to the curves on the accompanying woodcuts ;
the curves are isothermal. The pressure corresponding to each change
of volume forms the ordinate of the curve, and the volume itself the
abscissa.

     It may be remembered that Dr. Andrews, in his "Research on
 Carbonic Anhydride," never obtained the gas absolntely free from air,
 consequently, in diminishing the volume of his gas, in contact with its
 liquid, he always noticed that a slight increase of pressure was neces
sary.     If the curves   representing the behaviour of benzene under
similar circumstances be referred to, it will be noticed that the
pressure actually is reduced, in producing diminution of volume, in
Curves I, II, III, and IV. A relic of the same form of curve remains
in the behaviour of a mixture of ether and benzene, but no trace is
observable in the behaviour of ether.         The explanation appears to be
that the molecules, when the gas has been compressed to a certain
extent (very shortly before all gas is condensed to liquid), begin to
exert some attraction for each other, and consequently relieve the
pressure.     The explanation of the fact that this phenomenon is notice
able in the case of benzene, but not with ether, is perhaps connected
with their different behaviour at higher temperatures : the meniscus of
benzene is always easily distinguished, even up to its vanishing point ;
whereas that of ether soon becomes extremely mist-like and hazy.          I
have little- doubt that many other substances, when heated under
pressure in a condition absolutely free from the admixture of any other
gas, will show similar results.
    Probably, closely connected with this observation, is another: —
namely, that it is possible, after condensing all gas to liquid by pres
sure, to lower the pressure very considerably without ebullition of the
liquid, and consequently without formation of gas. At a temperature
of 228° for instance, it is possible gradually to reduce the pressure
from 29 to 22-4 atmospheres without any evolution of gas in the case
of benzene ; sudden ebullition then takes place, and the pressure rises
to 29'3 atmospheres, the volume at the same time suddenly increasing
to 65.     This behaviour is represented by a dotted line in the diagram
representing the isotherm for benzene.           The dotted line in the
second isotherm represents a similar phenomenon ; the pressure could
be reduced to 35-4 atmospheres before sudden ebullition took place.
At higher temperatures, a very slight reduction of pressure caused
ebullition, but the phenomenon could still be noticed, although no
attempt to measure it was made.         The same phenomena were noticed
with ether, and are also exhibited on the diagram.
    It is necessary, before discussing the results of these observations,
to give some tables, showing the relative proportions of gas to liquid
at the various temperatures       chosen ; always, of course such that it
was possible to distinguish the two states of matter easily from each
other.     I  have thonght it sufficient to reproduce merely those of
benzene and of its mixture with ether ; for the behaviour of ether does
not materially differ from that of the mixture.           The curves con
structed to exhibit these relations graphically have for their ordinate*

   The critical point. — The critical temperature of benzene lies about
291°-7.   At that temperature, no decided meniscus could be pro
duced by slowly altering the volume of the substance, but the tube
remained full of flickering stria?.       On increasing volume from 50
to 70, the flickering stria? disappeared, and the matter contained in
the tube appeared to be wholly converted into gas. On the other hand,
by diminishing the volume to 35 divisions, the flickering appearance
again vanished, for the whole of the contents of the tube were con
densed to liquid.    At higher temperature, no line of demarcation be
tween liquid and gas was observable.
   This observation, and similar ones made with ether and with a
mixture of benzene, contradict the statement made by me in a
note published in the " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 323, 1
stated there that the temperature at which the menisens disappears
depends on the relative volumes of the liquid and gas.        I have now
to acknowledge that the observations on which this statement were

•202                          Dr. W. Ramsay.                       [Dec.  16.
based, lead to an opposite conclusion when correctly explained.          The
heat in these experiments was imparted to the tubes through a large
block of copper, in grooves in which the tubes were placed.        I have no
doubt that the temperature of the copper block represented accurately
that of the tubes ; but not that of the liquid contained in the tu.be.
When the temperature of the tube is raised, however slowly, evapora
tion of the liquid in the tube ensues, and time is required for evapora
tion. During this time, the temperature of the copper block is rising ;
and with a tube insufficiently filled, it appears necessary to allow a
longer time for evaporation, than with one containing more liquid.
On reading temperature when the meniscus vanishes in the former
case, it will appear higher than in the latter.       The difference is ac
counted for by the fact that during evaporation, the temperature of the
copper block is continually increasing.       This would point to the con
clusion that a considerable amount of heat must be absorbed, even
under such circumstances, in order to convert liquid into gas, and
thus that the latent heat of vaporisation is still considerable, even at
temperatures so near the critical point.
   The critical change for benzene occurs at a temperature of 291°" 7,
and at a pressure of 60'3 to G0'5 atmospheres, and the isotherm at this
point is represented in Curve     VII   of Table A. Between the volumes
of 90 and 60 it is evident that gas is being compressed, for pressure
rises regularly.   But from 60 to 38 the rise of pressure required to
produce diminution of volume is smaller proportionately to the effect
produced, and after the volume 38 has been reached the pressure rises
much more rapidly.       And, on referring to Table D and to the accom
panying diagram,    it is also to be remarked that, when the volume is
60, or greater, the curve of equivolume represents the total evapora
tion of the substance.     With a volume of 50, that particular propor
tion of gas to liquid appears to be reached at which evaporation
almost exactly balances expansion, and neither total evaporation nor
total expansion takes place, but the ratio of gas to liquid appears to
remain unaltered. With volumes of 40 and 35 divisions of the tube
total expansion takes place, and the tube, above a certain temperature,
must become filled with liquid.       Above the temperatures represented
in Table D, it becomes impossible to distinguish liquid from gas, foi
the meniscus has disappeared.       But 1 can see no reason for assuming a
particular state of matter under such circumstances.         In the prelimi
nary note already referred to,      I  described an experiment, in which
liquid and gas were kept separate for some time by means of a capillary
tube, and in which even after the meniscus of the liquid had disappeared,
a solid, adhering to the wall of the tubes containing presumably only
gas, refused to dissolve.   This experiment has been frequently repeated,
with identical results ; it is, perhaps, most striking when the fluorescent
colouring matter, eosine, is used as the solid.       Eosine fluoresces only

when in solution    ;   when dry, it is a red powder ; and when alcohol
 containing eosine in solution is placed in one compartment of such a

 no fluorescence takes place till time has heen given for diffusion.         In
 fact, the rate of diffusion may be approximately measured by the
 increase in intensity of fluorescence in that half of the tube originally
containing the vapour of the solvent.
    Three facto appear, therefore, to be demonstrated : — First, that at
the temperature at which the meniscus of a liquid disappears, and at
temperatures above that point, but not far removed from                  an in  it,
crease of pressure       required to cause diminution of volume, com
                        is
parable with that necessary to compress a liquid at a temperature
somewhat below that at which its meniscus disappears             second, that
                                                                       ;
when a   mixture of liquid and gas        maintained at
                                               is            certain volume,
                                                                  a
the expansion of the liquid on raising the temperature, so long as                     it
is  possible to distinguish    liquid from, gas, points to the ultimate
occupying of the whole space by liquid at temperatures above which
the meniscus becomes invisible        and third, that under such circum
                                           ;
stances the liquid retains its solvent powers, while the gas         incapable
                                                                           is
of dissolving a solid. All these facts point to the conclusion, that at
or under such a volume the matter         really in the liquid state, whereas
                                               is
at a greater volume, the matter must be viewed as consisting at least
partially of gas.
   No direct experiments have been made with a view to ascertaining
whether heat  is  evolved when a gas      converted into liquid by pressure
                                               is
at such high temperatures.         hopeI to be able to execute some experi
ments which promiso some satisfactory answer to the question.
   It now remains to consider the condition of raising a mixtnre of two
liquids to such a temperature that the meniscus disappears.         Isotherms
for a mixture   of benzene  and   ether are given  on  Table     and  C,graphi
cally represented on the diagram.
  The first isotherm at the temperature 215°"6    at least 20 degrees
                                                             is
above the temperature at which the meniscus of pure ether disappears,
and yet the tension of ether vapour does not markedly appear.                          If
that curve be constrasted with Curve No. VI for ether alone at 207o-l,
some 8  degrees lower,     noticeable that diminution of volume in the
                             it   is
latter case is accompanied by a much greater rise of pressure than
in the former. The presence of benzene, therefore must exert some
marked influence on the pressure exercised by ether vapour, and
cause the mixture to behave to some extent as a single substance.    But
at higher temperatures the influence of the ether becomes more
marked, and at the temperature 240°'7 the critical point           nearly       is
reached.    The tube then appeared full of mist, till the volume 40 was
reached, when the mist disappeared, and the tube appeared full of
liquid. The pressure at which ether becomes critical      situated about
                                                                  is

mixture, 240o-7 ; benzene, 291°-7.            Both temperature and pressure
thus appear to take a position not far removed from the mean of the
two.
   The definition of the words liquid and gas appears to require more
accuracy than has hitherto been bestowed.            As no known aeriform body
absolutely obeys     the law    of  contraction   inversely as the pressure, and
equal expansion on equal rise of temperature, there is apparently no
instance of a perfect gas, although this state is closely approached by
such gases as hydrogen, oxygen, and carbonic oxide, especially at high
temperatures and not too great pressures.               And the definition of a
liquid appears    to  be a   fluid  exhibiting   surface  tension.   Now, above
the critical point, this surface tension disappears as has been repeatedly
shown.          I
          But venture to think that the possession of surface tension
is not a criterion of the existence of a liquid.           And a most striking
argument    in support    of   this  theory  has   lately been  furnished by M.
Cailletet (" Compt. Bend.," xc, 210). He found that carbonic anhydride
at a temperature of 5° "5, when the lower portion of his experimental
tube was filled with liquid, the upper portion being filled with a mixture
of gaseous carbonic anhydride with air, mixed with the air when a
pressure of 130 atmospheres was applied. The question is a simple
one ; does the gas become liquid, or the liquid become gas ? Or do they
both enter a state to be called neither liquid nor gas?
   I venture to bring forward a theory, with great diffidence, which
appears to be supported by numerous observations, viz., that there
exists a close analogy between the condition of liquid as compared
with its gas, and of a compound as compared with the elements of
which it is constituted, and that in the evaporation of a liquid we
have to do with a true instance of dissociation, that is, a decomposi
tion of complex molecules into simpler ones. Many compounds, when
 heated, dissociate into their elements, or into simpler compounds.
 The extent of dissociation is a direct function of the temperature, and
an inverse function of the pressure.         Thus, ammonium chloride, when
 heated, dissociates into ammonia and hydrogen chloride ; hydrogen
iodide into iodine and hydrogen. It is evidently possible so to regulate
 temperature and pressure as to obtain a mixture of hydrogen iodide
 with hydrogen and iodine in any desired proportion. If the analogy
holds, it is possible to obtain a mixture of liquid molecules with gas
 molecules in any desired proportion ; but as surface tension appears to
 be permanent until liquid and gas reach the same density, mixture
 does not occur before that point.         Still, mixture may be held to exist
 to some extent, for the vapour is not a perfect gas, and this is pro
 bably owing to its containing some liquid molecules among its gaseous
 ones.

                             On the   Critical Point.                 205
   The question is also closely connected with that of heat of vaporisa
  tion and heat of combination.    It is possible to exhibit this point
 more clearly by help of an example.      The heat of vaporisation of
 water, under a pressure of 760 millims. is 513 calories for 1 cub.
 centim. at 100°.     The expansion which the liquid undergoes in
 becoming gas is represented by the number 1623.        From the known
 equivalent of heat in work, it is easy to calculate the total work
 necessary to evaporate water ; and also the work required to expand
 the substance 1623 times against atmospheric      pressure.  The work
 done as heat, in the case of water is 221"1 kilogram-metres ; and as
 expansion, 16'6 kilogram- metres : hence 22V1 — 16'6 is work done in
 overcoming molecular resistance.     But this work is infinitely more
than is necessary to overcome surface tension, and the most probable
conjecture is,  Iventure to think, that the work is employed in dis
sociating the complex molecules of water into simpler molecules of
water-gas.
  Now, in    the foregoing paper, experiments       have been described
which show that when a liquid is heated in a certain confined spfice,
the results of observation, possible while the liquid is still distinguish
able  from its gas, lead to the conclusion that at a temperature at
which the meniscus of the liquid has disappeared, total expansion of
the liquid will take place, and that a certain larger volume, total
evaporation    will ensue.
   It may be objected that Kegnault's measurements of the heat of
 vaporisation of liquids at high pressures appear to show that it is a
 quantity diminishing with the temperature.        But it has never been
 shown to be the contrary in the case of heat evolved during chemical
 combination. Is it not likely that there will be a less evolution of
 heat during the combination of hydrogen and iodine at a high than at
a low temperature and pressure ?        And to return to M. Cailletet's
experiment,   is it likely  that compression, which, as a rule, has the
result of turning gas to liquid, should in this case change liquid to gas 9
   To sum up : the views expressed in this paper are: — (1) That a
gas may be defined as a body whose molecules arc composed of a
small number of atoms ; (2) a liquid may be regarded as formed of
aggregates of gaseous molecules, forming a more complex molecule ;
and (3) that above the critical point, the matter may consist wholly
of gas, if a sufficient volume be allowed ; wholly of liquid if that
volume be diminished sufficiently ; or of a mixture of both at inter
mediate volumes.     That mixture      is,
                                       physically speaking, homogeneous,
in the same sense as admixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases may be
termed homogeneous      ; but chemically heterogeneous, inasmuch as     it
consists of molecules of two different natures.          When prevented
from mixing by interposing        acapillary tube between the two, the
liquid and gas retain their several properties.

       B.A., M.D.     Communicated by Dr. MICHAEL FOSTER, Prae-
       lector of Physiology in Trinity College, Cambridge. Re
       ceived November 10, 1880.
    In  a former paper which I had the honour of laying before the
                   I
 Royal Society, endeavoured to describe the spectroscopic and some
of the chemical characters of febrile urobilin.
    In   the present paper  I have given the results of further spectro-
scopical research, which had for its object: — (1.) To determine the
differences which might exist between those urinary pigments which
are recognisable by means of the spectroscope, in health and disease.
(2.) The isolation of normal urinary pigment, giving the band at F.
 (3.) To attempt to trace back to their source all these pigments.
(4.) To examine bile more carefully for the presence of urobilin.
 (5.) To find an explanation of the absorption-bands noticed in the bile
of certain animals.
   In this paper I shall trive principally the spectroscopic appearances
of these pigments, reserving for a futnre communication a full de
scription of their chemical characters.    Speculation will be avoided as
much as possible, and a plain statement of the facts which presented
themselves will be adhered to, which show that there is irresistible
evidence of the relationship between the colouring-matters of blood,
bile, and urine.
    It is probable that a knowledge of how the urinary pigments can
be prepared artificially will be of great use in enabling us to under
stand how they are produced in the body.        Thus the knowledge of
the fact that the spectrum of nrobilin varies according to the amount
and the kind of oxidation, or reduction, or both, to which it has been
subjected in the body, which I shall endeavour to show is the case, is
of great importance, especially as we can produce in the laboratory
pigments (from bile- and blood-colouring matter), by a greater or a
less amount of oxidation or reduction, or of both combined, which can
be made to resemble exactly pigments obtained from urine in health
and disease.
    The Spectrum of Normal Urine: Its Band due to the presence of a
Pigment indistinguishable from Choletelin. — In examining urine obtained
from individuals in a healthy condition, I always can see a band at F,
and when a layer sufficiently deep to show this band is treated with
caustic soda, caustic potash, or ammonia, the band can be no longer
seen.     On the subsequent addition of an acid, it is again brought into
view. Bat if the urine be obtained from a febrile case, or indeed,

  from a case where there may be but a slight departure from the
  normal condition, the band at F is replaced by a band nearer the red,
  when these reagents, caustic soda or caustic potash, are added ; but
  ammonia causes its disappearance.          The reason of this is, that in the
  latter case, febrile urobilin is present.
     When, therefore, the pigment which gives the band at F is isolated
  from healthy human urine, it should present the same spectroscopic
  characters as the urine containing it.             Such is the case : for when
  normal chrome-yellow coloured urine is precipitated with neutral and
  basic acetate of lead, the precipitate extracted with alcohol acidulated
 with sulphuric acid, the acidulated alcohol containing the pigment
 separated by filtration from the lead precipitate, the fluid diluted with
 water and shaken with chloroform in a separating funnel, the chloro
 form separated, and then distilled off, a residue is left, which is a
 brown-yellow, amorphous, nitrogenous pigment, soluble in alcohol,
¦ether, chloroform, and benzol,        also in acids, and which gives in its
 various solutions the same band that was seen in the urine, and
 altered in the same manner by reagents, as it was altered in that fluid.
 While febrile urobilin gives a sharp black band at F of intensity «,
 the band of normal urobilin is less marked at its edges, and is less
 shaded than the former.          Its alcoholic solution shows the band well,
 and when this is treated with caustic soda, caustic potash, or ammonia,
 it disappears.        Sometimes its disappearance may not be complete, and
 in that case, the pigment which I named urolutein in my former
paper may be present.             The pigment may sometimes appear more
 brown than brown-yellow in colour, and in that case it shows a
tendency to imitate febrile urobilin in its behaviour with the caustic
alkalies, for on their addition a feeble band may be noticed nearer
the red than the original band.          More especially is this likely to occur
if the acidulated alcohol contains too much acid, or if the fluid be left
too long in the separating funnel.*           As a general rule, the more the-
colour of the pigment approaches to brown, or brownish-red in colour,
the more does it resemble febrile urobilin in its characters.                     The
colour depends npon the amount of oxidation to which it has been
subjected in the body, as well as on its artificial preparation, as I shall
endeavour to show afterwards.
    The band of normal urobilin is shown in Chart I, sp. 2. As a
general rule, it extends, when examined in a suitable depth of alcohol,
from wave-length 507 to wave-length 482. While alcoholic solutions
of febrile urobilin are red in colour, and become yellow with caustic
alkalies, the alcoholic solution of this pigment becomes redder with
caustic soda.           This is well marked when the alcoholic solution is
treated with sodium amalgam, for after the introduction of this snb-

  stance,   the colour   of the fluid becomes orange-red, and general
  ¦absorption of  the  violet  end of the spectrum takes place.        This re
  action at once shows a likeness between this pigment and choletelin,
  but even a more striking likeness is exhibited by the action of chloride
  of zinc, for when the pigment in its alcoholic solution is treated with
  chloride of zinc, the colour of the fluid at once gets redder, and it then
  shows a narrow and sharp band nearer the red end of the spectrum.
  The edge of this band nearer the red is the more abruptly shaded,
 that next the violet shows a gradually decreasing shading.              Thus,

     If, now, caustic soda  be added    to the fluid treated by zinc chloride,
 the precipitate being dissolved in an excess of that reagent, the fluid
 becomes yellow, and the same band as that got by treating febrile
 urobilin is then seen, of intensity S. Now Heynsius and Campbell*
 found that choletelin acted in the same manner, for it could not be
 made to give this band S, until it had been first treated with zinc
¦chloride.
    The following differences collected together were found to exist
between normal and febrile urobilin : —
    (1.) The acidulated alcoholic extract of the lead precipitate is
lighter in colour than that of febrile urobilin.
    (2.) The chloroformic solntion is of a yellow colour, and when
poured on a Berlin dish it is seen to be slightly reddish where its
¦edge    touches the dish. The same solution of the febrile urobilin
is red.
    (3.) The absorption-band in the urine, in alcoholic solutions and in
chloroformic solutions, has less well-defined edges and is less shaded
than that of febrile urobilin.
    (4.) The band at F is made to disappear by means of caustic
alkalies, while it is replaced by another in the case of febrile urobilin.
    (5.) The pigment is yellow-brown, febrile urobilin being reddish-
brown.
    When sodium amalgam is put into an alcoholic solution, as previously
mentioned, the colour becomes orange, but by continuing the action
longer, then acidulating with hydrochloric acid and shaking with
                                                        I
chloroform, and evaporating off the chloroform, obtained a brownish
pigment, which, when dissolved in alcohol and treated with caustic
soda, gave a band on each side of D (Chart I, sp. 4).              Now, it is a
remarkable fact, that      I  subsequently observed the same bands on
                  • "Centralblatt f. d. Med. Wiss.," 1872, p. 696.

  treating febrile urobilin, obtained from a case of pleurisy, with caustic
  soda (Chart I, sp. 17), and       I think this points to the conclusion that
  normal urobilin has a tendency to pass, when reduced by sodium
  amalgam, into the condition of febrile urobilin.*                Moreover, these
  bands indicate the source of the pigment           in  the  economy, as similar
  bands are seen in the spectrum of a pigment obtained from gall-stones
  (Chart II, sp. 2), in that of the alcoholic extract of bile-colouring
  matter, and also in that observed when hamatoin was reduced by
  means of sodium amalgam in the neutral state at the ordinary tem
  perature, and the fluid examined at an early stage of the reaction.
    A faint band covering D may sometimes be seen in solutions of
                         I
  normal urobilin, but have not yet determined upon what conditions
 its presence may depend.         (See, however, Chart II, sp. 15.)           It can
 only  be  seen in deep layers   of  alcoholic solution.   The  amount   of  normal
 urobilin in urine is small, but what I have been able to obtain after
 about thirty experiments will suffice to establish its identity.
    This pigment has, up to the present time, been confounded with
 febrile urobilin, but it will be seen that it is quite a different body.
          I
 Before had succeeded in isolating it, I had concluded that it was
identical with febrile urobilin, and since this normal urobilin is iden
tical with choletelin, and since the latter pigment is produced by
oxidation from bilirubin,       I   had concluded that febrile urobilin was
produced by oxidation. It would appear that febrile urobilin, although
it may represent an intermediate stage of the oxidation of bilirubin, is
capable of being produced by reduction of choletelin, and therefore
of normal urobilin, and also of a similar body produced by the
oxidation of haematoin by peroxide of hydrogen. We may conclude
that febrile urobilin is the same body as that obtained by Maly,
and which he called hydrobilirubin, but that the present pigment is
an entirely different body, and is produced by oxidation.               But there
is another body present in urine which is capable of passing into the
condition of febrile urobilin when strong oxidising agents are made to
act on the urine, in fact, it may be accepted as an established truth,
that the chromogen of febrile urobilin exists in normal urine.             Disquef
believes that it is this body which furnishes urobilin when urine is
treated with acids, and that it is oxidised in the presence of chloro
form into that body.       Such may be true in some cases, but not in all,
as the following experiment will show.            When a stream of chlorine is
passed through perfectly normal nrine,           or  when this fluid is treated
with permanganate of potassium, bromine in aqueous solution, or
ozone, the colour soon changes to yellowish-red, and a black band is
seen at F.      When caustic soda is added after such treatment, this

  band is replaced by another nearer the red end of the spectrum, as in
  the case of febrile urobilin.         Now, from another part of the same
  urine, which has not been this treated, we can, by precipitation with
  lead acetate, and       subsequent treatment with acidulated alcohol and
  chloroform, obtain normal urobilin.           It therefore appears that it is not
  by the oxidation of the chromogen of febrile urobilin* that normal
  urobilin is obtained, but that this body (i.e., normal urobilin) is
  present in the urine as such, or part may be present as its own chro
  mogen.       That such is the case will appear to be likely, when I
  come to describe the artificial production of normal urobilin from

     Urohcematin.       A- Pigment excreted in the Urine of a cast of Subacute
 Rheumatism.       — The patient in whose urine this pigment occurred, was
 suffering from subacute rheumatism, and was taking 15 grs. of the
 salicylate of soda three times a-day.                This pigment is of great
 interest as it can be prepared with ease artificially from haematin ; and
 as  it appears      to be incapable of production from bilirubin,           I  have
 named it urohffimatin.           The urine was a dark reddish-yellow colour,
 but did not contain blood or bile pigments as proved by appropriate
 tests.     It gave   a black band 63 — 74, or wave-length 507 to 480 ; with
 caustic soda, this band was replaced by another of intensity /3 or 7,
 from wave-length 513 to 491.             No other bands were noticed         in the
 urine itself.
    1,000 cub. centims.         of the urine were taken and precipitated with
neutral and basic acetate of lead, and afterwards treated in the same
manner        as that already described,f for the isolation of normal
urobilin.       The chloroformic solution gave the remarkable spectrum
seen in Chart I, sp. 6, and was the colour of dark golden sherry. In a
thinner layer another band, a, made its appearance, reading wave-length
507 to 484.         (Cf. sp. 8.) When the chloroform was distilled off, the
residue was seen to be a dark-brown colour, and was soluble in alcohol,
giving a red solution, and sp. 7, Chart I, and sp. 8.
    Ammonia did not cause the disappearance of the band at F when
added to the alcoholic solution, but acted like caustic soda, namely, by
causing another band, nearer the red than was the original one at P,
to appear.
    Cattstic soda made the fluid orange in colour, and shifted some of
the bands very slightly, as shown in Chart I, sp. 9, but the replace
ment of that at F was well marked, sp. 10.
   *  It is this chromogen which becomes oxidised when urine begins to decompose,
so that    stale healthy urine may contain febrile urobilin as such, and give its
spectrum.
   t The acidulated alcohol extract gives almost the same spectrum as that got by
treating artificially prepared normal urobilin, reduced by means of sodium amalgam,
with sulphuric acid. (See sp. 5, Chart I, and cf. sp. 11, Chart I, and sp. 12,
Chart I, and Chart     III, sp. 17.)

   The pigment was slightly soluble in ether and in benzol, but insoluble
in bisulphide of carbon.
   Hydrochloric acid and water dissolved the pigment completely, and a
different spectrum was then seen (Chart I, sp. 11).
   Strong sulphuric acid dissolved the pigment, forming a red solution,
giving sp. 12, Chart I.
   Permanganate of potassium did not seem to affect the spectrum, but
peroxide of hydrogen seemed to remove the feeble bands, leaving a
shadow from wave-length 584 to 567 and a band, x, wave-length 507
to 482.
   Sulphurous acid made the alcoholic solution lighter in colour, and
gave in deep layer almost the same spectrum as with sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids ; and in a thinner layer, the band at F was the
same as before its addition.        Hyposulphite of sodium did not affect the
spectrum.
   When the alcoholic solution was treated with sodium amalgam* its
reddish-brown colour changed to pale yellow after fourteen hours'
action, and it then gave sp. 13, Chart I. When this yellow fluid was
cautiously neutralised, and then slightly acidified with hydrochloric
acid, it became redder in colour and then gave sp. 14, Chart 1, in a
suitable depth.
   When the fluid treated by sodium amalgam, and subsequently hydro
chloric acid, was treated by permanganate of potassium, the band at P
was made fainter, and did not appear to be replaced by another when
caustic soda was added.
   This pigment was darker brown than febrile urobilin, which has a
reddish-brown colour, and it was evidently nearer to acid hsematin than
the latter pigment. Its affinity to the latter pigment was shown by
the way in which its band at F was affected by caustic soda, but by
the way in which that band was affected by ammonia it was seen to be
different.
   By the action of zinc and sulphuric acid on acid hcematin,           I have
succeeded    in obtaining the same pigment (as will be described further
on), and the solutions of the artificially prepared pigment gave the
same spectra as those of this one, band for band, and the spectra of
its various solutions were altered in the same manner as those of the
present one by reagents.         It would therefore appear that the various
bands seen in solutions of urohsematin are all due to one pigment, and
not to the presence of impurities.
    Urobilin, from the Urine of a case of Pleurisy, probably due to Tuber
culosis. — There was but slight effusion into the pleural cavities ; the
temperature of the patient was 101° F. The urine was reddish-yellow
in colour, contained neither bile or blood, and gave a black band at F,
                Cf. the action of sodium amalgam on hrematoin, infra.

•which was replaced by another one less shaded              and nearer    the red
when caustic soda was added.
    360 cnb. centims. of the urine were precipitated with neutral and
basic acetate of lead and treated as before. The acidulated alcoholic
 extract of the lead precipitate gave in deep layers no bands in red or
-orange.      This alcoholic extract was red in colour. In shallow layers
a, black band was seen at F
                                    (Chart I, sp. 15 and sp. 16).
    The chloroformic solution was reddish-yellow and gave a black band
at F,* and a feeble shadow extending for about the breadth of the band
itself on its redward side. In deep layers no other bands could be
 seen.     The black band a read from wave-length 501 to 482. The
pigment left after the evaporation of the chloroform was reddish-
brown in colour, and behaved like febrile urobilin as to solubility.
    Alcohol dissolved it, giving a reddish-yellow solution, which with
•caustic soda became perhaps slightly redder, and it then gave in deep
layers sp. 17, Chart I, and in shallow sp. 18. These two bands at D
were seen when normal urobilin was treated with sodium amalgam, as
already referred to.         (Vide supra.)
    With chloride of zinc another band appeared nearer the red in the
position of that produced by caustic soda. This pigment did not give
the same characters as normal urobilin, nor yet did it give exactly those
of febrile urobilin. From the appearance of the bands near D with
caustic soda, and taking into consideration the fact that these bands were
noticed when normal urobilin was reduced with sodium amalgam,                    I
believe the conclusion follows that this pigment was less oxidised than
 normal urobilin and less reduced than febrile urobilin.
    I have selected this pigment to show that the statement made in my
former paper was correct, and that urobilin               f  appears capable of
•existing in different states of oxidation.         I have come to the conclu-
-sion that the greater the number of feeble absorption-bands noticed,
the less the oxidation to which the pigment has been subjected in the
body. As a type of a pigment which has been produced by reduction
 only,   I may refer to urohaimatin.
    Preliminary Experiments on the Oxidation of Bile Pigments. — In
attempting to trace back normal and febrile urobilin to their origin,
one naturally begins with bilirubin ; consequently my first experiments
were made on solutions of bilirubin, obtained by treating human bile
with alcohol to precipitate the mucus, and then, after filtration,
shaking with chloroform.            I was not aware that I was dealing with
solutions which might also have contained urobilin ; in fact, I had
come to the opposite conclusion, since such solutions failed to give a
band at F. But when one considers that, even in spite of the absence
   *  It  was noted that the shading on the redward side of the band at F was only
seen in chloroformic   solutions.
   f  This remark applies to pathological pigments more especially.

  214            Dr. C. A. MacMunn.       Researches   into  the    [Dec. ltir
 of that band, urobilin might be present — for its band is invisible in
 slightly alkaline or neutral solution, and even after shaking with
 chloroform it may still be invisible until after an acid has been added
 — the conclusion follows that what has been supposed to be due to the
 transformation of bilirubin into urobilin may, after all, be nothing
 more than the gradual appearance under oxidation of the band of a
 pigment already existing in the solution. The behaviour of even
 impure solutions such as these is, however, very instructive.          When
 a chloroformic solution is put into a stoppered bottle, so as to fill it
 about one-third, and the bottle is shaken from time to time, the fluid
 gradually gets light in colour. The general absorption of the violet
 end of the spectrum characteristic of bilirubin gradually gives way to
 an interesting special absorption, which is characterised by the appear
 ance of a band on each side of D, which is soon followed by the
 appearance of one at F.        Then the former bands fade gradually
 away, leaving the band at F. This change was found to have been com
 pleted at the end of three weeks, and the colour of the fluid was then a
 pale brownish-yellow with transmitted daylight.          The same series of
 changes in the spectrum accompanies the play of colour got by the
 action of nitric acid on bilirubin, and at the penultimate stage of the
 reaction, at the brown-yellow stage, we can isolate the pigment giving
 the band at F.     But if the reaction be allowed to go on further, the
 fluid becomes almost colourless, and no longer can the band at F be
 seen.    Isolated at the penultimate stage, the pigment is found to be
 choletelin, but it is evident that if the bilirubin thus treated contained
 urobilin, accurate inferences cannot be drawn from the characters of the
 pigment isolated, as it might be not only an oxidised pigment derived
from bilirubin, but also a decomposition product of urobilin.
    Preparation of Pure Bilirubin. — Accordingly, it became necessary to
 procure pure bilirubin, which was done according to the directions
 given in the excellent
                        " Handbook for the                                "
                                              Physiological Laboratory of
 Professor Burdon-Sanderson. Brown human gall-stones were powdered,
extracted with ether, the residue boiled with water and treated with
diluted hydrochloric acid.      After washing and drying, the mass was
boiled with chloroform ; the chloroform distilled off over the water-
bath ; the residue treated with absolute alcohol.        It was then treated
with ether and alcohol repeatedly, and again dissolved in chloroform,
from which it was precipitated by absolute alcohol.              The pigment
thus obtained was an amorphous orange-coloured powder.
    It is not possible in the limits of this paper to describe all the
reactions and the spectra of the solutions obtained by this treatment
of the gall-stones, so that   I  shall only refer briefly to them as they
bear upon the subjects discussed here.          The first ether extraction of
the gall-stones gave two bands, which are evidently those of lutein —
7 from wave-length 482 to 469, and & from wave-length 459 to 442.

 The hot water extraction of a brownish colonr gave a band, c, from
 wave-length 507 to 486.   The acidulated water also gave a faint band
 in the same part of the spectrum.  The alcoholic extract gave a band
on each side of D, which latter wore evidently similar bands to those
noticed in solntions of the urobilin of pleurisy treated by caustic soda,
or in solutions of normal urobilin treated by sodium amalgam, and in
the intermediate stage of Gmelin's reaction, and in the alcoholic extract
of human and sheep-bile pigments, and which can be prepared arti
ficially by the action of sodium amalgam, in the cold, on solutions of
hffimatoin (when the pigment has been separated in the neutral state).
This alcoholic solution was of a red colonr with transmitted light in
 deep layers, while it was yellow in thin layers.  One band, 7, extended
 from wave-length 620 to 592, the other, B, from wave-length 585 to 569,
 sp. 2, Chart II.   With ammonia this fluid gave the spectrum seen in
 Chart  II, sp. 3.  The occurrence of these latter bands shows that the
gall-stones contained urobilin,* as similar bands are seen by similar
treatment of urobilin when it is obtained from bilirubin by sodium
amalgam, as will be referred to again.
   Action of Chlorine on Pure Bilirubin. — The colours and changes of
spectrum, similar to those which accompany Gmelin's reaction, can be
studied with great ease by passing chlorine, well diluted with oxygen
(such as may be obtained in traces when black oxide of manganese is
heated with chlorate of potassium), into a chloroformic solution of
pure bilirubin.' In such a solution this reagent brought about the
following changes in the colour and spectrum.          The colour of the
original  solution being orange, it soon changed  to : —
   1. Greenish-yellow.
   2. Sap-green (band before D, 625 to 598 wave-length).
  3.    Dark sap-green.
  4. Green.

 strong sulphuric acid and, lastly, U -tubes containing chloride of

accompanied by the same changes in the spectrum already noticed.
    On the Reduction of the Pigment present in the last stage to the con
dition of Febrile Urobilin by means of Sodium Amalgam. — It is evident
that the changes which take place are similar to those which
are seen in Gmelin's reaction, that at the penultimate stage choletelin
is formed, and that even at the last stage this is also further oxidised,
as proved by the complete disappearance of the band at F.          If chole
telin be a fully oxidised bile pigment and febrile urobilin a less oxidised
bile pigment we should be able to reduce choletelin back to febrile
urobilin by the action of reducing agents. Accordingly,        I proceeded
to isolate the pigment of the yellow stage, having first filtered the
chloroformic solution. It was then evaporated on the water-bath.
The residue was a light yellowish-brown pigment, perfectly soluble in
alcohol with a yellow colour.      I  could not see a band at F, for the
pigment     had   been  oxidised beyond the stage at which it gives this
band.     When a piece of sodium amalgam was introduced into the
alcoholic solution the latter immediately became of a reddish colour.
After it had acted for a short time the fluid was found to have the
power of absorbing the violet end of the spectrum.     "When hydrochloric
acid was added to the solution before the action of sodium amalgam no
change took place, but when it was added to the red fluid after the
action of the amalgam, it gave a black band, a, wave-length 506 to 481,
sp. 11, Chart II.     And when caustic soda was added until an alkaline
reaction was developed a band, 8, appeared from wave-length 513 to
wave-length 488.
    After the action of the amalgam had gone on for twenty-four
 hours the colour of the fluid was light yellow, and hydrochloric acid
then produced a reddish fluid giving a band of intensity, a, from
wave-length 502 to wave-length 478.
    But this pigment had gone just beyond the stage of choletelin, so
 that it became necessary to prepare that pigment.       I thought that by
 preparing   it by  another  method  I should have  additional  evidence of
 the truth of the idea that it can be made to yield febrile urobilin by
 reduction, if the result should turn out favourably.
    Preparation of Choletelin from pure Bilirubin and its Conversion into
  Febrile Urobilin. — Some pure bilirubin, prepared as before, which
 gave only general absorption in the deepest and thinnest layers when
 dissolved in chloroform, was treated with a little caustic soda in a
 chloroformic solution and exposed to the air in an evaporating dish.
  After the lapse of twenty-four hours the residue was found to be sap

green in colour, and it was then dissolved in alcohol. The solution was
then filtered so as to catch any unchanged bilirubin.   The filtrate was
then seen to be a brilliant sap-green colour and gave only general
absorption of the spectrum.     It was now treated with strong nitric
acid, and examined with the spectroscope.  When the bands on each
side of D had completely disappeared, leaving one at F of intensity p
or 7 from wave-length 507 to 482, the solution was shaken with chloro
form in a separating funnel, and the reddish-yellow chloroform layer
was separated off, and filtered. After evaporation of the chloroform, a
brownish-yellow, or yellowish-brown amorphous pigment was left,
soluble in the same solvents as normal urobilin.    This pigment, when
dissolved in alcohol, gave a yellow solution, and when looked at in a
white dish, it had a slightly reddish tinge at the edge, where it
touched the white surface of the dish, this being better marked in a
chloroformic solution. The alcoholic solution gave a band of intensity
 /3,from wave-length 510 to 482, having ill-defined edges.        When
the fluid was treated with caustic soda,   became of an orange colour,
                                             it
and then general absorption of the violet end of the spectrum was
noticed.   In a moderately deep layer, the dark shading commenced at
wave-length 510. No band could be seen in a thinner layer.        When
caustic soda was added after the addition of zinc chloride, the reddish
colour produced by the zinc chloride became yellow, and       then per
                                                                     I
ceived a feeble band from wave-length 516 to 488, but       was difficult
                                                                    it
to take the reading of this band.   Sodium amalgam produced exactly
the same effect that it  produced with the pigment got by the action
of chlorine, and the description given before will apply word for word
to the present pigment.
   Actionof   Ozone on Pure Bilirubin. —Fearing that nitric acid might
not have produced the pigment by oxidation,       planned an experiment
                                                  I
by which ozone was made to act on bilirubin dissolved in chloroform.
A Siemens induction tube* was made by taking two test-tubes,
one larger than the other the inner surface of the small tube was
                              ;
coated with tin- foil, and the outer surface of the larger one.    They
were kept from touching each other by four small points of sealing-wax
when one was placed within the other.        All the space between the
tubes was closed, except a hole at either end of the larger tube, into
which a small glass tube was fastened.     So that    had two concentric
                                                        I

side, with tin-foil, and containing a space between them through which
¦oxygen could be passed.     The coatings were respectively connected
with the terminals of     a Ruhmkorff's induction coil, worked by               a
quart bichromate cell. When oxygen was then passed into one end of
the space between the tubes,       came out ozonised through the small

   delivery tube at the other end. The latter was allowed to dip almost
  to the bottom of a test-tube containing a chloroformic solution of pure
  bilirubin.   The oxygen was purified by being passed through strong
  sulphuric acid before entering the induction tube.             After the ozone
  had been passed into the solution for fifteen minutes, it got slightly
  redder in colour, and it then gave a band covering D ; no other band
  in shallow layer.     The general absorption of the violet disappeared
  gradually, and a band & became detached at F, the colour of the
 solution becoming lighter at the same time. After longer action, the
 colour became still lighter, and the band still remained.           As no other
 change took place, the action of the ozone was discontinued.                  The
 band at F 5 read from wave-length 513 to 482, and when hydro
 chloric acid was added, it got darker, and gave the same reading, the
 colour of the fluid becoming red. But when caustic soda was added,
 the band read 507 to 480, and did not disappear.                   The pigment
 formed was therefore not choletelin, for its band should have dis
 appeared with caustic soda, and if it had been febrile urobilin, it
 should have been displaced towards the red, instead of which it came
nearer the violet.      But although the pigment produced by the action
of ozone on bilirubin was neither (apparently) choletelin nor febrile
urobilin, yet its action was somewhat similar to other oxidising
agents, in causing disappearance of the general absorption and the
formation of a pigment giving a band at F.
    Action of other Oxidising Agents on Bilirubin, fyc. — The action of per
manganate of potassium and peroxide of hydrogen on bilirubin is not
easily studied, from the difficulty experienced in getting them to act
¦on bilirubin ; for in chloroformic solution they will not do so, and when
made to act on solid bilirubin, their action is confined to the surface,
bnt on the whole, their tendency is to convert this pigment into
choletelin.    Peroxide of hydrogen, when added to bilirubin under
going oxidation, seems to advance the oxidation a stage, and then
stops short.     Although it acts with difficulty on bilirubin, there are
other biliary pigments, such as those got in the alcoholic extract of
human bile pigments, with which peroxide of hydrogen gives a play of
colours, accompanied by the same alteration of spectrum which accom
panies Gmelin's reaction ; but this will be referred to again.
    Action of Sodium Amalgam on Pure Bilirubin* — Bilirubin was sus
pended in water, and a piece of sodium amalgam introduced.               After a
few minutes a little of the fluid was taken and treated with hydro
chloric acid, which caused the formation of brownish flakes ; these
were soluble in alcohol, forming a yellow fluid giving only general
absorption.    At the end of an hour, the fluid was brownish in colour,
but lighter than it was at the end of half-an-hour.            After nine and a

substance were seen suspended in it. This yellow fluid gave a band,                 c",

layers a dark band, «, was seen at P.       (See Chart II, sp. 12 and 13.)

pigment is treated with caustic soda, and in gall-stones (as before

body more closely resembling febrile urobilin, which the fluid con
tained, an insoluble body was separated which appears to be identical
with that kind of urobilin which occurs in bile and in gall-stones.
     Action    Caustic Soda and Hydrochloric Acid on Bilirubin. — As there
              of
is   reason to believe that caustic soda alone changes bilirubin, and that
hydrochloric acid oxidises      it,  I  thought      would be interesting to
                                                      it
compare the action of these reagents with that of the sodium
amalgam.    And in order to compare the action of the caustic soda,
under the same circumstances as those which may he supposed                          to
occur when sodium amalgam             is used,  Iused a solid piece of pnre
caustic soda.    When a solid piece of caustic soda             isthrown into
water in   which    bilirubin   is  suspended,   the  fluid  becomes orange,
showing where          touches the dish a reddish tinge.
                      it                                            (After five
minutes' action  if  a little of  the fluid  be taken out   and  treated with
hydrochloric acid     itbecomes green in colour.)      At the end of twenty
minutes the fluid becomes green.           If another piece of solid caustic
soda be now put in and the fluid examined twenty-three hours after
the commencement of the experiment,             itfound to be a pale yellow-
                                                     is
green colour, showing only general absorption of the violet end
of the spectrum.       When hydrochloric acid            added
                                                           is     it turns red,
quickly changing to brown, and giving before the spectroscope            ablack
band, «, wave-length 507 to 482, and a feeble one, c, 625 to 598.
When this brown fluid      is treated with caustic soda a shading appears
over the violet end beginning at 516. It would therefore appear that
the action of the caustic soda and subsequently hydrochloric acid            tois
oxidise the pigment just beyond the stage of febrile urobilin, and

that it is premature to assume that urobilin is formed from bilirubin
by reduction. It would further appear from this experiment, and
from a careful study of Gmelin's reaction, that febrile urobilin repre
sents an intermediate stage of oxidation of bile pigment.
     Identity of Choletelin and Normal Urobilin. — It will be seen on com
paring choletelin with normal urobilin that they cannot be dis
tinguished from each other, being similar in colour, solubility, in spec
trum, and in the changes which their respective spectra undergo with
reagents.        But while choletelin is easily reduced back to febrile
nrobilin, normal urobilin is not easily reduced, because the chemical
stability of the latter pigment is greater than that of the former.
      On the presence of a body having similar spectroscopic characters to
 tlwse of Febrile Urobilin in Bile. — When human bile is treated with
absolute alcohol to precipitate the mucus, &c, and shaken with chloro
 form, the latter takes up a good deal of colouring matter, but as a
 general rule, gives only general absorption of the spectrum.           From
             I
 this fact had come to the conclusion that the solution could not have
 contained urobilin, forgetting that the band of that pigment may be
 invisible when the pigment has been removed from a neutral or
 slightly alkaline fluid. The following experiments conclusively prove
 that a body is present in bile which gives the same spectroscopic
characters as the body produced by the action of sodium amalgam on
 bilirubin ; and its presence can be proved, not only in the bile of man,
 but in that of the pig, ox, sheep, and probably in that of all animals
 possessing a gall-bladder.
      Urobilin in Human Bile. — Here    I shall principally refer to urobilin,
 leaving an account of the discovery of hismatin in bile, until after the
 production of the urinary pigments from hoematin has been dis
 cussed.       I  have  repeated the  following experiments several times,
 bnt select one experiment as an illustration of the method adopted for
 the demonstration of the presence of urobilin.            The bile was pro
 cured from a case twelve hours after death ; the gall-ducts and liver
 of the subject were free from disease. The bile was treated with
  absolute alcohol, filtered and shaken with chloroform, the latter
 separated off after having been allowed to stand some time, and
  filtered. This solution was orange in colour and gave no band at F.
  A feeble band could be seen in deep layers covering D, the violet end
 of the spectrum being shaded by the general absorption characteristic
 of bilirubin. The chloroform was distilled off over the water-bath,
  leaving a gamboge-yellow residue, which was extracted with alcohol,
  ¦which was then filtered, leaving a green-yellow     stain on the filtering
  paper. The residue left after the extraction by the alcohol was an
 orange powder consisting of almost pure bilirubin.
      The alcoholic solution was dark red when examined by transmitted
 gaslight, and a duller red with transmitted daylight, and with the

latter it was seen to be yellow with a greenish tinge in very thin
strata. In deep layers it gave a band covering D, bnt in shallow
layers one at F. (Chart II, sp. 15.) Treated with canstic soda it
gave sp. 14,* Chart II, the colour of the fluid becoming light green-
yellow. This is the same spectrum as that got by the action of
caustic soda on bilirubin treated by sodium amalgam.                 It will be
noticed that the band at F becomes replaced under the action of
caustic soda, by another of less intensity of shading and nearer the
red end of the spectrum.
    Zinc chloride produced a precipitate soluble in alcohol forming a
green solution, and then the band at F was seen to be narrowed, and
 nearer the red ; it produced a spectrum in other particulars like that
got by the action of caustic soda. Chart II, sp. 16.
    Hydrochloric acid produced a turbidity, changing the fluid to dark
red, which became clear brown-red with more alcohol ; this solution
gave sp. 17 in deep layer, while in shallower layer sp. 18 appeared.
    Sulphuric acid produced a dark-red fluid, giving almost the same
spectrum.
    From these observations      it was quite evident that the same kind of
urobilin was present      as that got by the action of sodinm amalgam on
bilirubin.
    Urobilin was absent from the bile in         a case of thrombosis of the
portal vein, and this observation       supports the view that    it is formed
in the intestine.
    Urobilin in the Bile of the Pig. — This bile was golden-yellow, and was
treated as in the case of human bile.           The chloroformic solution was
yellow,   and  left a  chrome-yellow   residue,  which was entirely soluble in
rectified spirit, forming a yellow solution. This gave, in deep layers,
general absorption, and in thin strata a band from wave-length 507 to-
482.
    Zinc chloride produced a precipitate soluble in alcohol, and an
abrupt shading commencing at wave-length 510. But in a thinner
layer a band was seen detached in the usual position, but owing to the
general absorption its violet edge was indistinct.        When the alcoholic-
solution was treated with acetic acid a band, a, from wave-length 507
to 478 was visible, the colonr of the solution being greenish-yellow.
    The alcoholic solution treated with caustic soda got pale yellow, and
gave the usual band from wave-length 512 to 488.
    This observation afforded positive proof of the presence of urobilin
in the bile of the pig.
    Urobilin in Ox-bile. — This bile was brown in deep, but yellow in
shallow strata.      It gave sp. 2, Chart III, which is of great interest, as
a similar spectrum can be produced artificially from hamialin, to which I

explanation of Chart II).

shall again refer. Every possible precaution was taken to exclude the
presence of blood.           When treated as in former cases, the chloroformic
solution was golden-yellow, and gave sp. 3, Chart III. When the
chloroform was evaporated, it left a yellow-brown amorphous residue,
which was partially soluble in alcohol, forming an orange solution.
This gave in a thin stratum sp. 4, Chart III. When this fluid was
treated with caustic soda it became light yellow-green, and then gave
sp. 5 in a thin layer.*
   Chloride of zinc made the alcoholic solution orange-red, giving in
deep layer sp. 6, and in shallow sp. 7. When this fluid, already
treated by zinc chloride, was treated with hydrochloric acid, sp. 8,
Chart III, was seen, the colour being light red.
   Ammonia acted in the same manner as caustic soda, except that
the band at F could no longer be seen.
   Urobilin was, therefore, present in this case.
   Urobilin in Sheep-bile. — Its presence can here be demonstrated in
the same manner, but as all the spectra are almost identical with those
of ox-bile, I will not describe them.
   The band at F is affected in all these solutions of human, pig, ox,
and sheep bile in exactly the same manner by reagents as in the case
of febrile urobilin, but, by the action of ammonia and caustic soda,
certain bands in red and orange appear, which, although they are
present in urobilin prepared by sodium amalgam from bilirubin, are
not always seen in the pigment got from urine. Again, it would
appear from numerous observations that, while the biliary pigment is
oxidised with comparative ease into choletelin, the urinary pigment
requires much stronger oxidising agents to bring about that result.
    On the Artificial Production of a Pigment exactly similar to Uro-
hcematin {excreted in the Urine of Rheumatism) from Acid Haemaiin. —
Hoppe-Seyler,f to whom physiological chemists owe so much, was
the first who tried the action of tin and hydrochloric acid on haematin.
 He got a pigment which showed such striking resemblance to Maly's
hydrobilirnbin that he came to the conclusion that the artificially
 prepared pigment was the same as Maly's pigment, but he noticed
 that the pigment prepared from haematin gave a band before D and
 one between D and E, as well as a. at F. By the action of zinc and
 sulphuric acid on acid haematin or bromatoiu, as it has been named by
 Professor Preyer,         I  have succeeded in obtaining a pigment which,
 when dissolved in various solvents, is found to be exactly similar to
 the pigment which I isolated from the urine of a case of rheumatism,
 and which     I  have taken the liberty of calling urohaematin.            It shows

a most remarkable series of bands, in addition to that at F.                 The
experiment has been repeated several times, with an uniform result.
   The fresh defibrinated blood of the sheep is treated with alcohol and
sulphuric acid (2 parts H3S04 to 35 alcohol) and filtered, more alcohol
being afterwards added (if necessary) to help the filtration. This dark-
red filtrate gives the spectrum of acid hsematin, which is seen in sp. 9,
Chart III, and which gives the bands of hsBmochromogen (reduced
huematin) with sulphide of ammonium.                It is put into a narrow
and deep beaker, some fragments of pare zinc and sulphuric acid
being added in sufficient quantity to develop a reaction, and a gentle
heat is applied to the water-bath over which the beaker is placed.
When the action has ceased the fluid is filtered, when it is seen to
have become of a much lighter colour.                (Sp. 10.*)      It is then
put into a separating funnel, diluted with water, and shaken with
chloroform. The chloroform takes up the pigment, forming a dark-
red solution ; on separating this off and filtering it, and then distilling
the chloroform, a dark-brown pigment is left.          It is soluble in alcohol,
with a rich colour, and this gives sp. 11, Chart III, in a moderately
shallow layer. (Compare 7 and 8, Chart I.)
   Ammonia slightly alters the position of the bands, when added to
the alcoholic solution, bringing some of them slightly nearer the red
end ; narrowing and bringing the band at F near the red, but not
causing it to disappear.        Caustic soda produces the same effect as am
monia, sp. 12, Chart       III  (colour of solution, orange). Zinc chloride
produces'    almost   the   same   change, sp. 13, Chart III.     (Cf. action on
urobilin.) The chloroformic solution of this pigment gives sp. 14,
Chart    III.
   On comparing these spectra with those of the urinary pigment,
urohaematin, it is seen that they are identical band for band, and the
description of the reactions with other reagents given by that pigment
will apply exactly to this one.
   On looking at Preyer'sf map of " iron-free heematin " a likeness to
the present pigment is noticed, but they are different' bodies, and the
action of sulphuric acid aided by heat had nothing to do with the
result ; for we can not only prove that a different pigment is produced
under those circumstances, but uroh»matin can be prepared in a
different manner, in which the influence of sulphuric acid aided by
heat is completely excluded.
   If the solution of haematoin be prepared as before, and it is then
shaken with chloroform and water in a separating funnel, the chloro
form will take up the hasmatoin, for which I find it is a perfect solvent,
and again leave it, after it has been distilled off, in a neutral state.

   If  this haematoin is then dissolved in alcohol and dilnted with
water, the solution put into a narrow and deep beaker (or better
in a flask), a piece of sodium amalgam added, and the whole gently
heated on the water-bath, a change will be found to have taken
place after some time.      The colour gets much lighter, becoming at
last yellow, and it then gives sp. 12, Chart               III
                                                     ; this is seen to be
the spectrum of urohaematin prepared by the former method and
treated in alcoholic solution with caustic soda.          The fluid may
then be filtered, the filtrate treated with sulphuric acid to acidity,
when its yellow colour changes to orange-red.     It is then (after acidi
fication) filtered, put into a separating funnel and shaken with
chloroform ; this chloroformic solution is reddish and gives sp. 14,
Chart III.* When the chloroform is distilled off a dark-brown pig
ment is left, which alcohol dissolves, forming a red fluid giving sp. 1 1,
Chart III. Treated with caustic soda it gets orange (i.e., less red)
and gives sp. 12, Chart III.      Ammonia produced the same effect,
and its behaviour with other reagents shows that this is the same
pigment as that obtained by the action of zinc and sulphuric acid on
haematoin.
  It    is,          certain that by the action of reducing agents on
              therefore,
haematoin      pigment can be prepared, identical with a pigment which
                a
can be obtained from urine in certain diseased conditions, and the
name urohaematin best expresses the origin of that pigment.

indistinguishable   from   Choletelin and  from Normal   Urobilin. — The
identity of choletelin and urobilin of health has already been proved
in this paper.      have now to describe a method by means of which
                    I
a pigment, which cannot be distinguished from either, can be procured
from acid haematin (haematoin).       So far as   know, this experiment
                                                      I
has never been described.
  A solution of acid       haematin having been prepared as before,                  it   is
treated with peroxide of hydrogen until         changes colour.

colour first seems to get slightly darker, but     soon changes to brown-
                                                      it
yellow and then a curious change
         ;                               isseen to have taken place in the
spectrum. All the bands of acid haematin have gone, and instead, a
band     or 7,
        p,       seen between green and blue (sp. 15. Chart III), wave
                    is
length 507 to 484.
   This change can be produced by treating the haematoin in the
original acid solution, or when separated in the neutral state by means
of chloroform, with the peroxide     but
                                     ;     ifthe latter method be adopted
we must slightly acidulate again before the pigment can be isolated.
The former method is, of course, the easier.           If this solution of
peroxidised  acid haematin  be put into  a  funnel   and shaken with chlo
roform, the latter becomes reddish-yellow, and when separated and

evaporated     off, it leaves 'a brown-yellow amorphous pigment.            It  is
soluble in the same solvents as choletelin and normal urobilin.              The
chloroformic solution appears yellow on a white dish, giving a reddish
tint where the fluid touches the white dish, and it gives a band, fi or 7,
from wave-length 510 to wave-length 484, with ill-defined edges.
    Alcohol* dissolved the pigment, forming a yellow solution giving a
band, 7, from wave-length 507 to 482.             When this yellow fluid was
treated with caustic soda it became orange, and gave, in deep layers,
general absorption of the violet up to wave-length 534.                In shallow
layers no band was visible.
    Zinc chloride caused th8 fluid to assume an orange colour, and then
the spectrum was shaded up to wave-length 538.                 In a thinner layer
a band became detached (though this was not easily seen) from about
wave-length 526 to 501 (?).
    When the fluid treated by zinc chloride was treated with caustic
soda, the orange-coloured fluid became yellow, and a feeble shadow
from wave-length 513 to 488 was just visible.
    Re-acidified after treatment with caustic soda a black band came
back in the original position.       The above characters are sufficient to
establish the identity of this pigment with normal urobilin and with
choletelin ; but its action with sodium amalgam completely proved
the truth of this supposition.
    Artificial Production of Febrile Urobilin from the Pigment produced by
 Ovulation of Ilmmatoin. — When this brown-yellow pigment is dis
solved in alcohol, it gives a yellow solution ; when it is diluted with
 water and sodium amalgam introduced the colour soon becomes orange.
 After longer action, especially when a gentle heat is applied, the fluid
 again becomes paler, until at last it assumes that of pale sherry.
 {See sp. 16, Chart III.)        When sulphuric acid is added to acidity,
 the fluid becomes orange-red, and then three bands are visible, one
 before D, one between D and E, and a black one at F, sp. 17. But
 if instead of using strong sulphuric acid, it is added in the pro
 portion of two parts acid to twelve alcohol, and the fluid is then
 shaken with chloroform, the latter takes up the pigment forming
 a red solution, which appears yellow in thin layers.            On evaporating
 the chloroform, a reddish-brown pigment is left. This dissolves in
 alcohol with a red colour, and gives in deep layers no bands near D,
  but in shallower ones a black band at F.           It will, therefore, be seen
  that strong sulphuric acid has the property of so changing the
  chromogen of the reduced pigment, as to produce two bands near D,
  as well as that at F.    I believe that this may account for the presence
 ¦of certain feeble   bands near D, seen in solutions of febrile urobilin.

giving the black band at F, caustic soda be added, it becomes yellow

deep layers      two   other  feeble   bands    are  seen   on  the    violet   side  of  D

chloride and allowed to stand a few minutes, a narrow band is seen,,
which is exactly the same band, as regards position and shading, as
that seen when solutions of febrile urobilin are treated with zinc
chloride.
   It would, therefore, appear that by the action of sodium amalgam
aided by heat, a colourless, or almost colourless, solution has beet
obtained, which under the influence of sulphuric acid becomes orange-
red, and gives all the characters of febrile urobilin.                      The original
body acted upon with the sodium amalgam                          being identical with

    On the Action of Decolorised Bile on Haemoglobin. — Seeing that the
urinary pigments, at least such as are recognisable by means of the
spectroscope, can be produced with great ease from heematin,                     I was led
to think that perhaps haamatin might be present in the bile, and as a
preliminary step to this inquiry              I tried the effect of the colourless
constituents of the bile on haemoglobin.                  Ox-bile was treated with
rectified spirit, filtered, then well shaken with animal charcoal in a flask,
and again filtered ; as this filtrate showed some general absorption
of the violet, it was again decolorised.             It was then evaporated almost
to dryness on the water-bath, and diluted with water ; the taste of the
solution was exceedingly bitter ; it was alkaline, and gave Pettenkofer's-
reaction and its spectrum.               To this fluid 3 cub. centims. of the
fresh defibrinated blood of a cat were added.                    The mixture was put
into a hot air-bath, and the bath heated to 110° F ; the mixture being
stirred with a glass rod from time to time.                   It soon got darker in
colour, and then gave the spectrum of methsemoglobin.                      The tempera
ture of the bath was then raised to 180°, and the fluid got still darker
in colour. After longer action it became a fine crimson, and then gave
a band covering D, and one at F, sp. 18, Chart III.                         After longer
action no further change took place. The same body can be produced
by the action of caustic soda in alcohol on haemoglobin.
    Action of Caustic Soda in Alcohol on Blood. — When fresh blood
 (defibrinated) is treated with alcohol and caustic soda, the colour
 changes to dark red.          If the blood so treated contain oxidised haemo
globin, we get a band at D, and a feebler one at F ; but if it contain
 reduced haemoglobin, and the reagent is added with exclusion of airr
 haemocbromogen is formed at the same time.                     The spectrum got by
 the action of the reagent on oxidised haemoglobin is evidently haematinr

as   it gives the bands of haemochromogen with sulphide of ammonia.                                   A
similar pigment may be obtained by isolating haematoin as described
before, and treating the residue with alcohol and caustic soda, when
the same spectrnm is seen ; but while the pigment obtained directly
from oxidised haemoglobin is easily reduced to haemochromogen, the
latter pigment is reduced with great difficulty.
   This alkaline haematin, whose spectrum is represented in Chart III,
sp. 19,* is easily converted into acid haematin again, and thus may be
the source of all those kinds of hsematin from which the biliary and
urinary pigments can be formed.
   Production of the Spectrum of SJieep-bile from this Pigment. — While
by the influence of oxidising agents such as peroxido of hydrogen and
permanganate of potassium, this body yields apparently the same pig
ment as haematoin yields, it gives with sodium amalgam in the 'cold,
and with brief action the spectrum of sheep or ox bile, sp. 20,f
Chart        III.
              It wants, however, one band in the red, but that also can
be made to appear by gentle oxidation with peroxide of hydrogen, and
this band in bile only appears after that fluid has been exposed to the
air for some time.    (Cf. Chart IV, sp. 2, and Chart III, sp. 2.)
   When this reduced brownish-red solution was treated with hydro
chloric acid, it gave a spectrum very like that got by treating the bile
pigments of the sheep with the same reagent ; but in order to compare  J
the action of reagents on the respective fluids, it will be necessary to
isolate the pigment giving this spectrum from sheep-bile, which has
not yet been done.      When the solution giving the above spectrum
is treated with sulphide of ammonium the bands of hffimochromogen
appeared.     Consequently, if sheep-bile contains this kind of haematin,
 it should also yield the bands of that substance with sulphide of
ammonium.

    Hmmatin in Human Bile. — The golden-yellow coloured bile obtained
twelve hours after death, from a case of meningitis, and which gave
only general absorption, even in thin strata, was treated with a little

  residue had a slightly green tinge, and after extraction with alcohol,
  the alcoholic solution was seen to be a brownish-green colour, and
  gave the spectrum already described (sp. 7). When this solution was
  treated with sulphide of ammonium, sp. 8, Chart IV, appeared after it
  had stood a short time (the original is seen in sp. 7), the colour of the
  fluid changing to red. Ammonia had nothing to do with this result.
  It therefore appears certain that human bile also contains hsematin, but
 in less quantity than the bile of the sheep.*
      If the curious series of bands seen in sheep-bile are due to the pre
 sence of haematin, it is probable that the bands seen in the red, orange,
 and green parts of the spectrum characteristic of the spectra of the bile
 of other animals, are also due to its presence.              In the bile of the crow
 these bands are     like  those    of  the   bile of the sheep and ox ; in that of
 the guinea-pig the single band may be due to the darker band of hserao-
 ¦chromogen ; those of the rabbit appear to be the bands of that sub
 stance, and    I have no doubt that the presence of hsematin in the bile
 of these animals'!- will be proved as easily as in the case of man and
 the sheep. Of course        I  do not include the band at F, as that is always
 due to the presence of urobilin.
     Action of Peroxide of Hydrogen on the Alcoholic Extract of Human
 Bile Pigments. — When the brown-green alcoholic extract of the chloro-
 formic residue of human bile pigment (see sp. 7, Chart IV), and which
 was proved to contain hffimatin, urobilin (of biliary origin), and other
 pigments, was treated by peroxide of hydrogen on a white dish, the
colour changed from brown-green to dark-green, blue-green, blue,
 violet, red, red-brown, and brown-yellow.                 At the violet stage three
 bands were visible, sp. 9, Chart IV ;J at the brown-yellow stage only
•one, that at F, sp. 10.        It was, therefore, evident that the mixture of
 pigments could be oxidised into choletelin with great ease.
     The Absorption Band of Serum. — The band at F in blood-serum
 has been Eaid to be due to lutein ;§ whether that substance is or is not
 present, there is evidence to show that an oxidised bile pigment is
 that which gives the band, and             I  have come to the conclusion, from a
 careful examination of fresh blood-serum, obtained by letting the
 blood of the sheep clot spontaneously, and filtering the yellow serum,
 that it contains either choletelin or a substance like it.                 The serum
 gave sp.   11,  Chart   IV,   which     shows    that  it  still contained  traces of
 hemoglobin. The band at F 7 read from wave-length 504 to 480,
 it was therefore nearer the red than the band of lutein, and                  I  could
    • As proved by the presence    of first band, of reduced hsematin, the second being
just visible and overlapped by general absorption.       (See 8, Chart IV.)

not, by any method, see the second band of lutein in violet.                More
over, caustic soda and ammonia which intensify the band of lutein,
caused this band, to     disappear; and when zinc chloride in very small
quantity was added after the caustic soda a precipitate fell, but when
this was separated from the fluid,          I thought   I could perceive a faint
band from wave-length 516 to 488.              If the white of egg is compared
with this,   as  I find that  it contains some of the lutein of the yelk,       we
see two bands      distinctly, and that nearer the red is decidedly darkened
by both caustic soda and by ammonia ; moreover the first lutein band
of the yelk in alcohol read from wave-length 496 to 478.                  (Lutein
itself, even if present, may also be formed in the liver, as I have found
it in gall-stones (vide antea), and a pigment giving its spectrum
appears to be formed by the long-continued action of caustic soda on
the alcoholic extract of the pigments of sheep bile, sp. 4.             Thus, the
first action was to give sp. 12, Chart IV, but after half-an-hour sp. 13
appeared, the other bands having faded away.)
    I therefore conclude that the absorption-band of serum is due to a
body which is produced by the oxidation of the bile pigments, and
which is on its way to be excreted by the kidneys.*
                            Summary and Conclusions.
     (1.) That normal human urine contains a body as such, which is
apparently identical with choletelin and with the body produced by
the action of peroxide of hydrogen on acid haematin.
    (2.) That normal human urine contains the chromogen of febrile
urobilin, which can be prepared artificially by reduction of choletelin,
and of the body produced by oxidation from haematoin.
     (3.) That human, ox, sheep, and pig bile contain a kind of urobilin,
which differs in some respects from that excreted in urine, and that
they also contain haematin.
     (4.) That it is highly probable that all the constituents of bile
colouring matter are produced from haematin by reduction.
     (5.) That the heematin present in bile is probably due to the action
of the bile acids on haemoglobin.
     (6.) That all the colouring matters of bile, including haematin,
urobilin of biliary origin, bilirubin, Ac., are oxidised into choletelin,
and that there is evidence to show that blood-serum contains this body,
which is on its way to be excreted by the kidneys.
     (7.) That the absorption- bands seen in the bile of various animals
are due to the presence of haematin and urobilin of biliary origin.
     (8.) That a pigment excreted in the urine in certain pathological
conditions is derived from haematin by reduction, as it can be obtained
by reducing acid haematin with zinc and sulphuric acid, and also by
    * Neubauer and Vogel (" Guide to Analysie of Urine," American    edition, 1879,
 p. 64) think this band is due to urobilin.

means of sodium amalgam ; that it is not febrile urobilin, and as it is
derived directly from hfflmatin it is best named urohaematin.
   (9.) That the urobilin of bile is produced in the intestine.
   (10.) That the urobilin of bile may, in certain states of the system,
appear in the urine, but that under normal conditions it is oxidised
into choletelin in common with the other biliary pigments, and comes
to the kidneys as choletelin, while a part may pass into the urine as
such, but a part becomes reduced in the kidneys into the chromogen of
febrile, and perhaps also into the chromogen of normal urobilin ; the
former by strong oxidising agents passing into febrile urobilin, and
the latter by the action of weaker oxidising agents into normal uro
bilin.
   (11.) That many of the colouring matters of urine have been pro
duced, by the action of the reagents designed to separate them, on
these chromogens.
   (12.) While most of the urinary pigments are traceable back to the
bile pigments,* there is evidence to show that some of them are derived
from haematin directly, and pigments derived from that source may
entirely replace the normal pigments.

   There appears to be one point of difference between normal urobilin

that while chloride of zinc produces a narrow band nearer the red

  The accompanying charts were mapped from                        the mierospectroscope provided with
an accurately divided photographed scale, and                     the scale at the top of each chart   is

each division of the scale in wave-lengths.                 I     have adopted this plan in order to

        vember 13, 1880.
    With the exception of a series of determinations made by the
 officers  of the " Challenger " at Ponta Delgada, St. Michael, in 1873,
 no  magnetic observations         have, so far as I can learn, been made in the
 Azores     since     the time   of Captain Vidal's hydrographic snrvey in
 1843-4.       A visit to these islands during the past summer has enabled
 me to offer the small contribution to their magnetic history which
forms the subject of the present communication.
    Magnetic observations are made with some difficulty in the Azores,
on account of the intensely volcanic character of the islands.                   Con
siderable care was however taken in selecting the stations, and there
is no reason to suppose that the observations are affected to any great
extent by the nature of the soil or rock immediately beneath the
instrument or in proximity to it. The places chosen were such as
will enable subsequent observers to repeat the determinations on the
same spots.
    The dip-circle employed was Dover 3, belonging to the Owens
College, Manchester :         I  had previously used this instrument in the
course of my magnetic observations along the fortieth parallel in
North America (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 132), and am again
indebted to Professor Balfour Stewart for the loan of it.                It was pro
vided with two needles, each 3£ inches long and 027 inch in maximum
breadth.       The same precautions were taken to preserve the needles
from     rust   as   are described    in the communication above referred to,
and    the, method        of observation   was identical     with that previously
adopted.       In all cases duplicate and independent             observations   were
made with the two needles.

  V.     "On Heat Conduction in Highly Rarefied Air."                By
      William Crookes, F.R.S. Received November 18, 1880.
    The transfer of heat across air of different densities has been
examined by various experimentalists, the general result being that
heat conduction is almost independent of pressnre.           Winkelmann
 (" Pogg. Ann.," 1875-76) measured the velocity of cooling of a
thermometer in a vessel filled with the gas to be examined.           The
difficulty of these experiments lies in the circumstance that the cooling
is caused not only by the conduction of the gas which surrounds the
cooling body, but that also the currents of the gas and, above all,
radiation play an important part.      Winkelmann eliminated the action
of currents by altering the pressure of the gas between 760 and
1 millim. (with decreasing pressure the action of gas currents becomes
less), and he obtained data for eliminating the action of radiation by
varying the dimensions of the outer vessel. He found that, whereas
a lowering of the pressure frem 760 to 91 "4 millims. there was a
change of only 1'4 per cent, in the value for the velocity of cooling,
on further diminution of the pressure to 4" 7 millims. there was a
further decrease of 11 per cent., and this decrease continued when the
pressure was further lowered to 1 -92 millim.
   About the same time Kundt and Warburg (" Pogg. Ann.," 1874, 5)
carried out similar experiments, increasing the exhaustion to much
higher points, but without giving measurements of the pressure below
1 millim.    They enclosed a thermometer in a glass bulb connected with
a mercury pump, and heated it to a higher temperature            than the
highest point at which observations were to be taken ; then left it to
itself, and noted the time it took to fall through a certain number of
degrees.    They found that between 10 millims. and 1 millim. the time
of cooling from 60° to 20° was independent of the pressure ; on the
contrary, at 150 millims. pressure the rate was one-and-a-half times as
great as at 750 millims.      Many precautions were taken to secure
accuracy, but no measurements of higher exhaustions being given the
results lack quantitative value.
   It appears, therefore, that a thermometer cools slower in a so-called
vacuum than in air of atmospheric pressure.       In dense air convection
cnrrents have a considerable share in the action, but the law of cool
ing in vacua so high that we may neglect convection, has not to my
knowledge been determined.         Some years ago Professor Stokes
suggested to me to examine this point, but finding that Kundt and
Warburg were working in the same direction it was not thought
worth going over the same ground, and the experiments were only

 240                             Mr. W. Crookes.                          [Dec. 16,
 tried up to    a certain  point, and then set aside. The data which these
 experiments would have given are now required for the discussion of
 some results on the viscosity of gases, which          I  hope to lay before the
 Society in the course of a few weeks ;             I  have therefore completed
 them so as to embody the results in the form of a short paper.
    An accurate thermometer with pretty open scale was enclosed in a
1^ inch glass globe, the bulb of the thermometer being in the centre,
and the stem being enclosed in the tube leading from the glass globe
to the pump.
    Experiments were tried       in two ways : —
    I. The glass globe (at        the various exhaustions) was immersed in
nearly boiling water, and        when the temperature was stationary it was
taken out, wiped dry, and        allowed to cool in the air, the number of
seconds occupied      for each sink of      5° being noted.
    II. The globe was first brought to a uniform temperature in a
vessel of water at 25°, and was then suddenly plunged into a large
vessel of water at 65°.          The bulk of hot water was such that the
temperature       remained   sensibly the same during the continuance of
each experiment.          The number of seconds required for the ther
mometer to rise from 25° to 50° was registered as in the first case.
    It was found that the second form of experiment gave the most
uniform results ; the method by cooling being less accurate, owing to
currents of air in the room, &c.
    The results are embodied in the following table : —

  I have     embodied these results         in the preceding diagram.         The ordi-
nates represent the   number of seconds occupied during                     the rise of
each 5°, starting from 25° ; the abscissas represent the pressure.  The
lower portion gives the total variation in time between pressures of
760 millims. and 1 millim.     The upper and larger portion of the dia
gram gives the abscissae in millionths of an atmosphere.    At the right
side of the diagram, in the space A B 0,                I
                                                 have drawn a series of
horizontal lines increasing in length from 0-25 millim. at 400 M., to
100 millims. at 1 M.    These show the actual lengths of the mean free
path of the molecules of air at the degrees of exhaustion to which they
are opposite.*   The parallelism between the curves formed by joining
the ends of these horizontal lines and the curves representing the rate
of cooling is sufficiently close to justify the inference that they are
associated phenomena.
  There are two waysin which heat can get from the glass globe to
the thermometer— (1) By radiation across the intervening space ;
(2) by communicating an increase of motion to the molecules of the
gas, which carry it to the thermometer.          It is quite conceivable that
a considerable part, especially in the case of heat of low refrangibility,
                        " carriage," as I will call it to distinguish it from
may be transferred by
convection which is different, and yet that we should not perceive
much diminution of transference, and consequently much diminution
of rate of rise with increased exhaustion, so long as we work with
ordinary exhaustions up to 1 millim. or so. For                if,
                                                             on the one hand,
there are fewer molecules impinging on the warm body (which                           is
adverse to the carriage of heat), yet on the other the mean length of
path between collisions      increased, so that the augmented motion
                              is                                                      is
carried further.    The number of steps by which the temperature
passes  from  the warmer   to the cooler body        diminished, and accord
                                                        is
ingly the value of each step         increased.
                                       is          Hence the increase in the
difference of velocity before and after impact may make up for the
diminution in the number of molecules impinging.            It therefore con
                                                                     is
ceivable that      it
                  may  not be  till such  high  exhaustions   are reached that
the mean length of path between collisions becomes comparable with
the diameter of the case, that further exhaustion produces          notable fall

in such vacua as exist in planetary space the loss of heat — which in
 that case would only take place by radiation — would be exceedingly slow.

       Received November 13, 1880.
    The object of the following research was to enable a comparison to
 be made of the results obtained in a previous investigation with
 mercurial electrodes (see " On the Thermo-Electric Behaviour of
 Aqueous Solutions with Mercurial Electrodes,"
                                                        " Proc. Roy. Soc.,''
vol. 29) with those of platinum in similar liquids, in order to ascer
tain whether the results further confirmed the conclusion that the
currents obtained with mercury were not at all due to chemical action ;
and also to draw from the results such additional inferences as were
warranted. The results of a former research, in which platinum elec
trodes were employed in a different apparatus (see
                                                         " Proc.
                                                                 Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 27) could not be used for the purpose of comparison, because it
was found necessary to use weaker solutions with mercurial electrodes
 (in order to avoid chemical action) than those used with platinum in
that research.
    The apparatus employed in the present investigation was precisely
similar to that used in the one with mercury, with the exception that
coiled ribbons of sheet platinum (with attached wires of that metal)
were substituted for the layers of mercury.
    The platinum ribbons were 27'5 millims. wide, and each had a total
surface of 52,960 sq. millims., including both sides.            They were
prepared for use at the outset by heating them to redness.         Between
each experiment      it was  found  necessary   to  thoroughly wash them,
then immerse them in boiling distilled water during about ten or
fifteen minutes, drain and dry them.      They were then simultaneously
immersed in the liquid to be tested, the latter being at a temperature
of about 55° F. A slight temporary deflection of the needles of the
galvanometer was usually produced on immersion ; when the needles
had settled at zero, heat was applied to one of the vessels, and its
temperature raised to 180° F., the deflection being noted.        After the
experiment had been made, the two portions of liquid were mixed and
cooled.
    As this research was made chiefly for the purpose of comparing the
thermo-electric behaviour of liquids with mercury to that with
platinum, precisely similar liquids were employed to those used in the
investigation referred to. None of the solutions acted chemically (in
any perceptible degree) upon platinum.          It was found necessary to
preboil   the  solution about  half-an-honr,  in   order to expel dissolved
air ; otherwise the deflections obtained in repetition experiments were
not uniform. It was also found necessary to occasionally immerse the
ribbons in a boiling-hot dilute solution of pure potassic hydrate, during

1880.]     Thermo-Electric     Behaviour   of Aqueous Solutions,    SfC.   245
about a quarter of an hour, to remove impurities caused by handling.
Repetition experiments were made with each liquid, and, under the
above conditions,     the results obtained were usually very uniform, the
variation of amount of deflection of the needles not often exceeding
half a degree.     The galvanometer      employed was the same as        in the
research referred to, and was used in the same manner.

   In order to arrange these solutions in a series, according to their
various degrees of electromotive force, a similar plan was adopted to-
that employed when liquids of the same composition were used with
mercurial electrodes ; viz., two exactly similar apparatuses, with elec
trodes of the same dimensions, were employed, one being charged
with one solution, and the other with the solution next to it in the
above series.    The apparatuses were connected with the wires of the
differential galvanometer in such a manner that the two currents
passed through the two coils in opposite directions ; the direction and
amount of deflection being noted when the liquid in one vessel of each
apparatus was at 160° F.      The series thus obtained is so arranged
that the couple giving the strongest positive current is at the top, and
that giving the most powerful negative current at the bottom, as in
the list already given.     The solutions in which hot platinnm was-
positive are separated from those in which it was negative by a hori
zontal line as in the above series.
    The positions of the solutions in the two series, although they agree
very closely, are not identical ; for instance, the two solutions of
formiate of sodium occupy respectively the seventh and tenth places
in the first series, and the third and eighth in the second series ; the
positions of a few other solutions are also changed, but not to so great
an extent. It will be observed that these two series agree more closely
 than did those obtained with mercury, and this may, perhaps, be
accounted for by the fact that in these the superficial area of the
platinum electrodes was the same, whereas in the others the mercurial
 surfaces were not equal in amount.

    The total differences 1225 and 4-0 in this series agree as nearly as
could be expected with the maximum deflections 110 and 4-25 in the
previous series.
    Remarks. —The strength of the solution was found to have but
little influence upon the direction of the current. Increase of strength
of solution increased the amount of deflection in solutions of cyanide
of potassium, sulphite of sodium, and selenic acid, and to a less
extent in those of formiate of sodium, formic acid, microcosmic salt,
and ammonia alum.
   With the solutions of sulphuric acid, those of intermediate strength
(1 in 40) gave a greater deflection at 180° F. than either a stronger or
weaker one.      No other instance occurred in which a solution gave a
greater deflection at the temperature of 180° F. than a stronger solution
of the same substance.
   On comparing the results now found with platinum with those
previously obtained with mercury, it will be seen that the two sets
are very similar.       The conclusions, therefore, which have already
been drawn from the former apply largely to the latter, and need not
be repeated.     The chief conclusion, viz., that the currents previously ob
tained  with  mercury were really due to heat and not to minute amounts
of chemical action, is largely confirmed by the present research.            The
chemical relations of mercury being considerably different from those
of platinum in special cases, if the currents were due to chemical
action, the two sets of results would have been widely divergent in
their orders.

   Agitation of the immersed metals is well known to influence the
current. Shaking one of the metals reversed occasionally the direc
tion of the current ; palladium was the metal which most frequently
manifested this effect.     The agitation of that metal rendered it either
more negative or less positive in a considerable degree, especially in
solutions of potassic chloride and cyanide.          In those of the bromide,
antimony    was  the   metal,  the  current   from   which  was most affected
by shaking. The effect of shaking was less in the iodide solutions
than in those of the bromide.
   Note. — Some years ago        I  made a note as follows : " If water is
nearly saturated with a suitable salt at 15°C, and the upper part is
then kept hotter and the lower part colder than that temperature for
a long time, will the upper part become stronger and the lower
           "
weaker ?       Recently, since this research was completed, the following
statements have been published : (see

of Temperature on the Distribution of Salts in their Solutions," by
M. Soret. " The concentration of the heated part diminishes, that
of the cold increases.        The difference grows with the original con
centration, and nearly in proportion.           In the series of the alkaline
chlorides   the difference is greater (for the same concentration) the
higher   the   molecular weight of the salt.          The phenomenon seems
to have no relation to solubility of the salt."        If these statements are
correct (as is very likely) they affect to a slight extent all the results
of the present research (and of other researches) on the thermo
electric behaviour of solutions, because they show that the chemical
composition of the aqueous solution is slightly altered by the rise of
temperature.     If also the strength of the thermo-electric currents of
liquids depends upon the degree of amplitude of vibration of the mole
cules of the salt, &c., in solution, it will probably vary, in the case of
solutions of alkaline chlorides, with the degree of concentration of the
solutions, and the molecular weights of the salts, like the phenomena
in M. Soret's experiments.
VII.   " Influence of Voltaic Currents on the Diffusion of Liquids."
    By G. Gore, LL.D., F.R.S. Received December 1, 1880.

   The subject of this paper is an investigation of the effects produced
by electric currents whilst passing through the surfaces of mutual

    neutral   and alkaline ones,  &c, also of different degrees of dilution,
    the influence upon the effects of the kind and strength of the liquids,
    the strength of the current, and of various other circumstances,       was
    determined.     Two different apparatuses were employed in these ex
   periments,   viz., a single and a double meniscus one ; the former was
   the most easily managed, and yielded the phenomena in their simplest
   form.
       It was found that the phenomena are very complex, and consist of
   a mixture of physical and chemical effects.     That they are chiefly due
   to electrolytic changes, to differences of specific gravity, to ordinary
   liquid diffusion, to electrolytic transfer and diffusion of liquids, and to
   heat of conduction-resistance.     That also the mutual contact surfaces
   of the liquids act to some extent as electrodes and osmotic diaphragms.
   That by the electrolytic action, various phenomena, such as layers of
  liquid of different specific gravities, &c, lines, strata of colour, altera
  tion of form of the surfaces of the meniscuses, liquid currents, &c,
  were produced.       That by the heat evolved, expansion and streaming
  upwards and downwards of the liquids, evolution of gas and steam, and
  boiling of the liquids at their contact surfaces took place. Nearly all
  the phenomena and their conditions have been examined and discussed,
  but some of them, however, have not been fully explained.
      The movements of the meniscus and apparent transfer of the bulk
 of the liquid were examined in a special apparatus in several ways,
 and a conclusion was drawn from these and the previous experiments,
 viz., that by the causes already named an apparent, and, also to a small
 extent, real bodily movement of the liquid did occur.
      Some experiments were also made with two superimposed electro
 lytes in capillary tubes for the purpose of comparing the effects pro
 duced on passing an electric current through them, with those which
occur in a capillary electroscope.       The conclusion arrived at was, that
the two classes of movement were considerably different, and that the
movements obtained with the two electrolytes were more allied to
 those observed by Armstrong (" Phil. Mag.," xxiii, 1843, pp. 194-202),
 Quincke ("Pogg. Ann.," vol. cvii, 1859), Jiirgensen and Wiede
mann, on passing electric currents through non-conducting liquids in
capillary tubes.
      By means of numerous and varied experiments with apparatuses
similar to that used by Porrett (Thomson's " Annals of Philosophy,"
vol. viii, 1816, pp. 74-76) in electric osmose experiments, the influence
of electric diffusion of liquids upon the results was examined.         From
the results of these it was inferred that the apparent movement of the
mass of the liquids was considerably different from that of electric
osmose ; in the osmose experiments it was found that the amount of
liqnid transferred was nearly always greater when the current passed
from a weak to a strong solution of the same salt or acid than when it

252                             Dr. G. Gore.                     [Dec.   16,
passed in the reverse direction.      This circumstance partly explains
some of the phenomena observed in the double meniscus apparatus.
    The influence of molecular structure of the liquid was discussed,
and   it was observed generally that the greater the degree of physical
and chemical differences between the two liquids, the more conspicuous
were all the effects.
    The influence of viscosity, specific gravity, adhesion, and ordinary
diffusion, &c, of the liquids was also considered, and conclusions
respecting them drawn, by the aid of the results of the experiments.
It was concluded that they all affected the phenomena ; that the
phenomena of lines and apparent movement of the liquids were not
wholly capillary ; that although ordinary diffusion affected the results,
its usual effects were modified by the current, which aided diffusion at
the negative meniscus and neutralised it at the other.
    Heat having been found to operate only as a disturbing element,
the influence of rise of temperature was not specially investigated.
The effects of heat resulting from conduction-resistance,         and from
chemical and electro-chemical action at the meniscuses were, however,
observed ; in some cases streams of liquid, evolution of gas and
6team, and even the phenomena of boiling, were seen in the con
tracted portion in the midst of the mass of the liquids.
    The electrical conditions were essentially important. The electric
current produced both physical and chemical effects, consisting of
electrolysis,  dissociation of water from salt, and simple mechanical
movement and diffusion of liquid by electric convection.           As these
phenomena appeared       to be immediate effects of the current,  either  the
current acted under conditions which were not uniform, and produced
effects which required different degrees of electro-motive force to pro
 duce them, or the current consisted of several portions of electricity
of different degrees of electro-motive force. The former supposition
 harmonised with the fact that the ingredients of chemical compounds
 were held together more strongly than those of mere mechanical
 mixtures.     The physical portion of the effects were considered to
 result from electric convection due to eleclric charge and conduction-
 resistance at the surfaces of contact of the liquids, and in capillary
 tubes also at the surface of the glass.   The unequal transfer of acids
and bases, and the liberation of ions at the contact surfaces of the
 liquids, further influenced and complicated the effects. It was pre
 dicted as probable, that as the amount of electric osmose was gTeater
 from a weak solution of a salt or acid to a strong one than the reverse,
 conduction-resistances to currents of opposite direction passing
 through such an arrangement would be similarly unequal.           Evidence
 was also adduced for the conclusion that every inequality of structure
 or composition of the liquid in the path of the current must act to
 some extent as an electrode.       As no visible lines or movements of

   liquid were produced without electrolysis,          and electrolysis would
   reasonably account for several of the phenomena, it was concluded
   that electrolysis   was not merely a concomitant circumstance, but also
   acted as a cause.       The converse phenomena of the subject of this
   paper have     been made the subject of a separate research, entitled
   "The Production of Electric Currents by Diffusion and Osmose of
   Liquids." No effect of magnetism upon the lines or movements of
   the liquids was sought for.
      Chemical action was found to be only a coincident and not a funda
   mental part of the phenomena ; it constantly took place by electro
   lysis and by contact of liberated ions, and occasionally by contact of
   the original liquids.     The lines and strata of liquid at the meniscuses
   were produced with almost every possible chemical             combination of
   electrolytes;   and   references   are  given  to experiments which prove
  this; they were also the more difficult to produce the less the
   differences of chemical composition of the two liquids.
  VIII. "    Experiments on Electric Osmose."              By G. GORE, LL.D.,
                     F.R.S. Received December           7,  1880.
      The following experiments were made for the purpose of elucidating
  a

  order to facilitate reference to them by other investigators.
     As, also, the discovery of an exceptional instance is often of con
  siderable importance, an additional number and variety of solutions
 were purposely examined with that further object until such a one was
 found.      I   anticipated that the proportion of exceptional instances
               "
 would be about one or two per cent."
     The experiments were similar to that made by Porrett (" Annals of
 Philosophy," vol. 8, p. 74). The vessel employed was about 7'0
 centims. high and 3'0 centims. diameter, of thick glass, divided vertically
 into two equal parts, its edges being covered with vulcanised india-
 rubber, with a diaphragm of biscuit ware about 1'5 millim. thick
placed between them ; the whole being held together between two
upright bars of wood by means of a clamp-screw, so that the dia
phragm might be readily removed, and replaced by a clean one.
The electrodes were of sheet platinum, about 18 millims. wide ; and
the electric current (except in the cases otherwise mentioned) was
from 12 Grove's cells of one pint capacity, and in single series. The
liquid was usually about 2 centims. high in the vessel, and at the same
level on each side of the partition previous to passing the current in
each experiment.          The diaphragm was frequently changed.

    In all  the foregoing experiments (sixty-eight in number), in which
an electric current passed from one portion of liquid through a clay
diaphragm to another portion, osmose occurred, except in No. 63.
    In  these experiments, fifty-five substances, different in kind, were
employed, including about twenty-seven                 nentral salts of the most
varied composition, about ten alkaline ones, twelve acids, two alkalies,
and one acid salt; twelve of the substances of different degrees of
dilution, were also examined.
   As with solutions of potassic cyanide, yellow potassic chromate, acid
chromate of potassium, or sodic carbonate (liquids which show an
apparent opposite movement in the research referred to), the osmose
was in the same direction as the electric current, and showed no sign
of reversal of movement,           I conclude that the apparent movement of
the lower liquid in that research is probably of a different character
from " electric osmose."
   From these experiments, it also appears that the direction of electric
osmose is in nearly all cases the same as that of the current ; that
rapid electric osmose is not confined to dilute solutions ; and that in
some cases too concentrated a solution prevented the effect (compare
Nos. 17-20, 54, also 4, 5, and 63).
   From the circumstance that the direction of osmose was the same in
   •  In consequence of the large quantity of orange-red solid matter liberated, the
direction of the osmose could not be determined.
   + In these three experiments a current from a single series of 25 QroTe's cella
was employed.
                                                                          T2

  256                Experiments on Electric Osmose.                 [Dec,  16,
  the most diverse solutions, viz., in acids, alkalies, neutral salts, aqneous
 and alcoholic liquids, concentrated and dilute solutions, &c, we might
 be apt to infer that the chemical composition of the electrolyte had no
 influence upon it ; but as a single exceptional instance will overturn
 the widest generalisation, so the exceptional behaviour of a solution of
 bromide of barium in absolute alcohol invalidates the conclusion that
 the direction of flow of b'quids in electric osmose, is independent     of the
 chemical composition and molecular structure of the liquid.               The
 danger of drawing conclusions from too limited a number of instances
 is well illustrated in this case, especially when we further remember
 that it is the exceptional   instances   which usually disclose the widest
 truths.
    As tho exceptions    formed    a very small proportion of the whole
 number of examples, it     would appear that the direction of the flow
 depended very much more frequently upon the direction of the electric
 current than upon the internal architecture of the liquid.
    In order  to be able to compare the direction of motion of the mass
 of the liquids, produced by passing an electric current from a heavier
to a lighter liquid lying upon it without a separating diaphragm, in
the research already referred to, with that produced when the liquids
were separated by a vertical diaphragm, additional experiments were
made.     The osmose cells employed in these experiments were about
4' 7 centims.   high, 2"5 centims. long, and about 2'0 centims. wide at
right angles to the diaphragm; and the diaphragms were cemented in
with sealing-wax.
    Experiment 1. — Current from 26 Grove's cells in single series, passed
from a saturated solution of sodic sulphate to a one-fourth saturated
one of potassic chloride.       Osmose occurred in the direction of the
current.
    Experiment 2. — Current passed from a mixture of 1 volume of sul
phuric acid and 7 of water to one composed of 5 volumes of a satu
rated solution of oxalic acid, and 3 of water.       Osmose produced in the
usual direction.
    Experiment 3. — Current passed from a strong solution of potassic
chloride to a mixture of 1 volnme of a saturated one of amnionic
sulphate and 3 volumes of water.          Rapid osmose took place in the
ordinary direction.
    Experiment 4. — Current from 5 Grove's cells in single series, passed
from a solution composed of 1 volume of a concentrated solution of
sodic hydrate and 3 volumes of water, to a saturated one of sodic car
bonate.     Osmose occurred in the usual direction.
    Experiment 5. — The same current, passed from a strong solution of
ainmonic nitrate to one of 1 volume of a saturated solution of sodic
carbonate and 3 volumes of water.           Feeble osmose in the ordinary
direction took place-

   From the results of these experiments, and of those referred to, it
appears    that the presence of the diaphragm considerably affects the
directions of the movements.
   By means of numerous experiments subsequently made, it was also
found that electric osmose usually proceeds more rapidly from a weak
to a strong solution of a given substance than in the reverse direction.

   Spider-lines miniatured down to the fourteenth part of the hundred-
thousandth of an inch have been made distinctly visible to ordinary
good eyesight under proper microscopical manipulation.            The question
then arose whether an actual thing so small as the millionth of an inch
could be descried in the microscopic field of view.
   According to recent researches, it would appear from formulas derived
from the undulatory theory of light, that brilliant disks are developed
from points of light which vary inversely in diameter with the increase

    of angular aperture of the objective employed,                      and directly as the
   wave-length of the kind of light employed.*
       Professor Helmholtz and Professor Abbe have independently arrived
   at this beautiful law. And Professor Helmholtz cautiously states, how
   ever, there may be some conditions which may modify this law.
       It follows from this principle that thin brilliant lines of light can be
   best separated by glasses of the highest angular aperture ; and the
   separating       power     can be measured       by the sine of the semi-aperture.

     Such values as these have accordingly been generally accepted as
 limits to the resolvability of close lines with objectives of given aper
 tures.       Further, it is said that lines drawn at the rate of a hundred
 thousand to the inch represent the limit of microscopic visibility.
     In a paper on this subject by the author it has been shown that a
bright space enclosed between two spider-lines, miniatured so as to
form a bright interval 7ao^6o6, was distinctly visible, whilst the webs
actually were about the -^nro an<i to'oo °f an incn iQ thickness.                     J

real objects could be detected by the microscope of the surprising
degree of attenuation, represented by the millionth.
   For this purpose a long search was instituted for many months, both
for the finest attainable defining powers and for suitable objects.
Minute mercurial particles have appeared to furnish very interesting
evidence. If these be very finely smashed with a small piece of watch-
spring, the experiments will be promoted by inserting a minute drop
of petroleum beneath the " cover," which should be very thin and
clean (fig. 9).
   A reflex illuminator       is then used to converge rays downwards
through the objective upon the preparation.
    The most extraordinary minute disks (in a darkened room) may be
then observed (of a circular form chiefly). Some of them are irregular,
and upon some of them will be detected clusters of the most wonderful
degree of smallness, consisting of minute black points, visible with a
power of 1,000 diameters.          And what is so surprising is the entire
absence of any diffraction effects at the edges of these black points.
                                              I
    For convenience of ready reference, have found micrometer spider-
lines of service for comparative estimation.            There are three thick
nesses carefully measured :     —

    Comparing these black particles floating on the surface of the mer
cury with the apparent diameter of the thinnest spider-line, some of
them appeared decidedly smaller. This observation has been confirmed
by several persons to whom they were exhibited.
    Under 1,000 diameters the particle was magnified just one hnndred
times in the micrometric focus. It then appeared less than the spider-
line idlm of an inch thick. Its real diameter was therefore less than
the -j-^ of this magnitude, or less than the millionth of an inch, a
microscopic unit which        I propose here to represent by III.          Under a
power of 2,000 diameters the finest spider-line would represent the
quantity \ ttt.
   The accompanying drawing fairly represents the appearance of the
spider-lines seen on a dark field when mercurial particles, as already
described, are examined with the micrometer under a power of 1,000
(Plate 3, fig. 9). (The webs appear too coarse in the plate.)

                              propose to describe in another portion of
the present research. Suffice it to say, that they fairly and surprisingly
imitate the starry lustre of a midnight sky —the Milky Way and the
various phenomena of the closest double stars.* They display too under
the finest attainable amplification the most accurate diffraction rings            I
have ever witnessed, and as such give admirable indications of quality
and correction in the lenses employed.  In this case floating mercurial
molecules,t uncompressed, reflect astonishingly minute focal images.
   From these observations the conclusion may safely be drawn that
real objects of unsuspected minuteness may be microscopically dis
played, as well as minute miniature images, such as             I
                                                     have elsewhere
described.];
  There is only one objection to this result. It may, perhaps, be said
that bright diffraction diminishes the apparent diameter of these black
points. But they may be observed almost touching each other.         The
great difference in diffraction in the case of black particles seen on a
flat illuminated disk of mercury, and black particles seen by trans
mitted light, so soon as the objects are illuminated from beneath, is
most striking.   Besides this, continued observations of another kind
confirm the conclusion arrived at.      The question of the minimum
visible regarded as visual angle is of equal importance in telescopic as
in microscopic researches, and is well illustrated by the appearance
of minute stars in large telescopes of great excellence.       There the
actual angular aperture is infinitesimally small, as the rays enter the
instrument in a state of parallelism. As, however, an object may be
supposed to move up towards the instrument, the angular aperture
gradually assumes a tangible quantity.       For instance, a fly's foot
viewed with Lord Rosse's gigantic reflector of 6 feet diameter, formed
an angular aperture of 5° 44", the object being 60 feet distant. At
a certain point, as the focus is shortened, a telescope becomes a long
focus microscope.    The instruments are, indeed, convertible. A very
long focussed microscope is in reality a shortened telescope.     At this
point the laws of vision apply identically, and the angular aperture is
the same for each. The question, then, of vision in the microscope,
when only small aperture is engaged as in the telescope, may aptly be
illustrated by minute astronomical observations.   The eye, too, engages
a near object at a small angular aperture : the pupil is then the base,
and the object the apex of an isosceles triangle measuring the angular
aperture, as much perhaps as a couple of degrees in short sight, but
infinitesimally small as in the telescope when directed to a star. The

limit of visibility measured by visual angle is reached, equally by                    the
eye-lens of a microscope or telescope, or by a simple magnifying glass,
when the object subtends too small an angle to be sensible to the
retina.* Both instruments require identical eye-pieces. (Two seconds
of arc is the limit in general of human vision.)
   Comparing, then, the minimum visible in both instruments, and
beginning with the telescope, it may be urged that the spurious disks
of the minutest stars visible, such as the 17th or 20th magnitude,
must subtend an exceedingly small visual angle.
   It is then fair to inquire under what visual angle such disks can be
glimpsed in an eye-piece, used indifferently in either microscopet or
telescope.    Great loss of light in defining these minute points is
prevented by very accurate curvature in a reflecting mirror.       Accord      J
ingly the Uranian satellites have been seen in an 18- inch silver glass
reflector.   The extreme minuteness of these bodies is illustrated as
follows :  —
   A double star between      and     Capricorni may be discovered whose
                                      /Sx     /3a
components are of the 16th and 17th magnitude. Yet Sir J. Herschel
declares, that in comparison with the Uranian satellites, these two
minute stars are splendid objects.      The visual angle at which these
satellites are seen in Calver's 18-inch mirror must be exceedingly
small indeed§ (see mercurial double stars, fig. 9).
   Sir John Herschel records an extremely fine observation of the
double star 22, composed of two minute equal stars nearly as small
as the 9th magnitnde      seen at the Cape with a 20-feet reflector armed
                                ;

     * The spurious disks of stars of excessive minuteness are very much smaller
than those of the larger kind.    But the usual mathematical expression for this size
is independent of star magnitude, and         in this respect incomplete. Such disks
                                                is
are therefore matters of observation, and their size in some degree conjectural.
     The mercurial illuminated star disks are here alluded to.
J t  The same economy of light      secured in microscopic object-glasses of great per
                                        is
fection, which disperse the otherwise inevitable white fog of spherical aberration.
The visibility of these Uranian satellites in Calver's 18-inch silver glass mirror      is
doubtless due to similar cause.

  I beg to call attention to the observation that in examining minia
 tures reduced 1,000 times, the details of these miniatures appeared
 entirely free from diffraction effects so long as the light was subdued.
 But the instant the sun shone every reflecting point or polished surface
 became entirely disguised, concealed, or obliterated in its details by
 the strong diffractions. f           It is on this account that mild daylight
 observations from light received from a white cloud have been found
 so serviceable in minute research as already described.

research is beset with many difficulties and variable factors, some of

angular aperture of the objective employed, according to the refrac
tions of the media, and the direction of illumination and the paral
lelism or degree of convergence or divergence of the illuminating
pencil transmitted.
   C. — Other interesting factors are the residuary aberrations of the
compounding lenses of observation and the greater or less intensity of
diffraction phenomena introduced by the mode of illumination.
   In a short paper, it will be convenient partly to deal with these
questions as they arise in the experiments rather than seriatim.

                                may say the most valuable, feature in
the appearance of a refracting molecule is the extraordinary variability
of the blackness and thickness of the marginal annuhis.
   This thickness and consequent visibility is dependent on the value
of the refraction into the given media, and the angular aperture of
microscopic observation : partially also upon the situation of the focal
point of the lenticular illumination.
   Example 1.— A glass spherule (0"'l diameter) is examined with a
pocket lens. An intensely black broad ring is seen against the light.
The same black ring is visible in bubbles frequenting plate glass in
windows. The angular aperture of the pupil of the eye is about a
degree for an image seen at 10 inches distance.       Melted glass fila
ments are also instructive (see figures a,   7,       9,/3,.      S,   e,

    •   It   is   not many years since lines on diatoms were all that were searched for.
But     as these are formed by an aggregation of siliceous spherules, they present extra
ordinary opportunities for investigating optical characters which must necessarily
belong to them —of    degree of minuteness of
                           a                      highly satisfactory order — such as

black annuli, focal points varying with chromatio refraction, shadows varying in
contour according to the extinction of transmitted rays by obliquity of illumination      :
appearances  changing with the refractive index of the media in which they are
immersed.    Only the very finest glasses extant can display the black margin of
a diatomic spherule the 0iff<> of an inch in diameter

chromatic foci.

      Example 2. —A microscope with ten degrees aperture considerably
  diminishes the relative thickness of the black annalus.
      Example 3. — With forty degrees it is much attenuated and it
 vanishes     altogether when the angular aperture reaches a certain rela
 tion to the lenticular refraction.
      The vanishing limits vary with the nature of the refracting
 spherule, and also with the angular observing aperture and the direction
 of the axis of illumination.*
      If it be formed of plate glass whose index of refraction into air is
  1"500, the vanishing angular aperture is 83° 36'.         But as the index is
 higher, this angle increases with heavy flint glass (m=l"988) to
  164° 6'. In both these cases the black defining annulus of the
 spherule is in these limits attenuated almost to evanescence.
      Glasses, therefore, of small angular aperture develope the broadest
 black outlines in a minute refracting molecule.
     The change of appearance of translucent bodies composed of masses
 of refracting molecules is very finely shown in observing a variety of
 scales forming the dust of moths and butterflies.
     Example 4. — Featherlets of the death's head moth.           Low angular
 aperture, 10°. The whole animal bristles with black feathers, armed
 with three or four long black spines : all of a dark but rich umber
 colour, tipped intensely black ; each spine shows an exceedingly thin
 line of light running centrally up between two broad intensely black
 margins. (Exactly what is seen when examining a thread of spun
glass with low aperture.)        (Fig. 1, Plate 3.)
     Increasing Aperture. — Colours pale. Light flashes through. The
spherules begin to appear edged with black annuli, which gradually
attenuate with higher angled glasses.               (Direct light.)   (Fig. 2.)
 (Fig.e,f.)
     It  is remarkable how the colour changes as the aperture increases,
through paler shades, until a general sparkling radiance appears to
steal through the mass of molecules formerly darkling with the uni
versal presence of black annuli due to low aperture.                The black
edgings also of terminating membranes extending from spikelet to
spikelet, and those of refracting tubules become indistinct.
     The obliteration of marginal shadows is well shown by first using
low and then large aperture on another very beautiful object, viz. : —

   It is interesting to state that the thickness of the filaments of this
plume vary between B6^00 and 5-jrffiro~> Je^ these are beautifully distinct
(aperture 12° and 50 diameters 2-inch objective), and yet under this
amplitude a single filament subtends* less than 20 seconds of arc.
   The exceedingly black and sharp appearance of these filaments
doubtless accounts for their actual visibility under this very small
visual angle.        Now this exactly represents a line 1-1, 600,000th
thick (considerably less than a millionth of an inch) seen under a
power of 1,000 diameters.f
    If then the minute fibrillse of the plume can be clearly distinguished
as closely packed black lines, at a visual angle of twenty seconds,
with low aperture of twelve degrees, this result is fatally opposed to
the popular idea that very close lines, or veiy minute lines or bodies,
can only be distinguished with large angular aperture.            These lines
were most sharply seen, though less than l-80,000th thick (fig. 13a,
Plate 4).
   But besides the black sharply defined ring or annulus always de
veloped in a refracting molecule by using low aperture, oblique illu
mination produces a thorough change in this black ring : it is trans
formed    into various black crescents ; and a row of such molecules
approximately appears as a continuous black line sometimes notched.
A tubule also produces a variety of marginal shadows according to
the angular aperture of observation and according to the arrangement
of internal molecules, and their combined shadows produce a variety of
effects of an important character (fig. 6).
   It follows from these considerations that researches upon inex-
hausted structures (those inadequately resolved for instance), must be
conducted with especial reference to the development and detection
of shadow annuli or bands, or notched black lines, and with special

 regard to the angular aperture of the most effective kind, whether
 modified by the limitation of illuminating rays or by reduction of
 aperture ; or by the refractive media concerned, viz., immersion fluids
  and  " mountings."       (Fig. 10).
     Very striking examples of the disappearance of distinctive shadows,
 and consequent obliteration of structural molecules, are afforded by
 the coarser Podura scales ; principally due to the use of excessive
 angular aperture (figs. 3, 5).
     It is now eighteen years since a single observation suggested the
 present research, which has been followed up almost continuously
 towards the attainment of transcendent high power definition.
     Dark molecules suddenly started into view under accidental mani
 pulation, but were most difficult of reproduction, and in finer objects
 of the same kind were often utterly unattainable.
     The questions naturally arose — are certain optical zones in the
 objectives more effective ; the spherical aberrations existing there as a
 minimum ; or are there other occult causes of occasional yet splendid
 definition under high powers ? This did not appear at all to be a
 question of the minimum visible because the objects exceeded the
 l-50,000th of an inch in diameter.
     These points may be illustrated by the records of some observa
 tions made by the writer.
     Although the molecules of the scale from the insect Podura
 domestica are large, the l-45,000th, a stringlet of these baffles the
 powers of the finest glasses now extant, as ordinarily employed, whilst
 those of the finer test scales (the Podura curvicollis) are hopelessly
 attempted by every observer who trusts to excessive angular aper
 ture (Pod. domestica, fig. 3, Plate 3) .*

light illuminates the object, by tilting the axis of the condenser, black
crescentic   annnli are clearly developed (fig. 6). There is no doubt
the view manipulated is entirely due to shadow thus developed and
the preservation of marginal darkness.         In this way the object may
be shown with a very fine half-inch objective.            The molecules are
indeed hnge compared with other visibilities : perhaps the explanation
here given may enable other observers to confirm their existence in
this comparatively easy object.
   The magnificent Oil Immersion Lens, by Zeiss, of Jena, utterly fails
with its full aperture to show the appearances just described.             It
displays grandly indeed the long corrugations, tubules, or ribs cross
ing each other irregularly, but entirely misses their beautiful contents :
fully charged though they be with spherules (see fig. 7, Plate 3).
   The total disappearance of this interesting structure, on the field of
such a glass, is both surprising and instructive to the beholder.

   As it now seemed only fair to Herr Zeiss' splendid " oil immersion "

axis being coincident with the optical. In place of using cedar oil
the glass was immersed in a mixture of Eangoon and olive oil. Long

able instance of it —:
    Herr Beneche, of Berlin, has made for the writer a very excellent
glass, which, however, performs best with direct central light (l-16th
immersion objective). It will be now seen how important a factor in
delicate observations     the thickness of the " cover" glass.*
                         is

nose touches the cover     ;slight action of the screw collar compresses

to permeate within the now flattened sac forming the scale. Rows of
molecules vanish one after another.        Upon releasing gently the slight
pressure, they reappear    at  will one at  a time.  A molecule remaining
still in contact with the cover appears dark. They lie in rows, by
twos and threes, and here and there form V's by anastomosis. Placing
the correction collar at the most favourable point for finest definition,
intensely dark, almost jet-black, spherules appear like shot to occupy
each rib.    But the scale appeared utterly spoiled by pressure. The
next day, however,    ithad entirely recovered its former appearance by
the force of capillary attraction. Again, the native oil was squeezed
gently along its many channels at a venture, by means of the fine
focal adjustment.
  * Beneche particulatly insists, very properly, upon this as, after all, the collar

   Result. — Many V-shaped rows are visible            :   double  molecules  here
and   there cross    between     the ribs.    Rapid but delicate changes of
pressure cause minute oil globules         to flash up and down with focal
points.
   An interesting demonstration of the molecules                completely filling
up   the  scale,  may be given by rotating the object so as to receive
oblique pencils successively.        The black crescentic shadows of the
molecules may then be seen in different positions relative to the ribs
of the scale (fig. 6). Fig. 10.
   I   must confess that in my earlier attempts to account for the
extreme and often insurmountable difficulty attending the demonstra
tion of minute crowded molecules in many translucent organic forms,
it was erroneously concluded that residuary aberration was                 the only
cause of their obstinate      obscuration.     I  am now able to amend this
conclusion by adding another obstacle, excessive angular aperture,
which   I found attenuated margin.
   Indeed, upon patiently reducing the residuary errors to a minimum,
by means of supplementary lenses, as described in the Transactions
of the Royal Society,* it was further discovered that the mode there
described    very considerably reduced also angular aperture.                   This
result necessarily followed the very considerable shortening of the
posterior foci of the objectives employed : at the same time, not
withstanding the full aperture of the lenses is engaged, the residuary
aberration of the whole is reduced also, in consequence of angular
aperture being at the same time reduced : this large aperture being
indeed the great source of spherical error.
   The angular aperture may be reduced in the same objective by
introducing stops between the back sets of lenses. It is better, how
ever, to have a series of objectives of excellent quality of graduated
apertures.       Aperture can always be reduced by shortening the
eye-tube, or by using low power objectives and deeper eye-pieces to
get the same power.        It may also be reduced in a manner by using
an illuminating cone of light, whose aperture can be diminished at
will.
   There is, it may be said, something unnatural in the mode of vision
intrinsic to very high angled glasses. It is undoubtedly true that
such a glass presents an all-round vision.               It really conveys visual
rays from a given brilliant particle, at every inclination in azimuth
and altitude ; and this too at one and the same instant.
   To illustrate this position, a minute die may be imagined the hundred
thousandth broad. The highest angled objective really enables the

  observer to collect     rays emanating from four sides, and the top at the
  same instant.       The human eye could at most view three sides at once.
  Doubtless, the effect of this angular vision all round the corners,
  causes particles to look spherical when sufficiently minute, even if
  cubical.
     To these considerations we may add the complete attenuation of
  annuli (which are black in refracting molecules with low angular
 a^r-ture), and the comparative invisibility of masses of molecules.
     It may L? remarked here, that the resolutions described have chiefly
 been accomplish^-' by placing the objects in a condition to develope
 black annuli or crescti+ic shadows, and chiefly by reducing the
 aperture.       It is also remarkable that the popular markings of the
 Podura scale lie in a higher plane than the molecules, and having
 been sought hitherto in a wrong focal plane, were naturally missed.
    In   cases, however,     where the composite spherules are much more
 crowded       and much more minute, mere reduction of aperture is
 inadequate to discover their existence.              Their excessive delicacy of
form and translucency of substance, the difficulties introduced by
unmodified diffractions, and by searching the wrong focal planes, mis
management of shadow-phenomena                 and uncorrected residuary aberra
tion combine together to present such formidable obstacles to success,
that few can congratulate themselves on the complete resolution of
this celebrated test object.
    [It having been pointed out that the apparent headings on gnat
scales have been degraded by the application of the term spurious, it
may be said in reply that no proper explanation of these appearances
has been given.          On the other hand, spherules much finer may be dis
tinguished on several delicate scales.

of insect striated scales;* Mr. Stephenson has minutely described
those of the gnat scale ; and Mr. Slack other beaded scales, in

up the structure, diligent search has been made among a considerable

the  objects in view under powers varying            from   1,000  to 3,000
diameters, by the aid of the camera lucida.
                       Scales seen in profile " end on."
   Figs, a, b, c, represent the fortunate vertical appearance of a scale
of the Petrobius maritimus, a Podura frequenting the coast limestone
rocks. The scale was luckily caught between the slide and cover
during the process of remounting (a) . A slightly deeper focus showed
appearance (6), deeper (c) ; a little more pressure caused the scale to
turn over and lie nearly flat, recovering its vertical position on the
removal of the pressure.      This phenomenon solved the problem once
for all, that the under side is smooth, the upper ridged. Black beads
could be detected in (c) at the tips of the ridges.      Having secured this
fact, attention was next turned to examination of the tips of the
spikes with a very exquisite definition of 2,000 diameters.       On search
ing many specimens, a full-grown scale was found and accurately
drawn from the microscope by an assistant.             Never was a search
better rewarded, for not only were the great ribs found beaded on
both sides, but up to the very tip (fig. 12d) ; while transversely three
or four spherules stretched across, in short rows, apparently supple
mented by another parallel set placed in contact in a lower focal plane.
Increased pressure being applied the scale was ruptured ; the scale oil
then flowed out, but returned, insinuating itself along some of its old
channels ; but while pressed out, the whole molecular structure became
visible in the obliterated part; attempted to be shown in the en
graving. Besides these a great number appeared to have burst forth
from the disruption.
   Podura maerotoma. — This little dark-brown leaping insect is very
commonly found in the early spring under old timber and brick-bats.
   A young scale is represented faithfully in fig. 14, a full grown one
in fig. 15, and the cross beading under a power of 3,000 in fig. 16, the
ribs being quite out of focus in an upper focal plane. In fig. 15 several
spherules have escaped and lie irregularly upon the surface and
outside the spikelets, each showing a bright focal point and annvlus.
   It should be here stated that an object-glass was used as condenser
of only 15° angular aperture.       Large aperture renders the spherules
faint and almost invisible.      Direct light was employed and lard oil
with a Seibert l-32nd, or No. XI objective of excellent quality. Great
niceties were also attended to, such as —
   (1.) Varying the length of the observing tube between 5 and 16
inches, changing the eye-pieces and especially altering the aberrations
by the screw collar.
   (2.) Varying the immersion fluid.
   (3.) Varying the illumination by means of a series of objectives as
condensers having angular apertures between 10° and 85°.

   The fall and brilliant display of these minute spherules is, therefore,
attended with no little patient research.    (Direct light used only.)
   I wish to call attention to the appearance of a fine fall-grown scale
of the Podura macrotoma under from 2,000 to 3,000 diameters in
three different focal planes.
   Fig. 18 represents the upper focus.
   Fig. 19 represents the middle focal plane.
   Fig. 20. The lowest.
   The Podura macrotoma appears very much to resemble in its scales
those of the Petrubius maritimus. Younger scales show single rows of
spherales on the ribs, and also between them.

 Method of Estimating very Minute Bodies by means of the Micrometer
                               Gauge.
  A  series of fibres of spun glass is arranged according to thickness,
with free ends projecting into the middle of the field of view of the
eye-piece, also spider-lines placed across the stop : —
       Thickness of No. 1 accurately measured 1- 1,750th of an inch.
                    No. 2     „         „     1- 2,000th
       Spider-line No. 3      „         „     1- 6,000th
            „       No. 4     „         „     1- 8,000th
                    No. 5     „         „     l-10,000th
  If   apositive eye-piece be employed magnifying ten times with an
objective of l-10th focal length, the posterior focal image of the glass
presents an image magnified 100 times, the total power being 1,000.
If, then, No. 1 appears to gauge the size of a magnified object really
100 times less —

             (No. 5.) The size would be yaooa X tso — 1.1,000,000th.
    The micrometer guage is not difficult of construction, as the pro
jecting glass fibres can readily be cemented to the stop within the
eye- piece. An object is much better compared by bringing it apparently
 to the free extremity of the fibre, so as to be in juxtaposition.

    2. The delicate Membrane uniting the Minute Spikelets of the Scale of
 the Gnat. — It may be observed that whenever _a membrane is dupli
 cated and flattened a dark black line is formed ; the edge        in fact,
                                                                    is,
 semi-cylindrical, and transmits no light.

     If
      the spider-lines be employed, careful microscopic examination
should be made and their actual thickness measured. When they
cannot be exposed, a very long focus objective must be employed with
a deep eye-piece and a long tube.     It should be noted whether they
are simple or complex in structure.
   Method of Estimating the Size of a Minute Molecule or Line. — Contact
is apparently made ; first, with the outside of the spider-lines, the
micrometer is then read.     Inside contacts must now be noted. The
mean will be the true size of the molecule, whether the spider webs
are of the same thickness or are of different thicknesses.*
   If a fine membrane be folded over tightly, the line of flexnre
appears exceedingly black and straight, and somewhat thicker than
the membrane.      The folded edge may then be considered at any point
as a refracting semi-cylinder, of special optical beauty and precision of
form unrivalled in organic life.
   To ascertain roughly the nature of this black line, gold beater's skin
was folded over and pressed ; at the line of flexure a very sharp black
line appeared, when examined with a pocket lens.       This line appeared
about one-third thicker than the free edge of the skin forming a section.
Gold leaf exhibits similar dark lines of flexure,f upon the malachite
green of the gold under transmitted light, if there be but little alloy
present.    On the whole, this line is thicker than the leaf, or about
l-100,000th, but it is not nearly so sharply displayed as in the flexure
of insect scales ; in many cases of which the breadth of this black line
                       J
is even less (particularly in the finest gnat and Podura scales).
     Example.          — In the gnat's scale the membrane, including the                              mole

J   This line has in general resisted every attempt at resolution yet, when               ;           a     cor
rugated scale          is   folded over, not too sharply,     a   serrated edge must necessarily          exist.
I   have never been able to define this serration perfectly, except with object-glasses                        of
the highest excellence and reduced aperture, which of course darkened and sharpened
the defining shadows. A very fine view was obtained by means of the posterior
focus of a l-50th being shortened to about two inches, which very considerably
reduced the aperture and admitted considerable separation of the front lenses, to
correct the aberration thus introduced.

   to spikelet, and is    very black and distinct at the edge with a first-class
   glass,   the objective apertnre being reduced by using a condenser of
   about 15° aperture.
      One of these terminators was placed between the spider-lines of a
   delicate micrometer in such a way that the lined edge was apparently
   half way between, and the interval on each side between them equal
   to the    thickness of the lined edge or terminating curve.             Neglecting
   the semi-thickness of the spider-lines, the distance between the latter
   was read 15 millionths (15in) ; one-third of this is 5ttl, or the 200,000th
   of an inch, whilst the general black margins of the ribs appear very
   much less.
      As against transmitted light, causing diffraction, the extremities
   of the spikelets were barely visible and did not appear one-third the
  thickness of the black line edge or margin, or about the 600,000th of
  an inch.        Between the ribs forming the spikelets rows of about
  four molecules could be seen stretching across like the rounds of a
  ladder.       The ribs were l-50,000th thick ; the molecules about one-
  third of this in diameter.
     On one occasion a scale was discovered " end
                                                               " on. The ribs then
  appeared rounded off and prominent, and of an intensely blue-black
   colour; projecting nearly the same amount in relief as they are
  separated by the corrugated channels between them as semi-cylinders
  (fig. 22) on one side, the other being quite smooth.
     The most surprisingly minute lines I have been able to detect were
  seen in examining an extremely small species of gnat.                     Mounted
  fresh and dry, the plumule hairs, about the l-100,000th thick, were
  themselves hairy !— ciliated hairs.
     The antennas displayed central grooves also ciliated.                  And the
 secretory organ, whence the plume hairs issued, formed a boss or cup,
 around which a fringe of cilia of very minute magnitude was erected.
 Comparing these with the familiar images of spider-lines reduced in
                               I
 miniatures 140 times, should not hesitate to estimate these objects at
 a size approaching the millionth or microscopical unit (HI).                      An
 extraordinary instance of accidental magnification of these usually
 invisible cilia with perfect distinctness, indeed,           I might say, with tho
most vivid definition (probably a power of 10,000 diameters) was dis
covered to-day.          See description of Plates, fig. 17.

                                     (Abstract.)
     This  research,   which is     a  continuation     of    one previously com
 municated to the Society,* is based on an examination of this organ in
 the dog, cat, horse, rabbit, ox, sheep, seal, pigeon, fowl, rook, tortoise,
 frog, skate, and conger-eel.        The research has been carried on under
 the direction of Dr. Klein, and the following are the chief conclusions
 which have been arrived at : —
     (1.) Vesicles. — Although branched vesicles may be present, the gland-
 vesicles in the thyroid of adult animals, according to the author's
 observations, form closed cavities, which are not in communication
 with one another to any extent. Much-branched vesicles, which have
 been observed in the glands of young dogs, are considered merely as
 forming a stage in the growth of the gland, and as indicating that an
increase in the number of vesicles is taking place.                In the thyroid
gland of the conger-eel, small vesicles (containing colloid) are fre
quently observed in the walls of large ones, and from the appearances
t hey present it is probable that the walls separating the cavities of the
large and small vesicles sometimes become flattened out and give way,
allowing the contents of the two vesicles to commingle.
    (2.) Epithelium, Reticulum, and Basement-Membrane. — Whilst the
shape of the epithelial cells of the vesicles varies much in different
animals, the general tendency of these cells throughout the vertebrate
series, as far as examined, is to the columnar form. A delicate reti
culum (as described by Zeiss) has been observed amongst the epithelial
cells. In a profile view of the epithelium club-shaped cells are also
often seen, which are probably indicative of more or less branched
cells, situate in the reticulum. The only form of basement-membrane

observed has been a delicate        layer of connective tissue between    the
epithelium and the        endothelium of the lymphatics, in which         the
capillaries ramify.
   (3.)   Contents  of Vesicles. — The following are the chief constituents
of these which have been observed in the microscopical examination
of specimens hardened in alcohol : —
                                                                         " of
   (a.) Homogeneous or granular material (" colloid substance
authors) has been observed with slight variations, in all classes of
the vertebrata, and is undoubtedly a normal product of the organ.
   (6.) Bed Blood-corpuscles are frequently found in the vesicles in
greater or less number, and in various stages of disintegration and
decolorisation. In the epithelial wall of vesicles containing red blood-
corpuscles granules of yellow pigment are sometimes seen which
appear to be due to the absorption, by the epithelial cells or inter
cellular reticulum, of the colouring matter of the effused blood.
Observations on the dog lead to the inference that in this animal an
escape of red blood-corpuscles is almost constantly taking place into a
greater or less number of vesicles, and its occurrence in other animals
also (man, tortoise, conger-eel) renders it very probable that the pas
sage of red blood-corpuscles into the vesicles is a normal occurrence in
the thyroid gland.       Further observations (dog, rook, seal) also make
it very probable that normally under certain circumstances an escape
of red blood-corpuscles takes place into a large proportion of the
vesicles of the thyroid gland. The blood thus effused contributes, the
author considers, to a large extent to the formation of the " colloid "
substance, and probably has an important bearing on the physiology
and pathology of the organ.
   (c.) Colourless blood-corpuscles (large round cells, with granular
cell-substance and single round or oval-shaped nucleus) are frequently
seen in the homogeneous material in the gland-vesicles of the tortoise.
The migration of these cells into the vesicles is a normal occurrence in
this animal. It may also take place in other animals.
    (<2.) Bounded masses staining darkly with hematoxylin,           or of a
bright yellow     colour with  picro-carminate  of  ammonia,  are seen in the
vesicles of many animals.           Crystals sometimes occur in the gland-
vesicles (tortoise, rook), and finally brown pigment granules have been
observed in the colloid material contained in the vesicles (frog,
conger-eel).
    (4.) Parenchyma.
                        — The parenchymatous cells already described in
the adult dog have been observed in the glands of dogs a few weeks
old. Ia the cat parenchymatous cells have been seen in less numbers,
and they appear to migrate into the vesicles in the same manner as in
 the dog.    In the pigeon large groups of round or oval-shaped cells,
provided    with   a single nucleus, are frequently seen, but there is no
evidence to show that they migrate into the vesicles.

                                            —
    (5.) Lymphatics and their Contents. A network of lymphatics,
resembling, in its general characters, that previously described in the
•dog, but differing apparently in the extent of its ramifications, has
been observed in some other mammals.         The homogeneous or granular
contents of the lymphatics in the dog occur in both injected and in
uninjected glands, and in very variable quantity, the amount being
apparently independent of the sex or age of the animal.             In the
thyroid gland of the pigeon no system of lymphatics could be injected
 by the method of puncture after repeated attempts, but the injecting
fluid always entered the blood-vessels of the gland.           The thyroid
gland of the tortoise contains a network of lymphatics of which the
smaller ramifications run between almost all individual vesicles.      The
endothelium of these lymphatics presents well-marked areas of vary
ing size and shape, stained darkly with nitrate of silver.           In the
thyroid gland of the conger-eel no evidence of a system of lymphatics
was obtained by interstitial injection.
                        —
    (6.) Blood-vessels. The arteries are ensheathed more or less com
pletely in their accompanying lymphatics (dog, tortoise). The capil
laries, on the contrary, run between the epithelium of the vesicles and
the smallest ramifications of the lymphatics (tortoise), leaving intervals
between them where the lymphatic is not separated from the epithelium
by blood-vessels.      Projections of the capillaries between the epithelial
•cells towards the cavity of the vesicles are frequently seen in the
tortoise. In the pigeon the intervesicular ramifications of the blood
 vessels are not so complicated nor so minute as in other animals (e.g.,
 tortoise, sheep), but resemble more the distribution of lymphatics in
 some mammals.        In birds also the veins frequently surround either
 partially or entirely the arteries which they accompany.
    (7.) Undeveloped Portions. — Bodies consisting of portions of the
gland of which the development has not advanced beyond the stage of
convoluted " cylinders of cells," described by W. Miiller, are frequently
seen.     They consist of a solid mass of more or less cylindrical rows of
 cells, between which run septa of connective tissue and blood-vessels.
 The " cylinders " are composed of cells resembling epithelial cells,
cubical or columnar in shape ; those on the surface of the cylinder,
next to the capillaries, being arranged at right angles to those vessels.
 In the adult dog these undeveloped portions usually form distinct
 bodies separated by layers of connective tissue from the rest of the
 gland, and frequently lying in depressions on the surface of the organ.
 In young animals, such as the kitten, they can be observed undergoing
3, transformation into gland- vesicles.
    (8.) Thyroid Gland of the Frog. — In opposition to the statements of
most authors, but in general agreement with those of W. Miiller,
 the tliyroid gland of this animal has been found to consist of two
distinct bodies, situate one on either side, on the ventral surface of the
                                                               Y 2

        Ovarian Ovum in the Common Fowl and in the Rabbit."
        By E. A. Schafer, F.R.S. Received November 24, 1880.
    Attention was drawn in the above mentioned paper (" Proc. Roy.
Soc." vol. 30, p. 239, and fig. 9) to certain peculiar bodies (pseudo-
nuclei) in the vitellus of some immature ovarian ova of the bird, the
origin and interpretation of which were left in doubt.          In a paper by
Rauber,* which I had not seen at the time, the bodies in question are
specially noticed, and an account of them is given which agrees closely
with mine. I confess, however,        I should be slow to acquiesce in the
opinion (which Rauber seems disposed to adopt) that they are either
directly or indirectly products of immigrated white blood-corpuscles.
So far as I can see they appear to be nothing else than condensations
of vitelline substance.
    I would further take this opportunity of mentioning that the con
voluted tube delineated in fig. 35 of the paper referred to in the
1leading of this note is not to be supposed to represent       any part of an
egg-tube, but the remains of a tubule derived from the Wolffian body.
It is inserted to show the distinction between the two kinds of tubes
which may be met with at the same time in the ovary.

1881.]       Dr.   J.   L. W. Thudichum.     Note on Protagon.        283
prepared by Dr. Gamgee,       I   beg leave to submit the following   brief
statement.
  In order   to decide whether      " Protagon,"
                                               as described in 1864 by
Oscar Liebreich, is really a definite chemical body, a true immediate
principle of the brain, it is of course essential to know whether the
substance, prepared as Liebreich directs, does or does not contain
other matters than those for which he accounts in his formula of
" protagon ;" and on this question
                                     (or rather on part of it) Professors
Gamgee and Roscoe have joined issue with me before the Royal
Society.
  My contention for some years had been that Liebreich's " protagon"
does always contain matters which are foreign to its alleged formula,
that it contains them in ponderable quantity, and, among them, notably
                                      " Annals of Chemical Medicine,"     I
potassium : and a year ago, in my
published details of many analyses to show that, in connexion with
trifling differences in the extraction-process, the proportion of potas
sium in different specimens of " protagon
                                                " could be made to
                                                                     range
from a trace to 1§ per cent. — See op. eit., Art. XIX.
   This position of mine Dr. Gamgee sought to refute before the
Royal Society by adducing a note from Professor Roscoe to the effect
that Professor Roscoe, having examined spectroscopically the car
bonised residue of a certain gram of " protagon," had found in it only
a quantity of potash which he estimated not to exceed i0l0c part
of the whole. See " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 111.
   On this challenge I submitted to the Society that Professor Roscoe's
examination had at any rate established as fact the presence of potas
sium in the " protagon," and that, for reasons which I stated, the
¦quantity of the potassium could not be rightly inferred from any such
examination as that which Professor Roscoe had made. See
                                                                    " Proc.
Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 278.
   Professor Roscoe, apparently in answer to that criticism, has now
brought before the Society the result which he obtained in a second
examination.       Having, in this examination, analysed 5 grms. of
" protagon " with regard to the potassium contained in       it, he reports
that he found       to contain potassium in the proportion of 0-0236 per
                   it
cent.   See
             " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 365.
   My reason for asking leave to trouble the Royal Society with the
above recapitulation, and with      afew words of comment on the present
state of the  case,  is, that Professor Roscoe, in closing his recent com
munication to the Society, alludes to certain fresh spectroscopic expe
riments which he has made, and says that they have convinced him of
the correctness of the conclusions contained in his original letter.    I
do not myself quite understand in what sense Professor Roscoe intends
                                                          "          " had
that statement, seeing that his later examination of        protagon
yielded him nearly seven times as much potassium as he had originally

284                     Prof. T. Carnelley.      On the             [Jan. 6r
estimated the body to contain. And lest the language now used by
him should lead to any misapprehension with regard to the essential
issue which has been raised before the Society,         I would ask leave to
                                               "           " which Professor
point out that, inasmuch as the specimen of protagon
Roscoe analysed yielded him a ponderable quantity of potassium, this
result,  so far as it goes, thoroughly confirms what I have stated on the
subject.    In the face of it, none can maintain that " protagon " is the
pure chemical body which it claimed to be.           Also, adverting to the
fact that Professor Roscoe's communication refers to but one analysis,
I  may perhaps be permitted to express my conviction that, if Professor
Roscoe were led to extend his examinations over an area commensurate
with mine, I should be indebted to him for further and more decided
confirmation of my statements.
   Finally, too,    I  would wish to insist on this contrast : that
while   " protagon," as I have shown, always on analysis betrays the

IV. " Preliminary Note        on the Existence of Ice and other Bodies
      in  the Solid State at Temperatures far above their ordinary
      Melting Points." By Thomas Carnelley, D.Sc., Professor
       of Chemistry in Firth College, Sheffield. Communicated
      by Professor ROSCOE, F.R.S. Received November 11, 1880.
   In  the present communication       I  have the honour to Lay before the
Royal Society a detailed description of experiments, proving that
under certain conditions it is possible for ice and other bodies to exist
 in the solid state at temperatures far above their ordinary melting
points. On a future occasion I hope to submit to the Society a full
account of the investigation of which these experiments form a part,
 together with the conclusions to be drawn therefrom. The bodies
 whose behaviour I propose to discuss at present are ice and mercuric
chloride.
                                     Ice.
    In the case of ice the great difficulty to be overcome is to maintain
 the pressure in the containing vessel below 4-6 millims., i.e., the tension
 of aqueous vapour at the freezing point, for it will be easily understood
 that if the ice be but slightly heated the quantity of vapour given off
 would soon be sufficient to raise the pressure above that point. After

several fruitless attempts the following plan, involving the principle of
the cryophorus, was adopted.
                                  Fig. 1.
   A strong glass bottle, such as is used for freezing water by means
of Carre's pump, was fitted -with a cork and glass tube C (fig. 1), and
the cork well fastened down by copper wire and paraffin wax.      A and
 C were then filled with mercury, and C connected with the end of the
tube DE by means of the piece of stout india-rubber pump tubing B,
a thermometer    having been previously attached by the wire x to the
lip of the tube at B. The connexion at B was made tight by fine
copper wire.      The tube DE was about one inch in diameter, and
about four feet long from the bend to the end E ; after connexion
with C it was completely filled with mercury, care being taken to expel
the air from A, C, and DE as completely as possible; the whole was
then inverted over the mercurial trough F, as shown in the figure, when
the mercury fell to o, the ordinary height of the barometer.          The

 286                   Prof. T. Carneiley.    On  the            [Jan. 6,
 mercury was ran out of A by tilting up the bottle and inclining the
tube DE. By this means a Torricellian vacuum was obtained from
 A to o. DE was next brought to the vertical, and the bottle A
placed in the trough P. A tin bottle G without a bottom was fitted
 with a cork, so that it might slide somewhat stiffly along DE.
   To begin with, the tin bottle was placed in the position G and filled
with a freezing mixture of salt and ice. Some boiled water was then
passed up the tube DE, sufficient to form a colnmn at M about two
inches deep.    The thermometer H had been previously arranged, so
that its bulb might be one or two inches above the surface of the
water M. The bottle A was next surrounded by a good quantity of a
freezing mixture of salt and ice, in order that any vapour given off
from the water at M might be condensed in A as fast as it was formed,
and thus the internal pressure might never be more than about l'O to
1*5 millims.    When A had been sufficiently cooled, which required
about fifteen minutes, the tin vessel G was slid down the tube DE,
and its freezing mixture removed.     The water at M had then solidified
to a mass of ice, which on heating with the flame of a Bunsen's
burner melted either wholly or partially, and the liquid formed began
at once to boil.    The fusion commenced first at the bottom of the
column of ice, whereas the upper part fused only with difficulty, and
required rather a strong heat. The fusion in this case was probably
due to the steam evolved from the lower portions of the ice column
being imprisoned and unable to escape, and hence producing pressure
sufficient to cause fusion.
   When the greater part of the ice had been melted the tube was
tightly clasped by the hand, the heat of which was sufficient to produce
a somewhat violent ebullition.     The liquid in boiling splashed up the
side of the tube and on to the bulb of the thermometer, where it froze
into a solid mass, as represented in fig. 2. By this means the ice was
obtained in moderately thin layers.     The tube at the points indicated
by  the  arrows  was  then  strongly heated  by the flame of a Bunsen's
burner, with the following results : —
   The ice attached to the sides of the tube at first slightly fused,
because the steam evolved from the surface of the ice next the glass
being imprisoned between the latter and the overlying strata of ice,
could not escape, and hence produced pressure sufficient to cause fusion,
but as soon as a vent-hole had been made fusion ceased, and the whole
remained in the solid state, and neither the ice on the sides of the
tube nor that on the bulb of the thermometer could be melted, how
ever great the heat applied, the ice merely volatilising without previous
melting. The thermometer rose to temperatures varying between
120° and 180° in different experiments, when the ice had either
wholly volatilised or had become detached from the bulb of the ther
mometer.     The ice attached to the latter did not partially fuse at the

 1881.]     Existence  of Ice and  other Bodies in the Solid State.     287
commencement       of the heating because, the heat reaching the outer
surface of the ice first, evaporation could take place from a free surface
and the vapour not become imprisoned, as was the case with the ice
attached to the sides of the tube.
                                    Fig. 2.
   These experiments were repeated many times and always with the
same result, except in one case in which the heat applied had been
very strong indeed and the ice attached to the sides of the tube fused
completely.     On removing the lamp, however, for a few seconds the
water froze     again, notwithstanding that the portion of the glass in
contact with it was so hot that it could not be touched without burning
the hand.
   The chief conditions necessary for success appear to he — (1) That
the condenser (A, fig. 1) is sufficiently largo to maintain a good
vacuum.      In the present case the capacity was about three-quarters of
a litre ; (2) That the ice is not in too great mass, but arranged in thin
layers.    Further, in the case where the heat is applied to the under
surface of the layers of ice, the latter must be sufficiently thin to allow
of a vent-hole being formed for the escape of the steam coming from

below, otherwise   fusion occurs.    When the heat is applied to the free
surface of the ice, the layers may be much thicker.

           m. p.=288°, re-solidifies at 270—275°, b. p. = 303".
   About 40 grs. of pure mercuric chloride were placed in the tube
(A, fig. 3), and a thermometer arranged with its bulb imbedded in the
salt.  The drawn-out end of the tube was connected by stout india-
rubber tubing with one branch of the three-wayed tube B, whilst the
other was attached to the manometer C.           B was connected with a
Sprengel pump, fitted with an arrangement for regulating the pressure.
   When the pressure had been reduced by means of the pump to below
420 raillims., the mercuric chloride was strongly heated by the flame of
a Bunsen's burner, with the following results : —
   Not the slightest fusion occurred, but the salt rapidly sublimed into

1881.]      Existence of Ice and other Bodies   in tlie Solid State.   28&
the cooler parts of the tube, -whilst the unvolatilised portion of the salt
shrank away from the sides of the tube and clung tenaciously in the
form of a solid mass to the bulb of the thermometer, which rose con
siderably above 300° C, the mercury of the thermometer shooting up
to the top of the stem. After slight cooling the air was let in, and
under the increased pressure thus produced the salt attached to the
bulb of the thermometer at once melted and began to boil, cracking
the tube at the same time.
    The experiment was next varied as follows : —
    About the same quantity of chloride was placed in the tube A, fig. 3,
as before, and heated by the full flame of a Bunsen's burner. The lamp
was applied during the whole of this experiment, and the size of the
flame kept constant throughout.      The mercuric chloride first liquefied
and then boiled at 303° under ordinary pressure, and whilst the salt
 was still boiling the pressure was gradually reduced to 420 millims.,
 when the boiling point slowly fell to 275°, at which point the mercuric
 chloride suddenly began to solidify, and at 270° was completely solid,
 the pressure then being 37G millims. When solidification was complete-
 the pump was stopped working, but the heat still continued to the
 same extent as before.      The salt then rose rapidly to temperatures
 above that at which a thermometer could be used, but not the least
 sign of fusion was observed. From the completion of the solidification
 to the end of the experiment the pressure remained at about 350
 millims.
    The above experiment, which was repeated three times, shows,
 therefore, that when the pressure is gradually reducsd from the
 ordinary pressure of the atmosphere to 420 millims., and the boiling
 point simultaneously from 303" to 275°, the salt solidifies while it is
 still boiling and in contact with its own hot liquid, notwithstanding
 that it is being strongly heated at the same time ; and that, after
 solidification is complete at 270°, the temperature then rises far above
 the ordinary boiling point (303°) of the substance without producing
 any signs of fusion. Under ordinary circumstances, mercuric chloride
 melts at 288° and re-solidifies at 270 — 275°, i.e., at a temperature
  identical with that at which it solidifies under diminished pressure, as
  above described.
     The solid mercuric chloride obtained on solidification under the
  combined influence of diminished pressure, and the application of a
  strong heat had a peculiar appearance, quite different to that pro
  duced when the substance is allowed to solidify in the ordinary way.
 It appeared to consist of a mass of pearly leaflets closely packed
  together round the bulb of the thermometer.
     Any final explanation of these phenomena is reserved until further
  experiments have been made.

                                     Appendix.
     Since writing the foregoing, it has been said in explanation of the
 phenomena therein described, that the thermometer, though embedded
 in the mass of the ice, did not really indicate the true temperature of
 the latter. With the object, therefore, of proving whether the ice is
 hot or not, I have, at the suggestion of Professor Roscoe, made the
 following calorimetrical determination : —
     The arrangement of the apparatus was so modified, that the ice,
 after being strongly heated, could be suddenly dropped into a calori
 meter containing a known quantity of water of known temperature.
 The resulting temperature, after the ice had been dropped in, was
 read off by a thermometer graduated so as to indicate a difference of
0o,05 C.      The weight of the ice was found by re-weighing the calori
 meter.
     So far,   I  have only had the opportunity of completing the two
 following determinations, and in the second of these the weight of the
 ice could not be found, as a small quantity of water was lost out of the
  calorimeter, owing to a sudden jerk at the moment the ice entered
 it:—

 latter =185 grms.
    Weight of ice dropped in=l'3 grms.

    On weighing the calorimeter after the experiment, the increase in
weight was only 0-15 grm., but as a portion of the water had been
jerked out during the operation, the true weight of the ice, and there

 1881.]       Effects  of Heat  on the Chloride,  $c, of Silver.       291
fore its temperature, could not be found.        But since the calorimeter
had slightly risen in temperature, the ice must have been above 80° C.
   From the nature of the experiment, as carried out on the present
scale, the weight of the ice which can be dropped into the calorimeter
is only small, and therefore the rise in temperature is but Blight.    But
since a fall in temperature of a much larger amount ought to have
been obtained had the ice been at 0°, it is considered that the above
experiments are conclusive.      Great care was taken, in order to obtain
 correct temperatures    in the calorimeter.  The latter was inclosed in
 several casings, and the water was allowed to stand in it for several
hours before the experiment, so that it might first attain the tempera
ture of the room, whilst the time which elapsed between the readings
of the thermometer before and after the ice was dropped in would not
be more than from 10 to 15 seconds.
   In the course of the next few weeks I intend to make one or two
more determinations, and, if possible, on a larger scale.

              1.  The Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide of Silver.
   Since   I had the honour of submitting to the Society papers on the
above    subjects, "Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 25, p. 279 — 303, accurate
determinations,    by a new method, of the melting points of the sub
stances with which the experiments were made have been described
by Mr. Carnelley.      He finds that the melting point of iodide of silver,
hitherto generally described as
                                   " a low red heat," is 527° C. of the
                                                                  ;
bromide of silver 427° C. ; and of the chloride 451° C. These num
bers are in all cases higher than those which I adopted, and I have,
consequently,     recalculated those portions of the results which are
affected by the new determinations, and they are given in the follow
ing table. The volume of the chloride and bromide at — 60° C. has
been taken as unity for better comparison with the iodide, which,
according to Fizeau, possesses its maximum volume at that tempera
ture.   It will be remembered that the iodide of silver in cooling from
its melting point contracts like ordinary solids until it reaches a
temperature of 142° C, at which point it possesses its maximum
density, it then suddenly expands to a volume greater than that which
it possesses at the fusing point, and continues to expand as the
temperature diminishes.

1881.]       Effects  of Heat   on the Chloride, fyc,  of Silver.       293
                   2. The Chloro-brom-iodides   of Silver.
    Mr. Carnelley has been   so  good as to determine for me, by his new
method,   the melting points     of the five chloro-brom-iodides of silver
described in my former paper (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 25, p. 292),
and the results have been recalculated in accordance therewith.          By
reference to the accompanying table, it will be seen that the fusing
point of No. 1 is 44° C. lower than that of its most easily fusible
constituent, and 144° C. lower than that of the least easily fusible
constituent.    The lowering is most conspicuous in No. 3, the fusing
point being 101° C. lower than that of bromide of silver, which con
stitutes nearly one-quarter of its weight, and 201° C. lower than that
of iodide of silver, which constitutes more than half its weight.
Again, in No. 4 it will be seen that the melting point is 147° C. lower
than of iodide 'of silver, which constitutes nearly three-fourths of its
weight.
    We may notice, moreover, the following points : —
    (1.) No. 1, containing the smallest quantity of iodide of silver, is
almost unaffected by it. It closely resembles bromide of silver, save
that a very slight contraction takes place between 125°-5 C. and
131°-5 C. ; and the orange-coloured powder furnished by pulverisation
turns green on exposure to light.          In No. 3, which contains a little
more than half its weight of iodide of silver, we find the lowest melt
ing point ; the highest specific gravity ; the greatest divergence in
every respect from the properties of its constituents, although the
influence of the iodide is very marked, both in the plasticity of the
substance above 250° C, and in the considerable contraction which
takes place between 124° C. and 133° C. In No. 5 the influence of
the iodide is most marked, and in some respects the substance
resembles its principal constituent.
    (2.) Let us note, moreover, that the fusing points diminish from
 1 to 3, and increase from 3 to 5 ; while the specific gravities diminish
on both sides of No. 3.
    (3.) In No. 1, in spite of the presence of the iodide, the coefficients
 of expansion above 131*5 and below 125'5 are higher than those of
 any of its constituents.      Again, in spite of the presence of such
 expansible bodies   as  the  chloride and bromide of silver, the amount
 of contraction undergone by some of the chloro-brom-iodides, on
 heating between 124° C. and 133° C, exceeds that of the iodide itself.
 The case becomes one of great complexity. Take the most distinctive
of the chloro-brom-iodides, No. 3. Between 0° C. and 124° C., any
 mass of a hundred molecules consists of 58 whicli are undergoing
 slight contraction, and 42 which are undergoing rapid expansion.
 Rapid contraction takes place with the iodide alone at 142° C. ; here
it commences 18" C. lower, and while it takes place in the case of 58

 VI.    " Phenomena of the Capillary Electroscope." By G. GORE,
             LL.D., F.R.S. Received November 23, 1880.
                                   (Abstract.)
     In this communication     is described an investigation of various of
 the conditions of the above phenomena.          The phenomena have been
 found to be purely physical except in those cases where the electricity
 was of too high tension and produced electrolysis, and in those in
 which the solution acted chemically upon the mercury.
     The influence of the kind and strength of numerous solutions was
 examined, including those of various salts of neutral, alkaline, and
 acid reaction, and of various acids, and the results are described.      Of
 the salts, some gave anomalous results ; alkaline cyanides, for instance,
 reversed the direction of the movements of the mercury. Inferior
 conducting liquids, such as aqueous ammonia, gave feeble movements.
  Good conducting solutions, such as neutral salts of the alkalies,
 potassic cyanide, and dilute sulphuric and phosphoric acids, yielded
 strong movements.        Both the kind and the degree of dilution of the
  various substances had great influence upon the results.
      By examining the question of the influence of the relative dimen
  sions of the mercurial surfaces it was found that no such influence
  existed, simply because one surface of liquid metal with a suitable
  solution was alone sufficient.
     Attempts were made, but without success, to obtain the same
  movements of two aqueous solutions instead of mercury and a watery
  liquid. Other effects, of apparent movement, &c. (described in a
  separate communication,     see
                                    " Influence of Voltaic Currents on the
  Diffusion of Liquids," {ante, p. 250), were obtained.
      The question as to whether the movements were wholly due to
  alteration of volume of the mercury was also investigated, and the
  conclusion     arrived at was, that while a very minute alteration of
  volume did occur, nearly the whole of the movement was due to other
  causes.
      The influence of adhesion was freely examined, and the hypothesis

 and    that the to and fro movement is a secondary circumstance
 arising from this in consequence of the greater adhesion of the solution
 than of the mercury to the tube.
     The relations of the phenomena to heat and temperature are
  discussed, and the inference drawn that these influences perform only
  an unimportant part in the actions.
     With regard to the electric conditions, it is observed that the phe
  nomena are inseparably connected with electric transfer, and may be
 attended or not by electrolysis ; the latter, when present, being only a
 coincidence.      Various experiments were made with electricity derived
 from an electrophorus, and the effects obtained are described in
 different parts of the paper ; and the sensitiveness of the instrument
 to electric influence is illustrated.           From the various results obtained
 by the author and other investigators, a conclusion is drawn that the
 phenomenon is essentially one of electric convection ; that the primary
 mechanical movement at the two liquid surfaces is due to a more or
 less charged electric state of those surfaces, which under the condi
tions of unequal adhesion of the two liquids to the tube produces the
 to and fro movement.
     The movements were independent of chemical action.

       1880.
    The following experiments arose out of a research on " The Influence
of Voltaic Currents on the Diffusion of Liquids." As the converse
phenomena of electric diffusion and electric osmose of liquids would
be the production of electric currents by liquid diffusion and osmose,
I made    various attempts to obtain them.
    Other investigators have already obtained electric currents by
means of the contact of two liquids.*                   Nobili appears to have been
the first.    In his arrangement, each element consisted of a series of
four glass cups, each containing an electrolyte, the liquids in the two
terminal vessels being precisely alike, and containing platinum
electrodes, and a second and third kind of liquid being in the two
intermediate cups respectively.               Liquids of suitable specific gravity
were selected, such as not to spontaneously mix.                    The solutions were
connected by means of liquids (similar to those in the cups) contained

 ment, acid and alkaline liquids were in contact with each other,
 chemical action occurred.            Fechner employed a similar apparatus, and
 in some of the combinations of liquids employed by him, chemical
 action took place from a similar cause. In Wild's research, each
 element consisted of an open pup having two long and vertical wide
 glass tubes projecting downwards from its lower surface and termi
 nated at their lower ends by electrodes.                   Three kinds of liquid, in
 four portions, of suitable specific gravities, were carefully placed upon
 each other in a series of distinct layers, without intervening solid
 diaphragms, the two portions in contact with the electrodes being pre
 cisely similar. Liquids which did not chemically act upon each other
 were in nearly all cases employed ; but as the electrodes were electro-
 coppered metallic capsules, and any electric current produced by
 liquid diffusion has extremely feeble electromotive force, it is probable
 that chemical action interfered. L. Schmidt (of Halle) employed a
 perfectly similar apparatus and arrangement of liquids. In Wiillner's
 arrangement, the liquids were in a wide cylinder formed of several
 horizontal segments, the liquids being in distinct layers, separated by
 disks of animal membrane, and the electrodes were circular sheets of
 brass or copper.*            In each and all of these apparatuses and arrange
 ments, three distinct liquids were employed, and the phenomena were
 not reduced to their simplest form by the use of two liquids only.
     In   my earliest     experiments,     I  employed      several    different   arrange
 ments     of apparatus, in which a very limited number of layers of
 liquid of different degrees of concentration were separated from each
 other by horizontal diaphragms of parchment paper, the terminal
layers having small platinum wire electrodes connected with a
 Thomson's reflecting galvanometer.                No signs of an electric current
were however obtained.
     As electromotive force may be of all degrees of strength, from that
which only causes two liquids to feebly mix to that by which the most
fixed compounds are decomposed ; and as the energy of mechanical
diffusion and osmose is extremely feeble in comparison with that of
chemical union,         I   concluded that any electric current arising from
those causes would probably have very feeble electromotive power, and
I  therefore made other trials with a larger number of elements.
     In order    to try more effectually whether a difference of facility of
diffusion, caused by the action of gravity upon two portions of solution
of different degrees of concentration and of specific gravity, would
produce an electric current, I made the following experiments : —

hown in fig. 1, each alternate one containing a liquid of a different
degree of concentration.       Two liquids were employed, viz., one com
posed of a half saturated solution of potassic nitrate, and the other,
one volume of a saturated solution of the same salt, mixed with 320
volumes     of water.    Each alternate           vessel contained respectively
3   ounces   by  measure    of   the     weaker,     and 2£ oz. of the stronger
solution.    The two terminal vessels contained the stronger liquid,
and were provided with small platinum wire electrodes inserted
through holes near the bottoms of the vessels. The liquids in the
vessels were connected in single series by means of inverted bent
tubes of glass, of half-an-inch diameter, the alternate tubes being
filled with the respective solutions.        The end of each of the tubes at
which the two liquids came into contact, was previously covered with
a wet septum of parchment paper tightly secured by means of string.
On connecting the series with the galvanometer, a feeble electric
current was obtained, which by interchanging the two terminal
vessels was proved not to arise from any differences of the electrodes.
The direction of the current was downwards through the septums and
surfaces of contact of the two liquids.
    As according to statements in text books on physics a solution of
potassic nitrate is one in which diffusion is not increased and which
is not decomposed by a diaphragm, I conclude from the above results
that the electric current obtained was probably due to greater rapidity
of diffusion at the alternate septums where the heavier liquid was
above than at the others.
    Experiment   2. — In order    to ascertain whether an electric current
 would   be  similarly produced by a different kind of liquid,         I took a
series of thirty-five such elements.          The liquids consisted of a strong
aqueous solution of cupric sulphate freely acidulated with sulphuric
acid, and a mixture of 1^ drachm of the same solution with 65 oz. of
water.    A   somewhat stronger electric current, similar in direction,
was obtained, and probably arose from a similar cause to that in the
previous experiment.
    Experiment 3. — In order to determine whether an alternation of
osmose and diffusion of the two liquids obtained by the presence of a

diaphragm and no diaphragm would also give rise to an electric
current, I charged the whole of the thirty-five glass cups with the
acidulated strong solution of cupric sulphate employed in the last
experiment, and filled all the connecting tubes with the weaker solu
tion used in that experiment, taking care to alternate the ends of the
tubes which were open with those which were closed by a septum, as
in the annexed sketch (fig. 2).      I also employed     as electrodes, moveable

platinum wire of much larger surface, cut from contiguous portions
of the same piece of wire and insulated at their upper parts from the
liquid by means of glass tubing.             By this arrangement a much
stronger electric current was produced than in the previous experi
ments ; but in a reverse direction, viz., from the strong solution up
wards through the diaphragm into the weak one, and from the weak
one down through the meniscus into the strong one.
   Experiment 4. — A similar experiment to No. 3 was now made with
a nearly saturated solution of potassic nitrate and a mixture of half a
drachm of that solution with 34 oz. of water.              The current was the
same in direction as in the last experiment, but more feeble ; and was
strongest at the first contact.
   Experiments 5 and 6. — These experiments were similar to No. 4,
except that (with the hope of obtaining a stronger effect) the whole
of the bent tubes were filled with the solution previous to placing
their ends in the vessels ;* the strengths of the solution of saltpetre
were also somewhat different. The currents obtained were the same
in direction and magnitude as in Experiment No. 4.
   Remarks. — In all these four last experiments, the electric currents
produced by the difference of osmose caused by a porous partition,
were upwards through the diaphragms and opposite in direction to
those produced in Experiments Nos. 1 and 2 by difference of diffusion.
   I have since obtained very much stronger currents, sufficient to
readily send the image off the scale, by means of even a single diffusio-
electric element.

   In the former paper, the author had supposed that by taking a
vessel of    very large horizontal section he should be able to eliminate
the sensible effects of conduction of heat downwards by the sides
of the vessel.        However, considering the important part which
the sides might conceivably play, and the statements in books and
published writings that the conduction of heat downwards in liquids in
the experiments of Despretz and others, was wholly, or almost wholly,
due to conduction by the sides of the containing vessel, it was thought
advisable to put the matter to a direct test.
   A screen of thick cotton material was accordingly placed inside the
cylindrical vessel used in the experiment.              The screen extended all
round, at a little distance from the side, and reached from top to
bottom, and accordingly would arrest currents of convection arising
from heat conducted down the side, if such were sensible.
   Experiments made in March and April, 1880, gave for the con
ductivity of heat by water, in square centims. per second, a mean of
0"00134 without the screen, and 0 00154 with the screen.                        These
numbers, though not in complete agreement, are yet quite of the same
order.     They indicate that no important error is to be feared as the
result of conduction down the walls of the bath. Indeed, the apparent
conducting power of water comes out a little greater with the screen
than without.

   •In a note published in the Report of the British Association for
 1878 (Dublin), and in a fuller paper in the " Transactions of the
 London Mathematical Society," 1879 (vol. x, No. 152), I have given
 the forms of the eighteen, or the twenty-one (as there explained),
 co-ordinates of a conic in space, corresponding, so far as correspond
ence subsists, with the six co-ordinates     of a straight line in space.
And in the same papers I have established the identical relations
between these co-ordinates,       whereby the number of independent
quantities is reduced to eight, as it should be.        In both cases, viz.,
the straight line and the cubic, the co-ordinates are to be obtained by
eliminating the variables in turn from the two equations representing
the line or the conic, and are, in fact, the coefficients of the equations
resulting from the eliminations.
    In the present paper   I  have followed the same procedure for the
case of a cubic curve in space.     Such a curve may, as is well known,
be regarded as the intersection of two quadric surfaces having a
generating line in common ; and the result of the elimination of any
one of the variables from two quadric equations satisfying this con
dition is of the third degree. The number of coefficients so arising is
4 X 10=40 ; but    I have found that these forty quantities may very con
veniently be replaced by forty-eight others, which are henceforward
considered as the co-ordinates of the cubic curve in space. The rela
tion between the forty and the forty-eight co-ordinates is as follows : —

 302                       Prof. F. Holmgren.                    [Jan.  13,
 On examining the equations resulting from the eliminations of the
variables, it turns out that they can be rationally transformed into ex
pressions such as UP'— U'P=0, where TJ and IT are quadrics, and P and
P' linear functions of the variables remaining after the eliminations.
The forty-eight co-ordinates then consist of the twenty-four coeffi
cients of the four functions of the form U (say the U-co-ordinate.«),
together with the twenty-four coefficients of the functions of the form
TJ' (say the U'-co-ordinates), arising from the four eliminations respec
tively : viz., 4x6+4x6=48.           And it will be found that the co
efficients of the forms P, P', are already comprised among those of
U, U' ; so that they do not add to the previous total of forty-eight.
    The number of identical relations established in the present paper
is thirty-four. But it will be observed that the equations UP'— U'P=0
are lineo-linear in the U-co-ordinates and in the U'-co-ordinates ; and
as we are concerned with the ratios only of the coefficients, and not
with their absolute vahxes, we are, in fact, concerned only with the
ratios of the U-oo-ordinates in ter se, and of the U'-co-ordinates inter ee,
and not with their absolute values. Hence the number of independent
 co-ordinates will be reduced to 48—34—2=12, as it should be.
    The thirty-four identical relations arrange themselves firstly in two
sets : one set belonging wholly or principally to the U-co-ordinates,
and the other set wholly or principally to the U'-co-ordinates.          In
each set there are four groups : one of four, one of eight, one single,
and again one of four equations ; seventeen in all.       In the course of
the paper, the two groups of eight are obtained in two forms : first,
by a purely algebraical method in a rational form ; and secondly by a
method partly geometrical and partly algebraical, in an irrational
form.
II.  " How do the Colour-blind See Hie different Colours ? In
       troductory Remarks." By Frithiof Holmgren, Professor
       of Physiology, University, Upsala. Communicated by
       W. Pole, Mus. Doc, F.R.S. Received December 6, 1880.
   That the colour-blind do not see colours in the same way with
normal-eyed persons we may know from the fact that they confuse
rays of objective light which, to the normal eye, give quite different
impressions.
   When, for instance, a red-blind person is confused in his perception
of those different sorts of light that to the normal eye appear as red
and green, we may conclude that he sees them both as one and the
same colour, but not what that colour is, as to its quality — whether it
is one of those just mentioned or a third— and whether, on the latter
supposition,   that colour exists in the colour-system of normal-eyed

1881.]    How do     the    Colour-blind   See the different Colours t     303
persons, say as yellow, or, on the other hand, is a colour of which we
in general have not the slightest conception.
  If  a theory of colour-blindness has for its object to explain the
different links in the chain of causes and effects, of which the first is
the objective light, and the last the subjective perception thereof, we
must first know this last.
   From the points of view of the different theories, different opinions
have   been entertained on this subject, but practical proofs have
hitherto been wanting for them all, and, what is worse, the hope of
ever gaining a solid basis for such proofs has been given up, for the
reason that they must be found in the subjective perception of another
man.
  Since it is impossible for one person to make himself master of that
conception in another, we cannot even objectively prove that all normal-
eyed persons see the different colours in the same way. Still it may be
assumed as an axiom that at least the quality of the different principal
colours is the same for all persons who show the same conception of
colours in general. Else we should not talk of colour, as all spiritual
communication would be impossible between persons whose sensuous
impressions were quite at variance.
  If that axiom is accepted, and we take for granted that all normal-
eyed persons see colours in the same way, as do also the colonr-blind
of the different sorts in their own particular manner, I will endeavour
to show that the question which stands at the head of this article is
not only not impossible to answer, but that I can already give that
answer, furnished with scientific and objectively binding proofs.
   There is apparently but one way to establish such an answer.          A
normal-eyed person must,    while retaining  his own colour-sense, be put
in position to see with a colour-blind eye, and compare the impressions
on that with those on his own normal eye. He cannot use either the one
or the other unless they stand in a living organic communication with
his own brain. He must, so to speak, grow into the colour-blind and
his chromatic sense without losing the use of his own.
   Such a phenomenon, which here is a conditio sine qua non, it is, of
course, impossible to procure in an artificial way ; but still I will show
that an organic combination of a normal and a colour-blind eye with
the same brain is not impossible to be realised in a perfectly natural
manner.
   Congenital colour-blindness is, as i3 known, in most cases inherited,
and inherited according to definite laws.     ( Vide Frithiof Holmgren :
"La Cecite des Couleurs en Suede," p. XIII.) One of these laws      that is,
all the children of the same parents are not afflicted with this defect          ;
some are free. Nor      the colour-blindness of the same degree in those
                       is
affected.   Accordingly     would seem not to be contrary to the laws of
                             it
inheritance  thata person  should be born with one normal eye, while the

304                          Prof. F. Holmgren.                   [Jan.  13,
 other was more or less colour-blind, or that while he was colour-blind
with one eye, the other should be imperfectly so, perhaps in so slight
a manner that it might be called nearly normal.
    Besides the congenital defect, there exists an acquired one, which
does not necessarily affect both eyes at the same time.
    A combination of a normal and an abnormal eye with the same brain
is, as we see, not impossible.     A few such cases have been noticed in
the literature of the subject as curious exceptions, one recently by
Professor Becker, in Heidelberg, which is described by him. Such a
case is what is wanted : a colour-blind person who can make his con
ception of the different colours subjectively clear for a normal-eyed
person, as well as this latter can make the same conception objectively
clear to all other people with normal sight. We have thus a bridge
between the subjective        perception of the colour-blind person and
objective scientific research.
    Led by this idea, 1 have during the last three years looked for cases
of this one-sided colour-blindness in combination with my statistical
researches through Sweden.         The difficulties that formerly were so
enormous, and which have been removed by my method with skeins of
Berlin worsted, were at this trial still greater, from different causes.
In Sweden I had previously only found one case, and this (found in the
summer of 1879) became unhappily useless through an accident.
    Since I succeeded in finding a practical way of lessening those
difficulties, I have, within a comparatively short time (June to October,
 1880), been fortunate enough to examine two such cases, one of one
sided violet-blindness,     and the other (for which I have to thank
Professor Hippel, of Giessen), a case of one-sided red-blindness.
    Experience will probably show that such cases are not so rare as we
have hitherto thought, and we have every reason to hope for a speedy
and perfect solution of the problem in this way ; but the resnlts of
these two cases have been so remarkable that        I will here give a short
 description of them.
    The plan, principle, and result were as follows : —
    First the diagnosis of both eyes was carefully made. In both cases
there was found a perfect, typical, partial colour-blindness on one of
the eyes (the violet-blind on the left, and the red-blind on the right
 eye) ; the other eye had a weak colour-sense, but still so nearly normal
that the principal colours were ascertained with perfect ease. A
 slight hesitation was only shown in distinguishing the lightest and
 darkest shades of those colours.       Both the cases were thus perfectly
 fit for the purpose.
    The principle of the trial was exactly this : — To let the normal eye
 control the perception of the abnormal one, and bring the result into
 a form that was perfectly plain to other normal-sighted persons.
    A one-sided colour-blind person has through his normal eye a per

 1881.]     How do   the Colour-blind  See the  different Colours?     305
 fectly clear conception of the normal-eyed people's different colours,
 and can tell his conception, by the aid of his other eye, for other
 normal-sighted persons.      His definitions are thus — in opposition to
                                     —
 persons colour-blind on both eyes perfectly reliable.
    As words are always less reliable than actions (vide Frithiof

                " De la Cecite des Couleurs dans ses Rapports avec les
 Chemins de Fer et la Marine," p. 116), and a description in this case
 is always inferior to a shown colour, I have in every instance let the
 person in question point out an objective colour with his normal eye
 for every one of his conceptions with his abnormal one.
    Indirectly we find in this way which qualities of perception are
 wanting in the abnormal eye in comparison with the normal one. The
 same result is directly arrived at by letting the colour-blind eye control
the subjective perception of the normal.
    It is my intention to explain the application of this principle in my
more detailed work on this subject, as well as the particulars of the
result.
    I will now only give the chief points of this result, which perhaps
is done   in the shortest and easiest way by giving the details of the
colour-blind person's subjective spectrum.       If we take the objective
solar spectrum for a starting point, and choose our own definition of
the different colours from the subjective spectrum of the normal eye,
we come to the following results : —
    As we have long supposed, for good reasons, a colour-blind person
sees  only two colours in the spectrum.      These are bis two subjective
principal colours.
    The principal colours in the spectrum of a violet-blind person are, as
to their fundamental tone, red and green. Towards the red end his
spectrum has quite the same extension as that of a normal-eyed person,
and is thus, in comparison with the latter, " unshortened." Reckoned
from the red end, his first fundamental colour stretches over that part
of the spectrum which is generally seen as red, orange, and yellow.
First in the yellowish-green (a little on the other side of Fraunhofer's
line D) he sees a narrow, uncolonred (" paper-white ") belt, from
which his other colour, green, commences, and is continued with at
first more and more saturated, and afterwards darker and darker
shades, over the place where we see green, greenish-blue, cyan-blue, and
indigo to the commencement of the violet, where his spectrum abso
lutely ends with a sharp limit (about Fraunhofer's line G). His
spectrum     is thus at this end considerably " shortened."       The fact
that violet-blind persons confuse the pigment colours (such as green
and blue, purple and red, orange and yellow, violet and yellowish-green
and grey) is thus explained of itself.
   All this is in the main consistent with the Young- Helmholtz theory.
Respecting the tone of the violet-blind person's subjective funda

306     How do      the  Colour-Mind See    the  different Colours ?
                                                                     [Jan.   13,
mental     colours,   it may  be said  that his red is not quite identical with
the common spectral red of the normal-eyed (something like cinnabar;,
but rather a clearer red, having a shade of carmine, about the same as
the red towards the end of the subjective spectrum of the normal-eyed.
His other fundamental colour, green, is also a clear green that for the
normal eye has a shade of blue in it.
    The two principal colours in the spectrum for the red-blind are as to
their fundamental tone yellow and blue.              This yellow commences a
little later, reckoned from the end, than the red of the normal-eyed
(about Frannhofer's line C), and stretches over the rest of the red,
orange,    yellow,   yellowish- green,  and ends   in the blue-green (between
Fraunhofer's lines b and F, nearer to the latter), where a narrow,
neutral, colourless belt forms the limit against the other principal
colour, blue, which stretches through the remaining part of the spec-
trnm, corresponding with our cyan-blue, indigo, and violet. At this end
              "
there is no shortening." The red-blind person's confusing of pigment-
colours (green and yellow, orange and red, purple and blue and violet
red and blue-green and grey) is equally well explained by this.
    All this, as we see, is objectively taken in perfect accordance with
the Young- Helmholtz theory.             Regarded from a subjective point of
view, we should perhaps have expected green instead of yellow as one
of the fundamental colours. But that yellow, and not green, is
that colour (as I have already for some time supposed, vide Upsala
 " Lakareforenings Forhandlingar," vol. vii, 1871,                        " Cen-
                                                            p. 119, and
tralblatt f. d. med. Wissenschaften," 1872, p. 826) does not shake
the basis of that theory, as is shown by Fick (" Znr Theorie der
Farbenblindheit,"         1873) and by myself (" Om Fargblindhetens
Theori," 1878). Besides, the tone of the red-blind person's first
fundamental colour is not perfectly golden-yellow, but seems for the
normal eye to have a shade of greenish-yellow, perhaps best defined
as citron-yellow in the lighter, and as olive-green in the darker, shades.
His other fundamental colour does not seem to be purely cyan-blue or
indigo, but is rather a blue with a perceptible shade of violet. It
might be called indigo-violet.
    Perfect clearness in the theory will not perhaps be gained nntil we
shall have had opportunity of studying more cases of different kinds
and degrees, and especially a case of typical perfect green-blindness.
    Still the path is opened, and a more definite starting-point has been
found for the treatment of the theoretical problem of colour-blindness,
of which it is my intention to speak more explicitly in my larger work
on the same subject.

III.   "Action of an Intermittent Beam of Radiant Heat upon
       Gaseous Matter."          By John Tyndall, F.R.S. Received
       January    3,  1881.
    The Royal Society has already done me the honour of publishing a
long series of memoirs on the interaction of radiant heat and gaseous
matter. These memoirs did not escape criticism.              Distinguished men,
among whom the late Professor Magnus and the late Professor Buff
may be more specially mentioned, examined my experiments, and
arrived at results different from mine. Living workers of merit have
also taken up the question : the latest of whom,* while justly re
cognising the extreme difficulty of the subject, and while verifying,
so far as their experiments        reach, what     I  had published regarding
dry gases, find me to have fallen into what they consider grave
errors in my treatment of vapours.
   None of these investigators appear to me to have realised the true
strength of my position in its relation to the objects I had in view.
Occupied for the most part with details, they have failed to recognise
the stringency of my work as a whole, and have not taken into account
the independent support rendered by the various parts of the investi
gation to each other.         They thus ignore verifications, both general
and special, which are to me of conclusive force.                   Nevertheless,
thinking it due to them and me to submit the questions at issue to
a fresh examination, I resumed, some time ago, the threads of the
inquiry.     The results shall, in due time, be communicated                to the
Royal Society ;     but,  meanwhile,    I  would   ask  permission     to bring to
the notice of the Fellows a novel mode of testing the relations of
radiant heat to gaseous matter, whereby singularly instructive effects
have been obtained.
   After working for some time with the thermopile and galvanometer,
it occurred to    me    several weeks ago that the results thus obtained
might be checked by a more direct and simple form of experiment.
Placing the gases and vapours in diathermanous bulbs, and exposing
the bulbs to the action of radiant heat, the heat absorbed by different
gases and vapours ought,         I  considered, to be rendered evident by
ordinary expansion.        I devised an apparatus with a view of testing
this idea. But, at this point, and before my proposed gas- thermometer
was constructed,     I became acquainted with the ingenious and original
experiments of Mr. Graham Bell, wherein musical sounds are obtained
through the action of an intermittent beam of light upon solid bodies.

                     I
   From the first, entertained the opinion that these singular sounds
were caused by rapid changes of temperature, producing correspond
ing changes of shape and volume in the bodies impinged upon by the
beam.    But if this be the case, and if gases and vapours really absorb
radiant heat, they ought to produce sounds more intense than those
obtainable from solids.      I
                            pictured every stroke of the beam responded
to by a sudden expansion of the absorbent gas, and concluded that
when the pulses thus excited followed each other with sufficient
rapidity, a musical note must be the result. It seemed plain, more
over, that by this new method many of my previous results might be
brought to an independent test.         Highly diathermanous bodies, I
reasoned, would produce faint sounds, while highly athermanous
bodies would produce loud sounds ; the strength of the sound being,
in a sense, a measure of the absorption. The first experiment made, with
a view of testing this idea, was executed in the presence of Mr.
Graham Bell ;* and the result was in exact accordance with what I
had foreseen.
   The inquiry has been recently extended so as to embrace most of
the gases and vapours employed in my former researches.           My first
source of rays was a Siemens' lamp connected with a dynamo-machine,
worked by a gas engine.     A glass lens was used to concentrate the rays,
and afterwards two lenses. By the first the rays were rendered parallel,
while tho second caused them to converge to a point about 7 inches
distant from the lens. A circle of sheet zinc provided first with
radial slits and afterwards with teeth and interspaces, cnt through                 it,
was mounted vertically on a whirling table, and caused to rotate
rapidly across the beam near the focus. The passage of the slits
produced the desired intermittence,t while a flask containing the gas
or vapour to be examined received the shocks of the beam immediately
behind the rotating disk.    From the flask a tube of india-rubber, end
ing in a tapering one of ivory or box wood, led to the ear, which was
thus rendered keenly sensitive to any sound generated within the flask.
Compared with the beautiful apparatus of Mr. Graham Bell, the
arrangement here described       rude
                                   is      is, however, very effective.

 t   When the disk rotates the individual slits disappear, forming       a   hazy zone
through which objects are risible.    Throwing by the clean hand, or better still by
white paper, the beam back upon the disk,   itappears to stand still, the slits forming
so many   dark rectangles. The reason     is obvious, but the experiment     a very

    With this arrangement the number of sounding gases and vapours
was rapidly increased.         But I was soon made aware that the glass
lenses withdrew from the beam its most effectual rays.                The silvered
mirrors employed in my previous researches were therefore invoked ;
and with them, acting sometimes singly and sometimes as conjugate
mirrors, the curious and striking results which I have now the honour
to submit to the Society were obtained.
     Sulphuric ether, formic ether, and acetic ether being placed in
bulbous flasks,* their vapours were soon diffused in the air above
the liquid.       On placing these flasks, whose bottoms only were covered
by the liquid, behind the rotating disk, so that the intermittent beam
passed through the vapour, loud musical tones were in each case
obtained.       These are known to be the most highly absorbent vapours
which "toy experiments revealed. Chloroform and bisulphide of carbon,
on the other hand, are known to be the least absorbent, the latter
standing near the head of diathermanous vapours.                  The sounds ex
tracted from these two substances were usually weak and sometimes
barely audible, being more feeble with the bisulphide than with the
 chloroform. With regard to the vapours of amylene, iodide of ethyl,
iodide of methyl and benzol, other things being equal, their power to
produce musical tones appeared to be accurately expressed by their
ability to absorb radiant heat.
     It is the vapour, and not the liquid, that is effective in producing
 the sounds.        Taking, for example, the bottles in which my volatile
 substances are habitually kept, I permitted the intermittent beam to
 impinge upon the liquid in each of them. No sound was in any case
 produced, while the moment the vapour-laden space above an active
 liquid was traversed by the beam, musical tones made themselves
 audible.
     A rocksalt cell filled entirely with a volatile liquid, and subjected to
 the intermittent beam, produced no sound. This cell was circular
 and closed at the top.         Once, while operating with a highly ather-
 manous substance, a distinct musical note was heard.                On examining
 the cell, however, a small bubble was found at its top.               The bubble
 was less than a quarter of an inch in diameter, but still sufficient to
 produce audible sounds.          When the cell was completely filled, the
 sounds disappeared.
     It is hardly necessary to state that the pitch of the note obtained in
 each case is determined by the velocity of rotation.            It is the same as
 that produced by blowing against the rotating disk and allowing its
 slits to act like the perforations of a syren.
     * I have employed flasks measuring from 8 inches to Jths of an inch in diameter.
 The   smallest  flask, which had a stem with a bore of about Jth of an inch in
 diameter, yielded better effects than the largest. Flasks from 2 to 3 inches in
  diameter yield good results. Ordinary test-tubes also answer well.

    Thus,     aa  regards vapours, prevision has been justified by experi
ment.       I now turn to gases. A small flask, after having been heated
in the spirit-lamp so as to detach all moisture from its sides, was care
fully filled with dried air. Placed in the intermittent beam it yielded
a musical note, but so feeble as to be heard only with attention.               Dry
oxygen and hydrogen behaved like dry air. This agrees with my
former experiments, which assigned a hardly sensible absorption to
these gases.        "When the dry air was displaced by carbonic acid, the
sound      was  far louder than that obtained from any of the elementary
gases.      When the carbonic acid was displaced by nitrous oxide, the
sound was much more forcible still, and when the nitrous oxide was dis
 placed by olefiant gas, it gave birth to a musical note which, when the
 beam was in good condition, and the bulb well chosen, seemed as loud
 as that of an ordinary organ pipe.*           We have here the exact order in
 which my former experiments proved these gases to stand as absorbers
 of radiant heat. The amount of the absorption and the intensity of
 the sound go hand in hand.
     A soap bubble blown with nitrous oxide, or olefiant gas, and exposed
 to the intermittent beam, produced no sound, no matter how its size
 might be varied.          The pulses obviously expended themselves upon
 the flexible envelope, which transferred them to the air outside.
     But a film thus impressionable to impulses on its interior surface,
 must prove at least equally sensible to sonorous waves impinging on
 it from without. Hence, I inferred, the eminent suitability of soap
                                             "
 bubbles for sound lenses. Placing a sensitive flame" some feet distant
 from a small sounding reed, the pressure was so arranged that the
 flame burnt tranquilly.          A bubble of nitrous oxide (sp. gr. P527)
 was then blown, and placed in front of the reed.                    The flame im
 mediately fell and roared, and continued agitated as long as the lens
 remained in position.         A pendulous motion could be imparted to the
  bubble, so as to cause it to pass to and fro in front of the reed.              The
  flame responded, by alternately roaring and becoming tranquil, to
  every swing of the bubble.            Nitrous oxide is far better for this
  experiment      than  carbonic  acid, which speedily ruins its envelope.
     The pressure was altered so as to throw the flame, when the reed
  sounded, into violent agitation. A bubble blown with hydrogen (sp.
  gr. 0'069) being placed in front of the reed, the flame was immediately
  stilled. The ear answers instead of the flame.
      In   1859  I proved   gaseous ammonia to be extremely impervious to
  radiant heat. My interest in its deportment when subjected to this
  novel test was therefore great.          Placing a small quantity of liquid
  ammonia       in one of the flasks, and warming the liquid Blightly,             the

intermittent beam was sent through the space above the liquid.    A
loud musical note was immediately produced.  By the proper applica
tion of heat to a liquid the sounds may be always intensified. The
ordinary temperature, however, suffices in all the cases thus far
referred to.
  In this relation the vapour of water was that which interested me
most, and as  I could not hope that at ordinary temperatures it existed
in sufficient amount to produce audible tones, I heated a small quantity
of water in a flask almost up to its boiling-point.   Placed in the inter
mittent beam, I heard -I avow with delight a powerful musical
                         —                          —
sound produced by the aqueous vapour.
  Small wreaths of haze, produced by the partial condensation of the
vapour in the upper and cooler air of the flask, were, however, visible
in this experiment ; and it was necessary to prove that this haze was
not the cause of the sound.       The flask was, therefore, heated by a
spirit-flame beyond the temperature of boiling water.         The closest
scrutiny by     a condensed  beam   of light then   revealed no   trace of
cloudiness above the liquid.      From the perfectly invisible vapour,
however, the musical sound issued, if anything, more forcible than
before.    I placed the flask in cold water until its temperature was
reduced from about 90° to 10° C, fully expecting that the sound
would vanish at this temperature ; but, notwithstanding the tenuity of
the vapour, the sound extracted from it was not only distinct but loud.
   Three empty flasks, filled with ordinary air, were placed in a freezing
mixture for a quarter of an hour. On being rapidly transferred to the
intermittent beam, sounds much louder than those obtainable from dry
air were produced.
   Warming these flasks in the flame of a spirit-lamp until all visible
humidity had been removed, and afterwards urging dried air through
them, on being placed in the intermittent beam the sound in each case
was found to have fallen almost to silence.
   Sending, by means of a glass tube, a puff of breath from the lungs
into a dried flask, the power of emitting sound was immediately
restored.
   When, instead of breathing into   a dry flask, the common air of the
laboratory was urged through       it,     sounds became immediately
                                         the
intensified.I   was by no means prepared for the extraordinary delicacy
of this new method of testing the athermancy and diathermancy of
gases and vapours, and  it cannot be otherwise than satisfactory to me
to find that particular vapour, whose alleged deportment towards
radiant heat has been so strenuously denied, affirming thus audibly its
true character.
   After what has been stated regarding aqueous vapour, we are pre
pared for the fact that an exceedingly small percentage of any highly
athermanous gas diffused in air suffices to exalt the sounds.  An acci-

312      Prof. Tyndall.       Action    of an Intermittent Beam         [Jan.      13,
 dental observation will illustrate this point. A flask was filled with
 coal-gas and held bottom upwards in the intermittent beam.            The
 sounds produced were of a force corresponding to the known absorp
 tive energy of coal-gas.    The flask was then placed upright, with its
 mouth open upon a table, and permitted to remain there for nearly an
 hour. On being restored to the beam, the sounds produced were far
louder than those which could be obtained from common air.*
    Transferring a small flask or a test-tube from a cold place to the
intermittent beam, it is sometimes found to be practically silent for a
 moment, after which the sounds become distinctly audible. This I
take to be due to the vaporisation by the calorific beam of the thin
film of moisture adherent to the glass.
    My previous experiments having satisfied me of the generality of
the rale that volatile liquids and their vapours absorb the same
rays, I thought it probable that the introduction of a thin layer of ite
liquid, even in the case of a most energetic vapour, would detach
the effective rays, and thus quench the sounds.         The experiment was
made, and the conclusion verified.         A layer of water, formic ether,
sulphuric   ether, or acetic ether, £th  of an inch in thickness, rendered
the transmitted beam powerless to produce any musical sound.         These
liquids being transparent    to light, the efficient rays which they inter
cepted must have been those of obscure heat.
    A layer of bisulphide of carbon about ten times the thickness of
(he transparent layers just referred to, and rendered opaque to light by
dissolved iodine, was interposed in the path of the intermittent beam.
It produced hardly any diminution of the sounds of the more active
vapours — a further proof that it is the invisible heat rays, to which the
solution of iodine is so eminently transparent, that are here effectual.
    Converting one of the small flasks used in the foregoing experi
ments into a thermometer bulb, and filling it with various gases in
succession, it was found that with those gases which yielded a feeble
sound, the displacement of a thermometric column associated with the
bulb was slow and feeble, while with those gases which yielded loud
sounds, the displacement was prompt and forcible.

    All  the results described  in my first note have been obtained in a
very energetic form with a battery of sixty Grove's cells.
    On the 4th of January I chose for my source of rays a powerful
lime-light, which, when sufficient care is taken to prevent the pitting
of the cylinder, works with admirable steadiness and without any
noise.     I also changed my mirror for one of shorter focus, which
permitted a nearer approach to the source of rays. Tested with this
new reflector the stronger vapours          rose remarkably in sounding
power.
    Improved manipulation was, I considered, sure to extract sounds
from rays of much more moderate intensity than those of the lime
light.     For this light, therefore, a common candle flame was sub
stituted.    Received and thrown back by the mirror, the radiant heat
of the candle produced audible tones in all the stronger vapours
   Abandoning the mirror and bringing the candle close to the
rotating disk, its direct rays produced audible sounds.
    A red-hot coal, taken from the fire and held close to the rotating
disk, produced forcible sounds in a flask at the other side.
   A red-hot poker, placed in the position previously occupied by the
coal, produced strong sounds.          Maintaining the flask in position
behind the rotating disk, amusing alternations of sound and silence
accompanied the alternate introduction and removal of the poker.
   The temperature of the iron was then lowered till its heat just
ceased to be visible.    The intermittent invisible rays produced audible
sounds.
    The temperature was gradually lowered, being accompanied by a
gradual and continuous diminution of the sonnd.        When it ceased to
be audible the temperature      of  the poker was found to be below that
of  boiling water.
   As might be expected from the foregoing experiments, an incandes
cent platinum spiral, with or without the mirror, produced musical
sonnds.     When the battery power was reduced from ten cells to three,
the sounds, though enfeebled, were still distinct.
   My neglect of aqueous vapour had led me for a time astray in 1859,
but bffore publishing my results I had discovered my error. On the
present occasion this omnipresent substance had also to be reckoned
with. Fourteen flasks of various sizes, with their bottoms covered
with a little sulphuric acid, were closed with ordinary corks and per
mitted to remain in the laboratory from the 23rd of December to the
4th of January.     Tested on the latter day with the intermittent beam,
half of them emitted feeble sounds, but half were silent. The sounds
were undoubtedly due, not to dry air, but to traces of aqueous
vapour.
   An ordinary bottle, containing sulphuric acid for laboratory pur
poses, being connected     with the ear and placed in the intermittent

beam, emitted a faint, but distinct, musical sound.               This bottle had
been opened    two or three times during the day, its dryness being thus
 vitiated by the mixture of a small quantity of commpn air. A second
 similar bottle, in which sulphuric acid had stood uudisturbed for some
 days, was placed in the beam : the dry air above the liquid proved
absolutely silent.
    On the evening of January the 7th Professor Dewar handed me four
 flasks treated in the following manner.     Into one was poured a small
quantity of strong sulphuric acid ; into another a small quantity of
Nordhausen sulphuric acid ; in a third were placed some fragments of
fused chloride of calcium ; while the fourth contained a small quantity of
phosphoric anhydride. They were closed with well fitting india-rubber
stoppers, and permitted to remain undisturbed throughout the night.
Tested after twelve hours, each of them emitted a feeble sound, the
flask Inst mentioned being the strongest.     Tested again six hours later
the sound had disappeared from three of the flasks, that containing the
phosphoric anhydride alone remaining musical.
    Breathing into a flask partially filled with sulphuric acid instantly
restores the sounding power, which continues for a considerable time.
The wetting of the interior surface of the flask with the sulphuric
acid always enfeebles, and sometimes destroys the sound.
    A bulb, less than a cubic inch in volume, and containing a little
water, lowered to the temperature of melting ice, produces very
distinct sounds.    Warming the water in the flame of a spirit lamp,
the sound becomes greatly augmented in strength.           At the boiling
temperature the sound emitted by this small bulb* is of extraordinary
intensity.
    These results are in accord with those obtained by me nearly
nineteen years ago, both in reference to air and to aqueous vapour.
They are in utter disaccord with those obtained by other experi
menters, who have ascribed a high absorption to air and none to
aqueous vapour.
   The action of aqueous vapour being thus revealed, the necessity of
thoroughly drying the flasks, when testing other substances, becomes
obvious.    The following plan has been found effective.      Each flask is
first heated in the flame of a spirit-lamp till every visible trace of in
ternal moisture has disappeared, and it is afterwards raised to a tem
perature of about 400° C.      While the flask is still hot, a glass tube is
introduced into     it,
                     and air freed from carbonic acid by caustic potash,
and from aqueous vapour by sulphuric acid,        urged through the flask
                                                    is

made, dry air proves as incompetent to produce sound as to absorb
radiant heat.
  In     18C8,    I   determinedabsorptions of a great number of
                                    the
liquids whose vapours         I
                          did not examine.   My experiments having
amply proved   the parallelism of liquid and vaporous absorption, I
held undoubtingly twelve years ago that the vapour of cyanide of
ethyl and of acetic acid would prove powerfully absorbent.      This
conclusion is now easily tested. A small quantity of either of these
substances, placed in a bulb a cubic inch in volume, warmed, and
exposed to the intermittent beam, emits a sound of extraordinary
power.
  I also tried to extract sounds from perfumes, which    had proved      I
in 1861 to be absorbers of radiant heat.              I
                                            limit myself here to the
vapours of pachouli and cassia, the former exercising a measured
absorption of 30, and the latter an absorption of 109. Placed in dried
flasks, and slightly warmed, sounds were obtained from both these
substances, but the sound of cassia was much louder than that of
pachouli.
  Many years ago         I bad    proved   tetrachloride of carbon to be highly
diathermanous.          Its sounding power is         as   feeble   as   its absorbent
power.
  In relation to colliery explosions,           thedeportment  of marsh-gas
was of special interest.          Professor Dewar was good enough to furnish
me with a pure sample of this gas. The sounds produced by                         it,   when
exposed to the intermittent beam, were very powerful.
   Chloride of methyl, a liquid which boils at the ordinary temperature
of the air, was poured into    small flask, and permitted to displace the
                                   a
air within it. Exposed to the intermittent beam, its sound was similar
in power to that of marsh-gas.
   The specific gravity of marsh-gas being about half that of air,                        it
might be expected that the flask containing          when left open and
                                                            it,
erect, would soon get   rid of  its contents.  This, however, is not the
case.   After a considerable interval, the film of this gas clinging to
the interior surface of the flask was able to produce sounds of great
power.
   A small quantity of liquid bromine being poured into well-dried           a
flask, the brown vapour rapidly diffused itself in the air above the
liquid. Placed in the intermittent beam,    somewhat forcible sound
                                                      a
was produced.          This might seem to militate against my former                     ex
periments,       which assigned    low absorptive power to bromine
                                    a very
vapour.      But my former experimentson this vapour were conducted
with obscure heat; whereas, in the present instance,     had to dealI
with  the radiation from incandescent  lime, whose  heat  is, in part,
luminous. Now the colour of the bromine vapour proves         to be an       it

energetic absorber of the luminous rays ; and to them, when suddenly
converted into thermometric heat iu the body of the vapour,              I thought
 the sounds might be due.
    Between the flask containing the bromine and the rotating disk,                I
therefore placed an empty glass cell : the sounds continued.                 I then
filled the cell with transparent bisulphide of carbon : the sounds still
continued.      For the transparent bisulphide I then substituted the
same liquid saturated with dissolved iodine. This solution cut off the
light, while allowing the rays of heat free transmission : the sounds
were immediately stilled.
    Iodine vaporised by heat in a small flask, yielded a forcible sound,
which was not sensibly affected by the interposition of transparent
bisulphide of carbon, but which was completely quelled by the iodine
solution.    It might indeed have been foreseen, that the rays trans
mitted by the iodine as a liquid, would also be transmitted by its
vapour, and thus fail to be converted into sound.*
    To complete the argument : — While the flask containing the
bromine vapour was sounding in the intermittent beam, a strong
solution of alum was interposed between it and the rotating disk.
There was no sensible abatement of the sounds with either bromine
or iodine vapour.
    In these experiments the rays from the lime-light were converged
to a point a little beyond the rotating disk.          In the next experiment
they   were   rendered  parallel by     the   mirror,  and afterwards rendered
convergent by a lens of ice.        At the focus of the ice-lens the sounds
were extracted from both bromine and iodine vapour.                  Sounds were
also produced after the beam had been sent through the alum solution
and the ice-lens conjointly.
    With a very rude arrangement          I have been able to hear the sounds
of the more active vapours       at a  distance   of 100 feet from the source
of rays.
    Several vapours other than those mentioned in this abstract have
been examined, and sounds obtained from all of them.                 The vapours
of all compound liquids will,        I  doubt not, be found sonorous in the
intermittent beam.      And,   as  I question whether there is      an absolutely
diathermanous     substance in    nature, I think it probable       that even the
vapours    of  elementary   bodies, including the elementary gases, when
more strictly examined, will be found capable of producing sounds.

 resembling a tobacco-pipe, had its mouth closed by such a film, while
 its open stem was connected with a sounding flask.     I did not succeed
 in producing any visible agitation. When the film was uniformly
 illuminated, or when it had become thin enough to produce iridescent
 colours, on holding a high-pitched tuning-fork near the open end of
 the stem, the whole surface of the film was immediately covered with

       Gravimeter designed by the late J. Allan Broun, F.R.S."
       By Major J. Hersciiel, R.E., F.R.S., Deputy-Superintendent
       of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Received

    In  the course  of 1878-9 some correspondence        passed between
Major-General Walker, the Surveyor-General of India, and the late
Mr. Broun, on the subject of an instrument designed by the latter, the
fate of which General Walker was desirous of learning.       Interrupted
by the death of Mr. Broun, General Walker requested the Director-
General of Stores for India to inquire if the instrument could be pro
cured for the Indian Government. It had meanwhile become the
property of the Royal Society. In order to comply with the Surveyor-
General's intention, the loan of the instrument was then obtained
from this Society, and it was placed in the hands of the author of this
paper to examine and report upon.
    The paper consists mainly of a narrative account of the examina
tion, and the conclusions to which he has been led regarding instru
ments of this class.

b!8               Major    J. Herschel.    On Gravimeteis.         [Jan.  20,
    A very similar, if  not identical, design having been published in the
 "            Bendus"   of  the Paris Academy, by the late M. Babinet, the
    Comptes
 author contributes to the history of the subject some letters written
 by Babinet anterior to the said publication, with the object of showing
 the concurrent identity and independence of the two designs.
    The principle on which the bathometer of Dr. Siemens appears to
 be constructed    is then considered.     Although intended to measure
sea-depths, and on that account called a bathometer, it is none the
less a gravimeter in principle, and its construction, when properly
understood, reminds one forcibly of the typical form as originally
proposed, by way of illustration, by Sir John Herschel in the
                                                                       " Out
lines of Astronomy."        The indications of the bathometer, it should be
said, are only to be interpreted empirically.
    The principle on which the gravimeters of Broun and Babinet are
                                                  "
designed is thus emphasized by the latter : — Ce qui distingue surtoufc
ma methode, c'est le fractionnement de la pesanteur, de maniere a
equilibrer l'effet d'un poids considerable, par la torsion d'un fil me-
tallique de force moyenne, et restant dans les limites de l'elasticite
parfaite."
    It is doubtful whether Babinet's conception ever took practical
form as an actually constructed instrument ; at any rate, no published
record of its performance exists. Broun's design, on the other hand,
after many vicissitudes, took the shape of the instrument now under
consideration.     It was made for him by Miiller of Stuttgart, who
appears    to  have  taken extraordinary pains to give effect to the in
tentions of the designer.
    Mr. Broun exhibited his gravimeter in the Loan Collection of
 Scientific Instruments at South Kensington, in 1876, where it was
 placed alongside of Dr. Siemens' bathometer.           A description of it
 appeared in the catalogue, corrected by himself, but it is faulty and in
 adequate, owing to the declining health of the owner having prevented
 his acquiring a practical acquaintance with his instrument ; nor was
 lie able to do so up to the time of his death.      It was, therefore, with
the very scantiest       preparation that the present examination was
undertaken.
    The principle of Broun 's gravimeter is easily understood, but the
manipulation of the instrument is so troublesome that it is more than
doubtful whether in its present form results of any practical value
could be obtained with it. The various grounds for this opinion are
explained in the course of the report. As a fact, no observations, such
as were naturally desired to test its sensitiveness, could by any means
be obtained, owing to a radical defect of construction, which the
maker has unfortunately failed in overcoming, although special atten
tion has been bestowed upon the point.              To explain this, some
description of the instrument is unavoidable.

    If a heavy   bar  be suspended by  two parallel inelastic lines, the force
 which is exerted when the position of rest has been quitted varies, in
 all positions, as the force of gravity at the time : if the angle of dis
 turbance and all other attendant circumstances be strictly the same,
 the proportion between the vertical and horizontal forces is constant ;
 and if the suspending lines are long, as compared with their distance
 apart, this constant is a small fraction.      This is " le fractionnement
                    "
  de la pesantenr      of which Babinet speaks. We are to regard the
 horizontal force as representing gravity and varying with it, at
 different times or places. Now, if the suspension had been by a single
 instead of a double line, and that elastic, the horizontal force exerted
 in consequence of disturbance would have been independent of the
 weight of the bar, and therefore also of variation of gravity.             It
 would be a constant force, as far as gravity is concerned.
    In the torsion gravimeter these two kinds of suspension are com
 bined — the constant being adjusted so as to balance exactly the in
 constant force, by the addition or subtraction of a minute subsidiary
 weight to the primary weight carried by the double lines.
    It would be difficult to explain briefly the mechanism by which the
 condition of equilibrium is ascertained to be perfectly secured :
 enough has been said to render the source of failure intelligible.
    Success must evidently depend on constancy in the force exerted by
 the single wire ; and this on the fixity of attachment of the ends of
 the same.     It appeared by repeated trials and experiments of different
 kinds that this attachment was faulty : further experiments, having
 for their object to remedy the defect, proved unavailing ; and at last
 the attempt — and with it the intended trial of the instrument as a
 gravimeter — was abandoned, as under the circumstances hopeless.
    Unsatisfactory as this result undoubtedly is — especially for the
 credit of so developed an instrument — the inquiry has not been
entirely barren of useful result. The theory of the machine had not
 been fully considered, and at least one important point would seem to
 have escaped recognition altogether.      There is reason to think that
had it been seen that the double suspending lines must practically
perform a function precisely similar to that for which the single wire
is provided, the latter would have been dispensed with.            It is true
that this implies not only other modifications of design but also the
further recognition of the part actually played by the torsion of the
double wires, of which no sign appears in anything that has yet been
published about it. Bat it is scarcely doing violence to the ingenuity
which developed a complicated machine to suppose that it would have
seized upon and utilised a mode of simplification had attention been
directed to it.
   The simplification to which allusion is here made, has been brought
to the notice of the Society in a previous paper.

   In  some other respects also, the examination, may be said to have
borne fruit: for occasion was taken to determine the weights and
 dimensions of parts, and to show the degree of accuracy which might
 be looked for in such an instrument, supposing it capable of fulfilling
its intended purpose.      Some defects of construction also of a general
 character have been pointed out which may serve as hints to future
constructors.
   It should be said in conclusion, that so much of the present paper as
deals with Broun's gravimeter in particular, was prepared and sub
mitted as a report in the first instance, to the India Office, and that it
 was communicated      to the Society for publication, by permission of
the Secretary of State for India in Conncil.      What may be called the
historical part    was  subsequently added, by way of introduction, to
make it more worthy of that honour.
II. "Experimental          Researches into Electric Distribution as
       manifested by that of the Radicles of Electrolytes."             By
       Alfred Tribe, F.I.O., Lecturer on Chemistry in Dulwich
       College. Communicated by Dr. Gladstone, F.R.S.                  Re
       ceived December 15, 1880.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The paper is divided into three principal parts ; the distribution of
the ions of copper sulphate on silver plates ; analogies between the
distribution of ions and that of static electricity ; and analysis of
electrolytic fields.
   When a solution       of copper sulphate is electrolysed   with silver
electrodes, the negative electrode becomes covered with a deposit of
copper, the positive with a coating of silver peroxide.       The author
has shown that if a metallic rod or plate is placed lengthwise between
the electrodes in a liquid undergoing electrolysis, the plate does work
identical in kind with that being done by both electrodes.      It follows
that a silver plate in copper sulphate will be found coated on one part
with copper, and on the other with silver peroxide.        The superficial
distributions of these ions were examined.      A rectangular electrolytic
cell, a solution of copper sulphate, and copper electrodes were employed.
The electrodes were of the same breadth and depth as the cell. In
the centre of the liquid, lengthwise and perpendicular to the electrodes,
a plate of thin sheet silver was fixed.
   In all cases the distributions of the two ions on the plates or even
on bodies of various other shapes, were invariably unsymmetrical, the
negative ion generally spreading further than the positive. The dis

  tributions are the same when the experiment is begun with a plate
 covered with either ion, or when the action is continued for a longer
 time.    But a change in the strength of solution, or in temperature, or
 in strength of current alters the distributions.          Speaking generally,
 there is an increase in the range of the positive ion with increase of
 temperature, increase of current strength, and decrease in strength of
 solution ; while the range of the negative ion decreases with increase
 of temperature, increases to a certain extent with increase of current,
 and varies irregularly in the case of change in the strength of solu
 tion.
     The mutual influence of plates, end to end and side by side, th«
 distribution on open tubes, and on plates encircled by them or copper
 gauze, show general analogies with what is known of the action of
 static electricity.
     As long as the plates are perpendicular to the electrodes, the distri
 butions of one ion on the two sides is the same, but when the plate
 forms an angle with a line joining the electrodes, this no longer holds
 true, and the boundary lines of the same ion become markedly concave
 on one side and convex on the other.
     With plates parallel to the electrodes, hardly any action took place
 until the shape of the plate was altered, and it is shown that the
 relation between the length and breadth of a plate of given area has
 a very material effect in determining the accumulation and distribution.
 And it was also found that the surface of a plate in this position for a
 measurable distance from its edges, and still more from its angular
 projections, shows no signs of electrification even when the body of
 the plate does so to a sensible degree.         These results afford a new
 basis for investigating the field of electrolytic action both as regards
 physical differences and the relative direction in which the action is
 transmitted.
     With electrodes of the same breadth and depth as the cell, the
same distributions were obtained in different parts of the field of
action, but when the electrodes were not of the same breadth and
depth as the cell, differences were obtained in absolutely corresponding
parts of the field.         These differences increased as the electrodes
became narrower.         It  is evident  that the smaller electrodes give       a
non-homogeneous       field.
     The distributions    are altered   by the interposition of an ebonite
screen between an electrode and an analysing plate even in a field
otherwise homogeneous, and some instances of this are given. Analogies
are found between       the effect of these screens and that produced by
diminishing    the  size  of the electrodes.
    The distributions are divisible into two classes — parallel and non-
parallel. The first class includes all cases which show            a  similarity
in the distribution on the two sides of the analysing plate       ;  the second

class, all coses which show a difference       in the configuration of the
boundaries    on the two sides of the plate.    All the distributions in the
experiments with different temperatures, strengths of solution and of
current, belong to the first class ; also those distributions obtained in
the non-homogeneous       fields, and with ebonite screens.
    On analysing a non-homogeneous field of larger dimensions, parallel
distributions were obtained all along a line running between the
electrodes, as well as along a central line at right angles to this. But
for some distance from the electrodes at the ends, the plates showed
non-parallel distributions.

method, and tho permanent form of the self-recorded results, and
indicates the direction in which it is desirable to extend the research.

       Satellites, and on the Evolution of the Solar System."              By
       G. H. Darwin, F.R.S. Received December 27, 1880.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The first part of the paper contains the investigation of the changes
produced by tidal friction in a system consisting of a planet with any
number of satellites revolving round it in circular orbits. The planet's
equator and the satellites' orbits are all supposed to be in one plane.
The planet is formed of homogeneous viscous fluid, but a large part of
the results, due to the particular sort of tidal friction which arises in this
special ease, would be equally true under a more general hypothesis as
to the nature of the planet. The mutual perturbations of the satellites
are neglected, so that only the rotation of the planet and the distances
of the satellites have to be considered.
    It is then proved that if E be the whole energy, both kinetic and
potential, of the system, and if f be a function of the distance of any
one of the satellites from the planet (which function, when the mass of
the satellite is small compared with that of the planet, is the \ power
of the distance), tho equation expressive of the rate of change of       J is
                                  *l = -A'  —
                                  dt        ef
 where    t is the time, A a certain constant, and c expresses partial
 differentiation.
    A similar equation applies to each satellite, and the whole of the
 equations form a system of simultaneous differential equations, which

 1881.]            On  the Tidal Friction of a Planet, §-c.             323
have to be solved       in order to trace the changes in the system of
satellites.
   Expressions are also found for the rotation of the planet, and for the
energy E, in terms of the resultant moment of momentum of the
system and of the f 's.
   It is then shown how these equations may be solved by series, pro
ceeding by powers of the time. As, however, the series are not rapidly
convergent, they are not appropriate for tracing extensive changes of
configuration.
   The case where there are only two satellites      is then considered in
detail, and  it is shown that, if a surface be constructed,  the points on
which have E and the two f 's as their three rectangular co-ordinates
(E being drawn vertically upwards and the f 's being horizontal), then
the solution of the problem is expressed by the statement that the
point, representing on the surface the configuration of the system,
travels down the steepest path.
   The contour-lines on this " surface of energy
                                                       "
                                                         are illustrated by
figures, and the graphical solution found therefrom is interpreted and
discussed.
   The second part of the paper contains a discussion of the part played
by tidal friction in the evolution of the solar system.
   It is proved that the rate of expansion of the planetary orbits which
arises from the friction of the tides raised by the planets in the sun
must be exceedingly small compared with that which arises from the
friction of the tides raised by the sun in the planets. Thus the investi
gation in the first part of the paper, where the satellites ar,e treated as
particles, is not applicable to the solar system.
   Although the problem of finding the changes in a system, formed by
a rigid or perfectly fluid sun attended by tidally disturbed planets, is
easy of solution, yet it seemed inexpedient to attempt a numerical
solution which should be applicable to the solar system.
   It appeared, however, likely that a knowledge of certain numerical
values would throw light on the question.       Accordingly the moments
of momentum of the orbital motion of the planets round the sun, of the
sun's rotation round his axis, of the orbital motion of the satellites
round their planets, and of the rotation of the planets about their axes
are evaluated with such degree of accuracy as the data permit.
   From a comparison between the orbital momenta of the planets and
their rotational momenta, it is concluded that tidal friction can scarcely
sensibly have enlarged the planetary orbits since the planets had a
separate existence.
   By parallel reasoning (although the argument has much less force)
it also seemed improbable that the orbits of the satellites of Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn have undergone very large extensions since the
satellites had separate existences, and it seemed nearly certain that

they cannot             back to an origin almost in contact with the
                be traced
present surfaces of their planets, as was shown in previous papers to
be probably the case with the moon and earth.
   The numerical values spoken of above exhibit a very striking
difference between the condition of the earth and moon and that of
these other planets, and it may therefore be admitted that their modes
of evolution have also differed considerably.
   The part played by tidal friction in the evolution of planetary masses
is then discussed.
   A numerical    comparison is made of the relative efficiency of solar
tidal friction in reducing the rotational momentum and the rotation of
the several  planets.   It is found that the efficiency as regards the
rotation is nearly the same for Mars and for the earth, notwithstanding
the greater distance of the former from the earth.        This point is
important with reference to the rapid revolution of the inner satellite
of Mars, and confirms the explanation of this fact, which has been
offered in a previous paper.
   The numbers expressive        of   relative efficiency of solar tidal
                                      the
friction are of course very much smaller for the more remote planets
than for the nearer ones, but they must not be supposed to represent
the total amount of rotation destroyed by solar tidal friction, because
the exterior planets must be presumed to have existed much longer than
the interior ones. Nevertheless the disproportion between the numbers
is so great that it must be held that the influence of solar tidal fric
tion on Jupiter and Saturn has been considerably less than on the
nearer planets.
   The manner in which tidal friction and the contraction of a plane
tary mass would work together is then considered, and it is found to
be probable that tidal friction was a more important cause of change
when the masses were less condensed than it is at present ; thus the
present rate of action of solar tidal friction         is not to be taken as a
measure of what has existed in all past time.
   This discussion leads the author to assign a cause for the observed
distribution of satellites in the solar system. For          if,
                                                              as the nebular
hypothesis supposes, satellites are formed when instability           produced
                                                                      is
by the acceleration of rotation accompanying           contraction, then the
epochs of instability would recur more rarely           iftidal friction were
operative than without       it;   and  if tidal friction were sufficiently
powerful,  an  epoch of  instability  would  never occur.
   The efficiency of solar tidal friction diminishes as we recede from
the sun, and therefore planets near the sun should have no satellites,
and the number of satellites should increase for the remoter planets.
This   the observed condition of the solar system.

permit tidal friction to be the principal feature in their evolution,
whilst its effects are less striking in the other planets.
   Amongst other points discussed are . the comparative speeds of
rotation of the several planets, and the probable effects of the genesis
of a satellite on the course of change afterwards followed by the planet.
   The paper ends with a review of the solar system, in which it is
shown that the tidal hypothesis is a means of co-ordinating many
apparently disconnected phenomena, besides giving a history of the
earth and moon since the origin of the latter.
   These investigations afford no grounds for the rejection of the
nebular hypothesis, but while they present evidence in favour of the
main outlines of that theory, they introduce modifications of con
siderable importance.       Tidal friction is a cause of change of which
Laplace's theory    took   no  account, and although the activity of that
cause is to be regarded as mainly belonging to a later period than the
events described in the nebular hypothesis, yet its influence has been
of great, and in one instance of even paramount importance, in de
termining the present condition of the planets and of their satellites.

      Anatomy, Owens College. Manchester.             Communicated by
      Professor Huxley, Sec. R.S. Received December 30, 1880,
                                  (Abstract.)
   The paper contains an anatomical description of the female organs
and placenta of the racoon.       The specimen examined contained but a
single foetus, which was lodged in the right horn of the uterus.     The
uterine mucous membrane of the unimpregnated horn was richly sup
plied with glands, which presented the usual structure. In the non-
placental area of the gravid horn these glands, although present, were
evidently undergoing degeneration and were with difficulty recognised,
and then only in a fragmentary condition ; whilst in the placental area
of the uterine mucous membrane these glands had entirely disappeared.
   The author's observations upon the placenta of Procyon lotor show
that in respect of this organ : — (1.) Procyon agrees with all other
 carnivora, in which that organ has hitherto been examined, in the pos
session of a zonary or annular placenta.
   (2.) That Procyon agrees with all of these in the mode of interlock
ing of the foetal and maternal portions of the placenta and in the
consequent deciduate character of that organ.

 digitigrade end pinniped sections of the carnivora, inasmuch as at one
 spot the placenta presents a deficiency or gap, at which spot the pla
 cental structure is imperfect.
     (4.) That Procyon agrees with Canis, at the same time that it differs
 from Fells, in the absence of a continuous layer of decidua serotina from
 the uterine surface of the detached placenta.
     (5.) That Procyon differs from every other carnivore, the placenta of
 which has been minutely examined, in the possession of placental
 vessels possessed of a structure hitherto only met with in the placenta
 of Ch-olcepus Hoffmanni among the Edentates.
    (6.) That Procyon differs from every other carnivore, the foetus of
 which has been hitherto examined, in the non-possession of an umbilical
 vesicle.
    (7.) That Procyon differs from all carnivora of which the young
 have been hitherto examined, inasmuch as the foetus is provided with a
 supernumerary cuticle or epitridermia, a structure which has only been
 met with in the young of certain members of other mammalian groups.
    From an examination of the various facts detailed in the paper, the
author arrives at the conclusion that a consideration of the modifi
cations in form and structure of the placenta ahne is insufficient as
affording a basis upon which to found a natural classification of the
mammalia.

    In   the involution of the thymus, connective tissue is formed in the
medullary portion of the follicle; and to some extent in the cortical.
Besides this, the connective     tissue outside  the follicles increases, and
in this connective tissue fat is formed     ; by these means the gland is
finally replaced by fat and fibrous threads.
    The cortical part attains its greatest size at the time of the greatest
activity of the gland, it is not differentiated from the rest of the
follicle at a very early period and disappears somewhat sooner than
the medullary portion.
    The lymphatics of the thymus of the calf are small.          In the neck
they run to neighbouring lymphatic glands, the efferent vessel of
which runs to two other lymphatic glands lying on the trachea at the
root of the neck.       There is no connexion with the large lymphatics
of the neck.      In the thoracic portion of the thymus the lymphatics
can also be traced to lymphatic glands, one of which is generally
 situated on the aorta.

   The reticulum of the cortical part of a follicle is of two kinds ;
consisting (1) of a reticulum, composed of coarse threads and of
delicate cells, with long branching processes — these cells and threads
are attached to the blood-vessels.     In the meshes of this reticulum
two different kinds of small bodies are seen nearly equal in size ; the
one (a) are very highly refractive and angular, and have short
threads attached to their angles, the other (b) circular and much less
refractive — a and 6 are acted upon differently by staining solutions.
The highly refractive bodies form the nodal points (2) of a delicate
reticulum which encloses the circular less highly refractive cells.
    Traces of this fine reticulum can be seen in the medullary portion.
    The granular cells mentioned in a preceding note (" Proc. Roy. Soc,"
vol. 27, p. 369) take their origin in the connective tissue cells which
constitute the network of the medullary portion.         These granular
cells not only help to form the concentric corpuscles, but are actively
concerned in the formation of fibrous tissue ; their fibrillated pro
cesses are sometimes found to be attached to newly formed connective
tissue.
    The granular cells are identical with some forms of giant cells —
they are not the plasma cells of Waldeyer, although plasma cells are
present in the thymus, as has been described by Ehrlich.

  with a discourse at the Royal Institntion in March, 1877, on " The
  Influence of Chemical Constitution on the Refraction of Light."          In
  the meantime, observations on many substances have gradually accu
 mulated in my note-book.
     Of late, however, the importance of the subject in regard to theories
 of chemical structure has been recognised by Dr. Thorpe and other
 chemists in this country, and attention has been recalled to it in
 Germany by the papers of Briihl, who, following closely in the footsteps
 of Landolt, has endeavoured to explain the results in the language of
 modern organic chemistry.
    At this juncture it may be of service to put on record my preserr
 views in regard to the refraction equivalents of the four principal
 constituents of organic bodies — carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and ni
 trogen.    The figures in this paper are always reckoned for the line A
of the solar spectrum, the refraction equivalent being the specific
refraction for    A  multiplied   into the atomic weight, or       —      In
                                                                   d
the present stage of the inquiry, though the results are deduced from
many observations,     I have not thought it desirable to go beyond the
first place of decimals.
    Carbon. — Carbon in its   compounds has at least three equivalents    of
refraction, 5-0, 6'0 or 61, and about 8"8.
    Whether    its refraction should be one or other of these appears to
depend on the way in which the atoms are combined.
    When a single carbon atom has each of its four units of atomicity
satisfied by some other element, it has a value not exceeding 5-0.
There are some indications that the value may be slightly less than
this.
    When a carbon atom has one of its units of atomicity satisfied by
another carbon atom and the remainder by some other element, it has
the value of 5'0, the same as in diamond. This is also the case if two
of its units of atomicity are satisfied by carbon atoms.      The majority
of organic compounds      of course  fall into this category.
    When a carbon atom has three of its units of atomicity satisfied by
other carbon atoms, its value is 6-0.        The most striking instance is
that of benzol, C6H6 (refraction equivalent 43-7), in which it is diffi
cult to conceive that each carbon atom is not in the condition just de
scribed, and which, reckoning 1'8 for each hydrogen, gives a little less
than 6-0 for each carbon.      Styrol, C8H8 (57'8), gives a similar value.
    There are other organic compounds in which only some of the
atoms of carbon have the higher value.           It has been especially the
work of Briihl to point this out, and to show that where they occur
(as in amylene or the allyl compounds) the carbon atom is in a con
dition similar to those in the phenyl nucleus, that condition in fact

1881.]       Carbon, Hydrogen,    $c, in Organic Compounds.            329
which is generally represented in our graphic formulae by two carbon
atoms linked by double bonds.
   The value assigned by Briihl in such cases is, however, 6*1. This
somewhat higher figure is deduced from the aggregate value of the
six carbon atoms in the nucleus of the aromatic series, which (except
in benzol and its simpler substitution products) would appear to be
nearer 37 than 36. If equally distributed over the six atoms this
would give a value of at least 6-l for each. The fact, however, is
susceptible of another interpretation.     It does not follow that in these
more complicated bodies all the carbon atoms are exerting the same
influence on the rays of light.    The replacement of hydrogen by some
monad radicle is an important change ; and if that radicle be CH3 it
is evident that according to present views the carbon atom must have
all four of its units of atomicity satisfied with carbon, and by analogy
we should expect it to have its refraction increased.        What that in
creased value may be, or which indeed of the two hypotheses is most
in accordance with the facts, it seems to me that we have not yet
sufficiently accurate data for determining.
    When a carbon atom has all four of its units of atomicity satisfied
by other carbon atoms, each of which has the higher value of 6-0 or
6"1, its equivalent of refraction is greatly raised.        There are com
pounds in which the atoms of carbon actually outnumber the atoms of
hydrogen or its substitute, such as naphthalene, C10Hg (ref. eq. 75' 1),
naphthol, C10H8O (79'5), phenanthrene, CUH10 (108'3), and pyrene,
C16H10 (126-1).     That the refraction is greatly raised is evident from
the fact that, if we were to reckon all the carbon atoms at 6"1, the
refraction equivalent of the body would not be fully accounted for. It
is evident that in pyrene only ten of the atoms of carbon can be in the
same condition as they are in benzol or styrol, the other six most have
all their units of atomicity satisfied by carbon alone. Now, if we allow
6'0 as the value of each of the ten carbons, and l-3 for each of the ten
 hydrogens, we get 73-0, which taken from 126*1 leaves 53-l for the
remaining six atoms of carbon, or 8'8 for each. By a similar calcula
tion the four extra atoms in phenanthrene are found to have the value
 of 88 each. Taking oxygen at 2-9, naphthol gives 9"1 for each. But
the experimental data do not indicate a higher value than 8"4 for each
of the extra carbon atoms in naphthalene.        Provisionally I venture to
assign 8'8 as the refraction equivalent of this highest carbon.
.   There are several other bodies, such as anthracene, anethol, furfurol,
and hydride of cinnamyl, which from their abnormally high refraction
appear to contain carbon in this last condition.
    Hydrogen. — The general evidence        with regard to hydrogen in
organic compounds tends to show that it has only one refraction equi
valent, that originally assigned to it by Landolt, 13.
    Oxygen. — Briihl has been the first to point out that oxygen in organic
                                                              2 it 2

 compounds has two values, and he comes to the conclusion that it has
 the value 3 35 where the oxygen is attached to a carbon atom by a
 double linking, but 2-76 inhydroxyl and where the oxygen is united to
 two other atoms.*     This is deduced from experimental data : but there
 are other results which present difficulties.       Thus the refraction of no
 substance is more certainly known than those of water, wood spirit,
and alcohol. But the oxygen in H20 (5-9) appears to have the higher
number 3-3, notwithstanding its union to t\Vo atoms of hydrogen,

   Nitrogen. — Nitrogen has two values, 41 and 51, or thereabouts.
   The lower value, 41, is that originally deduced from cyanogen and
metallic cyanides, and it seems to be generally confirmed by the-
observations on organic cyanides and nitriles.           The higher value, 51,
is deduced from all my observations on organic bases and amides, such
as diethylamine (39'4), triethylamine (54'6), formamide (17"4), &c.
   The determination of the value of nitrogen in nitro-substitution
products presents some peculiar difficulties. The observations are not
accordant.    Even were the value of N03 obtained with certainty, it
would not be easy to say how much should be attributed to the oxygen,
especially when it is remembered that combination with oxygen alters
very materially the refraction of the analogous elements, phosphorus
and arsenic.
   I hope shortly to submit to the public the data for these calculations,
and in fact the whole of my recent observations on the refraction of
organic compounds, together with a fuller discussion of the conclusions
that may be drawn from them.

And thns we may proceed in general until we arrive at a simple de
finite integral containing only one arbitrary constant and the indices

   Conversely we may obtain a complicated definite integral in many
cases from a simple one, by multiplying it by constants raised to the
powers of certain quantities contained as indices in the integral, as
signing successive values to those indices, and then summing the re
sulting series. Thus the integral (123),

the method of summation is of such great importance in the evalua
tion of definite integrals.
   I now hope to prove, as I stated in the last paper, that every func
tion of an algebraical magnitude may be regarded as a centre from
which systems of definite integrals emanate in all directions like rays
from a star, in such a manner that the value of each integral is
¦equivalent to the original function transformed by a known symbol.

     Adescription of the remains of a large Dinosaur, discovered in
1865 by the Rev. W. Fox, in a bed of shaly clay between Barnes
and Cowleaze Chines, in the Isle of Wight.         Head, neck, shoulder-
girdle, and foreribs were missing, but the rest of the skeleton was
almost entire.    Some of the presacral vertebras recovered show a
double costal articulation.    In the trunk and loins the centrum is
cylindroid, relatively long and slender, with plano-concave, or gently
biconcave ends.     Several lumbar centra are ankylosed together, and
the hindmost to    the sacrum.   The sacrum comprises five relatively
stout and short ankylosed centra of          depressed cordiform cross-
                                                           a
sectional figure.    The front sacral vertebras have a stout short
centrum.
   The limb bones are short, their shafts slender, and their articular
ends very expanded.       The femur has a third trochanter, and the
distal end of the tibia has the characteristic dinosaurian figure.
   The back and flanks were stoutly mailed with simple, keeled, and
spined scutes, and the tail was also sheathed in armour.
   The animal indicated by these remains was of low stature, great
strength, and probably slow habits.    It manifestly a Dinosaur, and
                                                           is
is considered to be very nearly related to Hylceosaurus.

        Schuster, Ph.D., F.R.S.        Received January 10, 1881.
    It would be a matter of the greatest importance if we could dis
cover an empirical law connecting together the different periods of
vibration in which we know one and the same molecule to be capable
of swinging. According to the most simple supposition the vibrations
might be harmonical overtones of one fundamental note.                Various
attempts    have  been  made  to prove that such indeed      is the  case, and
that the wave-lengths of different spectral lines bear to each other the
ratio of two comparatively small integer numbers.               M. Lecoq de
Boisbaudran and Professor Johnstone Stoney, especially, have dis
cussed this question ; the wave-lengths used by the former do not
possess the accuracy necessary for a final settlement of the point, but
Professor Stoney has, in the case of hydrogen, shown that three out of
the four lines in the visible part of the spectrum have wave-lengths,
which, to a high degree of accuracy, are in the ratios of 20 : 27 : 32.
    I have occupied myself at various times during the last ten years
with this question, and have naturally accumulated a large quantity
of material.      About three years ago, however,       I  came to the con
clusion that only a systematic investigation could lead to a decisive
result.    In any spectrum containing a large number of lines, it is
clear that, owing to accidental coincidences, we shall always be able to
 find ratios which agree very closely with the ratios of small integer
 numbers.     We can, however, by means of the theory of probability,
calculate the number of such coincidences which we might expect to
 find on the supposition that no real law exists, and that all the lines
 are distributed at random throughout the whole range of the visible
spectrum.      If, on calculating out all fractions which can be formed in
a spectrum by any pair of lines, the number of ratios, agreeing within
 certain limits with ratios of integer numbers, greatly exceeds the most
 probable number, we should have reason to suppose that the lines are
 not distributed at random, but that the law suggested by Messrs.
 Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Stoney is a true one.
     I have been engaged during the last three years in discussing some
 of the spectra in the manner indicated, and I now wish* to lay the
 results of the investigation before the Royal Society.            I took the
 spectra of the following elements ; the nnmbers in brackets indicate-
 the number of lines for each body : —

338                              Dr. A. Schuster.                         [Jan.  27,
    I  have only taken such lines as are found on Angstrom's map,
¦and I have compared          the ratios of any two lines with the ratios of
integer numbers smaller than 100. These latter ratios were calculated
out to six decimal places, and arranged in order of magnitude in a
table, to which     I  shall refer as the Auxiliary Table.         I  have adopted
 two methods of comparison.                The first is best explained by an
example.       The wave-length of the less refrangible of the two yellow
ish-green sodium lines divided by the wave-length of the less refran
gible of the two yellow lines gave the ratio                                '964760
On referring to the Auxiliary Table we find that this ratio
    lies between                                              55-r-57=      -964912
    and                                                       82-r-85=      -964706
'The difference between these two fractions being                           -000206
 The difference of the fraction in the sodium spectrum with
    the nearest fraction of integer number is                               -000054
The ratio of these two differences 54-^206 is found                         "262
 Similar ratios were formed for all possible fractions in the sodium
 spectrum.      Now, if the lines in spectra are distributed at random, we
.should expect the ratio of the two differences                  to range indis
 criminately    betwjen    0 and -5 ; the mean of all of them coming near
 •25.    If, on the other hand, the law of harmonic ratios is a true one,
 we should expect a greater number of small fractions, and hence the
 mean should be smaller than -25.            The results are given in Table I.
 The second column gives the numbers of fractions for each spectrum,
and the third the mean values obtained, which, as mentioned, ought
to be near "25, if the lines are distributed at random.

    Nothing could be more decisive against the law of harmonic ratios
than this table ; three out of the five elements considered, including
the two containing the greatest number of lines, give a mean value
greater than '25.
    In order to see how near to this value we should expect the mean to
come if no law connects the different lines,           I have given the probable

 1881.]       On Harmonic Ratios in         the Spectra  of  Gases.         3391
deviation from -25 in the fourth column. The term probable in pro
bable deviation is here used ia the same sense as in
                                                             " probable error."
It has been calculated by means of the approximate formula —
where   a = -25,
        s=the number of lines in each spectrum,
p is the probability that the mean value lies between + r ; for p equal
to one-half,  c is the probable deviation.
   It will be noticed that the actual deviation never differs much from
the probable one, but that     it is greater for the two elements having the
greatest number of lines.        If, therefore, any deduction is to be drawn
from the preceding table, it is that the ratios formed by two given
lines rather seem to avoid harmonic ratios.
   The method just explained, and which has given us such decidedly
negative results,   I believe to be very well adapted for the discussion
of spectra which have a comparatively small number of lines ; but
the iron spectrum may be examined by a more direct and complete
method.     We may directly calculate how many fractions ought to
agree  within   certain small limits with harmonic ratios if no law exists,
and counting how many do thus coincide.            I have found, for instance,
twenty-eight pairs      of lines   which   coincide  within limits so narrow
that they can be easily due to errors of measurements with fractions,
the denominator and numerator of which are both smaller than 10.
This number might appear large at first sight, and some support for
the law of harmonic ratios might be derived from it.               But the cal
culation gives the larger number 32 as the one wo ought to expect, if
all the lines were distributed at random ; so that here, also, the frac
tions seem to avoid rather the harmonic ratios.
   A little difficulty ia experienced in fixing the limits within which
we may consider a coincidence to have taken place.                   They must
depend, of course, on the accuracy which            we assign    to Angstrom's
measurements.
   I thought   it best to work out the results with two different limits,
one of  which   was half as large again as the other.       "We gain a decided
advantage in classifying the results for two limits.               It is in fact
equivalent to using a      third   method    of discussion,  for  supposing the
spectral lines to be distributed at random, the number of coincidences
found should be proportioned to the limits chosen. If, on the other
hand, the law of harmonic ratios is correct, the narrower limit should
relatively show the greater number of coincidences.            The limits taken
were —
                                  ± -0000505
and                               + -0000755.

so that two lines were said to have the ratio of 3       : 4, for instance,   if in
the first case the ratio lay between 7500505 and                74995195, and
similarly for the second limit.
    If the measurement of the least refrangible line is correct, an error
of 1 in 20,000 made in the measurement of the most refrangible line
would correspond to the narrower limit.
    The results are given in Table II. In the first row all fractions
were taken into account the denominator of which is smaller than
10 ; in the second row, the denominator is between 10 and 20, and
so on, for the other rows.         The columns headed " calculated," give
the number of coincidences which we should expect on the supposi
tion that the lines are distributed at random.         The formula employed
will be proved in the Appendix.

    At first sight the result seems again decidedly against the theory of
 harmonic ratios. For all fractions with denominator smaller than 70,
 the calculated coincidences are in excess of the observed ones.            There
 seems, however, to be a greater number of ratios than we should
 expect, which agree nearly with fractions, the denominators of which
 lie between 70 and 100.
     If we compare the results given for the two different limits, wo
 find that the smaller limit gives results decidedly more favourable to
 the theory than the larger ones, and that, as has been explained, is an
 important fact which cannot be left out of account.            In the following
 Table (III),      I have compared the number of coincidences for the
 smaller limit with those calculated from the larger one, on the sup
 position that the coincidences are proportional to the limits, as they
 ought to be if no connexion exists between different lines of the same
 spectrum.       It will be seen, that with the exception of two cases, one

    The fact that the number of coincidences, though falling short of
 the calculated values for both limits, is relatively greater for the
 smaller, suggests the possibility that still narrower limits might give
 results which are still more favourable to the theory of harmonic
 ratios.   This indeed is the case. I have connted for all fractions, the          .
•denominator of which is smaller than 30, the number of coincidences
 for a series of 8 limits.   The results are embodied in Table IV, and
 show that there is a tendency of the fractions to aggregate into the
 compartments for smaller limits.        With the exception of the first and
 last numbers, there is a gradual decrease of coincidences as we
 recede from the harmonic ratios.

We have now to reconcile          two apparently opposite results of our
•calculations.   On the one hand it was found that the coincidences
with harmonic ratios are fewer than we should expect from the theory

342                           Dr. A. Schuster.                     [Jan.  27.
of probability, and on the other hand the results obtained with
different limits showed that the smallest always gave the most favour
able result.     The regularity with which this latter fact appears in
Tables   III   and IV, proves it not to be accidental, and if not
accidental, it can only mean that the law of harmonic ratios is at
least partially a true law.
   The following explanation has occurred to me as possibly account
ing for the facts.     We may suppose the harmonic ratios really to
exist in appreciable numbers, but to be chiefly confined to fractions,
the denominator and numerator of which are larger than those we
have taken into account.         The fractions, for instance, formed by
integers between 100 and 200, if arranged in order of magnitude
in our auxiliary tables, would fall generally about midway between
the fractions formed by the smaller numbers.        Any coincidence with
the fractions  formed   by the  higher numbers  would   reduce the number
of possible coincidences with the fractions formed by the smaller
numbers, and hence we should have the effect which actually exists,
of a number of coincidences smaller than that given by the theory of
probability.    If, now, in addition to these coincidences with fractions
formed by higher numbers, we should have a small quantity of real
coincidences with the fractions which we have taken into account, the
increased quantity of coincidences for small limits over those of larger
limits, would be explained.
   This explanation might be supported by the fact that, for fractions
formed by numbers between 70 and 100, the coincidences observed are
more numerous than those calculated on the supposition that the lines
are all distributed at random.      It must, however, be remarked that a
similar effect might be produced, if any unknown law existed, con
necting the lines together, a law which in special cases reduced itself
to a law of harmonic ratios.
   That some law hitherto undiscovered exists       I  have no doubt, for
just in the  cases  where  we  have reason to suppose   that different lines
belong to one system of vibration, we cannot find any coincidences
 with harmonic ratios. The lines of sodium, for instance, are all
double ; yet in the set of lines given by Thalen the two components
approach each other much more rapidly as we pass to the more re
frangible end of the spectrum than they would if the lines were con
nected together by the harmonic law. In the additional sets described
by Professors Liveing and Dewar no regularity exists in the distance
of the two components.
   A similar remark applies to the four triplets      of magnesium lines.
The triplets resemble each other in so far as the    middle line is always
nearest to the most refrangible line ; but the       resemblance    is only a
general one, and there is no absolute relation        between the relative
distances in each triplet.

1881.]        On Harmonic Ratios in           the Spectra   of Gases.         343
   Taking all these considerations into account, the following seems to
me to be a fair summary of my results for the iron spectrum : —
   1. There is a real cause acting in a direction opposed to the law of
harmonic ratios, so far as fractions formed by numbers smaller than
seventy are concerned.
   2. After elimination of     the first cause a tendency    appears for fractions
formed by two lines to cluster round harmonic ratios.
   3. Most probably some law hitherto undiscovered exists, which in special
cases resolves itself into, the law of harmonic ratios.
   The subject is of sufficient importance to make further investigation
desirable.    We might, for instance, confirm the laws which we have
found to hold in the iron spectrum by treating in the same way some-
other spectrum having many lines, as those of manganese of calcium .
But it seems to me to be more promising to increase the accuracy of
measurement in the special cases where harmonic ratios have been
found. There are, for instance, two lines in the iron spectrum which
are in the ratio of 2 : 3.      By using a diffraction grating we might test
this coincidence to a great degree of accuracy by seeing how far the
more refrangible line in the third spectrum coincides with the less re
frangible line in the second spectrum.              Account, of course, must be
taken of atmospheric refraction ; reflecting surfaces only ought to be
used.    I  hope to try this plan before long, but in order that others
might have the same opportunity,            I   append a list of all lines which
are nearly in the ratio of some fraction formed by integer numbers
smaller than ten.
   Angstrom's numbers corrected for atmospheric refraction are used.
The table explains itself, but it is perhaps wise to remark again that
the number of these coincidences is not larger than one would expect
by the theory of probability, and that therefore all of them may prove
to be accidental.

   The problem which we have to solve may be stated as follows : —
   Given a certain number of quantities distributed at random between
two fixed limits ; form the ratios between every pair of them,
and find the expectancy for the number of these ratios which shall
within certain small limits agree with a given fraction. Tu the first
place, we remark that without detriment to the generality of the
problem, we may assume the lower of the limits within which all the
quantities are lying to be unity ; for if it is not, we may by means of
a common multiplier to all quantities reduce it to unity.
   Let a. be the given fraction with which all the ratios are to be com
pared, and let A be the higher limit which none of the quantities
shall exceed. Assume at first A to be smaller than the square of the
reciprocal of a. Divide the range A to 1 into two compartments;
the first from    A   to   i,   and the second from            -   to 1.       Let there be      t
quantities which I shall call Oj, n2, . . . in the first compartment ; and
let there be r quantities        .  . in the second compartment.
                                    6j,   6a,    .                   None
of the quantities within one compartment can form amongst them
selves ratios which shall be closely coincident with a say a+o.            :

   If there  is only one quantity, a,    in the first compartment,       6 is given
by the equation —
                                   6=«a+ ha.
Hence,   if there is only one     6  which can range between          - and  1, and
                                                                      a
must lie between a            and a (a— B), if there is a coincidence with
the given fraction, the probability of such a coincidence is
   If there is more than one quantity, a, in the first compartment, we
observe that these quantities may lie so near together that one and
the same 6 can have, within the limits within which we count coin
cidences, the required ratio with more than one of the quantities, a. If
these quantities, however, are not sufficiently close together to admit
of any such double coincidence, the probability that one             b should have
the required ratio with one a is
                           -^!L-?j(a1 + a2+     . . .at).

Call the sum in brackets st.
If we   drop the limitation that b should not possibly have at the same
time the required ratio with more than one a, the expression just
found will not any more represent the probability of a single coinci
dence, but it will represent the expectancy for the coincidences.               For
in the most general case there is a certain range, A, within which b
may lie in order to have the required ratio with one of the quantities,
a; there is a range, A2, within which a double coincidence will
happen, and so on : hence the expectancy for the coincidences is
                       (A1+2As+3A3-r

but the expression in brackets is always equal to

and hence the expression which we have found will represent                      the
expectancy if there is only one quantity, b ; for r quantities it is

VI. "Note on the Occurrence of Ganglion Cells in the Anterior
       Roots of the Cat's Spinal Nerves." By E. A. Schafer,
       F.R.S. Received January 11, 1881.
   Ganglion cells are of constant occurrence among the nerve-fibres of
the anterior roots of the cat's spinal nerves.   They are generally to be
found in that part of the anterior root which passes by the ganglion
which is seated upon the posterior root. They are not necessarily
situated next the ganglion ; but are often imbedded in the middle of
the anterior root, or found lying along its anterior margin, and tbere-
fore as far removed as possible from the ganglion upon the other
root.    Moreover, they sometimes occur in the anterior root before
this has come in contact with the ganglion, just as isolated ganglion
cells are occasionally to be found in the posterior root, some little
distance on the spinal-cord side of its ganglion. The cells in question,
although not in any sense numerous, are to be found in most longi
tudinal sections of the anterior roots, but they seem to be especially
abundant in those of the lower dorsal and lumbar nerves.              They
resemble on     the  whole very closely the ganglion cells in the spinal
ganglion npon the sensory roots, but it has not hitherto been possible
to make out their mode of connexion with the nerve-fibres.
   I  have sought in vain for ganglion cells in a similar situation in
the nerve-roots of man, the dog, the rabbit, and the mouse.             The
evidence, therefore, appears to be against the existence of any relation
between the occurrence of these cells in the anterior root and the
                                                       " recurrent sensa
phenomenon of sensibility in that root, known as
tion," for the latter has been observed in animals in which I have
been entirely unable to detect the existence of the cells in qnestion
{e.g., the  rabbit).
    VII.   " On the Iron Lines widened in Solar Spots." By J.
       Norman Lockyer, F.R.S. Received January 13, 1881.
   The observations put forward with reserve in my last communica
tion to the Society have now been confirmed.
   In the fine spots visible on December 24tb, January 1st and 6th,
many lines in the spectrum of iron were seen contorted, while others
were steady.
   The facts are given in the following table  : —

    It is to be noted, that these observations       furnish us with an instance
of inversion similar to those frequently obtained in our observations
of the most widened lines in spots.
    The inferences to be drawn from these observations, and those on
which we are now continuously engaged, must be matter for future
communication.           But I cannot resist calling attention to the crucial
nature of the evidence, at least as regards iron, in favour of the view
first put forward by Sir B. Brodie, whom we have so recently lost,
that the constituents of our terrestrial elements exist in independent
forms in the sun.t
    I have thought it right to send in a record of this work at once,
with a view to induce other observers to follow the continually vary
ing phases of the spots during the approaching maximum.
    The observations have been made by Mr. H. A. Lawrance, and con
firmed by myself in the majority of cases.
   * In this spot the D lines indicated motion and did not retain their parallelism.

I- "Upon       the Cause of the       Striation of Voluntary Muscular
      Tissue.'     By John Berry Haycraft, M.B., B.Sc, F.R.S.E.,
      Senior Physiological Demonstrator in the University of
      Edinburgh.         Communicated by Dr. Klein, F.R.S.            Re
      ceived December 1, 1880.
                                  [Plati  6.]  .
   The structure of striated muscular tissue has occupied the attention
of many histologists, and various, often antagonistic, have been the
views held from time to time since Schwann first investigated this
difficult subject.
   I bring forward with much caution and hesitation any opinions
of my own, nor should I venture thus far, did I not consider my
views susceptible of direct proof, or disproof, not being matters of
mere speculation, which may or may not be true, and which would
tend, by their introduction to the literature of the subject, to make
confusion   worse confounded.
   In  this paper an attempt will be made to account for many of the
observed structural phenomena of muscle on simple laws of geome
trical optics, which will, if it be successful, reduce the subject to
comparative simplicity.       I shall commence by giving a sketch of the
views of those physiologists who have especially written upon the
structure of muscle.       This must not be looked upon as a complete
history, for  I  shall leave out entirely points which do not concern  us
here.

portant and brilliant contributions to the literature of this subject,
and taking him as a landmark, it is convenient to speak of investi
gators before or after his time. Among the former Schwann, quoted
by Muller ("Physiology," translation by Baly, vol.                 ii,
                                                              p. 878), describes

Bauer, Kranse, Muller, Home, Valentin, and Milne Edwards recog
nised the important fact that each fibre            composed of a number of

threads or fibrillee, packed side by side and joined together by a
transparent tenacions fluid (Kranse), and, moreover, that these
threads or fibrillar are cross striated, as       the fibre itself.
                                                         is           Although
 Schultze describes the fibrillar as being uniform filaments, he           alone          is
 in this opinion, most of his contemporaries recognising the beaded
 appearance.*      The beaded thread was the cause of some dispute, for
 the question arose, was        linear series of globnles or a moniliform
                                      it a
 filamont? and the final settlement of this must, indeed, have been
a   matter of great difficulty to those older savants, when we consider
 the imperfect lenses at their disposal.     Krause and others maintained
 the former view, while Schwann held that which subsequent investi
 gators have shown to be the correct one.          The fibrillee, according to
 Schwann, present      very regular succession of bead-like enlargements,
                              a
 darker than the very short constrictions which lie between.              Thus,
 before the time of Mr. Bowman, the following important facts had been
 made out, namely, that the fibre        composed ofis      bundle of beaded
                                                                   a
 fibrillee cemented together, and that the fibrillee are cross striped, giving
 the whole fibre a like appearance of striation.         Erroneous views had
 often,       trne, been advanced, but these had never received general
             it   is
 acknowledgment.       Mr. Skey       Phil. Trans.," 1837), for instance,

 what similar view of the construction of the cross striae, and Prochaska
 considered them as depressions caused by the clasping of neighbouring
 capillaries and thready tissues.

 at the same time, much of what was fresh to our store of knowledge.

strate   its existence, and giving figures of it, which have been
copied into most modern histological works. The nuclei of the sarco-
lemma he also figured, but what most concerns us is his description
of the cross striation. Bowman, I believe, first pointed out that not
only can a fibre be split up longitudinally into fibrillsB along certain
dark lines which may generally be seen, even in fresh preparations,
but that it splits up transversely along the dark stripes.                      Each
fibrilla may, therefore, be split up into tiny segments across the dark
          " On the whole, little doubt remains in
striee.                                                       my mind that the
fibrilUs consist of a succession of solid segments or beads connected by
intervals generally narrower, and          I believe the beads to be light, and
the intervals the dark spaces when the fibrilla is in exact focus."
His idea of a fibre naturally follows from that just given of a fibrilla,
and, quoting again from him, we find "a fibre consists of sarcous
elements (so he termed the little segments or beads) arranged and
united together endways and sideways, so as to constitute in these
directions respectively fibrillte and discs, either of which may in
certain cases be detached as such," and " the dark longitudinal stria;
are shadows      between      fibrillse,  the dark transverse      stria? shadows
between discs."
    It will be seen that in one particular Bowman disagreed with
 Schwann and the older writers, and at the same time with those of
more recent date.         According to him, the bead was light and the
constriction   dark,   when the muscle was in exact focus, a description at
variance with everyone.              In the same paper he mentions this
remarkable fact, that on altering the focus the stripes were reversed ;
he must have examined it — this bears in a most important way on
our investigations, to be afterwards described — in the reverse focus of
what it is ordinarily figured in. His view of the form, and the split
ting of the fibre, was probably correct, for he described the cleavage
as occurring in the narrow part, which appeared to him, focussing as
he did, to be dark, and indeed it is often difficult to say which it is,
whether dark or light, for, as             I  shall more particularly mention
afterwards, the slightest alteration of the focus is sufficient to reverse
the appearance of the fibre.            Bowman, moreover, accounted for these
light and dark parts of the fibrillee, comparing a muscular filament
to a glass rod with alternate swellings and depressions, which, when
viewed with transmitted light, gives just the same appearance,
and from a study of his paper, although it is here somewhat indefi
nite, I judge that he concluded the monilifprm shape to be a cause of
the striping.*
   • Bowman, nevertheless, seems to consider the dark stripe of a different structure
from the light, not so much from the shading, but from the transverse cleavage.

  Now, this last-named              and important discovery of Bowman's has,
I believe,completely            been lost sight of, for no mention of it can bo
found in any modern monograph        nor in any systematic text-book that
1 have examined.     The striking    points in the paper and in the figures
he gives, is the splitting up of the fibre into transverse discs and the
demonstration    of the sarcous elements as before quoted.                This,
together with the sarcolemma, everyone connects with the name of
Bowman.       Modern investigators have worked mostly at the cross
striping of muscle, and have found it more complicated than Bowman
described, owing, no doubt, to the use of better glasses ; while he
explained the phenomenon as due simply to the shape of the fibres —
believing, however, probably that it was due also to structural
differences — modern investigators have introduced hypotheses                 to
account for       it,
                 which imply differences of structure along the filament.
The reason of this is, if      may express an opinion, that his theory has
                                   I
been completely lost sight of, and that        was followed by the discovery

cases, consider them in the order of their priority, and allusion will
not be made to much that has been written upon this subject, which,
indeed, may safely be put on one side.
    The light stripe — dark stripe of Bowman — has been shown by
Dobie, Busk, and Huxley to be traversed by a very fine dark band, or
rather line, " Querlinie," dividing        into two equal parts.
                                                  it                  We shall
speak   of this as  Dobie's   line, or the   dark  stripe in the centre of the
light. (Fig      D, Plate 5.) Then, again, the dark stripe
                    1,                                                traversed
                                                                              is
in its centre by a lighter band called Hensen's stripe.* (Fig.                H,     1,
Plate 5.) Other bands border this stripe, but as they are certainly
not to be seen in all specimens however well prepared, and as we shall
presently account for them, they need not trouble us here.
    As early as the year 1839, Boeck showed that muscle refracts light
doubly, which statement was, however, modified in 1857 by Briicke.
The latter examined muscles prepared in alcohol by polarised light,
and found that the dark stripe (dark in ordinarily non-polarised
 light) appeared luminous in the dark field of the microscope, and
that the light stripes were dark when the Nicols were crossed. The
 dark stripes, therefore, appeared to be doubly refracting (aniso-
tropous), and the light stripe singly refracting (isotropous), the fibre
consisting of singly and doubly refracting discs alternating one with
another.    These observations he verified by an examination of the
fibre with thin plates of selenite and mica.           The views of Briicke
 have, in their turn,  received  considerable   modifications    which will be
understood by reference to          diagram.

  364             Mr.  J. B. Hayoraft.    Upon   the Cause  of      [Feb. 3,
 very well the results of my own observations, which          I find, are in
 accordance     with those of other observers.          the
                                                            " Handbnch der

 Physiologie," by Dr. H. L. Hermann, 1879, p. 20.)          The black part
 of the diagram corresponds with the portion of the muscle which
 singly refracts light (isotropous), while the light shaded parts cor
 respond with the anisotropous substance.
     This diagram does not, it will at once be seen, correspond with the
 views held by Briicke, for the great mass of the light stripe, with
 Dobie's line in the centre of it is anisotropons, the dark band, as with
 Briicke, being anisotropous.       The most reeent view is, then, that
 both the light and the dark stripes doubly refract light, but that
there are bands which lie between them and which are singly refract
 ing.    The appearance which partially warrants such a conclusion
 I  have observed, but I shall endeavour to show hereafter how this
 may most satisfactorily be explained.        It will readily be seen how
Briicke's view, until quite recently accepted, would drive one to
the conclusion that the light and dark stripes represent two diffe
rent structures alternating tin the length of the fibre, and this is
corroborated by statements as to the action of staining agents on the
tissues.
    Muscle is readily stained by picric acid, but is but faintly
tinted by carmine, logwood, or eosine, although Banvier, in his
 " Traits
            Technique d' Histologic," states that he has obtained very
beautifully stained preparations        of insects' muscle, when using
Bcehmer's solution of logwood.        According to this observer, the dark
stripes as well as Dobie's lines are stained, while the rest of the fibre
remains colourless.       Klein in his " Atlas of Histology " figures the
sarcous matter of the dark band clearly tinted, while that of the light
stripe is absolutely colourless.    The statement will not be far wrong,
that everyone at the present time considers the dark and light stripes
as representing two different structures, distinct one from another in
their physical properties, for the dark stripe is spoken of as possess
ing a higher refracting power than the light, and chemically, for their
compositions have already been hinted at by more than one observer.
The dark stripe is looked upon by most as the true contracting part of
the fibre, and they are termed the sarcous discs, or
                                                         " Muskelprismen,"
" Hauptsubstanz," or masses of " disdiaclasts," and the light stripes as
                               " zwischensubstanz," or " Muskelkastcben
merely connecting matter,
fliissigkeit."    Dobie's line — more especially from the dipping down
and attachment of the sarcolemma in insects' muscle at this point —
                                       "

scopists  as   Klein and  Banvier, but not of Wagener (" Jahresberichte

describes a row of dots on either side of this line.
    Krause would have us believe that the fibre is divided by these
membranes into a linear series of little boxes, each box or casket,
" Miiskelkastchen," containing a dark stripe with
                                                                  (as the membrane
lies in the centre of the light stripe) one half of that on either side.

                                        self-containing, affirms that the mem
brane of Krause is double.          As to the stripe of Hensen, this is by very
many looked upon as still another structure lying in the centre of the
dark stripe ; it is in many fibres very clearly to be made out, its border
being well defined, and in stained preparations (logwood) it has
decidedly a lighter tint than the rest of the stripe.                      Still some
 (Krause)    look    upon    it as   an   indication     of   the  highly   refracting
power of the dark stripe, comparing the appearance with the light
centre of an oil globule. The other cross strise, of which there are
many described by some observers, but none at all universally
accepted, are, as a rule, considered as indicating further complications
in the muscle fibre ; indeed, the "Miiskelkastchen," by most advanced
microscopists, although not lo^06 of an inch in length, consists of
some ten or twelve different parts.              We may postpone,         I  think, in
definitely  the  consideration     of  these  details.
    While there is great unity as to the appearance of a fibre during
a  state of rest, the changes which the fibre undergoes when passing
into the contracted condition are not at all understood.                     Not only
does one fail to    find  among histologists agreement as           to the changes in
appearance, but the interpretations of these are as numerous as the in
vestigators themselves.         All are agreed, that during contraction, the
fibre as a whole shortens and thickens, but the changes in form which
the cross stria undergo are not understood so well.
   Klein, in his " Atlas of Histology," maintains the broadening of
both stripes transversely, the dark stripe becoming thinner in the long
axis, and the bright stripe more opaque. Ranvier (" Traite" Technique
d'Histologie," p. 489) states that the only points one can conscien
tiously observe in the contraction of a living fibre are, that a knot or
bulging forms, in which the dark bands approximate, being only sepa
rated by Dobie's line.        This led him to believe that the dark bands are
the true contracting part of the fibre.                Ranvier worked especially
with   osmic  acid,  fixing   the  fibres   when    at  rest, and during contrac
tion. W. Krause (" Allgemeine und Mikroscopische Anatomie," p. 92)
describes the contraction as follows : — The thickness (in the length of
the fibre) of the dark stripe or an isotropous substance remains the
same as far as can be seen, while the thickness of the isotropous sub
stance,
         " Zwischensubstanz " becomes less. From this, he argues that

                                                                          " Muskel-
kastchenniissigkeit," passes between the little elements of the dark
stripe, causing their lateral separation, and therefore broadening
and shortening the fibre.          Engelmann (" Neue Untersuchungen iiber
die   Microskopischen Vbrgange bei der Muskelcontraction,"                        in
"              Archiv,"                  is certain  that   the light stripe during
  Pfluger's                Bandxviii)
complete contraction becomes darker than the dark stripe, and that
there is a period as naturally follows from this observation, when
the fibre is quite unstriated. The stripes are in fact reversed, the bright
one becoming the darker, and vice versa.                Both stripes narrow, but
especially the bright one. Engelmann advances a theory to account
for this, holding that the cause of contraction is the passage of fluid
from the isotropous clear stripe into the anisotropous substance ; the
former shrinks, and the latter swells.            Most startling is the view of
Merkel (" Hofmann und Schwalbe," vol. i, p. 116), who believes that
the dark stripe shifts its position, arranging itself by Dobie's line,
while the light stripe passes to the centre.
   It is, as will readily be admitted, somewhat difficult to know what
to believe, for there is such entire disagreement among physiologists
as to simple facts, to say nothing of any conclusions which may be
drawn from them. Thinking that there must be some simple clae
which would solve the whole problem,               I  commenced to work at the
subject   in  the  summer    of  1878.    At the  onset   the clue was discovered,
and the substance of the present paper was written by the end of that
year, before      I  had read for the first time the paper of Mr. Bow
man's, in the " Transactions
                                       " of this
                                                     Society. My astonishment
was indeed great to find in it the first glimmerings of my own
opinions, for although the subject had then been worked out but in
the rough, and Mr. Bowman had a much simpler problem to deal with,
yet undoubtedly he held the same views in the main.                     My obvious
course was therefore entirely to re-write my paper, making every
acknowledgment to his already published work.                      He considered,
as  far as  I  can  make    out,  that  the  light stripe     was  to  be compared
with the cement seen in longitudinal fibrillation, between the fibrillte,
yet he looked upon the strise as being due to the shape of the fibre.
From the history of the subject, which has just been given, it will be
seen that all observers are not agreed as to the actual appearances of
a striped fibre, and especially the changes which occnr during contrac
tion, and I hold that they have fallen into great and unwarrantable
error in the conclusions (these, indeed, are all contradictory) drawn
from these appearances.           A fibre has been observed in the field of the
microscope, which is marked transversely, as already described, and
all modern investigators have concluded that the transverse bands
mark the positions of disks (seen on edge) of tissue of different refrac
tive indices and chemical composition, alternating in the long axis of

                     however, purely an assumption which in no way
follows.
   We can also account for all these cross markings in a way which
involves no theory, and requires for its appreciation but knowledge a
of most elementary geometrical optics.
   If a small fragment of muscle be teazed out in water, salt solution,
or almost any other fluid, and examined in the ordinary way, with a
power of 300 diameters or more, the important fact may be made out
(which     the basis of all my future observations), that the borders of
          is
the fibres are not smooth, but undulate, presenting wavy margins.
(Fig. 1.)
     In
      the fresh unstained preparation there      a halo around the edge
                                                is
of the fibre which masks the crenulated border, yet by carefully adjust
ing the mirror so as to obtain oblique light, or by searching for a fibre
partly in the shade of another, this may always be made out in the       ;
case of insects' muscle, this is, however, always easy to demonstrate,
for the fibres are much coarser, indeed, the appearance has been often
 figured in the works even of recent histologists. If the preparation
 be stained by any of the ordinary dyes, perhaps most readily by picro-
 carmine, the border        in all cases very distinct, and the regularly
                           is
 sinuous margin        nnmistakeable. Now, what
                      is                             is  the significance of
 the wavy outline  ?    It is, as will readily be understood, that the fibre
is  ampullated,  the wavy    outline being but the optical expression of
 such a figure.    A muscular fibre then not a smooth cylinder, but
                                      is                                           is
 like the turned leg of a chair, or like the transversely ribbed neck of a
 common water-bottle in shape.           If the fibre be broken up into
 fibrill®, which is very easy,   after maceration in alcohol, these are seen
 to have just the same characters, indeed, a small bundle of fibrils               is
  most convenient for study.       It may be well to remark, that the ulti
 mate fibrillae often show but little cross marking, and appear almost
 smooth that is, however, only due to their small size
          ;                                                    ;a good lens
 will bring out both points.
    The above-described appearances may be observed in all the varieties,
 of mnscle that have as yet examined, e.g., those obtained from man,

    The transverse stripings of the fibre are related to and correspond
with the inequalities of the surface. (Fig. 1.) The little elevations at
the borders correspond, of course, to the little ridges which run round
the fibre, while the dips at the borders are the optical expressions of
little valleys running between them. In the ordinary position, the dark
stripe marks the position of the ridge, and the light stripe lies in the
little valleys, as will be seen on reference to fig. 1, Plate   5.

centre of the dark band, lies on the exact summit of the ridges.
(H, fig. 1.)
   This position of the stripes in a normal muscular fibre, is the in
variable rule, and the idea at once suggested itself, may not the shape
of thfi fibre itself cause the cross stripings ?
   Any student of natural philosophy would at once affirm that a
structureless fibre of such a shape must be cross striped, and a glance
at the ribbed neck of the water-bottle on the table will elicit the
same answer from any one.
   The question we must now determine                    is,
                                                 are the appearances seen                       in
the fibre just the same in all their details, as would be produced by                           a
piece of glass, or any other homogeneous transparent substance of the
same shape     ?
  Before, however, entering into theoretical grounds,                       it    may be        as
well to give  full description of what actually to be
                  a                                     is                      seen,   for   this
has vet not been stated.
   With a structure of complicated figure, such as the one we                           are con

                 is                 no one focus in which
                                                  is                                it   may    be
described.          one pretty definite focus for a single speck or thin

                                                                      it   is

slightly out of focus.    We shall see, that in the case of the muscle,
although   there     one
                       is position of the lens when the parts are very
distinctly seen, and in which they have mostly been described, yet
that on slightly altering the focus, the appearance       changed.    These
                                                                     is
changes we must carefully study.
   For this purpose we may select the large muscles of the thigh of                              a
rabbit; stretch them ever so little upon a piece of wood, and place
them for some days in 50 per cent, alcohol.       A high power required           is
for their examination         have been in the habit of using
                                 ;I                                 -j^inch         a

                                                  ;                                             A
small bundle of fibrils should be selected in preference to a whole fibre
for examination.
   On focussing        becomes at once apparent that on varying the
                        it
adjustment ever so little, you may bring into focus the tops of the
ridges or the bottoms of the valleys which lie between them.           Now
this slight alteration    sufficient entirely to change the optical appear
                                 is
ances.
     First raise the lens until the fibre be out of focus and only to be    it is
seen as a dim streak running across the field, then bring    down until
its form and the cross markings are distinctly to be seen (the border
is now not quite distinct on      level with the horizontal axis of the
                                           a
fibre). In this position alternating light and dark bands are made out,
but no vestiges of Hensen's stripes or Dobie's lines. (Fig.    a.) The            3,

                                                                     '
   1881.]         the  Striation  of Voluntary Muscular Tissue.               369
  dark band corresponds        with, the valley and the   light one to the ridge,
  or crest.   This was the focus in which Bowman described his prepara
  tions as far as   I can gather from the paper. If the lens be now lowered
  ever so little, the stripes are reversed, a most curious point, which was
  noticed by Bowman, but afterwards lost sight of. The dark band now
  corresponds    with the ridge, and the bright band with the valley. (Fig.
  3, c.)   This is the focussing in which it is usually described, and in
  this position Dobie's line and Hensen's stripe are to be seen as a rule
  in uncontracted fibres.
     Between these two positions of the lens there is generally a well-
  marked intermediate one, which is depicted in fig. 3, b. The crests
  and valleys are both bright and equally so, although the slightest
  movement of the fine adjuster will make either one or the other the
  darker ; on the slopes, as it were, there are, however, narrow shaded
 bands, which are shown in fig. 3, b.         The fibre is now quite clear and
  distinct, and the longitudinal fibrillation is now best made out — if it
  can be seen at      all— and yet there is no sign of either Hensen's         or
  Dobie's stripes. These being the observed appearances (and they may
  be verified without very much trouble), I shall calculate theoretically
 the appearances which a homogeneous fibre of such a shape should
 present when examined by transmitted light, so as to see whether our
 observed effects tally with what may be theoretically calculated.
     Parallel rays of light pass upwards through the fibre, and in their
 course are altered in direction (see fig. 4). The substance of the fibre
 being of higher refrangibility than the fluid in which it is mounted,
 the thicker parts which correspond to the ridges will act like con
 verging lenses, causing the rays of light to come to a focus (A A' A"),
 diverging again.        The thinner parts (the valleys) will, on the other
 hand,    act  as  diverging lenses, causing the rays to spread out, as
 may be seen on reference to the diagram. Now it is evident that
 when the objective is arranged to focus those rays which have passed
 through the fibre and converge over the ridges, at that same position
 the rays above the valleys will be diverging (see fig. 4). This will
 produce a difference in the appearance, for the converging rays will
 give a bright band, while the position of those rays which diverge will
 appear darker.       Alter the focus by screwing the lens up or down, and,
provided the fibre can still be seen, this state of matters will be
reversed; for after converging, the rays above the position of the
ridges will now be diverging, while at the same time those over the
valleys will be converging and will appear bright.
    The condition seen in fig. 3, 6, which is intermediate between the
low and high focussed picture of the fibre, would be obtained by
shifting the lens half-way between these two positions. Hensen's
stripe is no doubt due to rays passing through the centre of the ridges
suffering little refraction in their course, and thus causing a brightness.

            *
                Mr.  J. B. Haycraft.     Upon  the Cause   of     [Feb.  3,
Dobie's line might, of course, be the reverse of this, no rays at this
point coining to the eye of the observer ; but we shall speak of this
more hereafter, when we shall show that there is some reason for sus
pecting at this point a distinct structure.
    Although it is indispensable to account theoretically for these appear
ances, yet to most persons a simple demonstration will carry more
conviction than any proof deduced from the laws of optics, however
well they be understood.      Instead of showing " what should be," we
will study " what is."
    For this purpose we will imitate as nearly as possible the figure of a
muscular fibre on a small scale, and it shall be made out of a substance
of uniform consistence throughout. What appearances will it present
on microscopic examination ?        I have proceeded in the following
manner: — A glass rod is heated in a spirit-lamp and plunged into
a bottle of Canada balsam ; it is then withdrawn, and a little drop of
the balsam is allowed to fall on a glass slide, or a thread of it may
be laid out on the surface of the glass.    Before the drop or thread has
solidified it is indented with the milled head of a fine screw, and
examined with a power of from twenty to fifty diameters, when cross
shadings are to be observed.      These are seen, moreover, to correspond
with the surface impressions, and not only so, but they are reversed on
altering the focus. Hensen's stripe is generally very well seen.        The
most beautiful and convincing object to study in this connexion is a
scale of the Lepisma.        These are sold as test objects with many
microscopes. They are oval in shape, transparent, and singly refractile
throughout, and beautifully ribbed in their length, these ribbings or
groovings being indeed so fine that a power of at least 500 diameters
 will be required to make out those points to be here described. Ton
would think on looking at one of these scales that a piece of muscle
 was flattened out before you on the field : no rough balsam model, but
a perfect illustration taken from the back of a tiny insect.
    The appearances it is needless to describe, for they are, almost to the
 minutest detail, those of a muscular fibre. The bright and dark stripe
 interchanging with every alteration of focus, Hensen's stripe, and
 Dobie's line (Krause's membrane) are all to be seen. In the case of
 the Lepisma scale the line of Dobie is in the centre of a bright band,
 which is broader than the dark band with Hensen's stripe. This is, of
 course, the other way in the case of the muscular fibre.
    We see, therefore, that a muscular fibre presents just those appear
 ances which a transparent body of uniform texture and of similar
 shape would possess.       However conclusive these proofs may have
 been, it is well to collect all evidence possible to show that these
  markings are nothing more than optical effects, to which end a very
  searching experiment was suggested to me by Professor Tait.          It is
  evident that if these cross bands are seen when parallel, or nearly

 1881.]          the  Striation   of Voluntary Muscular         Tissue.          371
parallel, rays of light are passing through the fihre, by using con
verging or diverging rays the appearance will be altered, and it will
be possible by careful adjustment of a lens to cause a total reversal of
the striping.      If a fibre be carefully focussed and a strong biconcave
diverging lens be placed between the stage of the microscope and the
mirror, and carefully moved about with the fingers, it will be possible
entirely to alter the fibre, causing a total reversal of the cross bands.
On withdrawing the lens, of course the fibre resumes its normal ap
pearance.      I  may mention that several lenses were tried before one
was found which would in at all a satisfactory manner show this phe
nomenon ; when successful the experiment is very striking.
    In opposition to my view is the one generally accepted, namely,
that the cross stripings are produced by differences along the fibre of
chemical composition, and refrangibility.
    Now, suppose that there were along the fibre two alternating struc
tures, A and B. Let A represent the bright stripe and B the dark
 stripe. If A has a higher or lower refractive index than B, it is
evident that although they were immersed in any number of fluids of
refrangibility varying from the lowest to the highest, yet A would
always be distinguishable from B, and the striping would always be
apparent.      Then, again, by placing the fibres in fluids of indices near
to that either of A or B, the more striking would be the contrast.                  If,
however, the fibre were homogeneous throughout, the striping being
nearly due to the form, then if the fluid and the fibre have the same
refractive index all striping will disappear.                 On Professor Tait's
suggestion,     I tried  a series  of fluids  formed    by mixing,    in various pro
portions, alcohol, whose refractive index is low, with oil of cassia, which
is high. In this way I have prepared specimens showing almost no
cross striee, the fibre appearing uniform until after most careful
examination.
    Dr. Klein has since shown me some muscular fibres of an insect.
They were quite smooth and cylindrical, and were unstriated. In these
specimens there were, on very close examination, cross lines separated
by comparatively wide intervals. It is possible that they represented
Dobie's lines.*
    But it may well be asked, What about the action of staining agents,
such as logwood, which is stated to tint the dark stripe and Dobie's
line ? Does this not show a difference of structure along the fibres ?
    Once having the clue it will be understood that just as the unstained
   * More recently my friends Messrs. Geddes and Beddard have demonstrated a Tery
curious condition in the muscular fibres of the Echinus, which my views entirely
explain. They noticed that in the same fibre some parts were cross striped, while in
parts no striation was to be seen. Hearing of my explanation of the markings, thoy
re-examined their specimens (which    I have also seen), and found that when the stride
were visible there, and only there, the fibre was ampullated.    (See fig. 5.)

                                                                      :         it

   We, however, affirm that the whole fibre           stained, and equally
                                                                 is
stained throughout. The bright band         undoubtedly stained, although
                                                      is
it appears not of the deep blue of the dark stripe when coloured                           by
logwood and this conclusion
              ;                     drawn not only from an examination
                                            is
of my own specimens, but also from some of great beanty shown                              to
me by     Dr. Klein. Why the bright band does not appear of so dark                        a
blue    is,
          that the apparent shading of the latter          added to the bine
                                                                      is
tint, producing a depth of colour. The most conclusive proof of this
is, that one can often reverse the colouring on readjusting the focus,
and that Hensen's stripe or the bright part of the dark stripe          only         is
of a faint light-blue, like that of the bright stripe.
   Picric acid stains muscle very readily, and colours it throughout.
The fibre to the naked eye            yellow and uniformly so, but when
                                            is
examined by the microscope, alternating yellow and shaded yellow
hands are to be observed, which reverse their position on changing
the focus.    With high focus — when the crests are bright in the un
                            a
stained preparation — they are of a bright yellow, while the valleys are
of a deeper yellow tint.
   To show the effects which        fibre of this shape can produce when
                                            a
transmitting monochromatic       light, nothing can be more conclusive
than the following experiment.        A slip of coloured blue glass held             is
obliquely between the reflector and the stage of the microscope, so that
blue rays pass through the fibre. It does not appear of a nniform tint,
but beautiful blue stripes are seen corresponding with the crests and
valleys, and varying with alterations of focus.      If piece of red glass
                                                                      a
be substituted for the blue slip, red cross stripes are seen in corre
sponding places.      For this experiment the fresh fibres of insects'
muse'e should be examined, for, with fine mammalian muscle, the light
is  not so good, owing to the higher power required.             This experi
ment has been introduced here with the description of stained muscle,
not that     can be strictly compared with an ordinary staining process,
              it

the tinting, supposing, as we do, that this       in reality nniform.

and on examination, what was my surprise to find that in some of
them the light stripes (valleys) were most brilliantly stained with
 carmine.     I was long puzzled at this, when it was at last discovered
that the picro-carmiDe had dried somewhat on the preparation, and
 the carmine had mechanically precipitated along the valleys, filling
 them up.      At the end of one or two fibres this precipitation had
 partially peeled off, showing undoubtedly the true nature of the phe
 nomenon.
     I have in my possession very beautiful alcoholic preparations stained
 with logwood.      At first sight, from a study of many of the fibres, one
 would be led to believe that the bright stripe is wholly unstained,
 while the dark stripes are of a beautiful violet.
    A careful examination, however, reveals the fact that such fibres
 are broken up transversely, looking like piles of coins, a very common
 occurrence, especially in preparations that have been long mounted.
 The coins, lying close to one another, with narrow chinks between, of
 course revealed transverse unstained tracts, which could well be mis
 taken for the bright stripe.
    More interest and discussion has hitherto accrued to the action
 of muscle on polarised light, than to the effects of staining reagents.
 We have seen that much difference of opinion exists : Briicke has
maintained that not only is the dark stripe (ridge), as all are agreed,
 doubly refracting, but that the whole of the light stripe is isotropous.
 I  myself was led to modify this, discovering that on careful focussing
 with a fibre not at all sheared in its length, the central part of the
                                                     I
 light stripe was undoubtedly anisotropous. This have afterwards seen
                                                  " Physiology," and have
 figured, as before mentioned, in Hermann's
introduced the diagram into fig. 2. It is a point of some practical
difficulty to mark exactly the positions of the cross bands while turning
the analyser, and thus changing the character of the field.            This
difficulty has been overcome completely by a suggestion of Professor
 Tait's, who has helped me much in this part of the work. Very fine
emery powder should be sprinkled over the preparation before covering
it ; for then, on examination, numberless little black specks will be
seen in the field.    A cross band of a fibre is selected for examfnation
which is exactly opposite one of these little specks, then when you
rotate you can definitely affirm, having the little black speck for your
guide, what change has occurred.
    Rabbits' muscles are very satisfactory objects for examination, as
they do not cleave across at all readily. The adductor muscles of the
leg should be excised, slightly stretched on a piece of wood, and
placed in 50 per cent, alcohol until they split readily into fibrils.
They may then be mounted in any ordinary fluid, a pinch of emery
powder having been sprinkled over the preparation before covering.

vestigation of mammalian muscle, while in the case of the insect one
of 300 diameters is quite enough.
   In the living and dead muscular fibre the whole of its substance is
doubly refracting.      The observations     of some modern observers
entirely agree with my own, in that, with crossed Nicols, the crests
(dark bands) and the centres of the valleys (bright stripes) appear
bright and therefore refract light doubly, and that there are two
dark bands on the slopes between them. (See fig. 2.) It does not
follow, however, that these two dark bands represent tracts of
isotropous substance.      This is the point at issue. The dark lines
between the valleys and ridges which appear when the Nicola are
crossed have been interpreted as marking the positions of cross bands
of singly refracting substance, but this is a fault of reasoning. If the
fibre were smooth and cylindrical it would then follow, but the fibre is
not, as we have already insisted.     These bands lie just on the sloped
parts of the fibre, those sections in fact which are oblique to the pass
ing rays ; and the explanation is now quite easy, for the extraordinary
ray passing through the fibre is naturally deflected at these parts, and
does not reach the eye of the observer.      Hence the body appears not
to transmit them at all at these parts.
   It is not difficult to explain the discrepancies between Brucke's
description of the bright stripe and my own.
   It is essential to be very scrupulous in the selection of a fibre for
examination.      It must not be at all twisted, or sheared in the
slightest degree, for then the cross stripes are not at right angles to
the long axis, and as their width is several times their thickness (in
the length) overlapping will to some extent occur.     This will certainly
lead to very confusing results, and the bright centre of the bright
stripe (valley) may well be overlooked.       Moreover, the fibre should
be slightly stretched and as small as possible.
   It has previously been mentioned that in many preparations the
fibres split up transversely in a most regular manner, and unless the
cover-glass be pressed upon, the little disks remain in position with
narrow chinks between them.         These chinks will be filled with the
isotropous fluid used for mounting, which will lead to very anomalous
appearances, and which may perhaps help to account for some of
Brucke's statements.      These fallacies may be avoided by a study of
the fresh fibres of insects' muscle.    Dytiscus and Hydrophilus muscle
has received a large share of the attention of histologists, but that
from the wasp or blue-bottle fly is quite as good. A leg should be
pulled from the trunk of a blue-bottle fly and this again forcibk
separated at the middle joint.      A piece of muscle will project from
one of the segments, which may be cut off and examined in a drop of
fluid expressed from the thorax of the fly. The polariscopic effect?
may then be made clearly out in the still contracting fibres.       I  haTc

    tested   all these points by a careful examination of insects' fibres
    with thin plates of selenite and mica.            This method is not so satis
    factory,  nor   do   the  differences   of  colour seen give such trustworthy
    evidence as may be obtained by the crossed Nicols alone.
       The Fibre during Contraction. — Living insects'              muscle may be
    examined and the changes observed when the waves of contraction
    pass along the fibre, or perhaps better still, they may be fixed with
    osmic acid.      The muscles from the leg of an insect are rapidly
   separated out on a slide, and a drop of weak osmic acid added which
   kills the fibres instantaneously,         fixing them in the position that they
   happen to be in.        On examination one generally finds fibres which in
   part of their course are contracted, and in other parts relaxed, when
   the differences      in appearance may readily be studied. It may here
   be observed     that the fibres bulge at the contracted part, so that if the
   surfaces     be examined         the focus of the microscope          must be ac
   commodated.
      The cross      stripes are nearer one to another and correspond, as
   before,   with    the ridges, and valleys seen at the margin, which are
   much more prominent and bolder in outline.
      In the Contracted Fibre the Striping is practically the same as in the
   Stretched    Condition. — The contracted         fibre exhibits just the same
  reversing of stripes on alteration of focus, and Dobie's line and
  Hensen's stripe can both be seen in the same positions as in the un-
  contracted muscle, provided the fibre is snitably placed for examina
  tion and not sheared in its length. We must entirely deny the common
  statement, first introduced, we believe, by Merkel and Engelmann, that
  in the contracted state the bright band becomes the darker.                If good
  specimens of insects' muscle be examined, which have been treated
  with osmic acid, and if the fibre be not sheared, the valley is always
  bright in the ordinary or deeper focus.             I  have verified this point in
  very many       cases.     Passing along a fibre from the relaxed end to a
 part where the contraction is fullest, the appearances vary in degree,
 but not in kind. The main features are in both cases the same, but
 the stripes are now narrower, and often it is not so easy to see Dobie's
 and Hensen's stripes.            This follows from the statement of Engelmann,
 viz., that " the bright stripes become darker than the dim ;" for he
 himself notices that at one point, or phase, in the contraction, no
 striping is to be made out. We agree with Ranvier that this is not
true, indeed it would be impossible for a muscular fibre with its con
figuration not to be marked across its length.
     This subject will call up to the mind of every working histologist,
appearances which he must have met with in other fields of research.
Many tissues naturally, or after clumsy manipulation, present am

bound together and seen on edge with the wavy outline towards the

in the frog's bladder is often faintly ampullated especially, perhaps
in chloride of gold preparations.     Cross stripes may also here be seen.
The fibres of Tomes, when a section of softened tooth is teazed, are
pulled out of the dentinal tubules, and, being of a soft and somewhat
elastic nature, on breaking they become often very beautifully am-

   In the winter of 1879-80, while examining fibres of the muscles                            of
a  newly-born child, a very curious discovery was made.         A nnclens
belonging   to  the  sarcolemma    was  seen beautifully striped.  It was
not in close apposition to the fibre, a very narrow chink intervening
On focussing with great care,       was seen that the cross bands upon

for light one, and vice versa. (Fig. 6.) Now, the curious point was thai

Last summer (1880) my friend Mr. Priestley communicated to me                                 a
similar and independent observation of his own, as a contribution
towards the maintenance of my views upon the formation of the
stripes.
    The position that we have reached              is   this   :   a muscular   fibre presents
such cross markings, varying with shifting the lens up                          or down, as   s
filament of homogeneous structure and similar shape.          have shown     I
this experimentally, and have illustrated    by simple     itexperiments
which     itin the power of anyone to test. This being the case,
               is                                                                             I
have searched to find      there be reason to assert any want of uni
                                    if
formity along the fibre, using various methods of staining.        This                       I
have failed to do, and have shown that the views commonly held are
to be explained simply by the shapes of the fibres.       As to the action
of muscle  on polarised light,    saw reason
                                         I   to dissent from the views                        of
Briicke, and subsequently found my own in accordance with those                               of
other recent observers.      differ from them in the explanation
                                     I                               offer           I
of the two dark bands seen with crossed Nicols, for here, again, the
Bhape of the fibre explains their presence without looking for any
special structure.

    So   far we are led to consider the fibre                 up of many ampul-
                                                         as made
    lated fibrils, packed side by side, forming an ampnllated fibre, these
    fibrils being uniform throughout, and joined together by some cement
    ing material, the nature of which we will not surmise. The only point
   which would suggest a definite structure along the fibril is the attach
   ment of the sarcolemma in insects' muscle to Dobie's lines.               There is
   no doubt that this membrane dips down and seems prolonged into
   Dobie's lines in a most beautiful and regular manner.               The signifi
   cance of this is very obscure, and is quite beyond me. There are
   many possibilities.     It may be, although there is no proof of            that   it,        a

 All those cross bands which have been described in ordinary voluntary
 muscle may here also be seen, and they are placed in the same rela
tions with the turned surface of the fibre. The dark stripe correspond

them.        (Fig. 7.) Dobie's lines may be made out with great ease, and
as there     is no sarcolemma here, they may be accounted for also purely
from the shape of the fibres.             Ihave often thought that Dobie's

 point more difficult to decide perhaps than in the case of the skeletal
 muscles.     Transverse cleavage takes place here also in the thinner
 part of the fibre, namely, in the bright stripe, but whether or not
 exactly in Dobie's line I have not yet definitely made out.
     A curious appearanoe often presented by insects' muscle, and some
 times also by that of the mammalia, has been described and figured by
 Mr Schiifer.      A paper descriptive of these he communicated to the
 Royal Society of London (1873), which came out later on in the
 '•
    Transactions " of this Society, and his observations are published
 also in the eighth edition of Quain's " Anatomy."            These have been
 almost entirely overlooked by French and German physiologists, yet
 in many English laboratories his observations have been verified, and
 his conclusions taught.
     They are well illustrated in a representation of the muscular fibre
of a Dytiscus, which may be seen in Quain's " Anatomy."               The dark
stripes are traversed longitudinally by dark rods, which end at both
 extremities in little knobs. These knobs lie in the borderland between
the bright and dark stripes.       The only point which I would add to
 his figure is this, that the knobs are joined across the clear stripes or
valleys by lines, just as they are so joined across the dark stripes,
although the lens must be depressed ever so little to make this ont.
These lines are, in fact, nothing more or less than the longitudinal
striae described many years ago as lying between the fibrillee of which
the fibre is composed, these little knobs lying in their course.            This
can, perhaps, most conclusively be made out in the following way.
Allow   a piece   of insect's muscle to remain in a drop of water for some
hours (which will vary with the temperature) until it has partially
putrefied.     Then cover and examine, when many of the fibres will
have separated towards their ends into fibrilloe.         One can then dis
tinctly  trace  the  chinks between   the separated   fibrillar  as being con
tinuous with the strise, on which the knobs are still seen, in the centre
of the fibre.     I think that the following is a feasible explanation of
these knob-like enlargements of the cementing substance seen as
longitudinal striae.     These knobs occur, as will be beautifully seen on
referring to the woodcut in Quain, on the slopes between the valleys
and the ridges.      The cementing substance dips down here with the
fibre itself, and if there be the slightest lateral obliquity it will appear
larger. The cementing matter is seen on edge, and differing as it
does from the muscle-substance in refrangibility, a distortion occurs,
giving rise not to a dark line as on the surface, but to a dark knob.
This is, in fact, but an optical delusion, for the strise are quit*
uniform, and were the fibre cylindrical would appear so. This may
be proved by the fact that very often if the rays of light from the
reflector are oblique, but one set of dots appears, which shift over to
the other side on twisting the mirror.        By shifting the preparation

  disappear from one part of the fibre to appear in another, showing
  that it is but an optical effect, and that no structure here exists.
     Before concluding         I    must gratefully acknowledge much help and
 sympathy which I have received in this investigation.
    To Professor Tait             I   have gone when in any difficulty, for an
 observer in a case such as this must have the aid of an experienced
 physicist, otherwise grievous error is but courted.                      To him, as has)
 been seen in the text,             I   owe many suggestions, and he has kindly
 entirely   looked     over   my paper.        Dr. Klein has shown me great kind
 ness in carefully examining my preparations                       from the histological
 point  of   view,    and   as has    before    been   mentioned, in showing me pre
 parations to corroborate my views.                    My thanks are also due to my
 friend Mr. John Priestley, for many hints, especially concerning the
 literature of the subject.

Figure   1.  This represents     a muscular fibre viewed with a very high power.          The
              borders are wavy .and the cross stripes correspond with these inequalities.
               (D) marks the positions of Dobie's dark stripes placed in the centres of
              the depression seen at the border.        (H) represents Ilensen's stripes, or
              Dobie's light stripes, placed on the summit of the ridges, in the centre
              of the dark    band.
Figure   2 shows the appearance        of the fibre with crossed Nicols.      The shaded parts
              are seen    on the slopes between the ridges and depressions.           They arc
              explained fully    in the  text.
Figure 3. A fibre is represented as seen with three positions of the lens. In (a) the
              lens is elevated and the depressions appear dark.            In (c) the lens is
              fully depressed      when    the stripes  are reversed,  the   depressions being
              now light with Dobie's dark stripe in the centre of them, and the crests
              dark but with Dobie's light stripe in the midst.               In (4) an inter
              mediate stage is seen.
Figure   4. This shows the     passage    of rays of light through the fibre. The convex
              parts converge      the  rays to focus A', A", A'", after which they diverge.
              The lens shifted up or down (vertically) over the ridges or depressions,
              will focus on the retina alternately converging and diverging rays.

    In this communication      the author describes additional parts of the
Megalania,     reconstructed   from  fossils exhumed by Mr. George Fred.
Bennett, at the same locality as the subjects of Part II, and sub
sequently transmitted. They were found about thirty feet distant
from the spot where the cranial fossils were imbedded, and are
deemed by their discoverer to be parts of the skeleton of the same
individual.
    The recognisable restorations constitute the termination and a
detached annular segment of the bony sheath, with one inclosed
vertebra, of the tail.        The average thickness of the sheath's sub
stance is one inch ; the coalesced portion includes three segments ;
and, save the last,     these with the antecedent detached segment sup
port osseous conical processes, in structure resembling the horn-cores
of the cranium, but of larger dimensions. Each segment supports
two pairs of such solid cones or cores.            The transverse diameter
of the antepenultimate segment taken across the tips of a pair of
cores is eleven inches ; the same diameter of the area of such annular
sheath is five inches ; the vertical diameter of the exterior of the
sheath is five inches and a-lialf.           These dimensions   support Mr.
Bennett's conclusion as to their relation to the skull ; and, supposing
the lizard's body originally entombed not to have undergone a dis
location affecting the two extremities now brought to light, their
relative distance agrees with the length of the animal, estimated from
proportions of previously described vertebra?.
    Detailed descriptions, with figures, of the parts of the horn- bearing
tail-armour are given, and comparisons are subsequently pursued in
examples of recent and fossil Beptilia and Mammalia, provided with
similar caudal armature.
    Illustrations of these and of the parts of Megalania compared

III.   " On a Method of Destroying the Effects of slight Errors of
       Adjustment in Experiments of Changes of Refrangibility
       due to Relative Motions in the Line of Sight." By E. J.
       Stone, F.R.S., Director of the Radcliffe Observatory,
       Oxford. Received January 17, 1881.
   Let arrangements      be made for the reversion of the prisms without
 any   disturbance    of  the other optical arrangements,    including, of
course, the position of the cylindrical lens, if one be used. Any slight
errors of adjustment which prevent the light from the star and the
comparison light from falling upon the train of prisms under the same
optical circumstances, so far as mere direction is concerned, will have
opposite effects in the reversed positions of the prisms ; but the
separation of the emergent lights due to relative motion will remain
unchanged by the reversal of the positions of the prisms.
   If, therefore, the apparent change of refrangibility due to relative
motion remains unchanged by the reversion of the prisms, all doubts
about the effects of errors of adjustment will be removed.       But if the
results in the reversed positions of the prisms sensibly differ, then the
existing errors of adjustment must be removed, or their effects
allowed for by taking a mean of the results in reversed positions,
before any reliance can be fairly placed upon the determination of
relative motions in the line of sight.
   A reversible spectroscope was arranged by me, and made by
                                     I
Mr. Simms, some years ago, but have never since had an equatoreal,
with a good driving clock, under my control with which the experi
ment indicated could be properly tried.
   With the direct prisms now in use, the required reversion can be
easily arranged.      I am not likely, for some time, to have the use of
a good equatoreal, and I, therefore, publish the plan with the hope
that some one more fortunately situated may give it a fair trial.
   The experiment is a crucial one, and, in my opinion, should be
tried.

         Section  I. — Nature  op  the Bimodular   Method and its
                                Improvement.
   The Bimodulus is a constant, which is exactly double of the modulus
of any system of logarithms. The Bimodular Method is derived from

the   familiar proposition that, when the difference of two numbers
is small, the difference of their logarithms is nearly equal to the
bimodulns multiplied by the difference and divided by the sum of the
numbers themselves. The improvement here for the first time effected,
consists in prefixing a brief preparation, which makes the method uni
versally applicable, and subjoining an easy correction depending on
the transformation of a well-known series proceeding by the odd
powers of the difference divided by the sum of two numbers, whereby
the number of places obtained is greatly increased.     This method is
here applied for finding the natural and tabular logarithms of any
number to twelve places of figures by means of a table of two pages
for each kind of logarithm, and to sixteen places by help of a seven-
place table of tabular or Briggs's logarithms.     An extremely simple
rnle, which, so far as I know, was never before imagined, enables ns
to pass from the logarithm to the number, that is, to find anti-
logarithms from the same tables. Although the method is applicable
to any system of logarithms, and was actually first applied by me to
the direct calculation of musical logarithms to the bases 2 (octave),
l2v/2 (equal semitone), and 81-^-80 (comma), and appropriate tables
have been constructed, I confine myself for brevity to natural and
tabular logarithms. The tables are constructed from existing mate
rials, but the method is capable of constructing them independently.

   Preparation. — To insure p being small in all cases,         I  have invented
the rule of preparation, founded on the fact that if N be the number
whose logarithm is sought, and a and b any two numbers of which
the logarithms are known, snch that ~Na-i-b=n+d, where n is the
next less number to              in the table, and d, the difference, is
less than the difference between two numbers in the table, then
log N=log (n+d) + log b— log a. In Tables I and                II  the difference
between two consecutive numbers is '001, and as there are 100 entries,
all the numbers lie between 1 and 1"1 ; so that if Na-r-6 is less than
1*1, the required reduction is effected.
   Preparation is accomplished in two lines of simple multiplication
and division, as follows : —
   The given number N is divided or multiplied by such a power of 10
as will leave the quotient or product as a decimal fraction between 1
and 10.    This is effected by simply shifting the decimal point.
   If the first decimal place is less than 3 times the integer (which is
always the case when the integer exceeds 3), divide by the integer and
divide the quotient by    l'l or 1*2. The result is less than l'l.
   If the first decimal place is more than twice the integer, then it is
always possible, generally in several ways, to find an integer between
1 and 10 which, used as a multiplier, will give a product of which the
integer is less than 13, and the first decimal place less than the integer.
The following rule embraces every case : — Multiply any of the numbers
1-30 to 1340 by 4; 1-340 to 1-80 by 7 ; 1-80 to 1-960 by 5 ; 1-900 to
1-99 by 6 ; 2-50 to 2-99 by 4 ; 3-80 to 399 by 3.           Then dividing this
product by    the integer the quotient  is less  than  l'l.
   This preparation is very convenient also for starting Wcddle's and

384        Mr. A.   J.   Ellis.         Improved Bimodular Method   of   [Feb   3,
Hearn's processes given by Mr. Peter Gray in the introduction to his
Tables for twelve-place logarithms, 1865 (first published in 1845), and
is also very much simpler than that proposed by Mons. Thoman in his
" Tables de logarithmes a 27 decimales," 18G7.
    Interpolation. — The finding of log N is thus made dependent on
finding log (n + d), where n is a tabular number and d is less than
•001.     We then find 2Md-=-(2n-f d), -which gives the "uncorrected"
logarithm of »+d, or the "quotient" x or z.                The multiplication
2M x d is effected by the multiples of the bimodulos given in the
tables, when M is not 1, the unit place of each multiple of 2M being
placed immediately below the determining figure of d, care being taken
to preserve as many places as are necessary for the final result. The
division is a single contracted division.          The resulting x or z has to
be "corrected" by the equations (5) and (6), as shown in Section III.
     Completion. — Having found log (n + d), we add the logarithm of the
 power of 10 by which we first divided, and the logarithm of any other
 divisor, and the arithmetical complement of the logarithm of the
 power of 10 or any other multiplier.         All these logarithms are gifen
 in the table. The result        is  the complete log N to the number of
 decimal places for which the table is adapted.
     Anti-Logarithms. — A logarithm being given we have to reduce it to
 the logarithm of a number between 1 and l'l. This is most con
 veniently done by subtracting from it (or adding to it) the logarithm
 of the largest power of 10, which will make the result lie between 0
 and log 10, and afterwards subtracting the next least logarithm of an
 integer between 1 and 10, and then the next least logarithm of a number
 between    l'l  and 2.   The logarithms of all these numbers are given in
 the table.     The result will be the logarithm of a number less than 11.
 We then subtract the next less logarithm in the table of interpolation,
 and obtain the equivalent to the corrected quotient x + c or z + Me of
  (5) and (6). We find the correction in the same way as for the
 quotient, and subtract           it,
                                thus obtaining x or z. Then we divide the
 bimodulus increased by this          or x by the bimodulus decreased
                                              z,                             by
                                                                            this
x   orz,  as in  (7), and  thus find   1+p,  which    the number correspond
                                                      is
 ing to the "quotient" in the direct method.          For " completion" this
 has to be multiplied by the numbers corresponding to all the logarithms
 subtracted in the preparation.
      Section     III. — Calculation         of the Bimoddlab Corrections.
   The principal peculiarity of this improved bimodular method                  con
sists in the calculation of the corrections and the determination
                                                                             in of

   By means of these equations the corrections can be calculated from
                  "
the " quotient      (that    is, the approximate values of x and           2) either
with or without existing tables of logarithms, or the quotient x or z
may be calculated to which a particular value of the first correction
is due.
   From these has been calculated the following table of the critical
values   of the first and second corrections, npon which the whole
practical use of the corrections depends.                 The quotients were first
taken to proceed from "Oml to -0m9 by steps of -0M1. Then the values
of the quotients were determined, which reduced either of the two
first corrections to 'OmI, n being variable, from which point the suffix
of 0, or the number of initial zeroes, changed, giving critical values of
the corrections.      Such quotients were then inserted in numerical
order.    The approximate numbers were obtained from the quotients
on the supposition that p was small enough to make nat. log (1 +p)
 =p, and tab. log (l+p)=Mp, to three places of significant figures.
   The suffix of 0 in the first correction, diminished by 1, shows the
number of places which are unaffected by that correction, that is, the
number of places in the uncorrected quotient which may be trusted
without corrections.         The undiminished suffix shows a number of
places which cannot be wrong by more than one unit in defect in the

last place.    The suffix of 0 in the second correction, diminished by 1,
shows     how many places of the quotient, after applying the first
correction, are left unaffected by the second correction, that is, how
many places can be trusted on applying the first correction only.
For natural logarithms it will      be seen that this never gives less than
bm+1 places,     that is, 2m + 1  places in addition to those determined
without correction.      Thus in Table I, where to is never less than 3,
we can always obtain sixteen places.          For tabular logarithms, as in
Table II, we must first observe a critical value in the numbers them
selves.    In that table the number 1 +p, whose logarithm is finally
sought, must be less than 1*001.       Hence, while in the upper part of
the preceding table of critical values, to will always be 3 or more, in
 the lower part, m — 1 will always be 3 or more, so that to will always
be 4 or more.     As far then as the quotient "0g434, the first correction
gives only 5 . 3 + 1 = 16 places, and this is the largest quotient that
 can commence with *03.       If the significant figures are greater than
 434, then to will be 4, and up to the quotient *04778 we can trust
 5 . 4=20 places, and beyond it we can even trust 19 places.        Observe
 that *049 at the bottom of this table is followed by *081 at the top
 (II, second column), for which, also, the second corrections leave
 5 . 3 + 4=19 places unaffected.
    But in determining the full number of places of the first correction
 from the uncorrected quotient by equations (12) and (IS), we are,
 of course, obliged to take so many significant places, that on cubing
 the result and multiplying by the proper coefficient, no error affecting
 the full number of places should be committed.            The number of
 places required for this pnrpose is so large that if we calculated the
 result directly, the present method of correction would be illusory.
 Hence it is necessary to use common seven-place logarithmic tables
 which can be trusted to six places. Consequently, we can use only
 six significant places in the quotient for finding the correction, and we
 thus introduce an error not exceeding half a unit in the last place in
 excess or defect.     On estimating the limiting effect of this error,
 I find practically that on using six significant places of the uncor
 rected quotient to determine the first correction, we may trust all
 six places of the correction found.      The total number of places that
 can be trusted, when this error is allowed for, depends on the quotient.
 Let r be the significant places of the quotient converted into a decimal
 fraction with one unit place. Then the real quotient is *0M1 x r, but
 on taking only six significant places, we use as a quotient *0„1 X r+
 •0„+Bl X 5, and the error thus made in the correction may be taken as
 the term involving r2 in the cube of this number divided by 12M2,
  that is, as *0Sm+elxl5r3-=-12M2.      Then, putting 16rs-4-12M»=10 and
  100, and finding the corresponding values of r, we obtain the critical
 values of the quotient where the suffix of 0 in the error of the

    But although it is by no means difficult or very troublesome to use
the formulae (13) and (17) for finding the first correction, it '»

may be thoroughly trusted, but in the              completion       an error of one
unit in the twelfth place may easily creep in unless " full corrections"
are used.      These "short corrections" have been calculated from the
formula} (15) and (19), by assuming successive values of the first
correction, as               '0n15, -0n25 and so on, and calculating tie
corresponding      value    of  the quotients.     But in the table itself these
corrections are entered as '0nl, '0n2, &c. The limiting correction is
reached when the corresponding quotient is the next least to that due
to the number l'OOl.           These twelve places are fully as many as are
required    for  ordinary purposes, and for them only thirteen out of the
eighteen places in the tables should be used.
              Section      IV. — Bimodular Tables      and Examples.
   Table I applies to natural logarithms giving from nine to sixteen
places, according to circumstances, with no corrections, twelve places
with short corrections, and fourteen to sixteen places with fall
corrections.
    Rule  to  find the logarithm from the number.
                                                           — Reduce the given
number to the form of a decimal fraction with an integer less than 10.
   Multiply and divide by such whole numbers less than 13 as will
reduce the number to one less than Tl, as shown in Section II.
   Find the next less number in " 1. Table for Interpolation," and
first subtract it from the reduced number, then omit the decimal

point, and multiply by 2, forming the dividend ;" secondly, add this
next less number to the reduced number, and then omit the decimal
                          "
point, forming the divisor."
   Divide the dividend by the divisor by simple contracted division to
as many places as are required.           Correct the quotient, as may be neces
sary, by the table or formula of correction, No. 6 or 5.
   Add the logarithms of the divisors and the arithmetical complements
of the logarithms of the multipliers used in forming the rednceJ
number, to find the full corrected logarithm.
   Table   II   applies to Briggs's or Tabular Logarithms, giving from
nine to sixteen places, according to circumstances, with no correc

    Rule. — Proceed precisely as for natural logarithms, except that
 instead of multiplying by 2 it is necessary to multiply by the tabular
 bimodnlns, by help of the multiples given in No. 3.
    Tables I and II. Rule to find the number from the logarithm. — Sub
 tract the logarithm of the next lower power of 10, and then, in order,
 the next lower logarithm in the lower, and then that in the upper
 part of the table " 2. For Preparation," and afterwards the next lower
 logarithm in the table for interpolation.
    Considering this as an approximate logarithm of a reduced number,
 find the correction as if it were a quotient by No. 5 or 6, and subtract
 (instead of adding) the correction, which reduces it to the form of a
 quotient or approximate logarithm.
    Add the resulting number to and subtract it from the bimodulus
 (which is 2 for natural logarithms) and divide the sum by the
 difference.
    Multiply the quotient in succession by the numbers corresponding
 to the logarithms subtracted.     The result is the number required.
    Examples, fully worked out, with explanations.
 Let                       N=192 699 928 576=(76)6.
 Then calculating the value of 6 nat. log 76 from Wolfram's tables

 work.

    Here a,  b, e                                          begins with 1*9,
where the first decimal place is more than 3 times the integer, a is
multiplied by 6 to produce 11*56 . . ., a decimal fraction of which the
integer 11 is less than 13 and more than twice the first integer 5.
Both 5 and 4 would have also answered.          The divisor 11 is separated
off by ), and in the quotient c the next less number P051 in the table
for interpolation is similarly separated. This leaves c— 1-051 to the
right of ), with the decimal point already omitted.        Then this diffe
rence is multiplied by the bimodulus 2, to obtain the dividend d. The
whole of c is added to the separated part 1*051, and then the decimal
point is omitted, giving e. As the difference c=-04905, lies between
'03106 and *04493, we can certainly obtain twelve places without cor
rection (Table I, No. 4), and as it lies between -081 and -04894 we can
obtain seventeen places with full corrections (Table I, No. 5). We

   enough to allow of obtaiiang eighteen places, that is, fourteen signifi

   must remain for the last contracted divisor, we shall require only
   fifteen places of the divisor, and the last five are rejected (shown

   The preparation a, b, c, is similar to that in Ex. 1, but 5 is nsed as
the multiplier by way of variety.         The difference c— T070 being
       . . ., which lies between '03653 and '03303, we cannot be certain

of more than ten places without correction (Table II, No. 4). As only
twelve places are wanted, we use the short corrections and work to
thirteen places. The chief peculiarity relates to the multiplication of
c — 1-070 by the bimodulus by means of the multiples in Table II,
No. 3, omitting all the decimal points. The integer of the multiple is
placed under the determining figure of the multiplicand, and the
multiple is then written out as far as necessary, neglecting the point,
but regulating the last figure.    It is best to write in the integer 0, as
in line e, to preclude error. As the quotient must begin with -03, only
ten  significant places are wanted, and hence only eleven places in
the divisor g, the four underlined 5556 are therefore rejected.    The
correction k is found from Table  II, No. 6, as belonging to a quotient
between -0321 7 and 03232.   The rest is sufficiently explained in the
notes.   The result is accidentally correct to thirteen places.
   Here a is the given tab. log to eighteen places. We first subtract
 11 log 10, or the characteristic.     Next, if the remainder were greater
 than any logarithm in the lower part of Table II, No. 2, we should
subtract that. But in this case it is not, and hence we proceed to
the upper part of No. 2, and subtract the next less, or tab. log 1*9.
This completes the preparation, as the difference c=a—b, lies between
the tab. logs of 1*014 and 1-015 in No. 1, the table for interpolation.
Hence, subtracting tab. log 1*014, we find tab. log e, of which the
number e has to be found.          Now, the formula (7) applies only to an
uncorrected z=tab. log         e',
                                 which cannot differ from tab. log in the       e
three first significant figures. In the direct process, tab. log        found
                                                                            e   is
from tab. log  e'   by adding the correction found by Table II, No.                       5.
Hence we have only to subtract this correction            which
                                                         /,        calculated
                                                                       is
from the same first six significant figures in both cases, as shown in
the example.       Having found this uncorrected tab. log e, we add          to      it
and subtract   it   from, the bimodulus, obtaining       kand   respectively,
                                                                   I
and thus find e=k+l.          Now, tab. log   e'cannot be greater than the
greatest difference between two tab. logs in Table II, No.                "for  1,

1-0010005    . . .  ,  and  must  be  greater than      1,

mence with l-000.         As the modulus divides out, this conclusion holds
for all systems     of  logarithms. As the last divisor in the contracted
division must have two digits for safety,      itfollows that the number of
digits in the quotient       k-±l=e,  will be one  less than the number of
digits in the divisor, that is, than the number of decimal places in the
given logarithm. And as the first of these digits           a whole number,
                                                              is

308              Mr. A.  J.  Ellis.      On   the  Potential Radius           [Feb.   3.
it follows that the number of decimal places in the quotient k + l, iriH
be two less than in the given logarithm. Moreover, as the last decimal
place is always approximate, it follows that the number e cannot be
found with certainty to more than three decimal places less than the
 number of decimal places in the given tab. logarithm.                  Hence, in tie
 present  case,  although  tab.  log   e  is  known     to eighteen    places  of deci
mals, e is known with certainty only to fifteen places of decimals (and
sixteen digits).     But the error in the next place (or digit) will not
probably exceed one unit.
   Having found e, we have to multiply it in succession by the num
bers corresponding to the logarithms subtracted in the preparations
in this example, 1-014, 1'9, and 1011. This is most readily done in the
way sufficiently explained by the notes in the example.                 The resulting
number    is  accidentally   correct    to   seventeen     digits,  but  only sixteen
can be used with certainty.         Hence, if we use this bimodnlar method
of finding logarithms and anti-logarithms, we should always find the
logarithms to two or three places of decimals more than we require
digits in the final number to be found.
V. " On the Potential Radix as a Means of Calculating Loga
      rithms to any Required Number of Decimal Places, with a
       Summary of all Preceding Methods Chronologically Ar
       ranged;' By Alexander J. Ellis, B.A., F.R.S., F.S.A.
      Received January 17, 1881.
   In the tables attached to my paper " On an Improved Bimodalar
Method of Computing Logarithms, &c." (" Proc. Boy. Soc," vol. 31,
p. 381),   the logarithms used were all taken direct,                or immediately
calculated, from the tables of Wolframm and Gray.                    But a complete
method of calculating logarithms should be independent of extraneous
aid and be applicable to the first construction of tables of logarithms.
I shall here show that my improved bimodular method is capable of
furnishing a practical means of calculating natural logarithms, and
hence logarithms to any base and to any number of places of
decimals.
   By the term positive numerical radix            I  shall understand a table of
the numbers r, l'r,      l +  'Omr,  with     their    corresponding natural loga
rithms, where r varies from 1 to 9, 0m means a series of to zeroes, and
m varies from 1 to any required number. The word Radix in this
sense is adopted from R. Flower, 1771, mentioned below.                        By the
term negative    numerical   radix   I  mean     a   similar  table  of  1 — -0»,r, and
the negatives of their corresponding logarithms.                When these radixes
(forming    an  English plural,   as  radices   would     be misleading)    hare been

constructed     to the requisite number of decimal places, logarithms and
anti-logarithms can be calculated bj various methods.          The improved
bimodular method requires a much less extended radix for the same
number of decimal places than any other method.             Thus, to find tab.

    For the details of the method         see  my former paper.       The pre
paration is here carried a step further than there, before the inter
polation. We first multiply by 5 and then divide by 9, as in Ex. 2
 of my former paper, but the division by 9 is now carried to twenty-
three places of decimals, and then 1*07, a number in the radix, is
 separated off as a new divisor of c, giving d, where l-0005 is separated
 off as the next less number in the radix.         But we might have used it
 as a diviRor, and should have then found TOO 001 833 078 307 160 0
 . . . from which still      more decimal places could be obtained in the
 final result. But stopping at d, we form the dividend e and divisor/,
and then find the quotient g.         The correction is obtained from the
 formula    in  my   former  paper, Table  II, No. 5. But as these correc
tions involve the use of other tables, they would be illegitimate in
 first constructions, which would give only fourteen decimal places
 correct in place of twenty. The rest is as usual.
    The disadvantage of this method by the positive numerical radix, is

the necessity       for frequent divisions, as by 1"07, l-0005, 1 '00001, <fcc,
very   simple,   it   is true, but rather lengthy.         These are avoided by the
 use of the negative nnmerical radix.
    Taking the preparation          a,  b,  c  as   before,  we begin with c, and
instead of dividing out by l-07, we only see how often 1'07 will go in
the three first significant figures 705, and finding it to be 6, we
multiply c by 0'6, producing d, and subtracting this from c, we obtain
d— 1 — -06. After this the number of times that 1006 goes in 6321

e by '026, subtract the result
                                       /  from e, and obtain ex (1 — '026). It is
 evident that by this process the number of zeroes with which the
decimal fraction commences can be increased by at least one at every
multiplication by (1 — '0,„r) a number in the negative radix. We
stop when sufficient zeroes are obtained to apply the improved bi-
modular method for a sufficient number of places. We might, how-

sum    (in this case 2) -would amount to multiplying                     the significant
figures by the modulus only, which is Thoman's rule.                       In that case
there would be no correction.             The completion consisting of adding
the logarithms of      the   divisors   and   subtracting those of the multipliers,
is the usual one, but as the negative radix gives —tab. log (1— '0mr)
direct, there is no occasion for using arithmetical complements.                     We
might, also, have continued the process till all the decimal places
were zero, and then have made the whole work one of completion.
The last half of the process need not be gone through, as the mul
tipliers in the negative radix can be taken from it at sight. This is
the process of Mr. Weddle, the inventor of the negative radix.
   The number may be recovered from the logarithms in various ways
from the positive radix, and, among others, by my improved bi-
modular method, or in Mr. Weddle's method, from the negative radix.
Hence the problem is reduced to finding a simple way of calculating
the positive and negative radixes.                  Before explaining the method
proposed    in  this paper,    however,     it  will  bo best to prefix a chrono
logical summary of the methods actually proposed for calculating
logarithms with or without a radix, and with or without an annexed
indication of the means employed for calculating the radix.*

to r=9, and m= 1 to m=8 with their tabular logarithms to fifteen
places of decimals.        The fifteenth place is often more than one unit
wrong, and two other errors occur, namely, tab. log 4= '60205 9991

produced in the chiliads.           Briggs does not explain how he calculated
 this table. He uses it to interpolate in his chiliads, and finds the
logarithm by means of a series of divisions with a continually
 augmented divisor, which is in fact the product of the successive
factors into which the number is gradually resolved, but he does not
explain this contrivance. He finds the number corresponding to the
logarithm by subtracting the next less logarithms successively and
multiplying by the corresponding numbers,                      a method generally
adopted.

Logarithms."       Flower introduces the word Radix, here preserved (a
memoriam.       He apparently used it because he considered all numbers
between 1 and 10 to be roots of 10.            He applies the term to several
tables.    First,   " the cube radix of 10," a series of cube roots,
10, 3v/10, sv/3\/10> &c., each expressed as decimals to ten places,
ending at l'092=r, and then each term is again expressed as a
series of cubes of r.       He shows how to find the tabular logarithms of
any number from this table, and actually finds tab. log 2 to ten places

                                               He next calculates " the square
Radix of 10," a scries of square roots, 10, */l0,               v/10, &c, with
                                                        By this he proved the
work with the cube radix. But finding the labour much lessened
by the smaller intervals between these square roots, and still more
so when the two radixes were combined, he was led (p. 9) to the
"classical radix," which is so called because of the "classes" into
•which the numbers          l-0mr were divided by the different values of
m, corresponding        to   my positive numerical radix, the number of
the class being m+l.           This he calculated, apparently from the two
                                   " both ways," as he
first  radixes   separately, or                            says, to ten decimal
places, to l'09l.        He subsequently enlarged his "square radix,"
under the      name     of  the square-square      radix, and added another,
 called the cube-square          radix, of the form 10, 3v/'10, V^v^lO,
 •v/v^v/lO,    &c,  and  from   these   he calculated his classical radix up to
 r0ul and twenty-three places of decimals, of which he believed

twenty-two to be correct, as was actually the case, except for tab.
logs of 1'4, 1'045, and 1'089, for which only twenty-one places were
correct.     To use this radix he gave three rules, all original, called
      "
the direct," the "reverse," and the "reflected" rules. It is the last
one which is most valuable, and which he mainly exemplifies.            This
rule consists in preparing the number by reducing it to a decimal
fraction having 0 as its whole number, and then multiplying it in
succession by numbers of the form l'0wr till the result is unity, then
the sum of the complements of the logarithms of these numbers
(given in the radix) will be the logarithm of the reduced number.
This was at the time an entirely original conception, and the
method of working it out, which was totally different from Briggs's,
gave the simplest means for finding tabular logarithms to twenty
places. I give these details because Raper and Horeley, as well as
Hutton (who reports their opinions, in the *'first edition only, 1785, of
his mathematical tables, p. 72, foot note), who had evidently very
 insufficiently studied Flower's work, considered his process to be
           "a                           " of
merely          large exemplification          Briggs's. Although Flower's
 method of finding the number from the logarithm agrees with Briggs,
 and although he speaks of Vlacq, I believe that he never saw either
 Briggs's or Vlacq's works containing the radix, which were expensive
and difficult to procure.        He seems to have known of them chiefly
 from *Sherwin's tables. Robert Flower was an obscure writing-
 master at Bishop's Stortford, where he was buried, aged 63 years and
 unmarried, on the 23rd of February, 1774, just three years after his
 book,
          " printed for the author," was published. It consequently
 rapidly disappeared.       It is not mentioned in Mr. Glaisher's catalogue
  (Rep. Br.   As.,  1873), it is not in De Morgan's catalogue ; I found no
  copy at the British Museum, at Oxford, or Cambridge, or at the
  Royal Society.      But there were two copies in Mr. Graves's collection
  at University College, London, one of which, at my suggestion, has
  been presented to tbe British Museum.

  XI (1802-3). Leonelli re-discovered Briggs's method, and having
  fortunately obtained a copy of Flower's book from M. Eveque, who
  bought it in London, reproduced his radix for tabular logarithms to
  1'0101 and up to twenty places only, added another radix for natural
  logarithms to the same extent, and gave Flower's rule, with his name.
  This work was translated into German by "Leonhardi in 1806, with
  numerous changes.        Only one copy of the original work was known
  to exist, presented by the author to the city library of Bordeaux, from
  which it was freprinted, with a preface, in 1876, by M. Hoiiel, who
  had already given from it an account of Flower's rule, with a radix,

a potential negative radix for natural logarithms, and as ouch was
partly an anticipation of my conception, explained below.    But he did
                          —
not form the powers of 1 '0M1, he merely tabulated    — r log (1— '0.1)

He therefore performed   the division by the values of the powers of
1 — -0M1, by means of a continual multiplication by '0W1 and subtrac
tion, which makes his process simple, but very lengthy.       is, how   It
ever, entirely original. He did not apply his metbod to the discover?
 of the number from the logarithm.

of Manning's. But it consists, in fact, of a complete negative numerunl
radix for both tabular and natural logarithms for sixteen decimal places
down to —log (1 — 'Ool), calculated by the usual series for — log (1—                z),

 Mr. Gray obtained his first knowledge of a positive numerical radix,
 never having seen Briggs's or Flower's, and it contained the first of his
 enlarged positive numerical radixes for twelve decimal places, containing
  log r from r=l to r=9, log Vr, and logl Oj^r, from m=l to m=5,

 one which holds only for fourteen digits).          Then, taking these as
 constants, he multiplies any number up to one of these numbers, by
 successive powers of l'0nl, using binomial coefficients, and subtracts
 the tab. logs of these powers from the tab. log of the constant.        He
finds the number from the logarithm by a similar process.

adapted to periods of three digits. Mr. Thomas Warner, who assisted
Mr. Gray to publish these tables, showed how they might be applied
to Flower's rule in periods of three figures by means of *Crelle's
Itechentafeln for the multiplication by three digits.   This is the latest
simplification   of  Flower's rule.     I have  been  much    indebted to

ingenious transformation of the positive numerical radix effected by
subtracting the logarithmic series from its first term, so that instead
of placing nat. log l'O.r against the number V0mr in the radix,
Professor Hoppe places '0mr— nat. log l'0mr against it.        This trans
formed radix is calculated from r=l to r=9, and m=l to m=15 to
thirty-three places.    The calculation is consequently an alteration of
Flower's reflected rule, adapted to natural logarithms, by which many
figures are saved. It is probably, therefore, the shortest rule yet dis
covered.    A reversed process gives the number. Table IV gives a
multiplier of at most two digits, or a divisor of at most one digit, by
which any number can be reduced to the form -9 . . ., which over
comes the principal difficulty in the use of Flower's reflected rule.

     By the positive potential                       radix         of natural logarithms,                 I    mean       s
table containing 10r, 2r, (l'l)r, (l'0„l)r and their natural logarithms
generally from r= 1 to r=10, but for 2r it suffices to go to r=3, and for
(l"l)r    to r=8, and from m=l to m= any required amount. By the
negative    potential radix of natural logarithms, I mean a table containinj;
the numbers (1 — '0ml)r within the same limits, and the negatives oi
their natural logarithms. If the improved bimodnlar method of my
former paper be used, the number of places which can be determined
from 'Oml as a quotient without correction is 3»i-f-3. By any other
method we cannot secure more than 2m places.          I was led to the con
struction of a potential radix by the bimodnlar method.         In the case
of the numerical radix, the ratio of any two consecutive nnmbers
r0„r for a constant m and variable r, continually diminishes, but
sufficient was gained for the action of the method, if the ratio remained
constant, that is, if the consecutive     numbers were the consecutive
powers (l-0,„l)r, having the constant ratio 1*0M1.       Again, as such s
power is very nearly equal to a number V0mr in the numerical radii,

could be obtained with the same accuracy as from a numerical radii,
yet the process     much longer with the former, and hence

that the real use of the potential radix       to calculate the nnmerical is
radix. This       still more the case for the negative potential radii,
                   is
which does not succeed in diminishing the work at all, and              here                                      is
simply introduced for calculating the very useful negative numerical

    The first pair would give a potential radix determining logarithms
 to at least twelve decimal places without correction. The second
pair would give one determining logarithm with at least forty-two
places correct, and generally many more.
    Having found nat. log (l + "0ml) for the extreme value of m, proceed
thus: — Form (l + 0'„l)r up to r=10, and the corresponding loga
rithms. Both operations are performed by simple addition or sub
 traction. Then find nat. log (l + "0m_il) either direct from the
series or by the improved bimodular method from the next least
 (l + '0ml)9 and next greater (l + 'O^l)10, of which the latter will give
more places, or by both methods, to check the work.              Then find the
                                  l
numerical radix for the stage + -Omr from the potential radix to this
extent.     Next proceed with the potential radix for the stage
 (l '0„_1l)r whence derive the numerical radix for this stage, and so
    +
on till we obtain (1"1)8, which is just a little larger than 2, and from
                                                                               "
which nat. log of 2 and its powers may be found, which will include
any number, however great.
                                     I
    In order to make this clear, give a short positive and negative
potential radix to twenty-one places of decimals up to 1'091, which
with corrections (obtained from a table of cubes, like Barlow's, of
numbers of four digits, from the formula \2c=a? where x is the quotient
to four significant places, and c is calculated also to four significant
places)    will give fourteen   decimal    places  at least,   and sometimes
more.     I then show    the mode of      calculating  the   numerical   radix
from it.     It  must be remembered      that the nat. log. l'OOl is approxi
mate,   the digits after the eighteenth        are 16681 in place of 167.
Hence the tenth multiple will not have after the eighteenth place
670, but 668, and similarly in other cases.        The three last places are
given to avoid such errors and make eighteen places perfectly correct.
    Here we may suppose that nat. logs of l'Ogl, l'Ol, l'l,and 1 — '0?1,
1 — -01, have been calculated      directly from the formula. Then the
powers of these numbers, and the multiples of their logarithms are
obtained by simple addition and subtraction, and the potential radix
is constituted except as regards 2 and 10. The calculation of nat.
logs of 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 1 -4- nat. log 10 to upwards of 260 decimal
places, by independent methods, by Professor J. C. Adams (" Pro
ceedings," vol. 27, p. 92, for 7th February, 1878) obviates any necessity
for the separate calculation of them by the present or any other
method, but they could be calculated by this method, if it were
necessary.
   The next     step is to calculate   the   numerical radix, or nat. log
(l + '0mr). Take for example l-004, which is very slightly less than
(l'OOl)4 of which the nat. log is known. Then my improved bimo
dular method, suppressing the details of the division, gives —

    The result is correct to the last or twentieth place.              If  we had
formed log     a  from  the  next   less  or (l'OOl)3,  the  difference    between
the numbers would have been so large that the result would have been
correct to thirteen places only, and we should have required higher
stages in the radix to obtain twenty places.                 Hence the nearest
number should always be selected.
    To find — nat. log (1 — -004) =— nat. log '996, we should deduce it
from— nat. log. (1— 'OOl)4, and as the difference in this case, which
is always the approximate quotient, and hence logarithm, is less than
'066, and T'T x (¦056)3=-01618, we should obtain sixteen places without
correction, and four with correction, or twenty places in all.
    We thus proceed to form the whole of this stage of the numerical
 radix, but we cannot obtain twenty places in all cases.                  Thus for
 1-009, the difference       from (l'OOl)9 is -0^6084, the quotient is
 •043508,    and  the  correction  =^ x (•043508)S=0U3594,           so that we
 should obtain only eighteen places, that is to say, although the
 potential radix is calculated to twenty-one places, it will not furnish
 a numerical radix of more than eighteen places when we begin with
 the stage 1*0S1, and hence will not give logarithms of general numbers
 to more than sixteen places certain.
     In the stage l'Ol the radix of that stage will not furnish so manj
 places, and we have to reduce to the preceding stage, which is now
 supposed to be fully calculated for both the positive and negative
 numerical radixes.       Thus for nat. log 1'04 as derived from 4 nat. log
  r01, the difference is -036040, giving correction '0^1 836, and henc*
  fourteen places.    But on dividing by 1'04 we obtain 10s58 . . . and
  the difference from 1"036, of which the natural logarithm in a pre
  ceding stage is known, is '042 . . ., the logarithm of which can be
  found to eighteen places. If more still were required we should divide
  by 1"035, obtaining 1'048       ...    of which we can find the logarithm
  through that of 1'048, to twenty places at least. Hence if the potential
  radix has been commenced at a sufficiently high stage and to a sufficient
  number of decimal places, a numerical radix for natural logarithms can
  be calculated to any number of places, and from it the natural logarithm

of any number, such as the modulus of any other system of logarithms
can be found, and its reciprocal, whence the radix for that system can
be calculated  by simple multiplication.    This is sufficient to show the
practicability of the present method,    and generally the comparatively
small trouble which it would occasion for the first construction of
logarithmic tables.
VI. " On the Influence of Temperature                     on the Musical Pitch      of
         Harmonium Reeds."                By Alexander J. Ellis,         B.A., F.R.S.,
         F.S.A. Received January 17, 1881.
  In my " Notes of Observations on Musical Beats," I stated (" Proc.
Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 532) that the influence of temperature on
harmonium reeds was,           so   far   as   I   was aware, unknown.
                                                             Since then
I have made some observations which at least approximately deter
mine      but there are so many sources of small errors (stated below)
         it,
that still more uncertainty must attach to the results, than to the
determination of the influence of temperature on the pitch of tuning-
forks (ibid., p. 523).   Roughly we may say that the pitch of harmo
nium reeds       affected in the same direction as that of tuning-forks
                is
(heat  flattening  and cold sharpening), and very nearly to twice the
amount, that         is,
                    by about     in 10,000 vibrations for each degree

Fahrenheit.    The following       the process pursued with the exact
                                          is
figures obtained —   :
   Towards the end of November, 1879, in the          South Kensington
Museum, with artificial temperatures (observed in each case) varying
from 53° to 60° F. on different days,     determined the beats which all
                                                   I
the reeds of Appunn's treble tonometer (ibid., p. 527) made with
Scheibler's forks (ibid., p. 525).  On 1st September, 1880, and again
on 3rd September, 1880, at constant natural temperatures of 73° and
79° F. respectively,    took the beats of twelve of the reeds (the same
                           I
on each occasion) with the same forks of Scheibler with which       had       I
measured those reeds        in November, 1879.
    Itis, of coarse, impossible to say whether either forks or reeds were
precisely of the same temperature as the air. The reeds were inclosed
in the wooden chest of the tonometer, which had been reposing in                    a
glass wall-case in the same room during     he night, and might not
have fully acquired the general steady temperature of the room.   The
beats for each reed were counted 10 times each for 10 seconds, with
each of two, and sometimes three forks, and the mean of each set of
beats was employed.    The known pitch of the forks at 59° F. (ibid.,
p. 525) was then reduced to the temperature of the observation on the
supposition, that the number of vibrations altered by    in 20,000 for
                                                                    1

 414         Mr. A.    J. Ellis.    On Influence   of Temperature         [Feb.  3,
 1°  F. (ibid.,   p.  523).    By adding or subtracting1        the mean of     the
 observed beats from this calculated         pitch of the fork, the pitches of
 the harmonium reeds at those temperatures were determined, and tte
 mean of all the determinations for each reed was taken.               In all case-
 I calculated to two places of decimals, but the second place cannot Ve
 depended on when counting the beats ; and as the result is consider
 ably affected by the second place, the process is not so satisfactory as
 could be wished, and must be regarded as only preliminary.               The ltss
 of pitch in proceeding from the lower to the higher temperatures tins
 determined was divided by the number of vibrations at the lower tem
 perature, and also by the number of degrees F. of difference of teirpe-
 rature.    The result or coefficient of temperature, being the alterarion
for 1 vibration and 1° F., would serve to reduce one pitch to the otier,
on the supposition, which cannot be more than approximately correct,
that the alteration for temperature is uniform, and is the same for
reeds of very different pitches and makes.           Such a coefficient is, how
ever, clearly better than none at all, and is especially useful in deter
mining pitch by Appunn's instrument.
    In the following table the number of the reed is that marked on
Appunn's treble tonometer (ibid., p. 527).             The "pitch" means the
number of double vibrations in a second made by the reed, on the
three occasions of observation already mentioned, and as the tempe
rature was variable during the first observations, made on different
days, though constant on the same day, this is annexed in a separate
column.      As harmonium reeds are subject to rather sudden small
alterations from causes not yet investigated, it is not possible to be
perfectly sure that all the reeds would have shown precisely the same
pitch at the same temperature for observations made at intervals of
more than nine months.           I am inclined to think that reeds 22 and 23
must have so altered.          In other observations on reed 22, made 14th
July,   1880,  at  71°"5 F., I  obtained practically the same results as here,
differing from those of all the other reeds. The observations on that
day were not sufficiently numerous nor exact to be here recorded, bni
they agree very well with those now given. The flattening of the
reeds for each increase of temperature is quite unmistakable, even in
the passage from pitch       II  to III, with a difference of only 6° F.      The
pitch   III of reed 26 is certainly a bad observation, as the results of
the determinations by the two forks differed much more than usual,
and it should, therefore, be thrown out of consideration.             Altogether
for such a small difference as 6° F. the observations could not be made
with sufficient accuracy to secure trustworthy resnlts.             Even for the
greatest difference     of temperature, 26°   F., the  difference  of pitch never
amounts to so much as "9 vibration in a second for the reeds observed.
    The three last columns give the coefficients of temperature arising
from comparing these three pitches two and two, namely, I and EI,

I. "Oil     the Influence of the Molecular           Grouping in Organic
        Bodies on their Absorption in the Infra-red Region of th~
        Spectrum." By Captain W. DE W. Abney, R.E., F.R.S., and
        Lieutenant-Colonel Festing, R.E. Received February 5,
        1881.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The authors describe the apparatus used by them in their research
and their plan of mapping the absorption spectra, the results being
 given in wave-lengths. The source of light for obtaining a continuous
 spectrum was the incandescent positive pole of an electric light, the
 electricity being generated by an M. Gramme machine.             The light
 was passed through tubes containing the fluid, and the absorption
 spectra photographed in the infra-red region.
    The absorptions they met with they class as follows : —
     1st. General absorption at the least refrangible end of the spectrum.

                              LBoth edges less sharply defined.
     The authors next discuss the causes of the different absorptions met
 with in various fluids.         Prom experiment they show that a large
 number of lines which are formed in hydrocarbons containing no
 oxygen are common to substances containing hydrogen and no carbon,
 and that in carbon tetrachloride and carbon disulphide, no lines or
 bands are to be met with.         By this eliminating process they deduce
  the fact that the  presence of lines is due to the hydrogen in the bodies.

They show that the termination of the hands in liquids containing
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen corresponds with the position of these
hydrogen lines.          It therefore appears to them that the bands are in
reality a blocking oat of radiation between two hydrogen lines.                        By
increasing the thickness of the fluid in front of the slit, the bauds may
be widened to another hydrogen line, each hydrogen line acting as a
stepping-stone, or they may remain constant if both edges are defined)
 or they may be obliterated by general absorption.                On the other hand,
 lines may be spread oat to bands as the thickness of liquid is increased.
 When the thickness of the fluid is diminished the lines may disappear,
 and the bands become lines, or the bands may remain constant though
 fainter.
      The authors then point out that each radical has its own definite
 absorption in the infra-red, and that such a radical can be detected in
  a more complex body.             It also seems possible that the hydrogen which
  is replaced may be distinguished by a comparison with other spectra.
  They next point out coincidences between some of the lines obtained,
  the absorption spectra of the hydrocarbons, and the spectra of bodies
  containing no carbon with solar lines, from which they reason that at
  present it is not safe to infer that such lines in the solar spectrum are
  not necessarily due to water.              Whether the Hues mapped are due to
  hydrogen     or  not,  it  is perfectly evident that every organic body has a
  definite absorption spectrum which connects it with some series.                    The
  paper    closes   with    an   appendix giving     tables of   the   bands    and  lines
  found in the following substances, of which also there are maps : —

  Former communications on the influence of altitnde on          respiration
have appeared in the
                       " Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1878
                                                                 "
and 1879.  I  have continued the inquiry     and my present object
                                               ;                             is    to
give an account  of my  latest investigations on that subject.
I    must beg leave to premise that a work of this kind        not free
                                                                 is
from difficulties some of these are of a physiological nature, and
                 ;
refer to the task of taking into account the different circumstances
bearing on the state of the body at the time of the experiment;
respiration is, ifI     may so express   it, so delicately balanced       in       its
relations with the other functions, that any one of them becomini;
either quiescent or in a state of activity reacts immediately upon           it.
   Then the capacity of the bags for collecting the air expired gave
some little trouble to determine accurately    and, moreover, the manipu
                                               ;
lations, which would require both care and practice to be carried
on satisfactorily in a laboratory where all that can be wanted                     is
at hand, were found much less easy to perform in the open air,
at the summit of some high mountain, in            cold cutting wind, and
                                                   a
where the omission of a trifling article, such as a cork or a piece
of string, might render much labour useless.       There  isalso a circum
stance in a  work of this kind having a tendency to detract from the
value of its results, inasmuch as what   is observed with one person may
not apply to another.      It isnot easy to find many people ready to
submit to a stay of several days in the Alps, at altitudes ranging np
to 10,000 feet and above and
                          ;    I  know by experience that the increased
length of time required to repeat the experiments on different persons
may prove very inconvenient.        This last summer, however,        I was
most fortunate in obtaining the company and help of a young gentle
man from Geneva, M. Elie David, the assistant of the Professor                    of
Natural Philosophy at the University of that town, Professor Wart-
mann.    M. David submitted to experiment with great patience and
much intelligence, and the results obtained on both of us may                     be
accepted as perfectly trustworthy.
  My method of investigation has been much improved since my last
paper was communicated to the Royal Society, and the substitution              of
the vacuum process for the aspiration with water, in order to transfer
air from the bag into the cylinder for analysis, has added not   little
                                                                      a
to the accuracy of the results.    New and larger india-rubber bag-
than those used at first have been made, of improved material,               and

their capacity has been determined with the greatest care by means
of a gas-holder or bell-jar, having a scale of cubic feet divided into
hundredths and tested as to correctness.        I  must beg to take this
opportunity of returning my best thanks to Mr. Henry Sporne, Inspector
of Gas Meters for the city of London, for his kindness in determining
in my presence the capacity of the bag used in these experiments, by
means of one of his beautifully graduated gas-holders, made for testing
the delivery of gas meters.      The capacity of others of my experi
mental bags was ascertained     by the same means.
   The bulk of air held by the bag employed in all the experiments
referred to in the present communication was determined as follows : —
The gas-holder having been filled with air, and the pressure of the in
strument regulated to one inch of water, it was placed in communication
with the bag laying flat and quite empty on a table. This bag was
also connected through one of its necks and india-rubber tubing with
another water-gauge.      All these connexions being perfectly air-tight,
the height of the air-holder was read off, and the air admitted into the
bag from the holder.      After some minutes the bag became fully dis
tended, and the water began rising in the gauge connected directly
with it. As soon as a pressure of one inch in the bag was attained;
the delivery from the air-holder was read off ; it had by that time all
but done falling, moving downward very slowly, to the extent of a
delivery of about one-hundredth of a cubic foot and then stopped ; if
the bag was then handled, one or two more hundredths of a cubic
foot might be given out from the holder.          One experiment gave a
delivery of from 4 to 7'18 on the index     =  3'18 cubic feet, read off as
soon as the water in the gauge connected with the bag showed a
pressure of one inch ; on waiting two or three minutes, 3"19 cubic feet
were read off; and, after handling the bag, the volume of air delivered
into it rose to 3'22 cubic feet. In another experiment the reading on
the holder was made to commence at 6, and when the bag was full it
had fallen to 9-19, giving a bulk of 3'19 cubic feet of air delivered into
the bag; after handling the bag, the air given out rose to 3"22 cubic feet.
I have therefore taken 3'20 cubic feet, or 90-6 litres, as the correct
estimation of the air contained in the bag under the pressure of one
inch of water. In this last experiment the temperature of the air in
the bag was ascertained to be the same as that of the room, and,
moreover, the holder had been filled with air for some hours previously,
so that it is very unlikely that its temperature       should have been
different from that of the external atmosphere ; the temperature of the
water in the gas-holder was a trifle below that of the room.
   I proposed this last summer to make the Col du Geant (altitude
11,030 feet) my highest experimental station, as this spot was easy to
reach with the necessary instruments, and a small wooden hut had
been lately erected at the summit of the pass, where we could make

our residence   during our stay at that place.          The experiments were
repeated at Yvoire near the Lake of Geneva (altitude 1,230 feet), and
at Courmayeur (3,945 feet) at the foot of the Col du Geant on the
Italian side. Hence, there were three series of data obtained in the
course of about three months on two persons in good health, though very
different in age, weight, and other respects.        Two sets of experiments
were made at Courmayeur, the first before ascending to the Col <hi
Geant, and the second on our return ; the object being to ascertain
whether the influence of the sojourn at the higher station showed itself
on our breathing for some time after we had left it. The experiments
were invariably made in the sitting posture, and in the open air, away
from every possible source of contamination with carbonic acid, and
care was taken to remain perfectly quiet for a short time before collect
ing the air expired.
   With the object of determining the amount of air expired ¦within
a given time, and the carbonic acid it contained, breathing was carried
on through a face-piece connected with the india-rubber bag, and
adapting itself perfectly over the mouth and nose ; the face-piece wa?
supplied with valves, so that fresh air was taken in at each inspiration,
while the expired air was collected in the bag.                A water gauge,
communicating with the bag by india-rubber tubing, showed the pres
sure of the air it contained, and the bag was taken as full when the
gauge exhibited a pressure of one inch.          By means of a stop-watch
registering minutes and seconds only, the time for filling the bag, and,
therefore, for expiring 3-20 cubic feet or 90-6 litres of air, was accurately
measured.
   Immediately after the bag had been filled with air from tbe lungs,
it was joined by india-rubber tubing with a cylinder made of very
thick glass, and holding exactly two litres, which was placed in an
upright position on a tripod stand.          After exhausting the cyb'nder
with an air pump, air was let into it from the bag, the operation being
repeated, thereby ensuring that two litres of air had been withdrawn
into the cylinder for analysis.     Before closing the stop-cock and sever
ing the connexion between the bag and cylinder a minute or two were
allowed to elapse, and then the temperature of the air in the bag and
in the cylinder was read off and noted. Care was taken to observe
these temperatures     while the bag and cylinder were communicating
freely with each other, so as to allow of the equilibrium of pressure
being established, should there be any difference between the tempera
ture of the air in the bag and in the cylinder; sometimes the tempera
ture was the same, but it frequently happened that the readings
differed by 1° or 2°, the difference very seldom reaching 3° or 4°. A
titered solution of baric hydrate was then introduced into the cylinder
by a process described     in a communication to the Chemical Society      ;*

finally, the combination of the carbonic acid was completely effected
by moving about the cylinder, so as to make the alkaline solution run
up and down the inside of the glass for a period of ten minutes, this
lapse of time having been ascertained experimentally to be amply
sufficient.     The milky fluid was withdrawn into a small bottle,
carefully   labelled,  holding about 100 cub. centims., the bottle was well
corked, and the cork secured with paraffin wax so as to prevent
effectually the admission of air.          I  analysed the contents of the
bottle on my return to Yvoire.
    The experiments, numbering eighty, have been disposed in a tabular
form ; they are distributed as follows : —
    Fourteen were made on myself at Yvoire, and ten on M. David ;
eight on myself at Courmayeur before ascending the Col du Geant,
and eight on returning to Courmayeur, nine on M. David at Cour
mayeur before ascending the mountain, and seven on his return to
Courmayeur.        Twelve on myself at the summit of the Col du Geant,
and also twelve on M. David at the same station.
    I shall beg to commence by inquiring into the influence of food and
temperature upon our breathing.
    Influence of Food.
                         — In my former investigations, the direct influence
of meals as increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired was, as
a rule, well marked.        The limited range of time that elapsed after a
 meal previous to an experiment, and the small number of experiments
at each station in the present inquiry, preclude any but comparatively
 wide results being arrived at as to the direct influence food exerted
 on the formation of carbonic acid.          Dr. Edward Smith* concludes
 that the greatest quantity of carbonic acid is expired from one and a
 half to two and a half hours after a meal ; in the present experiments,
 the ingestion of food showed a direct influence in my case towards
 increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired, although we cannot
 find any definite tendency of the kind with M. David. At Yvoire,           I
 expired the smallest quantity of carbonic acid between breakfast and
 luncheon, when the mean of four experiments undertaken during that
 period yielded 0'479 grm. The carbonic acid rose under the influence
 of a full luncheon, and attained a maximum of 0'572 grm. 1 h. 45 m.
 after that meal in the first series of experiments, and of 0"638 grm.
 3 h. 2 m. in the second series.       At Courmayeur, before ascending the
 Col, my minimum carbonic acid (0"449) was expired 4 h. 35 m. after
 breakfast, and the maximum (0-554) 2 b. 40 m. after luncheon. On
 onr return to that station, my minimum (0'434 grm.) is expired at
 the latest experiment after breakfast, and my maximum (0-561 grm.)
 3 h. 35 m. after luncheon.        So far the results agree tolerably, for
  such a small number of experiments, with the influence food is usually
  found to exert on the formation and expiration of carbonic acid.

    In M. David's     case so much irregularity is observed as      to the
amount of carbonic acid expired in connexion with the food           taken,
that it is not possible to draw any inference as to the direct inflnena
food exerted in this respect.    He informs me he considers his digestion
so slow that he does not bathe (in the Lake of Geneva) till three and
a half or four hours have elapsed after a meal.
    Influence of the Temperature of the Atmosphere on the Amount oj Car-
Ionic Acid Expired. — This influence was sharply defined, even for
small differences in the temperature of the air, and it was found that
at the same station as the atmosphere became warmer, the amount of
carbonic acid expired fell precisely in an equal proportion.       The first
series of experiments on myself at Tvoire were made on the 27th and
28th of August ; the temperature of the air was still high, and the
mean reading of the thermometer in the shade during the experiment,
was 69°-9 F. On that occasion, a mean of 504 mgrma. carbonic acid
was found to be expired by myself per minute, at a mean period of
2 h. 46 m. after a meal.     A second series of experiments npon myself
at that same station was undertaken on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd
October, yielding a mean of 572 mgrms. carbonic acid expired per
minute ; autumn was setting in, and the atmospheric temperahw
bad fallen to a mean of 60o-3 at the time of the experiments; the*
were made at a mean period of 2 h. 35 m. after a meal, or nearly the
same as in the first series. The circumstances attending the two serks
of experiments were therefore similar, with the exception of the at
mospheric temperature, which was lower by 9°-6 on the second than
on the first occasion.      It is very interesting to observe, that the
carbonic acid in the second series is just what might have been
 expected,   if in an inverse proportion to the temperatures, these pro
 portions being calculated would yield 0'493 grm., which is very
nearly 0 504, or 0"584 mgrm., which is very nearly 0"573.             If we
 now consider the experiments     made on myself at Conrmayeur, before
 ascending to the Col, they will be found to yield 494 mgrms. of
 carbonic acid with an atmospheric temperature of 76°-l, while the
 second series, undertaken on returning to Courmayeur, after onr
 stay on the Col du Geant, gave 492 mgrms. at a mean temperature
 of 77°, the mean time the experiments were made after food beinz
 2 h. 43 m. in one case, and 2 h. 29 m. in the other.     In this instawe.
 the mean temperature varies by less than T°, and the carbonic          arid
 expired is also as near as possible the same.
     M. David's two series of experiments at Courmayeur, at a mean
 time of 2 h. 58 m. and 3 h. 34 m. respectively after a meal, gave for
 the first 727 mgrms. carbonic acid, with a mean atmospheric tempera
 ture of 71°"2, and for the second, after our return to Courmayeur again,
 727 mgrms. carbonic acid, with a mean temperature of 72°-2, these
 figures harmonising in a remarkable degree.

   If  altitude, or a fall of atmospheric pressure, with which                    I  couple
increased dryness of the atmosphere, exerted no influence on the
amount of carbonic acid expired, independently of temperature, the
combustion within the body would be regulated by the temperature
of the air only, all other circumstances supposed to be similar;* in
that case the weight of carbonic acid at Yvoire and at Courmayeur,
reduced to equal temperatures, would have been the same. We find,
however, that such is not the case, and that, after reducing the
carbonic acid for Yvoire to the temperature corresponding to that of
Courmayeur, a marked excess of carbonic acid is expired at Cour
mayeur, and that this applies to both of us, as is clearly seen in the
following table : —

424                             Dr. W. Marcet.                            [Feb. 10,
   This table shows, in my own case, a theoretical excess of 8'3 per
cent, and 8-9 per cent, of carbonic acid expired for the first and
second series at Courmayeur respectively over my second series at
Yvoire, assuming the temperatures to be the same at both stations.
In M. David's case, the theoretical excess of carbonic acid expired it
Courmayeur over that expired at Yvoire, for similar temperatures, was
found to be 7 7 per cent, and 8'9 per cent, for the two Courmayeur
series respectively.     It follows that, for equal mean temperatures,
even such a small difference of altitude as 2,715 feet "would hare
given in these experiments a mean increase of carbonic acid of 8"6
per cent, in my case           and 8-3 per cent, with M. Da-vid.                 M.
Mermod,* who experimented with equal mean temperatures at a
difference of altitude of 3,143 feet (from 142 metres to 1,100 metresi
obtained an increase of carbonic acid expired by 6' 7 per cent, at his
highest station, which is very near to my result although slightly
lower. His experiments were all made fasting, between 7 and 6
o'clock in the morning, and it is not unlikely that his comparative!?
low increase of carbonic acid at the highest station was due in some
measure to his being in want of food at the time, and unable to
generate exactly the increased amount of carbonic acid required to
make up for the altitude.
   It may be asked, why should the body make more carbonic
acid at increasing altitudes, and under similar atmospheric tempera
tures ? The reply is, that the evaporation from the skin and lung;
must be greater under a lower pressure and drier atmosphere, giving
rise to a production of cold.        The air was exceedingly dry while vre
were at Courmayeur ; on July 21st, at 12.30 p.m., the readings of dry
and wet bulb thermometers were 78° and 62° respectively, giving a
relative atmospheric humidity of 39 per cent. ; the same day, at 2.15
p.m., the readings were 78° and 59°, corresponding to 32 per cent, of
relative atmospheric humidity. Under such a dry air there must have
been a considerable evaporation from the skin and lungs, cooling tht
body and thereby more than making up apparently for the absorption
of heat, the result being an excess of carbonic acid expired.
   The twelve experiments for each of us on the summit of the Col
cannot be viewed in the same light as the others, because although
the cold we were subjected to under such a low atmospheric pressure
was comparatively great, and, indeed, keenly felt, still we both eave
out less carbonic acid than at Courmayeur instead of more.                     This
circumstance will find presently a ready explanation ; in the meantime
I shall propose to divide the twelve experiments on the Col into two
groups of six for each of us respectively, one group corresponding to
the lowest and the other to the highest atmospheric temperatures. The
           * " Bulletin de la Soc. Vaudoise des Sc. Nat.," vol. xv,
                                                                    1877.

                      \  C02 expired  0 '614 . . mean temperature 45 '8
so  that rather less carbonic acid was expired at the lower temperatures.
Consequently, not only the total mean carbonic acid expired at the Col
was found to be lower than the total mean either at Courmayeur or
at Tvoire, but moreover daring our stay on the Col the coldest weather
was attended with the least formation of carbonic acid for both of us,
which is quite in opposition to what might have been expected.          This
circumstance, however, is easily accounted for. After spending two or
three days at Courmayeur were the sun was very hot, the thermometer
 (sheltered from the sun under or inside a bush) rising to 80°, we
started for the summit of the Col without having in any way prepared
 onr functions to the sudden change of climate to which they were
going to be subjected.      We were indeed fresh from the plains in the
hottest time of the year, and it was as taking a leap from the middle
 of summer into the midst of winter. We left Courmayeur one after
 noon, and slept at the inn about 3,000 feet higher ; next morning an
early start brought us in good time to the hut at the summit of the
 Col, in the midst of snow slopes and glaciers.        The floor of the hut
 was found covered in a great measure with ice and snow, which had to
 be removed   with axes, while the small stove in one corner was nearly
 buried in snow, and so imbedded in ice that     it took us some time before
we could get it free. People who cross this pass, one of the most
beautiful in the Alps, spend an hour at the hut and often less ; few
travellers sleep in it, but this was to be our home for at least three
days.    The wind was cold and cutting:, and a thick greatcoat proved
quite insufficient. M. David had taken with him a coat lined with fur,
but even that was not equal to keeping up a comfortable warmth. The
air was very dry ; on the 19th July at 10 a.m. the readings of the dry
and wet bulb thermometers were 42° and 33°, giving a relative humidity
of 44 per cent. (Glaisher's tables), so that the atmosphere possessed a
great capacity for moisture, and therefore an increased power of cooling
down the body.      The experiments were to be made out of the welcome
sun's rays, and, with this object in view, I had brought up a wooden
shed which had already done useful work on an expedition to the
Peak of TenerifEe ; this shed or roof was erected on four poles, kept
in their places by tent ropes and pegs. It may be readily understood
that sitting under the shed with the back resting against a rock and
facing the beautiful glacier which descends directly from the Col, was

wot    conducive   to warmth.          Food, good, abundant and         substantial,
would have offered the best means to counteract the cold, but our
supply was scant)', as we had been disappointed in the expectation of
obtaining provisions at the half way house, the Pavilion du Mont
 Frety, and even had food been abundant, want of appetite and inability
to digest with both of us would have prevented our taking advantage
of it. As it was, we lived mostly on soup made with extract of beef
and preserved julienne, bread and cheese, coffee and tea with condensed
milk, some chocolate, and a small quantity of meat from tins. The
nights we felt bitterly cold and uncomfortable, and we conld get but
very little sleep. No wonder that under such depressing circumstances
we were unable to make in our bodies the amount of heat required to
meet the occasion ; the result, in fact, was, as I have already stated, a
diminished combustion in both of us.#
   I now wish to offer a few remarks on the difference in the weight of
carbonic acid expired by myself and M. David respectively at the
several stations. M. David is 25 years of age, weighs 11 stone 7 pounds
(73 kilos.), and measures round the chest 37'6 inches, while                I am 52
years of age, weigh nearly 10 stone 8 pounds, and measure 34"5 inches
round the chest. M. David expired more carbonic acid than. I did,
though not in proportion with the excess of weight of his body. If the
figures showing the carbonic acid expired by each of us be reduced to
the same temperature          for each station, the fixity of the excess of
carbonic    acid expired by M. David, not only at the different stations
respectively, but also throughout the whole of the present inquiry,
becomes quite obvious.
   At Yvoire     my first series of experiments yield 0-504 COo at 690-9 ;
and     M.   David's only series, 0"776 COj at 61°"6, the reduction
to   the   same   temperature giving an excess of             26 3   per cent, for
M. David. My second series of experiments at Yvoire, compared
with M. David's single sot of experiments at that station, shows a
difference of atmospheric temperature from G0o-3 to 610"6 ; after apply
ing the reduction, the excess of carbonic acid expired by this gentle
man will be found to amount to 279 per cent., or within narrow limits
of the percentage first obtained.
    At Courmayeur, for the first scries of experiments, after applying
the correction for temperature, the excess of carbonic acid expired by
M. David was found to be 27'4 per cent. The second series at Cour
mayeur showed an excess of carbonic acid expired (duly corrected)
by M. David amounting to 27 9 per cent., or very nearly the same as in
   •  My experimental   baggage consisted of a trunk weighing 40 kilos. (68 lbs ), a
basket  weighing 35 kilos. (77 lbs.), and the wooden shed ; three porters from Cour
mayeur carried up the whole of this baggage from the Pavilion du Mont Frety ; I
engaged a fourth for taking the baggage down.        The work of these porters was a
remarkable feat of bodily strength and mountaineering.

temperature        in the experiments made on the Col du Geant.                             The
mean temperature for each of us is not very dissimilar, being 41°"7 in
one case and 43°"4 in the other.                 The excess of carbonic acid expired
at that station by M. David amounted to 28 6 per cent.
    These various percentages were alike in a remarkable degree, as                          will
be seen by placing them in a tabular form : —

 very nearly the same, and amounted to a mean of 27"6 per cent.

  It will  be observed, first of all, on considering these figures, thai
both  in my case and M. David's much less air, reduced, or a smalkr
weight of air, was expired per minute, and consequently breathed u
11,030 feet above tbe sea than at 1,230 feet; this difference was in my
case by 29'2 for 100 expired at 1,230 feet, and with M. David's by 281'
per cent. ; and it is not a little remarkable that the difference pa
cent, in both cases should be all but the same. There is also a fallio?
off of the volume of air (reduced) I exhaled at Courmayeur, but
M. David expired much the same amount at both stations. Ia u;
former experiments at Teneriffe and in the Alps             I
                                                         also observed i
reduction in the volume of air expired (reduced) at high altitudes, so
that there can be no doubt that, although the actual volume off
breathed is greater because of its being rarefied, still a smaller udfki
of air is breathed within a given time in the mountains than in             the
plains.
I    shall now beg to consider the volume of air expired for giro,  1       of
carbonic acid at our various stations — subject interesting both
                                            a                               in
                                                                            >
physiological and medical point of view.      In my case, the proportion
of air breathed for 1  grm. C03 expired falls steadily from our lower       U
our higher station  ;  or, in other words, at Courmayenr        Irequired    a
weight of 8'6 per cent, less air to make    1grm. of carbonic acid than      at
Yvoire and at the summit of the pass
           ;                                I  inhaled a weight of air a;
much as 14"0 per   cent,  smaller to produce    grm. of carbonic acid than
                                                 1
at the lowest station.    In M. David's case there      a decrease of per
                                                       is               8
cent, in the weight of air expired at the summit of the Col for grm     1
C02 compared with that expired near the Lake of Geneva. At the              in
termediate station (3,945 feet), however, there     slight increase; tie
                                                      is
                                                      a
rule remains, nevertheless,I  consider, as well proved, that at certain
altitudes, which may vary with different persons, a smaller weight           of
air   required to yield the necessary oxygen for producing in the bodj
      is
the    same weight of carbonic acid     ;this law also held good on
my former experimental stations.     It accounts, in my mind, for the
immunity against consumption     met  with amongst the inhabitants           of
towns and villages at elevations beyond 4,000 or 5,000 feet abort
the sea, and for the beneficial influence exercised in some cases on
the progress of phthisis by such high places as Davos in Switzerland
At these stations smaller weight of air
                    a                         required for the prodnc-
                                                 is
tion of carbonic acid than in tho plains, which means that the               air
breathed passes through the substance of the lungs into the blew:
more readily at certain altitudes than       does nearer the sea-level:
                                                it
and, consequently, where the pulmonary organ         unequal to
                                                       is         free  a
diffusion of air through its tissue, as  the case in consumption, and
                                         is
probably in old-standing bronchitis, such an influence of altitude on
respiration likely to produce favourable change. M. Mermod, whos?
               is              a
interesting inquiries on the effects of altitude upon respiration            1

  1881.]     On the Influence   of Altitude upon Respiration.           429
 have previously quoted, found that a smaller weight of air and more
 carbonic acid were expired at his higher than his loner station, show
           I
 ing, as have done from my experiments, that at increasing altitudes
 carbonic acid requires the inspiration of a smaller weight of air to be
 formed in the body than nearer to the sea level.
    A few remarks only are left to be made on the rate of breathing
 and volume of air taken into the lungs per respiration at the various
 stations.   The expirations were counted during three minutes, as
each experiment was being commenced : the person submitting to
experiment breathing freely in the open air and in the sitting posture.
 The mean rate of breathing was much the same for M. David and
 myself at Yvoire and at Courmayeur, before ascending to the Col,
there was consequently no appreciable difference for a rise in altitude
of 2,265 feet.     The influence of our stay on the Col, where M.
David's respiration increased in frequency, apparently showed itself on
this gentleman on our return to Courmayeur, as a reaction appeared
to set in at the time, and the number of expirations fell from 20"6
per minute on the Col to 8-5, 7'5, 9'5, and 9'7 per minute, rising
afterwards to 10, 12 7, and 15"3.          The cause of this change was
apparently   the fatigue  of the increased   rate of breathing during the
three days we spent on the pass, requiring rest of the muscles of
respiration. In my case there was also an increase, though not so great
as in the former (ll'G to 15-6 per minute), in the frequency of breath
ing on the summit, which appeared to give rise to no reaction beyond
a slight irregularity in the respiration on our return to Courmayeur.
We arrived at that place from the Col on the 19th July, in the evening ;
M. David's experiments were begun on the 20th July, at noon, and
continued that day, one only being made on the 21st. Two of my
experiments were undertaken on the 20th and the remaining on the
21st, so that a longer time had elapsed in my cases since we had
returned from the Col : this circumstance may explain the apparent
absence of reaction in my own breathing.         I do not ascribe, however,
much physiological importance to these figures, but we were much
struck with M. David's slow respiration at the time.
    The mean volume of air per respiration (not reduced) was in
my case as near as possible the same at the intermediate as at the
lower station (1 litre Yvoire and 0'98 Courmayeur), but it became
much smaller at the summit of the pass, where it fell to 0 64 litre.
M. David expired a mean of 0'71 litre of air per expiration at the
lower station, of l'O litre at the intermediate one, and 0'48 litre on the
summit of the pass.
                                 Conclusions.
    1.  The direct influence   of food  as  increasing the amount of car
 bonic acid expired was obvious in my case in a general way, although

430                           Dr. W. Marcet.                    [Feb.   lit.
not in that of M. David.      This result in M. David's case in    no war
invalidates the well-known influence of the ingestion of           food   k
increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired, but is apparently due
in a great measure to the comparatively small number of experiments,
and to circumstances connected with a slow rate of digestion.
    2. The influence of the temperature of the atmosphere           on   tk
amount of carbonic acid expired was well marked in both cases ; the
mean weights of carbonic acid expired at Courmayeur (3,945 feet) by
both of us being the same respectively at the mean temperatures
observed, which were equal in both series ; but it was found that tk
amount of carbonic acid expired at the same station varied inversely
with the change of temperature ; the readings observed ranged from
60°-3 to 77° (Col du Geant not included).
    3. For a difference of altitude of 2,715 feet between 1,23(3 feet
and 3,945 feet, and a relative atmospheric           humidity lower by
about   31  per cent, for the higher station         cent, at Yvoire), the
                                             (70 per
mean weight of carbonic acid expired by each of us, reduced to tie
same temperature was found to be in excess at the higher over
the lower station by 8"6 per cent, in my case and 8'3 per cent, in
M. David's.      This shows clearly the influence of altitude coupled
with increased atmospheric dryness towards promoting combustion is
the body.
    4. The sudden change from a lower and very warm place to a very
high and cold station, with a barely adequate diet and insufficient
training, was productive on the present occasion of a decreased forma
 tion of carbonic acid in both of us, and a feeling of want of power to
 react against the external cold.
    5. The amount of carbonic acid expired by each of us was not the
 same. M. David, a younger man than I am, gave out a total mean
                                              I
 of 27"6 per cent, more carbonic acid than did, calculating this excess
 from the carbonic acid we expired per minute reduced to equal tem
 peratures ; and moreover the excess exhibited much regularity at each
 station respectively.    The mean surplus, without reduction for tem
 perature, would have amounted to 30"9 per cent.
    6. A smaller weight (volume reduced) of air is breathed within a
 given time in the mountains, at altitudes which may vary with differed
 persons, than in the plains or low valleys, although the actual volume
 of air expired be larger under a lower barometrical pressure; and.
 moreover, a smaller weight of air is required by the body to prodnce
 within it a given weight of carbonic acid at certain elevations than
 near the sea level ; this confirming my results obtained on former
 occasions.
    7. At an elevation of 11,030 feet above the sea, and a mean tem
 perature of 41°-7 and 43°'4 for each of us respectively, the rate of
 breathing was accelerated in both our cases, though rather less in mine

  1881.]       On the Influence  of Altitude   upon Respiration.           431
 than in M. David's.      His increase was by 39'5 per cent., and mine by
 25'6 per cent.     I had occasion   to remark, in a paper published last
 year,*  that my observations     showed no increase in the frequency of
 respiration in the Alps, while in the sitting posture, between the alti
 tudes of 1,230 feet (Lake of Geneva) and 8,115 (St. Bernard) ; but
between 8,115 feet and 13,685 feet (summit of the Breithorn) the
 increase was in the following ratio : — To 8,428 feet, 20'4 per cent. ; from
thence to 10,899 feet, 12-7 per cent, beyond the latter; from that ele
vation to 13,685 feet, 6-3 per cent, more ; altogether 39 per cent. The
rate of breathing was not observed at that time quite in the same way
as on the present occasion, as it was then reckoned while expiring into
the bag, and not into the open air.           I cannot anticipate, however,
any actual difference in the results, as there is no reason why the rate
of expiration into the bag should not be proportional at various alti
tudes to the rate of expiration into the open- air at these same
altitudes respectively.
    I feel called upon to remark that the figures for the carbonic acid I
expired in the experiments which form the subject of the present paper
are higher than those reported in my earlier experiments, while the
volume of air expired is rather largely increased in this last inquiry,
which     I am hardly prepared at present to account for. A series
of experiments made on myself at Yvoire in autumn, 1879, yielded
weights of carbonic acid much nearer to those last obtained.                The
weight of air expired for one gramme of carbonic acid, which had
been somewhat smaller in the earlier experiments, rose in those of
1879 at Yvoire to a figure but slightly inferior to that obtained in the
experiments of 1880.

         F.R.S.E., Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the Uni

  The difficulty in earthquake measurements is to find a point which
does not move during the disturbance.   This condition     in certain                 is,
cases, fulfilled approximately (as regards horizontal motion) by the
bob of a pendulum,* and, for this reason, pendulums have been fre-
qnently used as seismometers. A long pendulum, whose period greatly
exceeds the period of the earthquake waves, suspended from an ex
ceedingly rigid frame, makes a fairly good seismograph, the earth's
motion relatively to the bob being shown by a pair of indicating levers
at right angles to each other, with their short ends in contact with
the bob near its centre of gravity, their fulcrums fixed to the earthT
and their long ends           lightly touching a plate of smoked glass which is
kept revolving uniformly by clockwork.          If the bob were to remain
quite  stationary   during  an   earthquake,  this  would give two curves,
showing on a magnified scale two rectangular components of the
horizontal displacement of a point on the earth's surface in conjunc
tion with the time, from which the amount and direction of the actual
horizontal movement, and its velocity and rate of acceleration at any
time during the shock, could be deduced.           There are, however, tw»
independent    reasons  why the  bob  of a pendulum seismograph does not
remain stationary during an earthquake shock.           In the first place, it
is disturbed by the friction and inertia of the recording levers.          [It
may be observed here that a considerable             multiplication of the
motion     essential, at least in measurements of the small earthquakes
              is
which are common in Japan, for the actual motion of the earth's sur
face     usually only a fraction of a millimetre.]
         is                                               It    not difficult,is
however, to reduce this source of disturbance to an almost insensible
quantity by a careful construction and arrangement of the joints, &c.,
and by making the mass of the bob excessively great relatively to that
of the levers.    The other and by far the more important cause of dis
turbance       the motion of the point of suspension of the pendulum.
                   is
 The motion communicated to the bob by this means would reach
 a maximum, and altogether eclipse the true earthquake motion              the                 if
 period of oscillation of the supporting point agreed exactly with the
 pendulum's free period.     By making the pendulum long enough, and
 the supporting frame rigid, this extreme case can easily be avoided,
 but the effect    never entirely absent.

a pendulum 20 feet long, suspended as favourably to steadiness as
possible, has been set swinging during even a very slight earthquake,
through arcs about three times as long as the actual motion of the
earth's surface. By using a pendulum of as great length as this, how
ever, and by making it trace a continuous record in the manner de
scribed above, we may distinguish between that part of the record
which is due to the swing of the pendulum and that part which is the
true register of the earth's motion, the waves produced by the swing
of the pendulum being of much longer periods than those due to the
undulation of the earth.        The record thus shows the short earth
quake   waves   superposed upon a long sinuous curve due to the swing
of the pendulum.
   In this way, a long pendulum seismograph may (though with diffi
culty) be made to give good results ; and one designed by the author
has been erected in the University of Tokio, thanks to the liberality
of the Japanese directors.        More recently, however, the writer has
designed   and   constructed   another   seismograph, which he believes to
be novel, and which is certainly far superior to the long pendulum
seismograph in simplicity and cheapness of construction, ease of use,
and accuracy of results.        To describe this new instrument is the
object of the present paper.
   Figs. 1 and 2 show as much of the apparatus as is needed for the
purpose of explanation.      The scale in fig. 1 is about one-third, and in
fig. 2 about  one-sixth,  of full size.
   A solid round cylindrical brass bob a is pivotted between two
conical points of steel, so as to be capable of revolving freely about a
vertical axis lb at the short end of a light horizontal lever.          The
horizontal lever consists of two parts — a light brass frame c and a long
pointer of straw d, the extreme end of which is sharp-pointed, and
presses gently against a revolving glass plate     / (fig. 2), whose surface
is smoked.     The lever cd is pivotted about a vertical axis ee, between
two conical steel points, the lower one working in a hole in the base ;
the upper one, the point of a set-screw fixed in the top of an inverted
stirrup, which is in one piece with the base of the instrument. In
fig. 1, one side of this stirrup is, for the sake of clearness, supposed to
be removed.       The base stands, supported by three levelling screws,
»n the top of a post, which is firmly driven into the ground, and then
cut off short a few inches above the surface.       The instrument is fixed
                      " geometrical clamp "
to the post by a                                (see Thomson and Tait's
"Nat. Phil.," 2nd edition, vol. i, § 198). The sockets for the feet of
the levelling screws are a pyramidal hole, a V slot, and a plane surface ;
and the pressure necessary to give steadiness is produced by a single
screw bolt near the centre, which is not shown in the drawing.           By
this arrangement the axis ee is placed and held in a vertical position.
It moves with the earth during a shock. There are two precisely

similar levers separately mounted at right angles to each other, and
their pointers touch the plate at different distances from the centre
(see Plan, fig. 2). The plate        /
                                 revolves continuously in the direction
of the aiTOW about a vertical axis, which is also fixed to the earth. It
has not been considered necessary to show the details of this part of
the apparatus.
   The lever cd is proportioned so as to have this peculiarity, that the
axes ee and 66 are axis of percussion and axis of instantaneons rotation
respectively.  Hence, if a small horizontal displacement of the earth's
surface       takes place in a direction at right angles to d, carrying the
axis    ee   with it, the lever will revolve through a small angle with 66 as
its instantaneous         we neglect the effect of friction).

therefore, no tendency on the part of the bob a to acquire motion,
either of translation or of rotation, and    remains at rest during and
                                                it
after the displacement.   The same     true of any number of successive
                                          is
displacements in alternate directions.
   The distance of the end of the pointer from the axis 66
                                                    d          seven is
times as great as the  distance of  ee from 66, and hence the pointer
moves throngh a distance seven times as great as the earth's motion.
But the glass plate has moved in the same direction by an amount
equal  to the earth's motion. The recorded movement, drawn upon
the plate in the direction of the radius, will therefore be six times the
actual movement of the surface of the earth.
  A     displacement occurring at right angles to the former, or along the
line   d,
        produces  no  record by the one lever, for pointer and plate both
move in the same direction and by the same amount.             But this will
affect the second  lever, which     set
                                     is at right angles to the first.
  In an earthquake two rectangular components       of the horizontal
motion are  recorded by the levers to which they are  respectively per
pendicular, and they are magnified in the same ratio. The revolution
of the plate gives two continuous curves showing the successive dis
placements in conjunction with the time.     When     displacement
                                                            a
occurs, the pointer which has been displaced has no tendency either to

    But the actual amount of frictional error, in the first somewhat
ronghly made instrument which has been set up, is so small as hardly
to affect the records to a sensible extent.  To test it the following ex
periment wns made : — The whole apparatus, consisting of the plate /,
the clockwork to drive          it,
                              and the two levers, was put on a shaky
table, whose movements could be made to imitate those of an earth
quake.     The pointers were placed side by side instead of in their usual
positions, and the bob of one of them was held fast by bracket from a
                                                                  a
neighbouring wall.      It was, therefore, perfectly steady during the
artificial earthquakes made by shaking the table. Two records were
then obtained upon the plate, by shaking the table transversely to the
levers:   one was the true motion, known to be true because the bob of
that lever was held fixed during the test the other was the motion
                                                        ;
as recorded by the other lever in the usual way.       Both motions were
magnified in the same ratio of six to one.    If the bob of the second
lever remained stationary (as      should have done except for friction),

actual earthquakes.     In these parts the divergence between the two
records   is   scarcely perceptible.
  The friction of the marking points on the plate gave some trouble

at first.  The difficulty of getting a truly plane plate and of setting it
exactly   perpendicular  to its axis of rotation, made it needful to allow
a small amount of up-and-down motion of the marking points during
the revolution of the plate.     This has been done by connecting the

straw pointer d to the other part of the lever c, by a hinge joint, which
gives the pointer freedom to move in a vertical plane, but leaves it no
freedom to move sideways relatively to the part c.         The effect of this
would be that half the weight of the straw would be borne by the
glass plate, which would give a disadvantageously large amount of
pressure at the marking point.            To remedy this, a very flexible
straight steel spring, g, has been added, which stands out from the top
of the stirrup, and bears a portion of the weight of d through the
tension of a fine silk fibre, h.   This arrangement retains the necessary
vertical play of the pointer, without allowing its pressure on the plate
to be greater thau is just sufficient to rub off the thin coating of lamp
black which receives the record.        So long as no earthquake occurs,
the pointers continue to trace out, over and over again, the same two
circles on the plate.
   Owing to the imperfection of the driving clockwork, it has been
found to be desirable to add an appliance for marking time at short
intervals on the plate during an earthquake disturbance.         This is done
by a short pendulum, which remains deflected from its normal position
by the attraction of an electro-magnet,          through which a current is
permanently    passing.    A  contact   breaker,   arranged to be broken by
the shock, interrupts the current and releases the pendulum, whose
beats then mark a scale of time upon the revolving plate during about
one revolution, after which they cease to mark.
   Since the seismograph was made        it has recorded several earthquakes
quite successfully.     The first of these (on November 3, 1880) was
found to consist of more than 150 successive undulations of irregular
amplitudes and periods.       The mean period of a complete wave was
about 0-6 second, and the greatest total amplitude of the earth's

  motion    was  0'3  mfllim.   Another earthquake      (on November 10),
  which, judged by its shaking effects on houses,      &c,  seemed to be of
  much greater violence than the first, gave a record which showed
  that its greater intensity was due, not to greater extent of movement,
  but to greater frequency in the waves ; for their amplitude was even
  somewhat smaller, but their frequency about three times greater than
  in the former case.   There were, however, at the beginning of this
  earthquake a few waves of long period, upon which the above-
  mentioned short waves were superposed : after them the motion con
 sisted of nothing but an irregular ripple of short waves.
     These results show that a higher ratio of multiplication is desirable.
 The description which has been given applies, with insignificant modi
 fications, to the instrument now in use at the University of Tokio. In
 making a second instrument the writer would introduce some changes
 by way of adding to the stability of the bob and diminishing the
 friction.   Its mass and its moment of inertia might be increased with
 out increasing the distance between the axes lb and ee, by making
 it in the form of a hollow ring, and placing the vertical part of
 the lever c inside.     To reduce the friction connexion between the
 lever and its supports on the line ee might be given by pressure
against horizontal friction wheels, two at the top and two at the
 bottom, the fifth degree of constraint being supplied by the pressure
of a rounded steel foot against an agate plate in the base. Other
 modifications might be mentioned, but the author's object in this
paper has been not so much to describe constructive details as to ex
plain the principle on which the action of the new seismograph
depends.

I. " On the       Viscosity   of Gases at High Exhaustions."             By
      William    CROOKES,    F.R.S. Received December 26, 1880.
                                 (Abstract.)
    By the viscosity or internal friction of a gas, is meant the resistance
it offers to the gliding of one portion over another.      In a paper read

 1881.]       On  the  Viscosity   of Gases at     High Exltaustions.         447
 before   the British Association in 1859, Maxwell* presented the re
 markable result that on theoretical grounds the coefficient of friction,
 or the viscosity, should be independent of the density of the gas,
 although at the same time he states that the only experiments he had
 met with on the subject did not seem to confirm his views.
    An elaborate series of experiments were undertaken by Maxwell to
 test so remarkable a consequence of a mathematical theory ; and in
 1866, in the Bakerian Lecture for that year,f he published the results
 under the title of " The Viscosity or Internal Friction of Air and
 other Gases."    He found the coefficient of friction in air to be practi
 cally constant for pressures between 30 inches and 0'5 inch ; in fact
numbers calculated on the hypothesis that the viscosity was inde
 pendent of the density agreed very well with the observed values.
    The apparatus used by Maxwell was not of a character to admit of
experiments with much lower pressure than 0"5 inch.
    Maxwell's theory, that the viscosity of a gas is independent of the
density, presupposes that the mean length of path of the molecules be
tween their collisions is very small compared with the dimensions of the
apparatus ; but inasmuch as the mean length of path increases directly
with the expansion, whilst the distance between the molecules only
increases with the cube root of the expansion, it is not difficult with thr
Sprengel pump to produce an exhaustion in which the mean free path
is measured by inches, and even feet, and at exhaustions of this
degree it is probable that Maxwell's law would not hold good.
   The experiments recorded in this paper were commenced early in
1876, and have been continued to the present time.                  In November,
1876, the author gave a note to the Royal Society on some preliminary
results. Several different forms of apparatus have since been used
one after the other, with improvements and complexities suggested by
experience or rendered possible by the extra skill acquired in manipu
lation. The earlier observations are now of little value, but the time
spent in their prosecution was not thrown away, as out of those experi
ments has grown the very complicated apparatus now finally adopted.
   The viscosity torsion apparatus with which all the experiments here
given have been performed, is a very complicated instrument, and
cannot be well understood without the accompanying drawings. It
consists essentially of a glass bulb, blown with a point at the lower
end, and sealed on to a long narrow glass tube.               In the bulb is sus
pended a plate of mica, by means of a fine fibre of glass, 26 inches
long, which is sealed to the top of the glass tube, and hangs vertically
along its axis.    The plate of mica is ignited and lamp-blacked over
one-half.    The tube is pointed at the upper end, the upper and lower
points are 46 inches apart, and are accurately in the prolongation of

the axis of the tube.      Sockets are firmly fixed to a solid support, so
that when the tube and bnlb are clamped between them they are oojt
able to move around the vertical axis.    The glass fibre being only cor.-
nected with the tube at the top, rotating the tube on its axis com
municates torsion to the fibre, and sets the mica plate swinging on tie
same axis without giving it any pendulous movement.          The diameter
of the fibre is about O'OOl inch.   The viscosity apparatus is connect^
to the pump by a flexible glass spiral, so as to allow the apparatus to
rotate on the pivots and at the same time to be connected to the ptum
altogether with sealed glass joints. An arm working between meal
stops, limits the rotation to the small angle only which is necessary.
   The torsional movement given to the mica plate, by the light of tie
candle shining on it or by the rotation of the bulb and tube on its aii
by the movement of the arm between the stops, is measured by a beam
of light from a lamp, reflected from a mirror to a graduated scale.
   The pump employed has already been described.            The measnrmj
apparatus   is  similar  to that described by Professor McLeod* before
the Physical Society, June 13th, 1874. As it contains several improve
ments shown by experience to be necessary when working at very higt
vacua, a detailed description is given in the paper.
   When taking an observation the arm is moved over to the stop,
and in a few seconds allowed to return to its original position by                   tlf
action of a    spring. This movement rotates the viscosity apparatus
through   a  small  angle, and sets the mica plate vibrating, the reflected
line of light traversing from one side of the scale to the other arcs           in
of diminishing amplitude till         finally settles down once more

number reached at the extremity of each arc. The numbers being
alternately on one and the other side of zero are added two             two     by
together, to get the value of each oscillation.          The logarithms                  of

                                 Viscosity of Air.
     The mean of a very large number of closely concordant results gives
 as the log decrement for air for the special apparatus employed, at a
 pressure of 760 millims. of mercury and a temperature of 15° C, the
 number 0"1124. According to Maxwell, the viscosity should remain
 constant until the rarefaction becomes so great that we are no longer
 at liberty to consider the mean free path of the molecules as practically
 insignificant in comparison with the dimensions of the vessel.
    The author's observations show that this theoretical result of Max
 well's is at least approximately and may be accurately true in air up to
 snch exhaustions as are above referred to ; and that at higher ex
 haustions the viscosity falls off, as it might be expected to do accord
 ing to theory.
     The results are embodied in a table and diagrams.
    The first half of the table gives the viscosity of air, in so far as it is
 represented by the log decrement, at pressures intermediate between
 760 millims. and 0"76 millim. (1,000 millionths of an atmosphere).        In
•order to avoid the inconvenience of frequent reference to small frac
 tions of a millimetre, the millionth of an atmosphere* (=M) is now
 taken as the unit instead of the millimetre.        The second half of the
 table is therefore given in millionths, going up to an exhaustion of
 0"02 millionth of an atmosphere.
    Starting from the log decrement 0-1124 at 0760 millim., the vis
 cosity diminishes very regularly but at a somewhat decreasing rate.
 Between 50 millims. and 3 millims. the direction is almost vertical, and
 a great change in the uniformity of the viscosity curve commences at
 a pressure of about 3 millims. At this point the previous approxima
 tion to, or coincidence with, Maxwell's law begins to fail, and further
.pumping considerably reduces the log decrement.
    From 1,000 M the diminution of viscosity is very slight until the
 exhaustion reaches about 250 M ; after that it gets less with increasing
 rapidity, and falls away quickly after 35 M is reached.
    The curves of increasing mean free path and diminishing viscosity
closely agree. This agreement is more than a mere coincidence, and
is likely to throw much light on the cause of viscosity of gases.
    In the table is also given the measurements of the repulsion exerted
on the blackened end of the mica plate by a candle-flame placed 500
millims. off. The repulsion due to radiation commences just at about
the same degree of exhaustion where the viscosity begins to decline
rapidly, and it principally comes in at the exhaustions above 1,000 M.
    The close agreement between the loss of viscosity and the increased
action of radiation is very striking up to the 35 millionth, when the
repulsion curve turns round and falls away as rapidly as the viscosity.

   Experiments are next described on the resistance of air to the passjge
of an induction spark.
   Since the publication of the author's researches on the phenomena
presented by the passage of the induction discharge through higl
vacua, the present results — which, although never published, precedf
by a year or two those just mentioned — have lost much of their
interest.
    The phenomena     at the very high exhaustion of 0-O2 M may be            of
interest.   With   a  coil giving a spark 85 millims. long, no discharjr?

distance in air was 100 millims. the spark occasionally passed throng!:

on to it.    At first nothing was to be seen. Then a brilliant green
light flashed through the tube, getting more and more frequent. Sud
denly a spark passed from wire to the glass tube, and broke
                            a                                        it,

   Since these experiments, vacua have frequently been got as high,
and even higher, but the author has never seen one that would long
resist the 20-inch spark from his large coil.

   The series of experiments with air show a complete history of              its
behaviour between very wide limits of pressure.     It became interest
ing to see how the two components of air, oxygen and nitrogen, wouLi
behave under similar circumstances.   Experiments were therefoi-e insti
tuted exactly as in the case of dry air, but with the apparatus filled
with pure oxygen.
   The results are given in the form of tables and plotted as curves on
diagrams.
   The figures show a great similarity to the air curve. Like         thr

It then diminishes again, and at higher exhaustions      itrapidly sinks.

   Oxygen has more viscosity than any gas yet examined.             The
viscosity of air at 760 millims. being 01124, the proportion between
that of air and oxygen, according to these results, is 1'1185.
   This proportion of 1-1185 holds good (allowing for experimental
errors) up to a pressure of about 20 millims. Between that point and
1 millim. variations occur, which have not been traced to any assign
able cause : they seem large to be put down to
                                                 " experimental errors."
The discrepancies disappear again at an exhaustion of abont 1 millim.,
and from that point to the highest hitherto reached the proportion of
1-1185 is fairly well maintained.

than a year,    was discovered that the discrepancy arose from a trace
                   it
of water obstinately held by the hydrogen. Since discovering thi
property, extra precautions (already described at the commencemei:;
of this paper) have been taken to dry all gases before entering the
apparatus.

   The remarkable character of hydrogen is the uniformity of resist
ance which    it presents.     It obeys Maxwell's law almost absolutely up
to an exhaustion of about 700 M, and then it commences to break
down.     Up to this point the line of viscosity is almost vertical. It
then commences to curve over, and when the mean free path assumes
proportions comparable with the dimensions of the bulb, and approaches
infinity, the viscosity curve in like manner draws near the zero line.
   The repulsive force of radiation is higher in hydrogen than in any
other gas. It commences at as low an exhaustion as 14 millims., but
does not increase to any great extent till an exhaustion of 200 M
is attained ; it then rises rapidly to a maximum at between 40 and
60 M, after which it falls away to zero.           The maximum repulsion
exerted by radiation in hydrogen is to that in air as 70 to 42'6.        This
fact is now utilised in the construction of radiometers and similar
instruments when great sensitiveness is required.
    Taking the viscosity of air at 760 millims. as 0-1124, and hydrogen
as 0-0499, the proportion between them is 0'4439.
                           The Spectrum of Hydrogen.
    The red line (\=6562), the green line (X=4861), and the blue line
 (\=4340) are seen at their brightest at a pressure of abont 3 millims.,
and after that exhaustion they begin to diminish in intensity.         As ex
haustion proceeds, a variation in visibility of the three lines is ob
served.    Thus at 36 millims. the red line is seen brightly, the green
faintly, whilst the blue line cannot be detected. At 15 millims. the
 bine line is seen, and the three keep visible till an exhaustion of
418 M is reached, when the bine line becomes difficult to see. At 38 M
only the red and green lines are visible, the red being very faint. It
is seen with increasing difficulty up to an exhaustion of 2 M, when it
can be seen no longer.          The green line now remains visible up to an
exhaustion of 0'37 M, beyond which it has not been seen.
    It is worthy of remark that although, when working with pure
 hydrogen, the green line is always the last to go, it is not the first to
 appear when hydrogen is present as an impurity in other gases. Thus
 when working with carbonic anhydride insufficiently purified, the red
 hydrogen line is often seen, but never the green or the blue line.
            Influence of Aqueous Vapour on the Viscosity     of Air.
    In the foregoing experiments many discrepancies were traced to the
 presence of moisture in the gas.          The influence of aqueous vapour
 does  not appear   to be   great  when present in moderate amount in gas
 of normal density, but at high exhaustions it introduces errors which
 interfere with the uniformity of the results.       A series of experiments
 were accordingly undertaken to trace the special action of aqueous
 vapour when mixed with air.

454                           Mr. W. Crookee.                     [Feb.  17,
    Up to a pressure of about 350 millims. the presence of aqueous
 vapour has little or no influence on the viscosity of air. The two
curves are, in fact, superimposed.       At this point, however, divergence
commences, and the curve rapidly bends over, the viscosity falling
 from 0-0903 to 0'0500, between 50 and 7 millims. pressure.         Here it
joins the hydrogen curve, and between 7 millims. and 1 miliim. they
appear to be identical.
    These results are partly to be explained by the peculiar action of
water vapour in the apparatus.        At the normal pressure the amount of
aqueous vapour present in the air, supposing it to be saturated, is only
about 13 parts in a million, and the identity of the log decrement
with that of dry air shows that this small quantity of water has no
appreciable action on the viscosity.       When the pump is set to work
the air is gradually removed, whilst the aqueous vapour is kept sup
plied from the reservoir of liquid.      As the exhaustion approaches the
tension of aqueous vapour, evaporation goes on at a greater rate, and
the vapour displaces the air with increasing rapidity ; until, after the
pressure of 12' 7 millims. is passed, the aqueous vapour acts as a gas,
and, being constantly supplied from the reservoir of water (as long as
 it lasts), washes out all the air from the apparatus, the log decrement
rapidly sinking to that of pure water gas.
    This explanation requires that the viscosity of pure aqueous vapour
should be the same as that of hydrogen, at all events between
7 millims. and 1 miliim. pressure.         The facts can, however, be ex
plained in another way.         During the action of the Sprengel pump
sufficient electricity is some times generated to render the fall tnbes
luminous in the dark. It is conceivable that under such electrical in
fluence the falling mercury may be able to decompose aqueous vapour
at these high exhaustions, with formation of oxide of mercury and
liberation of hydrogen.      Of these two theories the latter appears to be
the more probable.
    The presence of water vapour shows itself likewise in the very
slight amount of repulsion produced by radiation. Repulsion com
mences in air at a pressure of 12 millims., whilst at a higher exhaus
tion the maximum effect rises to over 40 divisions.         Here, however,
repulsion does not begin till the exhaustion is higher than the baro
meter gauge will indicate, whilst the maximum action after long-
continued pumping is only 9 divisions.
                        Viscosity of Kerosoline Vapour.
    The rapid diminution of viscosity in the last experiment after reach
ing the pressure of 400 millims. is probably due to the aqueous vapour
in the air being near its liquefying point. It was thought advisable
to test this hypothesis by employing a somewhat less easily conden-
sible vapour, which could be introduced into the apparatus without

any admixture of air. An experiment was accordingly tried with a
very volatile hydrocarbon, commercially known as kerosoline, boiling
at a little above the ordinary temperature.         The vapour of this body
was introduced into the well-exhausted apparatus, when the gauge at
once sank 82'5 millims. After the usual precautions to eliminate air
a Beries of observations were taken.
    The loss of viscosity is more rapid than with any other gas examined
except aqueous vapour.       Conversely a very great increase of viscosity
occurs on increasing the pressure from 8 to 82*5 millims. The expla
nation of this is that the vapour of kerosoline is very near its liquefy
ing point, and therefore very far from the state of a "perfect " gas.
    The negative bend in the curve at about 10 millims. pressure,
already noticed with other gases, is strongly marked with this hydro
 carbon vapour.

     When discussing the viscosity results obtained with the different
 gases experimented with, the author gives the following approximate
 comparison of viscosities, such as is afforded by a comparison of the
 log decrements of each gas and that of air, comparing the ratio with

      Graham's numbers are the theoretical results deduced from his ex
  periments on transpiration of gases. They are, he says,* the numbers
  to which the transpiration times of the gases approximate and in
  which they have their limit.       Graham concludes that the " times of
  oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic oxide, and air are directly as their densities,
  or equal weights of these gases pass in equal times. Hydrogen passes
  in half the time of nitrogen, or twice as rapidly for equal volumes.
  The result for carbonic acid appears at first anomalous.            It is that the
  transpiration time of this gas is inversely proportional to its density
   when compared with oxygen."
      The proportion between air and oxygen, nitrogen, or carbonic oxide
   is not very different at any degree of exhaustion to that which it is at

 760 miHims.      Carbonic anhydride, however, is different ; the propor
tion between it and air holds good between 760 and 650 millims. Then
 it gets lower and lower as the pressnre sinks, until 50 or 55 millims.
is reached, when the proportion between it and air becomes constant.
    Hydrogen, however, is entirely different to the other gases ; its log
decrement remains the same to a very high exhaustion, and, that of
Other gases sinking, it is evident that the proportion between this gas
and any other is different for each pressure.
    It must not be forgotten that the pressure of 760 millims. is not one
of the constants of Nature, but is a purely arbitrary one, selected for
our own convenience when working near the level of the sea.          In the
diagrams accompanying the paper the author has started from this
pressure of 760 millims., and has given the log decrement           curves
which approximately represent the viscosities through a wide range of
exhaustion.     But the curves might also be continued, working down
wards instead of upwards. From the shape and direction in which
they cut the 760 line it is reasonable to infer their further progress
downwards, and we may assume that an easily liquefiable gas will
show a more rapid increase in viscosity than one which is difficult to
liquefy by pressure.     For instance, hydrogen, the least condensible of
all gases, shows no tendency to increase in log decrement by pressure.
Oxygen and nitrogen, which are only a little less difficult to condense
than hydrogen, show a slight increase in log decrement. Carbonic anhy
dride, which liquefies at a pressure of 56 atmospheres at 15° C, increases
so rapidly in log decrement that at this pressure it would have a log
decrement of about 1*3, representing an amount of resistance to
motion that it is difficult to conceive anything of the nature of gas
being capable of exerting.
    Kerosoline vapour is rendered liquid by pressure much more readily
than carbonic anhydride. Its curve shows a great increase in density
for a very slight access of pressure.
    Again, aqueous vapour is condensible to the liquid form with the
greatest readiness ; and the almost horizontal direction of the curve
representing aqueous vapour mixed with air carries out the hypothesis.
    It follows, then, that Maxwell's law holds good for perfect gases.
The disturbing influence spoken of in the commencement of this
paper as occasioning a variation from Maxwell's law, is the tendency
to liquefaction, which prevents us from speaking of any gas as
" perfect," and which hinders it from obeying Boyle and Mariotte's
law.     The nearer a gas obeys this law the more closely does it conform
to Maxwell's law.
    Maxwell's law was discovered as the consequence of a mathematical
theory. It presupposes the existence of gas in a
                                                      " perfect " state —a
 state practically unknown to physicists, although hydrogen gas very
 nearly approaches that state.      An ordinary gas may be said to be

bounded,    as regards its physical state, on the one side by the sub-
gaseous    or liquid condition, and on the other side by the ultra-
gaseous condition.       A gas assumes the former state when condensed
by pressure    or  cold,  and it changes to the latter state when highly
rarefied. Before actually assuming either of these states there is a
kind of foreshadowing of change, with partial loss of gaseity.
When the molecules, by pressure or cold, are made to approach each
other more closely, they begin to enter the sphere of each other's at
traction, and therefore the amount of pressure or cold necessary to
produce a certain density is less than the theoretical amount by the
internal attraction exerted on each other by the molecules.                   The
nearer the gas approaches the point of liquefaction the greater is the

quired to produce any given density will be proportionally less than
 that theoretically required by a " perfect " gas.
                       The Ultra-gaseous    State of Matter.
    After some theoretical considerations          respecting the viscosity of
 gases, the author concludes with the detailed statement            of his theory
 of the existence of an ultra-gaseous state of matter.
    A consideration of the curves of the gases, especially hydrogen,
 ¦which are given in the paper, will confirm the supposition that a gas,
 as the exhaustions become extreme, gradually loses its gaseous charac
 teristics, and passes to an ultra-gaseous state.
    An objection has been raised touching the existence of ultra-gaseous
 matter in highly exhausted electrical tubes, that the special phenomena
 of radiation and phosphorescence which the author has considered
 characteristic of this form of matter can be made to occur at much
 lower pressures than that which exhibits the maximum effects. For
 the sake of argument let us assume that the state of ultra gas with
 its associated phenomena is at the maximum at a millionth of an at
 mosphere.      Here the mean free path is about 4 inches long, sufficient
 to strike across the exhausted tube.           But it has been shown by many
 experimentalists that at exhaustions so low that the contents of the
 tube are certainly not in the ultra-gaseous state, the phenomena of
  phosphorescence can be observed.          This circumstance had not escaped
  the author's notice.     In his first paper on the " Illumination of Lines
 of Molecular Pressure and the Trajectory of Molecules," * the author
  drew attention to the fact that a molecular ray producing green phos
  phorescence can be projected 102 millims. from the negative pole
  when the pressure is as high as 0324 millim., or 427 M. In this case
  the mean free path of the molecules is 023 millim. ; and it is not sur
  prising that with more powerful induction discharges, and with

special appliances for exalting the faint action to be detected,           the
above-named phenomena can be prodnced at still higher pressures.
  It must   be remembered        that we know nothing of the absolute   length
of the free path or the absolute velocity of a molecule ; these may       vary
almost from zero to infinity.    We must limit ourselves to the          mean
free path and the mean velocity, and all that these experiments show
is that a few molecules can travel more than a hundred times the
mean free path, and with perhaps a corresponding increase over the
mean velocity, before they are stopped by collisions. With weak elec
trical power the special phosphorogenic action of these few molecules
is too faint to be noticed   ;but by intensifying the discharge the action
of the molecules can be so increased as to render their presence visible
It is also probable that the absolute velocity of the molecules is in
creased so as to make the mean velocity with which they leave the
negative pole greater than that of ordinary gaseous molecules. This
being the case, they will not easily be stopped or deflected by collisions,
but will drive through obstacles, and so travel to a greater distance.
   If this view is correct, it does not follow that gas and ultra gas can
coexist in the same vessel.     All that can be legitimately inferred            is.
that the two states insensibly merge one into the other, so that          at
                                                                         an
intermediate point we can by appropriate means exalt either the phe
nomena due to gas or to ultra gas. The same thing occurs between the
states of solid and liquid, and liquid and gas.      Tresca's experiments
on the flow of solids prove that lead and even iron, at the common
temperature, possess properties which strictly appertain to liquids,
whilst Andrews has shown that liquid and gas may be made to merge
gradually one into the other, so that at an intermediate point the sub
stance partakes of the properties of both states.

   The determination of the motion of the gas within the bulb, which
would theoretically lead to a determination of the coefficient of visco
sity of the gas, forms a mathematical problem of hopeless difficulty.
Nevertheless we are able, by attending to the condition of similarity
of the motion in different cases, to compare the viscosities of the diffi'-
rent gases for as many groups of corresponding pressures as we please.

 altogether had the moment of inertia of the vibrating body been
 sufficient to make the time of vibration sensibly independent of the
gas, as was approximately the case, the condition of similarity is that
the densities shall be as the log decrements of the arc of vibration,
and the conclusion from theory is that when that condition is satisfied,
then the viscosities are in the same ratio. Pressures which satisfy
the condition of similarity are said to " correspond."
    It was found that on omitting the high exhaustions, the experiments
led to the following law : —
    The ratios of the viscosities of the different gases are the same for
any two groups of corresponding pressures.         In other words, if the
ratios of the viscosities of a set of gases are found (they are given by
the ratios of the log decrements) for one set of corresponding pres
sures, these pressures may be changed in any given ratio without dis
turbing the ratios of the viscosities.
    This law follows of course at once from Maxwell's law, according to
which the viscosity of a gas is independent of the pressure.        It does
not, however, by itself alone prove Maxwell's law, and might be
satisfied even were Maxwell's law not true.       The constancy, however,
 of the log decrement, when the circumstances are such that the molar
inertia of the gas may presumably be neglected, proveB that at any
 rate when the density is not too great that law is true ; and the varia
 bility of the log decrement at the higher pressures in all but the very
 light gas hydrogen is in no way opposed to          though Mr. Crookes's
                                                   it,
 experiments do not enable us to test   itdirectly, but  merely establish a
 more general law, which embraces Maxwell's as a particular case.
     The viscosities referred to air as unity which came out from Mr.

    The viscosity of kerosoline vapour could not be accurately deduced
from the experiments, as the substance        is
                                              a   mixture, and the vapour
 density  therefore unknown.     Assuming     the  relative viscosity to be
0-0380, the vapour density required to make the experiments fit came
•out 3-408 referred to air, or 49'16 referred to hydrogen.
    When once the density     issufficiently small, the log decrement may
be taken as a measure of the viscosity.        Mr. Crookes's tables show
how completely Maxwell's law breaks down at the high exhaustions,
as Maxwell himself foresaw must be the case.         Not only so, but  ifwe
 take pressures at those high exhaustions which are in the same ratios
 as
     " corresponding " pressures, the log decrements in the different
 gases are by no means in the ratios of the densities.

    It  would appear    as if the mechanical properties of a gas at ordinary-
pressures     and   np to extreme exhaustions (setting aside the minute
deviations from Boyle's law, &c), were completely defined by two con
stants, suppose the density at a given pressure and the coefficient of
viscosity, but at the high exhaustions at which phenomena of " ultra-

additional constant, or perhaps more than one, requires to be known.

        Commander W. B. Pauli, R.N., Her Britannic Majesty's
        Consul at Manila. Received January 18, 1881.
 The following      " Notes "               communicated
                                have   been                from   the   Foreign
              Office, by direction of  Earl Granville, K.G., F.B.S.
   I was   unfortunately obliged to leave Manila last June on sick leave,
and the news of the late disastrous earthquakes reached Europe
shortly after my arrival.
   My knowledge of the locality enabled me to realise the extent of
the calamity even with the bare details given by the telegrams.
   I have collected the fullest information obtainable at this distance,
chiefly from local papers and letters from friends, but by far the
most important data        I have received are contained in the scientific
observations sent me by Father Faura, the Director of the Municipal
 Observatory at Manila, who being a pupil of the late Father Secchi,
of Rome, and himself taking keen interest in science, chiefly in rela
tion to storms and earthquakes, is a particularly fit person for his
present post.
    The Manila Observatory is now furnished with seismographical in
struments, by which the accompanying diagrams of the chief shocks
were obtained.
    These, with the translation      of Father Faura's observations on them,
I  trnst may be of interest, especially as this is the first scientific
account    of earthquakes in the Philippine Islands, where they are so
frequent and so violent.
   To this account I have appended further information derived from
other sources respecting the course and extent of the disturbances, but
have purposely omitted the details of the personal experiences of
individuals and the loss sustained in life and property, confining my
remarks to such accounts as bear directly on the phenomena in a
scientific point of view.
   A short preliminary account of the volcanic systems of Luzon, the
seat of the late earthquakes, may prove a useful introduction.

1881.]     Notes on    the Earthquakes  of July, 1880, at Manila.    461
Philippine Government, in a      work called " Memoria Geologico Minera
de los Islas Filipinas," observes : — " That the volcanic action in the
Philippine Archipelago is not displayed in an arbitrary or irregular
manner, but, on the contrary, is exercised by defined lines almost
parallel to each other, whose direction may be fixed as from N.N. W. to
S.S.E,, thus showing two parallel systems, which to distinguish from
each other we will call the system of Taal, and that of Mayon, being
the names of the two volcanoes of the greatest and most frequent
activity in the two systems."
    The first, viz., the system of Taal, commences in the north of Luzon,
and after traversing the greater part of the island, including in its
course the active volcano of Taal, is lost in the sea of Mindoro, to
reappear in other islands of the Archipelago.
    The second system, " of Mayon," is situated to the eastward of the
first, and is represented by the magnificent active volcano of Mayon
of 8,000 feet altitude, and although parallel to the first, does not
extend farther to the north than the extinct volcano of Isero, in the
province of South Camerines, in Luzon, but traverses the southern
portion of the island, and includes the active volcano of Bulasan, at
the extreme southern point of Luzon ; it appears again in other
islands, especially in the large island of Mindanoa.
    Senor Centeno observes that these two distinctly parallel lines in
Luzon, with a distance of about 120 miles between them, after leaving
that island, approach each other so as to be only 64 miles apart in
Mindanoa, and in his opinion join each other in the southern group of
the Mollucas.
    The present earthquakes extended from Vigan, in the north, to
 Tayabas in the south, being in the line of the system of Taal, which
 volcano showed considerable and unusual activity during the dis
 turbance. The volcano of Mayon, on the contrary, is reported as
 being in its normal state, emitting no more than its usual amount of
 smoke, although the volcano of Bulusan (in the system of Mayon, and
 far to the southward of that mountain), which seldom shows signs of
 activity, had recommenced to throw up smoke.       This would appear to
 corroborate Senor Centeno's theory, that the two systems are distinct
 in Luzon, but join each other far to the southward ; and that the
 effects of the earthquakes on volcanoes was confined to the system of
 Taal on this occasion in Luzon, extending to the point where the two
 systems united in the south, and penetrating on its return to the
 north, along the system of Mayon, as far only as Bulusan, but not
 reaching so far north as Mayon.
    The extent of these earthquakes is said to have been from Vigan to
  Tayabas, a distance of about 220 nautical miles in length, with an
 average width of about 75 miles.       No shocks are reported from the
  extreme north or south of Luzon.

Summary of       the   Seismometrical    Observations taken   at the Municipal
    Observatory    of Manila, during the various       earthquakes which took
   place from   the  Uth to the 25th July, 1880.
    The observations       commence     by a description of the instruments
employed to trace the figures representing the undulations ; Father
Faura continues : — " The object of both apparatuses is first to discover
the direction of the first horizontal undulation, which is obtained by
means of the small ring at the end of the pendnlnm, and forced along
by it.
    " 2nd. To ascertain the
                                 general direction of the horizontal undula
tions, and their amplitude by means of the lines which the same
pendulum leaves in the powder.
    " 3rd. To obtain the greatest amplitude of the
                                                               greatest vertical
undulation by means of the vertical seismometer.
    " 4th. To obtain by a combination of the above results the magni
tude and direction of the oblique undulations.
    " From the indications of these two apparatuses the observations of
the terrible phenomena which plunged Manila into the greatest affliction
were deduced and given each day.            We do not place absolute reliance
 in them, because the apparatuses can only offer certainty in their in
 dications in cases where the complications and violence of the present
 movements are absent ; but we believe they have a relative and not
 inconsiderable value, and that they give a sufficiently exact idea of the
 occurrence, for which we consider them very useful in a comparative
 point of view, particularly to those who have experienced the terrible
 phenomena.
     "After these preliminary remarks, we will give the different ob
 servations collected each day, which will prove more intelligible by
 consulting the various figures traced by the pendulum, and these in
 their turn will prove a complement to those observations.
     " In the months of
                              April and May, commotions began to be felt in
 the northern provinces of Luzon ; the centre of the seismic oscillation,
 according to different indications received at this station, seemed to
  coincide with a volcano extinct for some time, and situated between
  Lepanto and Abra, in the central range of Luzon, in lat. 16° 22' N.
 and long. 127° E. of the Observatory of San Fernando.
     " In the beginning these disturbances were weak and infrequent ;
 but in the month of June their intensity sensibly increased, extending
 to the north and south in a much larger zone.              The direction never
 changed    ; and   if  in  some   telegrams  certain contradictions    were ob
 served, these appear to have been the effect of the haste with which
 the observations were taken, which can never be relied on where there
 are no special instruments used to mark a change in the direction of a
 seismic oscillation. In the beginning of July shocks were also felt ; but

from the 5th to the 14th no notices of earthquakes in any part of the
island were received in Manila.
    "On the 14th, at 12 h. 33m. p.m., being threatened with a storm
from the north-east, indicated by an extraordinary fall of the baro
meter, we experienced here the first shock, in which we observed that
two centres of oscillation were combined (see fig. No. 1), one on the
second quadrant, from whence the pendulum of the horizontal seismo-

meter began to oscillate ; and the other from the third, where the
oscillation of this first movement terminated, and which was chiefly
horizontal ; the amplitude of total oscillation reached 5° 25'.         The
horizontal pendulum inscribed a cross with arms almost at right angles,
the first bearing from S.E. 10° E. to N.W. 10° W. ; the second from
S.W. 5° W. to N.E. 5° E.
    " The first impulse was in the direction from south-east to north-west.
The amplitude of this oscillation described an arc of 5° 25', and
appeared      to be  formed by the first shock, because the pendulum
almost at once oscillated in a direction almost perpendicular to the
first. The amplitude of this second oscillation was somewhat less than
that from the first impulse.
    " The index of the vertical seismometer departed 4 millims. from its
position.     After this first movement, we experienced two more shocks
in the space of an hour and a-half ; on the 15th and 16th there were
no perceptible movements ; on the 17th, two slight shocks were felt.
    " It was on the 18th, at 12 h. 40 m. p.m., when the
                                                          great earthquake
of oscillation, trepidation, and what is commonly called rotatory move
ment, occurred simultaneously.       Its duration was 1 m. 10 s.

account of their number and variety. We shall therefore confine our-

   " It  is to be noted   that, from our point of view, only the great
oscillation from east to west (which was the most measured and free
from violent shocks), indicates the true inclination of the buildings
towards the west.
   " 1. The
              greatest oscillation from E. 5" S. to W. 5° N. ; the ampli
tude of the greatest oscillation 22°, or by seismic wave motion 11° to
east and 11° to west.
   " 2. Greatest oscillation from south-west to north-east, true, ampli
tude 19°, but with the difference of more inclination towards the
south-west, which reached to 10° 10', against 8° 50' only towards the
north-east.

this oscillation 16°, in which also is observed that the inclination is
greater towards the south, being 9° south and only 7° north, the impulse
consequently appears to be from north to south.
   " The index of the vertical seismometer departed 34 millims. from
its position. From the time of this earthquake until the 20th at three
in the afternoon, at which time we experienced a very strong repetition,

we continued to         be  under the influence of the phenomenon.       In this
first repetition the oscillation and trepidation movements only were
experienced, but with extraordinary violence.            The oscillation of the
pendulum was directed from S.B. 15° E. to N.W. 15° W. The ampli
tude described an arc of 12° 30', but with the following peculiarity,
that this did not consist of a perfect oscillation, but of three semi-
oscillations, which show plainly the violence of the shocks (see in

   impulse.

   the deviation of the pendulum, but who is competent to understand
    the terrible convulsions which       the  former underwent during such
    repeated and violent shocks ? The three above-mentioned convulsions,
    joined to the vertical undulation which reached 24 millims., being taken
    into account, the only thing to be astonished at is, that many more
    buildings were not thrown down. The pendulum continued oscillating

3  p.m. of the 21st, in three succeeding days had long intervals          of
complete immobility.     On the 25th, at h. m. a.m., another slight

the gradual change of focus of seismic radiation during the whole
time. The direction of the undulation was from E. 26° N. to W. 26°       S.,
and only reached a total amplitude of 3" 45'. The movement of trepi
dation was inappreciable, as the index of the vertical pendulum
departed only 0'7 millim. from its normal position.

        c "
            We will now recapitulate briefly what we understand by the
  RgTares.
        "On     the 14th, which is that represented       in fig. 1, we notice two
  foci       of seismic radiation, the first situated    in the second quadrant,
  wher        eit began, and the second situated in the first quadrant, where
'
  it    terminated.       In  the earthquakes of the 18th we also discover the
  same two foci         ;  but two others also appear which impelled the pen
  dulum in every          imaginable direction, as may be seen in fig. 2.
        c<
            Proceeding    to that of 3 p.m. on the 20th, we find that the focus of
  fc"h_© second quadrant acted with astounding violence, and the others
  disappeared (fig. 3). We turn now to fig. 4, which represents to us
  "fctt© violent repetition of 10 p.m. on the 20th, and we observe a great
   variation with regard to the foci of seismic radiation. In it we see
   that      the oscillations from east to west, and which correspond to the
   focus, which before had acted with so much violence, were gradual
   and of much less intensity. On the contrary, that from north-east to
   south-west showed a great degree of undulation from these points.
                                           Fig. 5.
         " Finally,  in fig. No. 5, which represents the last important oscil
     lation on the morning of the 25th, we only note the focus of seismic
     radiation of the first quadrant operating with very little intensity, the
     other foci having entirely disappeared.          We do not care at present
     to form deductions from the above observations, we have preferred
     to present them to general notice in order that scientific persons might
     form their own conclusions without being biassed by our opinions.
         " Note 1st. Observe, that in speaking of the swing of seismic un
      dulation from both sides of the centre of reference (place of instru
      ment), we do not mean to say that the buildings moved from one side
      to the other like the pendulum, because it is very clear that the latter
      was only moved in one of the semi-undulations by the effect of the

468                     Commander W. B. Pauli.                   [Feb. 17,
impulse, or inclination, of the building, the other being the effect of
the velocity acquired in the first semi-oscillation.        The object of
alluding to the double motion on either side of the centre of reference
was to give freedom to the opinion which some people held, that earth-
waves are similar to waves of sound in the air ; while others aver tint
they are caused by the rising and sinking of the ground in localities
more or less distant from the post of observation.
    " Note 2nd. A great number of lines will be observed in the figures
which appear not to be connected with the rest ; we can only explain
the fact as being caused by frequent vertical shocks, jerking the
pendulum violently and causing it to leave one curve to follow another
commenced by the new impulse.
    " We can assure our readers that the curves as they are repre
sented in the different figures were transferred from the lycopodium
to the paper with the greatest fidelity."
    This ends Father Fanra's observations on the earthquakes, and in
forwarding these he informs me that he will later on publish a more
complete account.      He is also engaged in establishing stations for
meteorological observation in various parts of Luzon — which will be in
telegraphic communication with Manila — and thence with Hone
 Kong ; the chief object being to announce the advent of typhoons.
 As these storms invariably travel from about east by south, or east-
 south-east   to west by north, or west-north-west, the Philippine
islands, especially Luzon, are well situated for the object of giving
 storm warnings to the coast of China.
    No doubt these stations will also be supplied with instruments, and
 receive instructions to observe the direction and force of earth- waves.
 If such stations had existed in July, the accounts would have been
 more complete and useful, and although reports from many place?
 are recorded, they are in most cases unreliable and contradictory, and
 deal chiefly with the destruction caused to buildings, loss of life, and
 injury to persons.
    The captain of the British steam-ship " Esmeralda," then at anchor
 in the Bay, states that in the earthquake at 6 p.m., on the 20th JnJy,
 " the water bubbled and boiled up
                                        noisily all around the ship and the
 vessel tossed as if in a heavy gale ;
                                       " that the wreck of a ship (which
 had been sunk for some years) " was thrown right up out of the
 water and one of her iron masts was seen to give way." He describes
 the sensation on board ship as well as on shore as that " of being
 suddenly connected with a galvanic battery strongly charged," and as
          "
 being a tremendous strain on the nerves."
    Accounts are also given of fissures in the ground in various places,
 from which sand and water were emitted, especially in the neigh
 bourhood of the Laguna do Bay, where hot sulphur springs have
 always existed.

1881.]      Notes on the Earthquakes   of July, 1880,    at Manila.    469
    I  will now give a translation of a letter to a local paper from a
resident near the spot, giving an account of the behaviour of the
Volcano of Taal before and during the earthquakes of July. This
letter was written in consequence of exaggerated reports of great
eruptions of that volcano, and professes to give a true relation of the
facts.
    " The crater of the Volcano of Taal ceased to send up smoke as
usual on Monday, 12th July. At nightfall on Wednesday the 14th,
subterranean noises were heard, and a heavy swell was observed in
the lake " (the volcano is on an island in the Lake of Taal), " which
ceased after the earthquake of the same night ; louder subterranean
noises were heard during the earthquake.
    " On Thursday the 15th, two columns of smoke continued to issue,
with intervals, until the 16th, when they almost disappeared, and the
volcano subsided to its usual state.
    " On Sunday the 18th, in the neighbouring villages of Tanauan,
Sto. Tomas, and Talisay, and nearly as far as Lipa, a fog of smoke,
with smell of sulphur, was observed, which disappeared suddenly at
noon ; a short time after occurred the violent earthquake of Sunday,
at 12 h. 40 m. p.m. In the afternoon of the same day, the 18th, the
volcano again threw up the two columns of smoke, at intervals, until
Tuesday the 20th, at 10 h. a.m., when it ceased smoking entirely.
In the afternoon, at 3 h. and some minutes, the violent earthquake,
felt at Manila, which was also most intense at Batangas and towards
the Laguna, occurred.        From eight to ten on Tuesday night, a
brightness   was seen  over the volcano, as if reflecting the light of fire
from the crater on the vapours which arose from it. This brightness
ceased suddenly and the atmosphere cleared entirely, and at ten
began the strong shocks of earthquakes,        the first being the violent
shock felt in Manila.    These continued   in the Province of Batangas
                                                                          "
                               " during the night and were sensible for
(in which Taal is situated)
several days.
    " On Wednesday the 21st, in the morning, the volcano threw up a
great quantity of smoke, to a considerable height, in one column, the
whole size of the crater, and continues to do so up to the time of
writing this notice.
    " In the evening, the Volcano of Maquiling, which had been con
sidered extinct, gave forth much smoke, which caused terror in the
province, because the people feared the crater there would break out
again, and they called to mind the terrible eruption of the Volcano
of Taal, on 12th December, 1754, when the lava destroyed the
villages of Tanauay, Sapa, Lipa, and Taal, which villages were after
wards rebuilt in a position more remote from the volcano."
   Among other strange phenomena recorded, it is stated from other
sources that the great mountains of Banajoa, Maquiling, and San

Cristobal were observed at the time of the earthquake to be covered
by clouds of, to all appearance, gaseous vapour ; and the Pads
Bravo, Curate of Lilio, asserts, that the movement of Banajoa was »
awful to behold that residents of that village, situated at the Use
of the mountain, feared that it would fall over and bury thee
beneath it.
   The two sheets containing diagrams of the five principal shods
were lithographed at Manila, under the careful supervision of Father
Faura, and   I  thought it better to send them as received rather tbar

appended a translation of the few descriptive notes on the sheets, as
the terms used are almost identical with their English signification.

I. "On a Simple Mode of Eliminating Errors of Adjustment
      in Delicate Observations of Compared Spectra." By Pro
      fessor G. G. Stokes, Sec. R.S.          Received February 12.
       1881.
   When the identity or difference of position of two lines, bright or
dark, in the spectra of two lights from different sources has to be
compared with the utmost degree of accuracy, they are admitted
simultaneously into different but adjacent parts of the slit of a spec
troscope and viewed together.      It was thus, for instance, that Dr.
Huggins proceeded in determining the radial component of the velocirr
of the heavenly bodies relatively to the earth. It is requisite that the
two lights that are to be compared should fall in a perfectly similar
manner on the slit : and it will be seen, from a perusal of his paper:
how careful Dr. Huggins was in this respect.
   In a paper read before the Royal Society on the 3rd instant, Mr-
Stone has proposed to make the observation independent of a possible
error in the exact coincidence of the lights compared by constractin-
a reversible spectroscope, by which the light should be refracted
alternately right and left, supposing for facility of explanation the
slit to be vertical.

  1881.]        Mode    of Eliminating Errors of Adjustment,           §-c.      471
      The idea is an elegant one, but           I apprehend that there would be
 considerable difficulty in carrying it out. For a spectroscope giving
 large dispersion is of considerable weight, and the reversal of so heavy
 an apparatus would be liable to introduce possible errors arising from
 flexure.* It would be difficult to make sure that such did not exist, at
 any rate, unless the instrument were constructed with great nicety
 and firmness, which would add considerably to the cost ; and even
 then the care and time required for the reversal would help to oblite
rate the observer's memory of what he had seen in the first position of
the instrument.
      A method has occurred to me of effecting the reversal without re
 versing the spectroscope, but merely giving a lateral push to a little
apparatus which need not weigh more than a few grains.
     If the base of an isosceles prism be polished as well as the sides,
and a ray of light parallel to the base and in a plane perpendicular to
the edge fall on one of the equal sides of the prism so as to emerge
from the other, after suffering an intermediate reflection (which will
necessarily be total) at the base, its course after refraction will be
parallel to its course before incidence ; and there will, moreover, be
no lateral displacement, provided the lateral distance of the base from
the incident ray be such that the point of reflection is at the middle of
the base.
     If the  slit of the spectroscope be covered by such a prism, placed
close to the slit and facing the collimating lens, to the axis of which
its base is parallel, it will not disturb the general course of the light
incident on the spectroscope, nor even produce a lateral displacement
provided the lateral position be that mentioned above ; but in conse
quence of the reflection there will be a reversal as regards right and
left, and any error in the placing of the lights to be compared will
thus be detected and eliminated, by comparing the spectra Reen with
the light from the slit direct or reflected. If the prism be placed
quite close to the slit it may be made very minute in section, though
it shonld be long enough to cover the slit, and then the change of
focus which it produces will be insignificant.
    There will be no need, however, to make the prism so very minute,
nor to place it so close to the slit, provided it be associated with a
plate to take its place in the direct observation, and compensate for
the change of focus which is produced by its introduction.
    Let ABCD be a section of the prism, let M be the middle point of
the base AB, KLMNO the course of a ray passing as above described,
which is supposed to be the axis of the pencil coming through the

turned in its socket, the slit and cylindrical lens remaining fixed. To such an
instrument the objection as to flexure would not apply.

the angle subtended at the slit by the objective of the collimator. It
should be a little larger than what is just sufficient to take in the
largest pencil that is to be observed, but not beyond that. The object
in keeping it as small as conveniently may be, is that only a trifling
change of focus may be required when the instrument is pushed aside
altogether, and the slit viewed directly through the spectroscope,
•without the slight loss of light due to the two reflections.
    The compensating plate is represented as placed at the narrow end
of the prism, which permits of the two being cemented together,
thereby facilitating the support.      I do not think that the minute
quantity of light which is reflected at L, and scattered at the surface
 (even though blackened) FC in such a direction as to mingle with the
clireet light would be any inconvenience, being too faint to be visible
at all. If it were wished to avoid this, or to get more easy access to
the surfaces AD, BC, for cleaning if requisite, the plate might be
 placed at the other side ; bnt in that case it must not be cemented to
AB, as that surface is wanted for total reflection.
    The little instrument I have suggested may conveniently be called
a slit-reverser, to distinguish it from other arrangements which have
been proposed, and in which the spectrum itself is reversed.
    P.S.   Feb. 21. — The method proposed above is more directly appli
cable to such an object as the comparison of really or apparently
coincident lines in the spectra of two elements than to astronomical
measurements, because in the latter case a great part of the difficulty
arises from a want of perfect accuracy in the clockwork movement of
the equatoreal. Yet I cannot help thinking that even for astronomical
 work the method will be found useful ; for we can pass in a moment
from the direct to the reflected image of the slit, and vice versa, and
by taking the measures alternately in the two modes, and combining
them exactly as in weighing with a balance that is still swinging, any
error progressive with the time would tend to be eliminated.

          a= another local atmospheric constant depending on         latitude
                and local conditions.
    When the absorption of sun-heat by the atmosphere is neglected
                                   0(z)=cosz,
and the first term of the equation can be integrated for one day is
terms of t, and afterwards summed for all latitudes, for one year; but
when we take account of the absorption of sun-heat by the atmosphere,
0(z) becomes an exponential function of cos z, that cannot be inte
grated, even by series.
    It has been shown, however, that, whether we take account of            the
atmospheric     absorption  or not, the quantity of sun-heat represented     by
2^_0OO taken for the whole summer is the same, at similar latitudes,
     r2
in the northern and southern hemispheres ; and, in like manner, the
winter sun-heats are the same in the two hemispheres, whatever mar
be the perihelion longitude and eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
    This being so, the secular inequalities of climate under discussion,
must arise from the second term of equation (1), depending on terres
trial radiation, and ultimately on the fact that the summers and
winters in the two hemispheres differ in length, that difference depend
ing on the perihelion longitude and eccentricity, as is well known.
    Before discussing the second (or radiation) term of equation (1), I
shall explain my reasons for assuming it to have the form
                                   -B(tf + «),
and show what that form implies.

      The
      heat received from the sun hy the layer of atmosphere next the
ground is dissipated in the following ways : —
      1   .   By convection, orascent of the warmer surface air into the higher
layers         of the atmosphere, until it is cooled down to a temperature* a,
such that its direct radiation                    into space is equal to the heat received
from the sun and lower layers                     of the atmosphere at that height in the
sitmosphere.
   2. By             conduction,      or transfer of heat from layer to layer,                   as    in
solids.
       3.     By direct radiation from the surface layer across the atmosphere
into          star-space.
       The third of these sources of loss of heat may be neglected, because
    the atmosphere, which absorbs about one-fourth of the luminous sun-
    lieat passing throngh it vertically, will absorb nearly all non-luminous
    heat and allow only an infinitesimal fraction to   escape into star-space.
       The first source of loss of heat (convection) is much more influential
    than the second (conduction), but for my present purpose it is not
    necessary to make any distinction between them, for the loss of heat
    from both causes will follow the same law and is proportional to the
    difference of temperature between the surface layer of the atmosphere
    and the upper, or equilibrium control layer; that                       is,
                                                             the loss of heat                          is
     proportional  to (0 + a).
        The radiation     therefore represented by
                                is
                                          Radiation=B(0+a)i<.
        This expression cannot be summed without assuming some relation
     between     and 0  which   do as follows — It
                               /,        I              well known that the
                                                              :        is
     diurnal temperature does not reach its maximum and minimum at
     midday and midnight, but some hours after the sun's passage of the
     upper and lower meridian and           also well known that the hottest
                                             ;      it   is
     and coldest days of the year    do  not occur at midsummer and mid
     winter, but some days after.
        This law of diurnal and annual change of temperature presents so
     close an analogy to the law of the diurnal and annual tides, as to
     justify us in assuming for its mathematical expression formulas similar
     to those of the well-known equations of the diurnal and annual tides.
      I       therefore assume —
                                                 •-VrJJSi                                             (2),

     In the concluding paragraph of the note communicated on the lOti
 of  January to the Royal Society these words occur : — " The vapours of
 all compound liquids will, I doubt not, be found sonorous in the inie-
 mittent beam."      Since that time I have examined eighty differs:
 liquids, both at the ordinary temperature of the air and at their boding
temperatures, and have verified so far the prediction just quoted,         b.
           I
all cases have obtained musical sounds — some feeble, some moderate,
and some exceedingly      strong.   I  have, moreover, determined by ther-
 mometric expansion     the absorptions exerted by the vapours of mors
than twenty of these liquids, and it is my intention to subject the whoU
of them to this test. The harmony and mutual support exhibited by
two series of experiments, conducted in accordance with these two
 diverse methods, are on the whole admirable.       The investigation, how
ever, is laborious, and many weeks must elapse before          I am able so
submit it in extenso to the Royal Society.
    Tested by the thermometric method, my old experiments on aqueoc-
vapour again affirm their Validity. A long and narrow glass tube, bent
into the form of a U, was partially filled with coloured water. Ch*
leg of the U was connected with the recipient which contained tbe
gaseous substances submitted to experiment, while the other end wa;
left open to the air. Before permitting the beam to pass, the liqui-i
stood at the same level in both legs of the tube.       Cleansing the reci
pient thoroughly, and filling it with well-dried air, a powerful bean
was sent through it. There was no sensible expansion and consequently
no perceptible motion of the thermometric column.
    Air similarly dried was then passed over bibulous paper, moistened
by water of a temperature of 14" C.         The modicum of vapour carriei
forward at this temperature by the dried air, when smitten bv the
beam, produced instantly a depression of 55 millims. in the leg of the
tube connected with the recipient, and an equal elevation in the other
leg.    The difference of level in the two legs amounted, therefore, to
110 millims.     No trace of haze or sign of condensation could be
detected within the recipient.       Its boundaries were as bright, and its
contents as free     from   turbidity, as when the dry air alone was
employed.
    With a conical tube of a certain size, stopped at its base by a trans
                             I
parent plate of rocksalt, have obtained a considerable intensification
of the sounds. Abandoning the ear-tube altogether, and filling the

 I. " Some Experiments on Metallic Reflexion. No. II." By
        Sir John Conroy, Bart., M.A. Communicated by Professor
        Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received February 12, 1881.
    Professor Stokes did me the honour of commnnicating to the Royai
 Society a short paper (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 28, p. 242) giving an
 account of some determinations    I had made of the values of the prin
 cipal incidence for, and the principal azimuth of, red light, when
 reflected by a gold plate in contact with air, water, and carbor,
 bisulphide.
    These experiments   I have continued, using light of different refran-
gibilities, and gold and silver plates, and also thin films of these metals.
    The observations were made by causing a beam of light which had
 been polarised elliptically, by passing through a nicol with its prin
 cipal section at an angle of 45° with the plane of incidence, and a
 " quarter undulation plate," with one of the neutral axes in that
                                                                      plane,
 to fall on the metal plate, and then altering the angle of incidence till
the reflected  light was plane polarised.
    The angle of incidence at which this was the case was different,
according as one or other of the neutral axes of the quarter plate was
in the plane of incidence, and the mean of these two values was taken
as the true principal incidence.
    The goniometer used in these experiments was described in the
former paper, but had an additional vertical divided circle attached to
the inner end of the tube fixed to the collimator arm, in order to
facilitate the adjustment of the quarter plate, and to permit the plate
being changed, without the necessity of determining each time the
position of the neutral axes.
   Brewster's law, that the tangent of the angle of polarisation is equal

1881.]           Some Experiments on     Metallic Reflexion.         487
to the refractive index of the medium, not having been, as far as I
was aware, ever experimentally verified in the case of transparent
bodies in contact with media other than air, it appeared desirable to
make some experiments on this point, though there was every reason
for supposing that the law would be found to hold good.
   A crown glass prism was fastened to the vertical stage, the quarter
undulation plate and the analysing nicol removed, the polarising nicol
placed with its principal section in the plane of incidence, and the
angle of polarisation determined, a paraffine lamp being used as the
source of light.    The thin glass vessel was then placed on the vertical
stage, and  filled successively with water and carbon tetrachloride, and

   The angles of polarisation in air are the mean of twelve and four
observations respectively, those in water of eight and twelve, and
those in carbon tetrachloride of twelve observations.
   When the surface of the glass was in contact with water or carbon
tetrachloride, its reflective power was so much diminished that it was
not possible to determine the angle at which the minimum amount of
light was reflected, and therefore the angles at which the light ceased
to be visible were observed, and the mean of these taken as the angle
of polarisation.
   The tangents of the angles of polarisation in water and carbon tetra
chloride, when multiplied by the refractive indices of these liquids,
give the following values for the angle of polarisation in air : —

   The distilled water which was used in these experiments had not
been freed from air, and this may account for the values of the angles
of polarisation in air, calculated from the measurements made in
water, being somewhat too high.
   These observations show that,      within the limits of experimental
error, Brewster's law holds good for glass in contact with water and
carbon tetrachloride, as well as air, and that in all probability it is
universally true for transparent bodies.

    The same gold plate         which had been used in the previously             de
scribed experiments       was fastened to the stage of the goniometer,           and
the principal incidences       and azimuths observed        with yellow and blue
light, when the plate was in air, water, and carbon bisnlphide.
    An alcohol flame with a salted wick and a paraffine lamp, with a
glass trough filled with ammonio-sulphate of copper placed in from
of it, were used as the sources of light.          The light transmitted by the
deep red glass used in the previous experiments and by the ammonio-
sulphate was not homogeneous.
    The light of the greatest intensity in the one case          was slightly    more
refrangible than C, and in the other of a refrangibility nearly midway
between F and G.
    The polarising nicol was placed with its principal section at u
angle of 45° with the plane of incidence in each of the four quadrant:
successively, and two observations made with the nicol in each posi
tion ; so that the value of the principal incidence and the principal
azimuth for each position of the " quarter undulation plate " is the
mean     of eight observations.
    The following table contains        the results of these     experiments ; the
values for red light, which had been previously obtained,              are included
in it for the sake of comparison : —

    The last column gives the values            as corrected     by Professor Stokes'
method (loc. cit., p. 248).
    The table shows, that for red and yellow light the observations
made with plate I, and for blue light those made with plate VI, are but
of little value ; whilst for red and yellow light the observations made
with plate VI, and for blue light those made                   with plate I, lie very
close to the corrected numbers.
    All subsequent experiments were therefore made with plate VI for
red and yellow light, and with plate              I for blue light.
    The gold plate used in these experiments had been polished with
rouge, and from time to time rubbed with a little rouge, and then
with a clean chamois leather to remove the polishing powder.
    From some experiments with a silver plate, it appeared probable
that the optical constants           of the plate might depend to a certain
extent on the nature of the polishing powder used, and therefore the
gold plate was dismounted and polished with putty powder, and then
well rnbbed with a clean chamois leather, and the principal incidences
and azimuths determined.
    Four observations were determined in each position of the quarter
plate, two with the principal section of the polarising nicol on the
right, and two on the left of the plane of incidence; the plate VI being
used with red and yellow light, and plate 1 with blue light.

   Polishing the plate with rouge appears to have had the effect of
increasing the values of the principal incidences and diminishing those
of the azimuths, but not to such an extent as might have been antici
pated from the difference between the values obtained with the plate
before and after it had been polished with putty powder.       This may
be due to the original smoothing and polishing with rouge having
altered the surface of the plate to a greater extent than conld bo
effected by repolishing with rouge the already polished plate.
   The gold plate, which was a long narrow one, having been con
stantly rubbed in one direction whilst being polished, it was thought
possible that the direction of the furrows produced by the polishing
might influence the result: the plate was therefore turned so that
these were perpendicular to the plane of incidence, instead of parallel
with it. This alteration in the position of the plate did not appear to
alter the value of the constants.

   In order   to obtain a gold surface free from the influence of any
polishing powder, a sheet of gold leaf was placed between two pieces
(if paper, and the paper and gold cut into strips with a sharp pair of
scissors, the gold leaf transferred to glass slips, floated out with water,
in the manner described by Faraday, and the water allowed to drain
off, leaving the gold leaf stretched out on the glass.
   Some of the pieces of gold leaf were thinned by being floated on a
dilute solution of potassium cyanide, the cyanide solution washed
away with water as soon as the thickness of the gold had been suffi
ciently reduced, and the gold leaf left adhering to the glass.
   Gold leaf treated in this way has a very fairly smooth surface,
sufficiently good to act as a tolerable mirror, and both the ordinary
leaf, and that thinned by the action of potassium cyanide, is trans
parent, the transmitted light being, as is well known, green.
   In order to determine the thickness of the gold, the glass slips were
carefully cleaned and weighed before the gold was transferred to them,
and then, after being dried, again weighed.
   The area of the gold was measured, and the specific gravity being
taken as 1936 ("Watts' Dictionary," vol.         p. 926), the thickness
                                                        ii,

incidences   and azimuths being somewhat higher, especially with blue
light, in the case of the gold leaf.
   It therefore appears probable that of the two sets of values for the
gold plate, those obtained after the plate had been polished with putty
powder are nearest the truth.
   A    large number        of determinations of the principal incidences and
principal azimuths were made with a silver plate in air, water, and
carbon tetrachloride, with both the quarter undulation plate3.
   The silver plate had been polished with rouge, and during the course
of these experiments, which were carried on at intervals during some
months, rubbed with a little rouge from time to time, and although
afterwards well rubbed on a clean chamois leather, in certain lights it
appeared to have a reddish tinge, although the surface was most
brilliant.
   In some few of the earlier experiments sixteen observations were
made in each position of the quarter plate, four with the polariser in
each quadrant ; but most of the numbers are the means of eight
observations, two for each position of the polariser.

    angle of 90° and two more observations made, so that the values for each

        The retardation produced by the plate not being equal to 90° for the

        An elliptical vibration being equivalent to two rectilinear vibrations
    in the planes of the axes, differing in phase by a quarter of an undu
    lation, and of different amplitudes, this method affords a ready means
    of producing with the same retarding plate a difference of phase                         of
    exactly 90° between the vibrations in the plane of incidence and the
    plane perpendicular to    it with light of different wave-lengths.

        The azimuths are different, both in sign and in amount, for the two

     The azimuths for silver in air and water with yellow light were so
close to one another, that the mean was taken in these two cases as
the principal azimuth.
     The determinations of the reflexion constants of the silver plate
made by the two different methods agree fairly well together, hut are
not in accordance with subsequent observations made with films of
 chemically deposited silver, or with M. Jamin's experiments (" Cours
 de Physique," edit. 1866, vol. iii, p. 693), the principal incidences being
 somewhat too high, and the principal azimuths having different values
 for light of different refrangibilities, instead of being nearly the same
 for all kinds of light.
     The plate having been polished with rouge, and having, as has
 already been mentioned, a reddish tinge, due in all probability to
 minute particles of the powder having become embedded in its surface,
 it appeared possible that the difference in the values of the azimuths
 for the three kinds of light might be due to the rouge ; the plate was
 therefore dismounted and well polished with putty powder, which was
 chosen as being nearly white, and then the measurements repeated in
 the usual manner.

   The values of the principal incidences are nearly the same as when
the plate had been cleaned with rouge, but the principal azimuths, in
addition to being considerably higher, differ but little for the three
kinds of light instead of increasing with the refrangibility of the
light.
   Films of silver chemically deposited  on glass were prepared by
Martin's process (" Ann. de Chimie," 4th Series, vol. xv, p. 94).   Glass
slips, similar to those used for mounting   microscopic    objects, were
well cleaned, polished with rouge, washed with water, a little nitric
acid poured over them, and then again washed and dried.
   A rectangular frame (about 15 centims. by 7 centims.), formed of
two glass rods, the ends of which were fixed into pieces of wood, was
placed in a shallow earthenware dish partly filled with distilled water;
the surfaces of the pieces of glass which were to be silvered were wetted
with a mixture of equal parts of alcohol and potassium hydrate solu
tion, and then the glass slips placed with their ends resting on the
glass rods, and with their wetted surfaces downwards.          There was
just sufficient water in the dish for the lower surfaces of the glass
slips to be in contact with it, whilst the upper remained dry.
   The silvering solutions were mixed in another dish, care being taken
that the depth of the silvering solution was the same as that of the
water, and the frame with the slips resting on      transferred from one it,
dish to the  other.
   The room in which the silvering was carried on being very cold the
action was slow, and till at least five minutes had elapsed there was
hardly any deposit; the slips were removed successively after          11,                      8,
14, and 18   minutes,  well washed   with water, and   placed on edge to
dry. The reflexion constants in air, water, and carbon tetrachloride
were observed, and then after the area of the silver had been measured,
and the slips dried and weighed, the silver was rubbed off with a damp
cloth, and the glass again dried and weighed, and .from the loss of
weight and the area, the thickness of the films calculated.          The

    The table for the silver film in air shows that with the increase of
the thickness of the film the principal incidence increases for all three
kinds of light, bnt the increase is greatest with red and least with bine
light. The principal azimuth also increases with the thickness, bnt
does so more rapidly, the difference between the values for films I. and
 II   and between V and    VI   being very considerable, whilst the values
for films  II, III, and IV and VII,   VIII, and  IX   lie close together.
    With films II, V,   and  VI  the azimuths increase from red to blue,
 whilst with the thicker films they decrease ; film I, however, furnishes
an exception, for, although very thin, the azimuths decrease from red
 to blue.
    In this respect the thicker films behave like the silver plate cleaned
 with putty powder (p. 496), and the actual values of the azimuths in
 both cases are about the same ; the principal incidences, however, are
 much lower with the films than with the plate.         The difference in the
 values of the principal incidences may possibly be due to the effect
 produced on the plate by the pressure necessary to polish it.
    When the films were in water and carbon tetrachloride, the prin
 cipal incidences decreased to a slight extent with the increased
 thickness, but the variation was small in amount.          The azimuths in
                    I
 the case of film in water increased from red to blue, but in carbon
 tetrachloride, and with the other films in both liquids, the azimuths
 decreased from red to blue.
     When the films were in contact with the liquids, the principal inci
 dences were lower, except with film I, than in air, and the principal
 azimuths were also lower, instead of being higher, as had been the
  case with the gold and silver plates.
     Quincke (" Pogg. Ann.," vol. cxxix, p. 177) made a large number of
 observations with silver films and red light, and found that the values
  of the principal incidences increased with tbe thickness, and tended to
 a constant value, and also that as soon as the thickness of the metal
 exceeded 0"00002 millim. there was but little further change in the
 value of the principal incidence.
     In the short paper which appeared in the "Proc. Roy. Soc,"
 vol. 28, p. 242, it is stated that the numbers obtained by multiplying
 the tangents of the angles of principal incidence for red light and the
 gold plate in water and carbon bisulphide, by the refractive indices of
 these media, were somewhat higher than the tangents of the angles of
 principal incidence for air. This is also the case for the determinations
 made with the gold plate and yellow and blue light, and for those made
 with gold leaf, the silver plate, and the silver films with all three kinds
 of light. Thus for the silver plate cleaned with putty powder the
 values are as follow : —

    In  the case of the silver films the difference   between     the observed
and calculated values is greatest with the thinner       films (amounting to
nearly 4° for the thinnest, with red light) and diminishes as the films
increase in thickness.
    The values for the refractive index for gold were also calculated by
the formula given by Lundquist (" Pogg. Ann.," vol. clii, p. 405), ^SA=
tan2A(l— sin3A. sin*20), and the values for the relative indices for
water and carbon bisulphide multiplied by the refractive indices of
these media, but the numbers thus obtained did not agree with those
deduced from observations of the principal incidence and azimuth in
air.
    These experiments appear to show, first, that with glass in contact
 with media other than air, the tangent of the angle of polarisation is
 equal to the relative refractive index of the media.
     Second, that the optical constants of a polished           metallic plate
 depend, to a certain extent, on the substance with which it has been
 polished, and that this surface condition is a fairly permanent one,
 not being destroyed by contact with liquids or by a considerable
 amount of rubbing with a clean chamois leather.
     Third, that when the plate is in contact with media other than air,
 the principal indices are lower, and the principal azimuths higher than
 in air ; but that there is no simple relationship discoverable between
 the change in the values of the constants and the indices of the media.
     Fourth, that with metallic films the principal incidence and the prin
 cipal azimuth increase with the thickness of the film, and that therefore
 more than one layer of molecules is concerned in the act of reflexion.
     The fact that with the increase of the thickness of the films the
 principal azimuth increases appears to show that the surface layers
  reflect light polarised in the plane of incidence more abundantly than
  light polarised perpendicularly to that plane, and that as the number
 of reflecting layers increases, the amount of light polarised perpendicu
 larly to the plane of incidence which is reflected increases also ; or, in
 other words, the light polarised perpendicularly to the plane of inci
 dence penetrates to a greater depth than that polarised in the plane of
  incidence.

     When hairs affected with the Trichophyton tonsurans are cultivated
in   cells, the development of the spores on the sides of the hairs can, if
it occurs, be observed in situ nnder the microscope. When the attempted
cultivation takes place on the surface of a fluid in a test-glass, it is also
possible, after maceration in solutions of potash, to decide whether
the spores in the hairs have grown out from the surface of the hair,
and to distinguish between a growth of adventitious fungi and the
growth of the Trichophyton.
     The paper gives an account of experiments made by the use of cells
and test-glasses, which were kept at a temperature of between 92° and
 98° F., but in a few instances at the ordinary room temperature.               The
 Trichophyton remained sterile in cultivations attempted with a solu
 tion of phosphate of soda and tartrate of ammonia, with Conn's fluid,
 milk, carrot infusion, turnip infusion, salt solution (0-75 per cent.),
 egg albumen, egg albumen and potash, and vitreous humour and
 potash.      The only method by which it was grown was by moistening
 the hairs with vitreous humour. When moistened with vitreous
 humour, the spores on the sides of the hairs placed in cells were seen
 to grow into a mycelium, and free growth took place when the hairs
 were floated on the surface of this fluid in test-tubes.         It did not grow
 in cells when the hairs were immersed in a large drop, nor in test-
 tubes when the hairs were kept at the bottom of the tube.
     The growth observed consisted in a formation of mycelinm, which
 sprouted from the spores in the hairs, and in the formation of spores in
 the newly-formed mycelium.
     The successful cultivations were,       with one exception, at the incubator
 temperature.      In  the exceptional      instance   the fungus grew at room
 temperature,     but more feebly         and   slowly than at the incubator
 temperature.
    It was shown by experiments in which Aspergillus, Penicillium
 glaucum, and other fungi grew around the hairs, whilst the spores of
 the Trichophyton remained sterile, that the latter is essentially distinct
 from the common fungi whose spores are present in the atmosphere.
    The development of the spores by the only method found successful
 could not be relied on as certain        in any given case.    It was not found

  The author having in several      cases   of Alopecia areata found bacteria
adherent to the roots of extracted hairs, subjected hairs in six selected
cases to processes designed to demonstrate the existence of organisms,
should they be present, in the substance of the diseased hairs.
   In five out of the six cases an object was observed in the hairs which
he believes to be a bacterium.     It was seen as rounded or elongated
                                                     a
spheroid, and was found frequently in pairs, the long diameter of the
two spheroids forming      a continuous straight line.   Sometimes three
were found in line,    adelicate rod-shaped sheath enveloping the three.
These bodies    were,  as was shown by the processes to which the hairs
were subjected, neither oily particles nor crystals, and they could be
distinguished from the granules always present in hairs.        In all the
cases their size and form were the same, and they had the refractive
qualities of bacteria.
   In hairs which were only slightly affected they were found between
the inner root-sheath and the hair-shaft, and in small clusters on
the hair-shaft beneath the cuticle of the hair. In hairs which were
much diseased they were found in great numbers inside the cuticle of
the hair, in the disintegrated hair substance.
   Some hairs were found split into ribbon-like bands not far from the
root and the organisms were found on the bands.
   They were found only in the part of the hair which         under the

     Whilst     occupied    -with cultivation    of ringworm hairs in vitreous
 humour at a temperature             of 92 to 98° F.,   I had occasion to observe
 in studying the hairs under the microscope, amongst the forms of
 bacteria which were invariably found in these cultivations, certain
 appearances that seem worthy of note.
     For the present, I shall limit my remarks to one of these ap
  pearances.
      It is known that certain fungi possess the property of taking up
 colouring matter from the medium in which they grow ; and                       I have
 had occasion to observe in the Trichophyton tonsurans that both in man
  and in the horse the fungus may acquire a dark colour from absorbed
  pigment.
      In  the case    of the horse,   I have found the mycelial wall represented
  by an apparently empty dark tube ; and               I  have found, at the same
  time, spores blackened with a coating of pigment.
      I have found an analogous appearance in bacteria.
      The bacteria found in these cultivations are seen in the transition
  forms of a spore or coccus, an elongating spore, rods, elongated rods,
  sometimes of great length, long rods, with the first appearance of a
  differentiation of the protoplasm into sporules, and finally as tubes
  full of spores or cocci.
      These appearances have been now followed in several specific
  organisms, and notably, and first of all, in the Bacillus anthracis.
  They wonld seem to indicate the ordinary life-history of at least many
  bacteria.
      I observed    that frequently the preparations contained long bacteria
  rods which had taken up pigment from the hair. This pigment was
  often found at one end of a long rod, whilst towards the other end
  the rod was free from it ; and in the part of the rod in which the
  pigment was found the spore formation could, in several instances, be
     * As treatment which is destructive of bacteria would also arrest the
                                                                                develop
   ment of a fungus, it is desirable to add that in none of these cases, nor in previous
  ones, was the author able to find the fungus described by Gruby, although a large
   number of hairs were examined. The examinations thus made were so exhaustive
   that he can only explain the alleged existence of a fungus in this disease by assum
   ing that the distinction between Alopecia areata and some of the forms of ringworm
   has not been always kept in view.
                                                                      2 n 2

ment.     The  pigment   was  packed in the tubes around and between the
spores ; but, by focussing, it could be seen that the substance of the
spore was free from it.      The free spores and short rods were free from
pigment.
    The bacteria in which it was observed showed no other peculiarities,
and were of about the same calibre as the rod bacteria usually observed.
    The fact is noted as affording proof that bacteria can take up
minute solid particles through their walls.

    This paper contains the development of a theory for functions which
satisfy Laplace's equation, and are suitable for conditions given over
the    surface of a circular anchor ring, and which therefore seem
important in the possibility of their application to the theory of vortei
 rings, as well as other physical problems.          From the nature of the
 case, it will not be easy to give an intelligent and full abstract of tbe
 results without making it unduly long, but it may be possible to give
 some idea of its scope and the method of development.

 orders of the form (2p + 1)/2. It is shown how the P can be expressed
 in terms of the first and second complete elliptic integrals F, E ; and
  the Q in terms of the complementary          integrals F', E'. Several in

    Section ii is devoted    to the consideration of zonal functions, i.e.,
functions suitable when     the conditions are symmetrical about an axis.
Section iii deals with      the general case, whilst in the last section
illustrations of the use     of the functions are given by application to
several problems, such as the potentials of tores under the action of
an electrified ring, or point of electricity, and the velocity potential
when a tore moves parallel to itself in a fluid. Among the results
obtained, which may be mentioned here, is the electrical capacity of an
anchor ring.       When the section of the ring is not very large com
pared    with  the  central opening, a very close approximation is given
by the formula     —

R, r being the radii of the circular axis, and generating circle of the
ring respectively.
    The approximation is so close that the formula only makes an error
of about "3 per cent, when r is so large as R.   \
    If a tangent be drawn from the centre to the anchor ring, and a
sphere be described with this for radius, the capacity of the tore
measured in terms of that of the sphere is

    In carrying out     the   investigation of the molecular structure of
 insect scales, under the finest attainable amplification, the discovery
 has been made that the striated surfaces of these scales, though
 appearing approximately beaded, are really covered with villi, chenille
 or velvet pile, terminating in a spherule.
    The recognised object of these striee regarded as corrugations" is to
 give strength to a most delicate tissue, which are again supported by

 spherule.     This very difficult observation appears to open a new field
 of research.      The object upon which these beaded villi were first
 detected is the scale of the Vanessa Atalanta, or Red Admiral.

 I. " On the Conversion of Radiant Energy into Sonorous Vibra
       tions." By William Henry Preece. Communicated by
        the President.         Received February 21, 1881.
   Messrs. Graham Bell and Sumner Tainter* have shown that, under
certain conditions, intense rays of light, if allowed to fall with periodic
intermittence upon thin disks of almost every hard substance, will set
up disturbances in those disks corresponding to this periodicity which
result in sonorous vibrations. Mr. Bell has subsequently shown that
such effects are not confined to hard substances, but that they can be
produced by matter in a liquid form.
   These discoveries have elicited a considerable amount of interest,
and have led to the inquiry whether the sonorous effects are due, as
the discoverers themselves surmised, to light, or as the President of
the Royal Society, Professor Tyndall, and others have suggested to
radiant heat.                                                                •
   Messrs. Bell and Tainter have partially answered this question by
showing that the disturbances are not necessarily due to light, for they
found that sheets of hard rubber or ebonite — a substance opaque to
light — do not entirely cut off the sounds, but allow certain rays to
pass through, which continue the effect.                 M. Mercadier, who has
studied the subject with great care,f has shown that the effects are
confined to the red and ultra-red rays.             Moreover, Professor Tyndall
has shownj that gases, such as sulphuric ether, which he had proved
to be highly absorbent of heat rays, while they are transparent to

light  rays, are remarkably sensitive to this intermittent action.                Dr.
Tyndall has more recently read a paper before the Society* proving
that these sonorous effects are a function of all gases and vapours
absorbing radiant heat, and that the intensity of the sounds prodnced
is a measure of this absorption.
    The negative proof of Messrs. Bell and Tainter can be rendered
positive if it can be shown that ebonite is diathermanous.               The author
provided himself with several sheets of different substances, and a
sensitive radiometer. A standard candle and a lime-light were used as
sources of energy, the former fixed four inches and the latter four
feet from the radiometer, which was carefully screened from all dis
turbing influences but that of the source. The number of revolu
tions made by the radiometer per minute was counted, first without
any screen, and then with each sheet successively interposed ; and the
average of several observations was taken.            The following is the result,
and the numbers indicate the relative diathermancy of the substances
used to the source of light used : —

508            Mr. W. H. Preece.         On the Conversion     of   [Mar. 10,
disturbances    produced by some thermic action rather than by any
luminous effect. Several other experiments made by them confirm
this conclusion, notably those made upon crystals of sulphate of copper,
a substance which Mr. Crookes has shown to be highly opaque to rays
of low refrangibility.*
    Now, the questions arise, is this thermic action expansion and con
traction of the mass due to its absorption of heat ? Or is it a disturb
ance due to molecular pressure similar to that which produces the
rotation of the radiometer ? Or is it due to some other cause ?
    The argument against the first assumption when applied to herd
disks, is that time is a material element in such actions, and that the
rate of cooling of warmed diaphragms is too slow to admit of such
effects.   Lord Rayleighf has questioned the validity of this argument,
and has shown that if the radiating power of the body experimented
on were sufficiently high a slow rate of cooling would be favourable to
 rapid fluctuations of temperature.         It became desirable to test this
 point experimentally. The following apparatus was constructed for
 the purpose.
    AB is a thin strip or wire 6 centims. in length of the substance to
 be examined, fixed to a platinum " make and break
                                                             " M, and
                                                                      adjusted
 to a lever S, round whose axis is fastened a silk thread, the end of
 which is attached to the strip or wire at A, and whose position could
 be adjusted by a screw C.       Any variation of tension due to expansion
 or contraction of the wire would produce intermission in the electric
 currents passing through the telephone T, which if periodically pro
  duced would result in sonorous vibrations in the telephone.             Heat
  from various sources and at various distances from bright lime- light to
  dull heat from hot metallic surfaces, was allowed to fall through
 rotating vanes intermittently on AB ; but notwithstanding every pre
 caution, and the many materials used, not more than six interruptions
  per second could be produced, although the system was beautifully
  sensitive to the smallest changes of temperature.

   The best effect was obtained when AB was a thin ebonite wire about
•5 millim. in diameter, and 6 centims. in length.
   It was evident from these experiments that the sonorous effects of
hard disks could not be explained by the change of volume due to the
impact of heat rays, and their absorption by the mass of the disk.*
   Is the action then due to molecular pressure similar to that which
produces the rotation of the radiometer ?
   It is quite true that the radiometer effect is one visible only in very
high exhaustions, but Mr. Crookes (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 169, § 220)
detected " the existence of molecular pressure when radiation falls on
a black surface in air of normal density."
   Whenever radiant energy falls on an absorbent surface in air, such
as a disk of blackened wood, its wave-length is degraded or lowered,
and it is converted in thermometric heat.              The molecules of air
striking this warmed surface acquire heat, and move away from it
 with increased velocity, and as action and reaction are always alike in
                                             "
 moving away, they give the body a kick." Since there is no such
action on the other side of the disk, there is a difference of pressure
 between the two sides, which gives it a tendency to move away from
 the source of energy.          The effect is very much smaller in air at
 ordinary pressures than in air at a very low vacuum, because in the
 former case, the mean free path of the molecules is very small, and
 the rebounding molecules help to keep back the more slowly ap
 proaching molecules. Nevertheless, molecular pressure is experienced,
 and if of sufficient magnitude and rapidity, it ought to produce
 sonorous vibrations.       It seemed probable that the element of time
 does not enter here so prominently as in the previous case, for the
 radiometer effect is a mere surface action of the disk, and not one
 affecting its mass. Hence it was hoped that the retarding effects
 would be eliminated.         If the sonorous action, therefore, be due to a
 radiometer action, a difference of effect would be observed if the side
    * This conclusion was confirmed  by subsequent experiments, notably by Experi
  ments 7 and 41.

of a disk exposed to the source of energy, be either blackened by lamp
black or camphor carbon, or if it be polished or whitened.
    An apparatus was constructed similar in principle to that described
by Messrs. Bell and Tainter.           The source of light (L) was an oxy-
hydrogen lime-light.         The rotating disk (R) was of zinc perforated
 with holes, which could be noiselessly rotated, so as to obtain 1,000
intermissions per second.         Glass lenses (G) were employed to focus
the light upon the perforations of the rotating disk, and another (G'),
 to render the rays parallel on the other side of the disk. A mahogany
case   or cup (C) to retain the disks to be experimented upon was
constructed as shown in section in fig. 3, and fixed 400 ccntims.
from the source L ; a, being the disk 5 centims. in diameter,
clamped on by screws ; b, a brass tube, to which the india-rubber
hearing tube (h) was fixed; c, a circular air space behind the disk
6' centims. in diameter,      and 3 millims. to 5 millims deep.         Cavities of
various dimensions and forms, spherical, conical, and trumpet-shaped,
were tried, but the ones described were those which gave the best
effects.
   Experiment     2. — An ebonite    disk well blackened on one side when
exposed to the intermittent rays was found to produce sounds, which
Professor Hughes estimated to be about 20 as compared with his
sonometer scale.*
   • Professor   Hughes' Sonometer (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol., 29, p. 56) proves an
excellent apparatus to estimate the relative intensity of low sounds, for by shifting
the induction coil from one side to the other, we can pass from an absolute zero, or
pure silence, to a limit of sound of considerable intensity.  The scale divides this
space passed over into 100 equal parts, any number of which give a fairly approxi
mate value of the sounds compared. The ear has to determine the equality of the

    3.
       * A similar ebonite disk equally well whitened, gave slightly less
 intense sounds estimated at 18.
    4. A zinc disk blackened gave sounds =8.
    5. A similar disk polished gave only sounds =2.
    6. A mica disk blackened gave scarcely any sounds at all.
    7. A clean mica disk gave sounds =5.
    These effects were produced many times, and on different occasions,
and they were so unsatisfactory as to throw doubts on the accuracy of
 the radiometer explanation. They were not so decided as theory led
one to anticipate.         The effects produced by the zinc disk, though
very weak, favoured the theory ; those given by the mica disk com
 pletely refuted it ; while those given by the ebonite disks were almost
of a neutral character.
    It was, however, thought that if D be the disk (fig. 4), and C the
                                   I)
source of light, then if the excursions of the disks to and fro were due to
expansion from the absorption of heat, it would first bulge towards A,
since the side towards the source           of light would expand first.      If, on
the other hand, it were due to the radiometer effect, it would first
bulge towards B.
    8. An extremely delicate electrical contact arrangement               was con
structed to determine this by means of a telephone, which recorded
the excursions to and fro of the disk ; but the result was sometimes in
one direction, and sometimes in the other.                Moreover, the effect was
slow, and we failed to obtain more than five distinct vibrations per
second.
   This result raised the question whether in Bell and Tainter's ex
periments     the disks vibrated at    all.
intensity of the two sounds, i.e., of the sonometer and the source investigated, and
the value of the latter is given in terms of the scale of the former.
   * The consecutive figures indicate the number of the experiments.

512              Mr. W. H. Preece.     On  the  Conversion  of   [Mar. 10,
    9.  A  delicate  microphone was fixed    in various ways on the case,
fig. 3.     Although the sounds emitted      in the hearing tube were as
intense as indicated in Experiment 1, scarcely any perceptible effect
was detected on the microphone.        Had the disk sensibly vibrated, its
vibrations must have been taken up by the case.        A microphone never
fails to take up and magnify the minutest mechanical disturbances.
    It was thus evident that the disk did not play a prime part in this
phenomenon, but it appeared as Professor Hughes suggested, that the
result might be due wholly to an expansion and contraction of the
air contained in the air space c, fig. 3.
    An entirely new set of cases and disks were now constructed, but of
the same dimensions.
    10.  With a new clean    case and an ebonite  disk, the sonorous  effects
were feeble, viz., 15 on the sonometer scale.
    11.  If, however, a lens ((i) were placed close in front of the  ebonite
disk a, (fig. 5), the sonorous effects were magnified considerably, rising
at once to about 40.
     12.  A  case was constructed similar to that shown in fig. 5, but with
 a tube at the side, as well as one at the back, communicating with
 the air cavity in front of the disk, as well as that behind, and whether
 one listened at one place or the other, the effect was equally good,
 indicating that the results were most probably due to the expansions
 of the contained air.
     13. When the one tube was stopped and opened by a cork while the
 other tube was used for listening, the quality of the sounds varied
 more than the intensity, but there was distinct evidence of variation.
     14. The ebonite disk of this case was now fitted with an extremely
 delicate microphone, which in this case gave good indications upon
  the telephone, but whether the vibrations were the results of the

1881.]        Radiant Energy into Sonorous Vibrations.                  513
vibrations of the disk itself, or of the air in which the microphone was
placed, was doubtful.
   15. If the lens d, fig. 5, were removed, and the disk left supported
without any air cavity, either behind or in front of       it, no perceptible
sound could be obtained, proving that the effects were really due to the
vibrations of the confined air, and not to those      of  the disk.   It was
therefore determined to dispense with      the  disk altogether.
   16. Case (No.   1) similar to fig.5  was taken, and the disk removed,
but the lens remaining, the sonorous effects were nil.
   17. Another case (No. .2), also similar to fig.    5,  was taken under
similar circumstances, i.e., without the dish, but the effects were
very loud — 60 in fact, the best results which had yet been obtained.
               ;
Now, the only difference between the ono case or cup and the other,
was that the one was blacked in the interior, and the other was not.
   18. Hence Case No.   1  was again taken without the disk, and though
when clean  it gave no   effect, when its interior was blacked by camphor
smoke, it gave sounds as strong as those in Experiment 17, viz., 60.
It was thus evident that the sonorous effects were materially assisted
by coating the sides of the containing vessel with a highly absorbent
substance, such as the carbon deposited by burning camphor.             It re
mained to be seen how far the lens played a part in this phenomenon.
   19. The lens was now removed from the front of the case, and           it
was replaced by a moveable glass plate (l'S millims. thick) (e) fig.      6;
the sounds were the same, but they gradually ceased on gradually un
covering the front opening of the case, so as to give the air room to
expand.

     21. The plate     e  was replaced   by white note paper.     The sounds
  •were  very faint but perceptible.
     22. It was replaced by thin cardboard,      and the effect was nil.
     23. All these effects were produced equally well, whether the cases
  were placed at C, fig. 2, 400 centims. from the source of light, or
  16 centims. from the rotating disk R, but in the latter case their
  intensity was of course always increased.
     Hence it is abundantly evident that these sonorous vibrations are
 due to the motions of the contained air, and not to those of the disk ;
 that they are actually improved by the removal of the disk, that their
 production is materially assisted by lining the surface of the containing
 space with an absorbent substance, that they are dependent on the
 heat rays that pass through, and that they disappear when the rays
 are cut off from the air cavity by an athermanous diaphragm.
     24. Dr. Tyndall having shown in the paper already referred to,
 that water vapour responded actively to these intermittent actions, a
 clean empty one-ounce glass flask was taken and exposed to the inter
 mittent beams. No sound was produced.
     25. It was then filled with water vapour by pouring a small quantity
 of water into it, and warming it in a flame, fair sounds of an intensity
 25 were the result.
     26. The flask was filled with the dense smoke from burning
 camphor, and the sounds were intensified considerably.
     27. The case (fig. 6) was taken and a glass plate 1"5 millims. thick
 fixed in front of it as before.
           a. When the glass was dry, sounds were 20.
           b. When the glass was wetted on the inside, sounds were 25.
    28. Another clear one-ounce glass flask was taken.
          a. When clear, sounds     = 0.
          b.  When filled with tobacco smoke, sounds = 5.
          c. When filled with heavy camphor smoke, sounds = 30.
    29. One side of the flask was blackened on the outside, the other
side remaining clear.
          a. On exposing the clear side to the    light fair sounds 25 were
       obtained.
          b.  On exposing the blackened side, no sounds    were produced.
    30. The flask was blackened in the. interior on one side only.
          a. When the blackened side was near the source, sounds        = 25.
          b. When it was away from the source, sounds = 30.
          c.  When the flask was cleaned, all sounds disappeared.
    31.  A   thin glass plate was now blackened on one side and placed in
front of the case, fig. 6.
          a. When the black surface        was outside,  no sounds were ob
       tained.

             b.   When the black surface was inside, good sounds, 30, were
         the result.
             e. When the glass was cleaned, the sonnds became = 50.
     32.   An ebonite plate was similarly treated.
             a. When the blackened surface was outside, sonnds = 15 were
         obtained.
             6.   When the blackened surface was inside, the sounds were =3.
     This being an anomalous result, several experiments were now
 made to test the behaviour of opaque and transparent bodies, when
 used as disks, for while in the previous experiments the effect was
 greatest when the blackened surface faced the interior, here we find
 the opposite result produced, viz., the greatest effect was produced
when the blackened surface was on the exterior.
    33. Another ebonite disk 0'6 millim. thick was made dull on both
sides by rubbing it with emery paper.                It was fixed in case (No. 2),
 fig. 5,   without       the  lens.
            a. It gave sounds = 15.
            b.    It  was now blacked on one side, and when that side was
        turned to the source, it gave sounds = 30.
            c.   The unblackened      side was turned to the source, and    it gave
        sounds       = 15.

    35.    A    glass plate (3 millims.     thick) was blackened on one side.
           a. Black outside, sounds         = 2.

    It  thus appears that transparent bodies behave in an opposite                 Tay
to opaque bodies.         Glass and mica can be rendered athermanous and
silent by making the carbon deposit sufficiently thick. Zinc, copper,
and ebonite can produce sonorous effects by a proper disposition                     of
carbon. The effect in these latter cases may be due either to molecular
pressure, in fact, to a radiometer effect, though very feeble in intensity ;
or it may be the result of conduction through the mass of the dia
phragm, that is, radiant heat is reduced to thermometric heat by
absorption by the carbon deposit on the outside of the disk, this heat
is transmitted through the disk and radiated to the absorbent gases                  in
the interior.
    41. To test these questions, a delicate microphone was fixed on
a zinc disk (0-7 millim. thick) without any air-cavity in front of or
behind it.
           a.  The disk was blackened      ;  no measurable       trace of sound   was
       perceptible.
          b.   The disk was cleaned, with precisely the same result.
    42. The zinc disk was now replaced on the case, fig. 5, with the               air-
cavity, and sounds =10 were emitted as before.
          a.   The zinc was neatly covered with white paper — a highly
       athermanous substance ; the sounds were nil.
           b. The paper was blackened ; the sounds were still nil.
           c. The zinc was covered with clear mica ; faint but unmeasur-
       able sounds were heard.
          d. The mica was blackened             ;   no     perceptible    sounds  were
       obtained.
           e.  The zinc disk was      blackened        slightly  in the usual way;
       sounds    = 10 were obtained.
          /.   The zinc was thickly blackened        ;  all sounds disappeared.
    43. Ebonite disks      of different thicknesses were used, and layers of
carbon      of different thicknesses  were deposited on the thinnest of them.
 The sounds became fainter and fainter as the thickness of the layer of
carbon and the thickness of the ebonite increased, until they dis
 appeared altogether.
    These experiments       fully establish the inference that the effect is one
 of conduction, and that the blackened surface of an opaque body like
 zinc acts as though the source of heat were transferred to the outside
 surface of the disk.
    44. Tubes of various sizes and dimensions were now tried, to con
 firm Messrs. Bell and Tainter's observations on tubes. They invariably
 gave out satisfactory sounds when the intermittent rays were directed

1881.]             Radiant Energy into Sonorous Vibrations.                   517
into     the interior of the tubes,      which were always considerably in
tensified by blackening their interiors, and closing the open end with
a glass plate.
     45. Since the sounds varied considerably in intensity, according to
the number of intermittences per second transmitted, white and ruby
glass plates were used, and it was found that the maximum effect
 (60) was produced when the note corresponding to the intermittences
 was —
                With white glass                <Z'=297 vibr. per sec.
                With ruby     „                 6 =247    „
     This showed that the element of time was a function of the amount,
-of radiant energy transmitted through the plate.
     46. The two cases, which possessed air-cavities of different dimen
 sions, were tried with white glass        :
                       Case  1  gave 6=247 vibr. per sec.
                       Case 2      „ e*'=297       „
     Hence it is evident that there is a time element, and that the loud
 ness    of the note emitted depends upon the rapidity with which the
 contained air not only absorbs the degraded energy, but upon the
 rapidity with which it gives up its heat to the sides of the case and
 the exits open to it. Though the pitch of the maximum note varied
 with the cavity and the amount of radiant heat transmitted, its quality
 never varied, notwithstanding the great diversity of materials used as
 diaphragms.
     47. Since these sonorous effects are due to the expansions                 of
  absorbent gases    under  the  influence   of heat, and since wires  are heated
  by the transference of electric currents through them, it seemed pos
  sible that if we inclosed a spiral of fine platinum wire P (tig. 7) in a
  dark cavity, abed, well blacked on the inside, and sent through it,
  by means of the wheel-break W, rapid intermittent currents of elec
  tricity from the battery B, heat would be radiated, the air would
  expand, and sounds would result. This was done, and the sounds
  produced were excellent.        In fact, with four bichromate cells, sounds
  more intense than any previously observed were obtained.
     Furthermore it was evident that if the wheel-break (W) were re
 placed by a good microphone transmitter, articulate speech should be
  heard in the case abed.      This was done, and an excellent telephone
  receiver was the consequence, by means of which speech was per
  fectly reproduced.
     The explanation of these remarkable phenomena is now abundantly
 clear.
     It is purely an effect of radiant heat, and it is essentially one due to
  the changes of volume in vapours and gases produced by the degrada
  tion and absorption of this heat      in a confined space. The disks in Bell

and Tainter's experiments must be diathermanons, and the better their
character in this respect the greater the effect ; remove them, and tbe
effect  is greater still. Messrs. Bell and Tainter* showed that the
sounds maintained their timbre and pitch notwithstanding variation
in the snbstance of the disk, and M. Mercadier found that a split or
cracked plate acted as well as when it was whole.             These facts are
consistent with the expansion of the contained air, but not with any
mechanical disturbance of the disks. Moreover, M. Mercadier showed
that the effect was improved by lampblack, but he applied it in the
wrong place.
   The disks may, and perhaps do under certain conditions, vibrate,
but this vibration is feeble and quite a secondary action. The sides of
the containing vessel must possess the power to reduce the incident
rays to thermometric heat, and impart it to the vapour they confine,
and the more their power in this respect, as when blackened by
carbon, the greater the effect.         The back of the disk may alone act
in this respect. Cigars, chips of wood, smoke, or any absorbent sur
faces placed inside a closed transparent vessel will, by first absorb
ing and then radiating heat rays to the confined gas, emit sonorous
vibrations.
   The heat is dissipated in the energy of sonorous vibrations.           In all
cases, time  enters as an element, and the maximum effect depends on

the diathermancy of the exposed side of the cavity, on its dimensions
and surfaces, and on the absorbent character of the contained gas.
    The remarkable property which deposited carbon possesses of
reducing radiant energy to thermometric heat is strikingly shown by
these experiments, and it suggests an important field for inquiry for
those who are working in the region of radiant heat.
    It is only necessary to add that, in carrying out these experiments,
I have had the benefit of the presence and advice of Professor Hughes,
and the inestimable advantage of the great mechanical skill, philoso
phical character, and experimental ability of Mr. Stroh, without whom,
in fact, the inquiry could not have been accomplished.
             Additional Note.     Received March 14, 1881.
    Professor Stokes has suggested that the action is due not to the ex
pansion of the contained vapour through its absorption of thermome
tric heat generated on the lamp-black surface, but to the contact of the
air molecules with this surface.     It is clear that when the carbon is
warmed, the rapidly moving air molecules which strike it and bound
off have their retreating motion increased in velocity. This increased
velocity means increased pressure, which in its turn produces increased
volume, and this when intermittent, produces sonorous vibrations. This
explanation is quite in accordance with the observed facts, for the
difference of the intensity of the sounds emitted by dry air and air
charged with absorbent vapours is very much less, when a lamp-black
surface is used, than was anticipated. Dry air gives excellent results
with lamp-black, but is silent without it. Indeed it leads one to
 conceive that as charging the air with heavy smoke produces the
 same effect as coating the containing surface with lamp-black, each
 particle of smoke becomes a warmed surface from which the colliding
 air molecules, whose dimensions are infinitely smaller, retreat with
 increased   velocity.  Moreover, if we conceive the smoke particles
 replaced by the compound molecules of absorbent vapours such as sul
 phuric ether, olefiant gas, or ammonia, and if we assume the dimen
 sions of these molecules greater than those of the air, we have an
 explanation not only of the absorbent power of these gases, but of the
 reasons for their behaviour in converting radiant energy into sonorous
 vibrations. It is clear that if the compound molecule act as a smoke
 particle, the radiant energy becomes degraded into thermometric heat,
 tor the motion of the ether is transferred to the motion of the mole
 cule.    The minute air molecules move unaffected in the undulating
 ether, but the larger compound molecules of the absorbent gas take up
  the waves of the ether, and assume that form of motion which is
  known as thermometric heat.       Hence, the greater the number of
  molecules and the larger their dimensions, the greater the absorption

 of heat and the more the production of sonorous vibrations, for a
 greater number of air atoms will collide with warmed surfaces in a
 given time.     That this assumption is justified is proved by the fact
 that this absorption of radiant energy renders the particles of disso
 ciated nitrite of amyl and other vapours visible as well as warm, and
 therefore they can assume dimensions that are comparable with the
 particles of smoke.
 II. " On     the   Limit of the Liquid State."           By J. B. HANNAY,
       F.R.S.E.       Communicated by Professor              G. G. STOKES.
       Sec. R.S.     Received February 22, 1881.
                                    (Abstract.)
   In this paper the author gives an      extended account of the work under
 taken to determine whether the liquid state extends above the critical
 temperature, or whether it is bounded by an isothermal line passing
through the critical point, as had been indicated in a former paper.
A large apparatus      was constructed, with several improvements before
described,   details of construction being given in the full paper.          It
was found that manometers            with small bores gave higher readings
than those with larger internal diameter, so the manometers used were
of the largest size compatible with the strength required to resist the
pressure.     The thermometers were carefully prepared by heating and
cooling, and compared with the standard at Kew.             All the usual pre
cautions   were   taken  to   obtain  accurate   numbers.   The critical tem
perature and pressure of the liquids were first determined accurately,
and then a quantity of a gas insoluble in the liquid was compressed
over the liquid, and the critical temperature again determined under
increased pressure.        When the densities of the two bodies, e.g.,
alcohol and hydrogen, are far apart from each other, the gas shows
no effect in lowering the critical temperature, as is the case with
carbon dioxide and air, whose densities approach much nearer, but
simply acts as a spring against which the upper surface of the alcohol
bears, thus having a surface free for observation at pressures far
above that of the vapour of the liquid.           When the liquid passes the
critical temperature at any pressure the meniscus is lost, and the fluid
freely diffuses into the superincumbent gas, but this does not occur at
temperatures below the critical, except where very high pressure has
made the gas appreciably soluble in the liquid.            Thus the curve of
vapour    tension,  that  is,  the  curve   representing the  temperatures at
which a given pressure will produce liquefaction suddenly becomes
isothermal at the critical point, and passes along the co-ordinate
denoting the critical temperature.
   As surface tension is the only property by which the liquid state

 1881.]               On the Limit of the Liquid   State.             521
can be known, the capillary height of the liquid at various tempera
tures was next determined.       The capillary height becomes zero at the
critical temperature, and this is the case whether the pressure is the
critical pressure or a higher one. Curves indicating the loss of
capillarity with rise of temperature are given, and the observations
repeated at higher pressures, the pressures being obtained by com
pressing hydrogen over the liquid. The surface tension is lowered a
little by the action of the compressed hydrogen, but the change of
                                    Fig. 1.
  capillarity follows that of the liquid alone very closely, and the
  capillarity sinks to zero a few degrees below the critical temperature.
  Nitrogen may be substituted for hydrogen with the same results,
 and various other liquids being used — carbon bisulphide, carbon
  tetrachloride, and methyl alcohol.      Curves are given, showing their
  behaviour under high pressures, as in the case of alcohol.       In no
  case could any of the properties of the liquid state be found to exist
  above the critical temperature.        The paper concludes : " Three

curves have been drawn to show the slight depression of the critical
temperature with increase of pressure, and these lines have been con
tinued down the curve of vapour pressure to show the break at the
critical point." This will be clearly seen in the annexed fig. 1.
   The consideration of these results yields a novel mode of looking at
the states of matter which I have shown at fig. 2. From this, it
appears we might classify matter under four states :          First, the
gaseous, which exists from the highest temperatures down to an
isothermal passing through the critical point, and depending entirely
upon temperature or molecular velocity. Second, the vaporous, bounded
upon the upper side by the gaseous state, and on the lower by absolute
zero, and depending entirely upon the length of the mean free path,
because shortening of the mean free path alters the state.    Third, the
liquid state, bounded upon the upper side by the gaseous, and on
the lower by the solid or absolute zero.   Fourth, the solid state.

   The paper contains the results of an investigation into the nature
of the material used in Japan for converting starch into sugar in the
brewing operations.     This substance " koji " is prepared from steamed
rice by allowing the spores of a fungus, mixed with the grain, to
vegetate over the surface.    Details of the manufacture are given, and
it is shown that the rice suffers a loss of 11 per cent., calculated
upon the substance dried at 100° C. At the same time a great evolu
tion of heat occurs.
   A solution of the soluble portion of the " kdji " thus prepared is
shown to possess properties analogous to those of malt-extract, although
differing from it in some important respects. It rapidly inverts cane-
sugar and hydrates maltose and dextrin. It liquefies starch-paste,
forming at first maltose and dextrin, but giving as ultimate products
dextrose and dextrin.      Curves accompany the paper showing the
action of the extract of " k&ji

   The paper concludes with an examination of the change which the
rice grain undergoes by the growth of the mycelium of the fungus,
and it is pointed out that the principal effect produced by the growing
plant is to render the insoluble albuminoids previously existing in the
rice soluble.

I. " On the Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid Films, with
      a Revision of Newton's Table of Colours."              By A. W.
      Reinold, M.A., Professor of Physics in the Royal Naval
      College, Greenwich, and A. W. Rucker, M.A., Professor of
      Physics in the Yorkshire College, Leeds. Communicated
      by Professor W. Grylls Adams, F.R.S. Received March 3.
      1881.
                               (Abstract.)
   The authors have made numerous measurements of the electrical
resistance of cylindrical liquid films.    Their object was to determine
whether a thinning     film gave evidence by change in its specific re
sistance of an approach to a thickness equal to twice the radius of
molecular attraction, and also to devise a method of finding the amount
of water which might be absorbed by or evaporated from it. This
change of constitution had been neglected by previous observers of
the properties of films.
   The thickness of the films was determined from their colour.     Thif
necessitated a revision of Newton's table of colours, which was carried
out partly by observations on Newton's rings, partly by more than
2,000 observations on the films themselves.       Two simultaneous but
independent measures of the thickness of the film were made by
observing two portions illuminated by light incident at different
angles.   In 84 per cent, of the measures made during the final series-
of experiments described in the paper, the difference between the two
values of the thickness thus obtained did not exceed 2 per cent, of its
value.
   The films were enclosed in a glass case in which they could be
formed without admitting any external air. Elaborate precautions
were taken to maintain the aqueous vapour within the case at the
tension proper to that in contact with the soap solution.
   The resistance of the films was measured by piercing them with

1881.]            Molecular Electro-Magnetic         Induction.            525
gold wires which were in connexion with the opposite pairs of quad
rants of a Thomson's electrometer.        The resistance of the film between
the needles was calculated by comparing the deflection caused by the
difference of potential of the two wires when a current was passing
through the film, with that produced by the difference of potential
above and below a known resistance placed in the same circuit.
    A novel method, the same in principle with the above, was also used
to determine the specific resistance of the liquids from which the films
were formed.      This was deduced from the difference of potential of
two platinum wires cemented into a glass tube in which the liquid was
contained. As these were at some distance from the electrodes, errors
due to polarisation were got rid of. The results of some test experi
 ments made on solutions of sulphuric acid agreed with those of
 Kohlrausch to within 0'7 per cent.
    The authors conclude that their experiments show that the specific
 resistance of a soap film thicker than 3- 74 x 10-6 centims. (the least
 thickness at which trustworthy observations were made) is inde
 pendent of the thickness, and is equal to that of the liquid from which
 it is formed.
     They have, therefore, detected no indication of an approach to a
 thickness equal to the diameter of molecular attraction, and this leads
 to the deduction that its magnitude must either be less than is supposed
 by Quincke (0-5 x 10-5 centims.), or that the mean specific resistance of
 the surface layer, the thickness of which is equal to that magnitude,
 does not differ by 17 per cent, from that of the liquid in mass.
     They have further found that soap films, even in an enclosed space,
 may, if the precautions above referred to are not taken, readily lose 23
 out of the 5 7' 7 volumes of water contained in every 100 volumes of
 solution, and their experiments show that this quantity may probably
 be largely exceeded. They think, therefore, that in all accurate observa
 tions on soap films these profound modifications of constitution must
 either be prevented or measured by a method similar to their own.
 They criticise from this point of view the observations of Plateau*
 and Liidtge,t and conclude by pointing out the extreme sensitiveness
 of the electrical method of investigation.

sitive it was to the slightest molecular change in the composition of
any metal or alloy, and it gave strong evidence of a peculiarity in iron
and steel which its magnetic properties alone failed to account for.
We could with all non-magnetic metals easily obtain a perfect balance
of force by an equivalent piece of the same metal, but in the case of
iron, steel, and nickel it was with extreme difficulty that I could
obtain a near approach to a perfect zero. Two pieces of iron cut off
the same bar or wire, possessing the same magnetic moment, never
gave identical results ; the difficulty was, that notwithstanding each
bar or wire could be easily made to produce the same inductive
reaction, the time during which this reaction took place varied in
each bar   ; and although  I could easily change its balancing power a?
regards inductive force by a change in the mass of the metal, by heat
or magnetism, the zero obtained was never equal to that obtained from
copper or silver.
   This led me to suppose the existence of a peculiarity in magnetic
metals which could not be accounted for except upon the hypothesis
that there was a cause, then unknown, to produce the invariable effect.
   Finding that it would be impossible to arrive at the true cause
without some new method of investigation, which should allow me to
observe the effects from an electrical circuit, whose active portion should
be the iron wire itself, I constructed an apparatus or electro- magnetic
induction balance, consisting of a single coil reacting upon an iron
wire in its axis, and perpendicular to the coil itself ; by this means the
iron or other wire itself became a primary or secondary, according as
the current passed through the coil or wire.         Now, with this appa
ratus we could induce secondary currents upon the wire or coil, if the
coil was at any angle, except when the wire was absolutely perpen
dicular; in this state we could only obtain a current from some dis
turbing cause, and the current so obtained was no longer secondary
but tertiary.
   The whole apparatus, however, is more complicated than the
general idea given above, as it was requisite not only to produce effects
but to be able to appreciate the direction of the electrical current ob
tained, and have comparative measures of their value. In order to fully
understand the mode of experiments, as well as the results obtained,
I will first describe the apparatus employed.
   The electro-magnetic induction balance consists of — 1st, an instru
ment for producing the new induction current; 2nd, sonometer or
balancing coils ; 3rd, rheotome and battery ; 4th, telephone.
   The essential portion of this new balance is that wherein a coil is
so arranged that a wire of iron or copper can pass freely through,
forming its axis.     The iron or copper wire rests upon two supports
20 centims. apart ; at one of these the wire is firmly clamped by two
binding screws ; the opposite end of the wire turns freely on its sup

port, the wire being      22  centims.  long, having 2 centims. projection
beyond its support, in order to fasten upon it a key or arm -which
shall serve as a pointer upon a circle giving the degrees of torsion
which the wire receives from turning this pointer. A binding screw
allows us to fasten the pointer at any degree, and thus preserve the
required stress the time required.
    The exterior diameter of the coil is 5^ centims., having an interior
vacant circular space of 3^ centims., its width is 2 centims. ; upon
this is wound 200 metres of No. 32 silk-covered copper wire. This
coil is fastened to a small board so arranged that it can be turned
through any desired angle in relation to the iron wire which passes
through its centre, and it can also be moved to any portion of the
20 centims. of wire, in order that different portions of the same wire
may be tested for a similar stress.
    The whole of this instrument, as far as possible, should bo con
structed of wood, in order to avoid, as far as possible, all disturbing
inductive influences of the coil upon them.
    The iron wire at its fixed end is joined or makes contact with a
copper wire, which returns to the front part of the dial under its board
 and parallel to its coil, thus forming a loop, the free end of the iron
¦wire is joined to one pole of the battery, the copper wire under the
 board is joined to the rheotome and thence to the battery.
    The coil is joined to the telephone ; but, as in every instance we can
 either pass the battery current through the wire, listening to its induc
 tive effects upon the wire, or the reverse of this ;     I  prefer, generally, in
 order to have no voltaic current passing through the wire, to join the
 iron wire and its loop direct to the telephone, passing the voltaic
 current through the coil.
    In order to balance, measure, and know the direction of the new
 induction currents by means of a switching key, the sonometer* I
 described to the Royal Society is brought into the circuit.            The two
 exterior coils of the sonometer are then in the circuit of the battery,
 and of the coil upon the board containing the iron wire or stress
 bridge.    The interior or movable coil of the sonometer is then in the
 circuit of the iron wire and telephone.      Instead of the sonometer con
 structed as described in my paper to the Royal Society, I prefer to
 use one formed upon a principle       I  described in " Comptes Rendus,"
 December 30, 1878. This consists of two coils only, one of which is
 smaller and turns freely in the centre of the outside coil. The exterior
 coil being stationary, the centre coil turns upon an axle by means of a
 long (20 centims.) arm or pointer, the point of which moves over a
  graduated arc or circle.      Whenever the axis of the interior coil is
 perpendicular to the exterior coil, no induction takes place, and we

have a perfect zero   :  by turning the interior coil through any degree
we have a current       proportional to this angle, and in the direction
in which it is turned. As this instrument obeys all the well-known
laws for galvanometers, the readings and evaluations are easy and
rapid.
   If the coil upon the stress bridge is perpendicular to the iron wire,
and if the sonometer coil is at zero, no currents or sounds in the tele
phone will be perceived, but the slightest current in the iron wire
produced by torsion will at once be heard ; and by moving the sono
meter coil in a direction corresponding to the current, a new zero will
be obtained, which will not only balance the force of the new current
but indicate its value.    A perfect zero, however, will not be obtained
with the powerful currents obtained by the torsion of 2 milims.
diameter iron wire, we then require special arrangements of the sono
meter which are too complicated to describe here.
   The rheotome is a clockwork, having a rapid revolving wheel which
gives interruptions of currents in fixed cadences in order to have equal
intervals of sound and silence.       I  employ four bichromate cells or
 eight  Daniell's  elements,  and  they are joined through this rheotome
to the coil on the stress bridge, as I have already described.
   The magnetic properties of iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt, have been
so searchingly investigated by ancient as well as by modern scientific
authors, that there seems little left to be known as regards its molar
magnetism.       I use the word molar here simply to distinguish or
separate the idea of a magnetic bar of iron or steel magnetised longi
tudinally or transversely from the polarised molecules which are
supposed to produce its external magnetic effects.
   Molar magnetism, whilst having the power of inducing an electric
current in an adjacent wire, provided that either has motion, or the
magnet a change in its magnetic force, as shown by Faraday in 1832,
lias no power of inducing an electric current upon itself or its own
molar constituent, either by motion or change of its magnetic moment.
Molecular magnetism (the results of which, I believe, I have been the
first to obtain) has no, or a very feeble, power of inducing either
magnetism or an electric current in an adjacent wire, but it possesses
the remarkable power of strongly reacting upon its own molar wire,
inducing (comparatively with its length) powerful electric currents,
in a circuit of which this forms a part.
   In some cases, as will be shown, we may have both cases existing hi
the same wire ; this occurs when the wire is under the influence of
stress, either external or internal ; it would have been most difficult to
separate these two, as it was in my experiments with the induction
balance, without the aid of my new method.
   Ampere's theory supposes a molecular magnetism or polarity, and
that molar magnetism would be produced when the molecular mag

netism became symmetrical ; and his theory, believe, is fully capable
of explaining the effects        I  have obtained, if we admit that we can
rotate the paths of the polarised molecules by an elastic torsion.
   Matteucci made use of an inducing and secondary coil in the year
1847,* by means of which he observed that mechanical strains in
creased or depressed the magnetism of a bar inside this coil.
   Wertheim published in the " Comptes Rendus," 1852,f some results
similar to Matteucci ; but in the " Annales de Chimie et de Physique,"
       J
185 7, he published a long series of most remarkable experiments, in
which he clearly proves the influence of torsion upon the increment or
decrement of a magnetical wire.
   Vilari showed§ increase or diminution of magnetism by longitudinal
pull according as the magnetising force is less or greater than a certain
critical value.
                                                   "
    Wiedemann,|| in his remarkable work Galvanismus," says that an
iron wire through which an electric current is flowing becomes mag
netised by twisting the wire.           This effect  I have repeated, but found
the effects very weak, no doubt due to the weak battery I use, viz.,
four quart bichromate cells.
    Sir W. Thomson shows clearly in his remarkable paper " Effects of
 Stress on the Magnetisation of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt,"^f the critical
 value of the magnetisation of these metals under varying stress, and
also explains the longitudinal magnetism produced by Wiedemann as
due to the outside molar twist of the wire, making the current pass as
 in a spiral round a fixed centre. Sir William Thomson also shows
clearly the effects of longitudinal as well as transversal strain, both as
regards its molar magnetism and its electric conductivity.
    My own researches convince me that we have in molecular mag
netism a distinct and separate form of magnetism from that when we
develop, or render evident, longitudinal or transversal magnetism,
which    I have before defined as molar.
   Molecular magnetism is developed by any slight strain or twist
other than longitudinal, and it is only developed by an elastic twist ;
for, however much we may twist a wire, provided that its fibres are
 not separated, we shall only have the result due to the reaction of its
 remaining elasticity.
    If we place an iron wire, say 20 centims. long, 1 millim. diameter, in
 the axis of the coil of the electro-magnetic balance, and if this wire is
joined, as described, to the telephone, wo find that on passing a electric

under a greater elastic stress than the wire itself, they are no longer
perpendicular to the centre of the wire, and consequently they react
upon this wire as separate magnets would upon an adjacent wire.                   It
might here be readily supposed that a wire having several twists, or              a

   At this point the fibres of a soft wire commence to' separate, and we
have no longer a complete single wire, but a helix of separate wires
npon a central structure.
   If  now, instead of passing the current through the coil, I pass it
through the wire, and place the telephone upon the coil circuit,      I  find
that I obtain equally as strong tertiary currents upon the coil as in the
previous case, although in the first case there was produced longitudinal
electro-magnetism in the perpendicular wire by the action of the coil,
but in the latter case none or the most feeble electro-magnetism was
produced, yet in these two distinct cases we have a powerful current
produced not only upon its own wire, but upon the coil, thus proving
that the effects are equally produced both on the wire and coil.
   If we desire, however, in these reversible effects to produce in both
cases the same electromotive force, we must remember that the tertiary
current when reacting upon its own short wire produces a current of
great quantity, the coil one of comparative higher intensity. We can,
however, easily convert the great quantity of the wire into one of
higher tension by passing it through the primary of a small induction
coil whose resistance is not greater than one ohm. We can then join
our telephone, which may be then one of a high resistance, to the
secondary of this induction coil, and by this means, and without
changing the resistance of the telephone, receive the same amount of
force, either from the iron wire or the coil.
   Finding that iron, steel, and all magnetic metals produce a current
by a slight twist, if now we replace this wire by one of copper or non
magnetic metals we have no current whatever by an elastic twist, and
no effects, except when the wire itself is twisted spirally in helix, and
whatever current we may obtain from copper, &c, no matter if from
its being in spiral or from not being perpendicular to the axis of the
coils, the currents obtained will be invariably secondary and not
tertiary.   If we replace the copper by an iron wire, and give it a
certain fixed torsion, not passing its limit of elasticity, we find that no
increase or decrease takes place by long action or time of being under
strain. Thus a wire which gave a sonometric force of 50° at the first
observation, remained perfectly constant for several days until it was
ngain brought to zero by taking off the strain it had received.        Thus
we may consider that as long as the wire preserves its elasticity, exactly
in the same ratio will it preserve the molecular character of its
magnetism.

    It is not necessary to use a wire to produce these effects ; still more
powerful currents are generated in bars, ribbons, or sheets of iron;
thus,    no matter what external         form the iron      may possess, it stil
produces all the effects      I have described.
    It requires a great many permanent twists in a              wire to be able to
see any effect from these twists, but if we give to a wire, 1 millim,
diameter, forty whole turns (or until its fibres become separated) we
find some new effects ; we find a small current of 10° in the same
direction as its molar twist, and on giving a slight twist (203)
the sonometric value of the sound obtained is 80°, instead of 50°, the
real value of a similar untwisted wire ; but the explanation will be
found by twisting the wire in a contrary direction to its molar twist.
We can now approach the zero but never produce a current in the
contrary direction, owing to the fact that by the spiral direction, doe
to the fibrous molar turns, the neutral position of its molecules is no
longer parallel with its wire, but parallel with its molar twist, con
sequently an elastic strain in the latter case can only bring the mole
 cules parallel with its wire, producing no current, and in the first
case the angle at which the reaction takes place is greater than before,
 consequently the increased value of its current.
     The measurements of electric force mentioned in this paper are all
 sonometric on an arbitrary scale.          Their absolute value has not yet
 been obtained, as we do not, at our present stage, require any except
comparative measures.*           Thus, if each wire is of 1 millim. diameter
 and 20 centims. long, all render the same stress in the axis of its coil.
 I  find that the following are the sonometric degrees of value : —

     The tertiary current increases with the diameter of the wire, in a
 proportion which has not yet been determined ; thus, an ordinary hard
  iron wire of 1 millim. diameter giving 50°, one of 2 millims. diameter
  gave 100° ; and the maximum of force obtained by any degree of
  torsion is at or near the limit of elasticity, since as soon as we pass
  this point, producing a permanent twist, the current decreases, as
  I  have already shown in the case of a permanent twist.                    Tims, the
     * 50° sonometer has the same electromotive force as O'lO of a Daiiiell

critical point of 1 millim. hard iron wire was 20° of torsion, but in
hard steel it was 45°.
   Longitudinal strains do not produce any current whatever, but a
very slight twist to a wire, under a longitudinal strain, produces its
maximum effects : thus, 20° of torsion being the critical point of iron
wire, the same wire, under longitudinal strain, required but from 10°
to 15°.    It is very difficult, however, to produce a perfect longitudinal
strain alone.      I  have, therefore, only been able to try the effect of
longitudinal strain on fine wires, not larger than 1 millim. in diameter,
but as in all cases, no effect whatever was produced by longitudinal
strain alone,   I  believe none will be found if the wire be absolutely free
from torsion. The molecules in a longitudiDal strain are equally under
an elastic strain as in torsion, but the path of their motion is now
parallel with its wire, or the zero of electric inductive effect, but the
longitudinal and transverse strains of which the compound strain
is composed, react upon each other, producing the increased effect due
to the compound strain.
    The sonometer is not only useful for showing the direction of the
current and measuring it by the zero method, but it also shows at
once if the current measured is secondary or tertiary.           If the current
is secondary    its  period of  action coincides with that   of the  sonometer,
and a perfect balance, or zero of sound, is at once obtained, and its
 value in sonometric degrees given, but if the current is tertiary, no
zero is possible, and if the value of the tertiary is 60°, we find 60°
the nearest approach to zero possible.           But by the aid of separate
induction coils to convert the secondary into a tertiary, a perfect zero
can be obtained if the time of action and its force correspond to that
 which we wish to measure.
       I
    If place a copper wire in the balance and turn the coils at an
angle of 45°,    I  obtain a current for which the sonometer gives a perfect
 zero at 50°, proving, as already said, that it is secondary.             I
                                                                       If now
replace   the   copper by   an  iron wire, the  coil  remaining   at 45°, I have
again exactly the same value for the iron as copper, viz., 50°, and in
 both cases secondary.       Now, it is evident that in the case of the iron
 wire there was produced at each passage of the current a strong
 electro-magnet, but this longitudinal magnetism did not either change
 the character of the current or its value in force.
    A most beautiful demonstration of the fact that longitudinal mag
netism produces no current, but that molecular magnetism can act
equally as well, no matter the direction of the longitudinal magnetism,
consists in forming an iron wire in a loop, or taking two parallel but
separate wires, joined electrically at their fixed ends, the free ends
being each connected with the circuit, so that the current generated
must pass up one wire and down the adjacent one. On testing this
 loop, and if there are no internal strains, complete silence or absence

534                          Prof D. E. HugheB.                     [Mar. 17,
of current will be found.       Now, giving a slight torsion to one of these
wires in a given direction, we find, say, 50° positive ; twisting the
parallel wire in a similar direction produces a perfect zero, thus, the
current of the second must have balanced the positive of the first.
If, instead of twisting it in similar directions, we twist it in the con
trary direction, the sounds are increased in value from 50° positive to
100° positive, showing, in this latter case, not only a twofold increase
of force, but that the currents in the iron wires travelled up one wire
and down the other, notwithstanding that both were strongly
magnetic by the influence of the coil in one direction, and this
experiment also proves that its molar magnetism had no effect, as the
currents are equally strong in both directions, and both wires can
double or efface the currents produced in each.           If, instead of two
wires we take four, we can produce a zero, or a current of 200°, and
with twenty wires we have a force of 1,000°, or an electromotive
force of two volts. We have here a means of multiplying the effects
by giving an elastic torsion to each separate wire, and joining them
electrically in tension.       If loops are formed of one iron and one
copper wire, we can obtain both currents from the iron wire, positive
and negative, but none from the copper, its rSle is simply that of a
conductor upon which torsion has no effect.
   I have already mentioned that internal strains will give out tertiary
currents, without any external elastic strain being put on. In the
case of iron wire, these disappear by a few twists in both directions,
but in flat bars or forged iron, they are more permanent ; evidently,
portions of these bars have an elastic strain, whilst other portions are
free, for   I find a difference at every inch tested : the instrument, how
ever, is so admirably sensitive, and able to point out not only the
strain, but its direction, that    I have no doubt its application to large
forged pieces, such as shafts or cannon, would bring out most interest
ing results, besides its practical utility ; great care is therefore neces
sary in these experiments that we have a wire free from internal
strains, or that we know their value.
   Magnetising the iron wire by a large steel permanent magnet has
 no effect whatever.      A hard steel wire thus placed becomes strongly
 magnetic, but no current is generated, nor has it any influence upon
 the results obtained from molecular movement, as in elastic torsion.
 A flat wide iron or steel bar shows this better than iron wire, as we
 can here produce transversal, instead of longitudinal, but neither shows
 any trace of the currents produced by molecular magnetism.            I hav
 made many experiments with wires and bars thus magnetised, but a
 the effect in every case was negative when freed from experimental
 errors,  I  will not mention them ; but there is one very interesting
 proof   which   the instrument gives, that longitudinal magnetism first
 pusses through its molecular condition before and during the discharge,

Or     recomposition of its magnetism.           For this purpose, using no
             I
battery, join the rheotome and telephone to the coil, the wire having
no exterior circuit.      If I strongly magnetise the two ends of the wire, I
find by rapidly moving the coil, that there is a Faradaic induction of
50° at both poles, but very little or none at the centre of the wire ; now
fixing the coil at the centre or neutral point of the wire, and listening
                                                     I
intently, no sounds are heard, but the instant give a slight elastic tor
sion to the free pole, a rush of electric tertiary induction is heard, whose
value is 40°. Again, testing this wire by moving the coil,          I find only
a remaining magnetism of 10, and upon repeating the experiment of
elastic torsion,    I find a tertiary of 5 ; thus we can go on gradually dis
charging the wire, but it will be found that its discharge is a recom

position, and that it first passed through the stage have mentioned.
     Heat has a very great effect upon molecular magnetic effects. On
 iron it increases the current, but in steel the current is diminished.
 For experimenting on iron wire, which gave a tertiary current of 50°
 positive (with a torsion of 20°), upon the application of the flame of
 a spirit-lamp, the force rapidly increases (care being taken not to ap
 proach red heat), until the force is donbled, or 100 positive. The same
 effects were obtained in either direction, and were not due to a molar
 twist or thermo-current, as if care had been taken to put on not more
  than 10° of torsion, the wire came back to zero at once on removal of
  the torsion.     Hard tempered steel, whose value was 10° whilst cold,
  with a torsion of 45°, became only 1° when heated, but returned (if
  not too much heated) to 8° when cold.            I very much doubted this
 experiment at first, but on repeating the experiment with steel several
  times,   I  found that on heating it,   I   had softened the extreme hard
   (yellow) temper to that of the well-known blue temper.             Now, at
  blue temper, hot, the value of steel was but 1° to 2°, whilst soft iron of
  a similar size gave 50° of force cold, and 100° at red heat. Now, as
   I  have already shown that the effects        I have described depend on
   molecular elasticity, it proves at least, as far as iron and steel are
   concerned, that a comparatively perfect elastic body, such as tempered
   steel, has but slight molecular elasticity, and that heat reduces it, bnt
   that soft iron, having but little molar elasticity, has a molecular
   elasticity of a very high degree, which is increased by heat.
      The objects of the present paper being to bring the experimental facts
   before the notice of the Royal Society, and not to give a theoretical
   solution of the phenomena, I will simply add, that if we assume with
 '
    Poisson, that the paths of the molecules of iron are circles, and that
   they become ellipses by compression or strain, and also that they are
    capable of being polarised, it would sufficiently explain the new effects.
      Joule has shown that an iron bar is longer and narrower during
    magnetisation than before, and in the case of the transverse strain, the
   exterior portions of the wire are under a far greater strain than those

    In  1867    I  made    some experiments      on the action of sodium           upon
cbinoline and lepidine, and found that a substance was produced which
dyed silk a beautiful but fugitive orange colour.                   I announced this
fact in a paper        " On the Higher Homologues of Chinoline."*                I made
analyses of the products at the time, but the difficulties in the way of
preparing them pure were so great, and the time at my disposal was so
limited, that        I  did not make public any quantitative results until
                           I
March, 1878, when published a s'hort note " On the Action of Sodium
on Chinoline and Lepidine. "f In that paper                I  gave the results of an
analysis     of   a  product   from  chinoline, which   agreed with the formula
C18HWN2.HC1, which is obviously that of the hydrochlorate of dichine-.
line.    I  also gave an analysis of the nitrate of dilepidine, which
agrees almost perfectly with the theoretical values ; but                    I  did not
enter   into    the details of the modes of preparation.              In the course of
my investigation of /3-lutidine, it was natural that I should study the
action of sodium upon it, but            I  met with so many and unexpected
difficulties that I determined to prepare myself for a new attack upon
the subject by a fresh investigation of the action of sodium upon
chinoline. As I find that other observers are working upon chinoline,
/J-lutidine, and /3-collidine,J      I have thought it desirable to bring before

proceeding.

    The action of sodium on chinoline is exceedingly remarkable, not
merely because it polymerises the base, for a similar result, as is well
 known, takes place with picoline, but because the products have pro

hydrochlorate, is probably a unique reaction.                 To obtain this product
of     the utmost beauty, it appears to be necessary that the chinoline
should       be perfectly free from any impurity, except, perhaps, its next
bomologue.          The most successful preparations were made from chino
line     obtained from fine crystals of the chromate.*
      Chinoline prepared from the chromate is almost colourless, and
becomes yellow, on keeping, with extreme slowness as compared with
the base prepared without that precaution.                 In the following experi
ments it is to be understood that all the chinoline was obtained from
 the crystallised chromate.
      Chinoline was boiled with sodium, the fluid, which became purplish
 crimson, was treated with water, which at once converted the crimson
 colour into a dirty yellow.            Hydrochloric acid was then added, and
 the solution became of an intense orange colour. The solution was
 boiled, filtered, and allowed to stand two days, the crystals of hydro-
 chlorate of dichinoline were filtered off, and the mother-liquid was
  precipitated fractionally by solution of platinic chloride. The first
  precipitate was of a light orange colour, the second a deep orange,
  the third Naples yellow, the fourth was in the form of a brown crystal
  line powder.        The platinum was determined in each with the follow
  ing results :   —

   The first result agrees with the numbers required for the formula —
                                  2(C18H"N2)HCl.PtCl*,
   which requires 22-18 per cent, of platinum. The second is probably
   a mixture of the substance having the formula of the first precipitate
   with some of that having the formula of the third, which latter agrees
   fairly with a salt having the formula —
                                    C18H«N2.3HCl.PtCl*
    which requires 28-00 per cent, of platinum.              The formula —
                                    Ci8HWN2.2HCl.PtCl*,

    chinoline and leucoline, and who possess the latter in a pure state, would study the
    action of sodium upon it ; as, if it yields the crystalline scarlet hydrochlorate, the

the numbers obtained, but they do not appear to me so readily admis
sible.   For instance, a substance having the formula —
                              2(C18H1*N2)PtCl*,
 would require 23"13 per cent, of platinum, which would agree with
the amount of metal obtained from the second precipitate, but the
formation of such a substance in the presence of free hydrochloric acid
appears most unlikely. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the platinum
salts obtained from the products of the action of sodium on chinoline
and /3-lutidine, often agree in their percentages of platinum with
substances having formulae of the polymerised bases united directly to
platinic chloride.
                  Action of Sodium Amalgam on Chinoline.
   25 gnus, of chinoline and 20 grms. of sodium amalgam containing
10 per cent, of sodium were mixed.          The action commenced in the
cold, and red streaks appeared where the base and the amalgam were
in contact.     When the action ceased in the cold, the mixture was
warmed    on   the  water-bath ; the reaction started again immediately,
and the whole became of a deep red colour. No gas was giveu off.
The next day the mixture had assumed the consistence of thick treacle ;
when heated on the water- bath it softened, but the amalgam remained
hard ; the fluid had turned from purplish red to yellow, but reddish
streaks were still formed on stirring, showing that the reaction was
not complete. BAt this stage 5 grms. more amalgam were added. After
four or five hours of constant stirring on the water-bath the red streaks
ceased to appear, and the whole became a greenish yellow oil, the greater
portion of which was poured off, and the residue containing much
undecomposed amalgam was treated with hot water.            The amalgam
decomposed      with  violence, and when   the action was over excess of
hydrochloric acid was added, and the solution was boiled and filtered.
Three liquors were taken off and kept separate from each other, each
solution gave on cooling crystals of the hydrochlorate of dichinoline;
they were in the form of needles of so brilliant a scarlet that, on com
parison with a sample of the finest vermillion, the latter looked brown
by contrast with them. The first solution yielded       l'l grams of air-
dried product, the second 0"4, and the third 0-25, in all T75 grms.
from 25 grms. of chinoline. The scarlet crystals bleach on exposure
to light and become pale brown on drying in the water-oven, and the
brown colour itself rapidly bleaches on exposure to light.
   The mother-liquors of the scarlet crystals on evaporation to a quarter
of their original bulk, deposited a pale yellow precipitate too small for
analysis ; it was nearly insoluble in cold water.
   The mother-liquors affording no further crystals on evaporation,
were treated with excess of potash to enable the chinoline to be

recovered   ; 11 grms. were obtained, being 44 per cent, on the   chinoline
taken ; dedncting the recovered chinoline from       that  originally em
ployed, the produce of the scarlet crystals become 12-5 per cent, on
the base originally taken.
          Action of Sodium Amalgam, on   the Recovered Chinoline.
   The recovered chinoline was dried by sticks of potash for a short
time, and then rectified to see if its boiling-point had undergone any
alteration by the treatment with sodium amalgam ; however, it came
over at almost exactly the same point as it did before.         It is very
remarkable that in spite of the fact last mentioned, the product of
the action of the amalgam upon the recovered base was of a totally
different character to that of the same reagent upon the original
chinoline.
   The 11 grms. of recovered chinoline were treated with 20 grms. of
amalgam, effervescence took place, and much heat was developed ; this
was possibly caused by traces of moisture remaining in the base.
When the effervescence was over, 5 grms. more amalgam were added,
being in all 30 grms. for 11 of base, whereas in the first experiment
equal parts of base and amalgam were used ; this fact has to be
remembered in considering the causes of the different result.          The
red coloration took place as before ; it is, however, a very ephemeral
reaction, the colour on a glass rod soon disappears, and does so imme
diately on spreading the substance in a thin layer on the side of the
beaker in which the operation is conducted.         The experiment was
made precisely as with the original chinoline, and the reaction appeared
to proceed exactly in the same manner as before ; but, on boiling out
with dilute hydrochloric acid, the product of hydrochlorate of dichino-
line was much smaller, and the crystals were too small to be distin
guished as such by the naked eye.
   The mother-liquors were treated with potash, as before, to enable
the chinoline to be recovered, when to my surprise a solid yellow base
was obtained, which on boiling some time with water to expel any
adhering chinoline, became, on cooling, a hard resinous mass : on
drying in the air it weighed 7 grms., or 63 per cent, on the 11 grms.
of recovered chinoline used.
   In order to gain some insight into the nature of the new solid
base, it was converted into a hydrochlorate and fractionally precipi
tated with platinic chloride.      1  grm. was dissolved in 50 cub.
centims. of hot diluted hydrochloric acid, on cooling a part separated
out ; this could have been prevented by a great excess of hydrochloric
acid, but, on this occasion, the separation was permitted as a mode of
 purification. The precipitate was filtered off, and some hydrochloric
acid was added to prevent the water in the solution of platinic
chloride from causing a further precipitation. On adding the pla

                                                                     [Mar.
t inum solution, a dense bright yellow precipitate was formed ; to the
filtrate more platinum solution was added, and so on until four pre
cipitates were obtained.     The second, third, and fourth were buff
coloured, but the   last on standing became of a dirty brown colour.
The two last were in too small quantity for analysis.
    The first precipitate gave 18'47 per cent, of platinum. Assuming
for the present that the yellow solid base from the recovered chinoline
is isomeric with that which yields the scarlet hydrochlorate, it may be
mentioned that a salt having the formula —
                        2   (C18H'*N2)4HCl.PtCl*
would require 19-76 per cent, of platinum. The second precipitate
gave 23"49 per cent, of platinum, and yielded, therefore, almost the
same percentage of the metal as the second precipitate obtained
from the product of the action of sodium upon the original
chinoline, and the remarks made upon that precipitate apply equally
to the present one.
   Experiments were subsequently made to ascertain         if,
                                                           in presence
of excess of hydrochloric acid, platinum salts of   different constitu
                                                      a
tion would be formed. For this purpose         grm. of the new solid
                                                1
base was treated with   10 cub.    centims.   of strong hydrochloric acid,
it  dissolved with effervescence as    ifcarbonic anhydride had been
absorbed    the solntion took place with moderate readiness
            ;                                                      was;   it
filtered and treated with solution of platinum as before, a buff
coloured precipitate was obtained    ;at this point 10 cub. centims.
more hydrochloric acid were added, the precipitate became smaller,
25 cub. centims. more hydrochloric acid were added at this stage,
and the solution was heated to about 90° and filtered      ;much of the
platinum salt remained on the filter, and, after drying, gave 23'92
per cent, of platinum, the mother-liquid on cooling gave another
precipitate containing 24-55 per cent, of platinum; both these pre
cipitates appear, therefore,  in spite of the great excess of acid in
 which they were formed, to be constituted like the second precipi
 tates previously obtained.
    The solid yellow base contained     06 per cent, of ash, which con
                                         3
sists of carbonate of lime with a trace of iron, both derived from the
chemicals used in its preparation.
    The solid base when heated fuses to a yellow oil, giving off pre
 cisely the same odour as chinoline compounds generally near a red
                                                                 ;
 heat it  boils away leaving some carbon which, contrary to the usual
 rule in such cases, burns away readily.
    Nitric acid dissolves the base easily, giving a reddish brown solu
 tion which on dilution with water affords a yellow precipitate;
 ammonia turns the solution red, and partially dissolves the pre
cipitate.

1881.]          On the    Action of Sodium upon Chinoline.                   541
Preparation    of the   Platinum    Salt from    the Scarlet  Hydrochlorate    of
                                  Dichinoline.
   The scarlet hydrochlorate of dichinoline was dissolved            in boiling
water, and precipitated while boiling by an excess of platinic chloride.
The high temperature of the solution was necessary to prevent the
precipitation of the hydrochlorate with the platinum salt.           The latter
was of a beautiful pale cadmium yellow colour.                The filtrate on
cooling yielded    fine  needles  in  extremely    small  quantity. The pre
cipitate contained 24' 54 per cent, of platinum, and probably, there
fore, had the same composition as those before mentioned, containing
the same or nearly the same amount of platinum.              The needles con
tained 35-7 per      cent,  of platinum, and it is most likely that the
presence of a small quantity of this salt was the cause of the high
platinum in the first precipitate. A direct combination of dichinoline
with platinic chloride —
                                 C18H"N2.PtCl*,
would require 33'11 per cent, of platinum, but it is not easy,        as  I have
said before, to admit such a formula, when it is remembered             that the
precipitation took place in the presence of hydrochloric acid.
   A salt of the formula —
                           2(C18HuN3)HC1.2PtCl*
would require 33'66 per cent, of platinum, and would only differ from
the salt —
                             2(C18H1*N3)HCl.PtCl\
before alluded to, and which contains 22'18 per cent, of platinum,
by containing one more equivalent of platinic chloride.                It must,
however, be distinctly stated that the numbers in this paper are given
provisionally, and that the subject is still under study.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   David Thomas Ansted was born in London on the 5th February, 1814,
and after education at a private school, entered the University of Cam
bridge as a member of Jesus College.      He was 32nd Wrangler in the
year 1836, and proceeded to the degree of M.A. in due course. About
four years afterwards he was elected to a fellowship on the Ley Foun
dation in his College, which he retained for about eight years.        In
1840 he was elected Professor of Geology at King's College, London,
which office he resigned in 1853. He was also for some time Lecturer
on Geology at Addiscombe, and Professor of Geology at the College of
Civil Engineers, Putney. From 1844 to 1847 he was Vice- Secretary
of the Geological Society, of which he became a Fellow in 1838. He
was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1844.
    By degrees his attention became diverted from the theoretic to the
practical aspect of his favourite study, and for the last thirty years
at least of his life he acted professionally as a consulting geologist
and mining engineer.       For some time before his death he was in
failing health, and he expired on the 13th May, 1880, at his residence,
Melton, near Woodbridge, Suffolk.
    Professor Ansted, however, when systematic teaching ceased to be
a part of his regular duties, did not abandon his interest in geology as
an educational subject, but not unfrequently lectured and took part in
examinations on this and allied sciences.     His pen also was rarely for
 long idle. Besides some contributions to the
                                                  " Quarterly Journal of
 the Geological Society," the  " Transactions of the Cambridge Philo
sophical Society," the
                         " Annals and Magazine of Natural History,"
 and other like publications, he was whole or part author of a con
 siderable number of volumes ; the majority of these were of a some
 what popular character, and more than one obtained a considerable
 share of success.    He wrote lucidly and pleasantly whether upon
 matters  more   directly scientific or upon the incidents of travel.
                                                             "
 Among these works may be mentioned the following : — Geological
 Gossip," first published in 1860 ;
                                      " A Short Trip to Hungary and
 Transylvania," in 1862; "The Ionian Islands," in the year 1863;
 and " The Great Stone Book of Nature," published in the same year.
 He also published a work on geology, in two volumes, in 1844, and
 more than one smaller book on this subject, physiography, or geography.
  He was joint author (with Mr. R. G. Latham) of a work on " The
                                                               b

                                       ii

                                                      " Physical Geography
and Geology of Leicester." In the Great Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862
he contributed to the
                        " Reports." His latest and one of his most im
                         "
portant works was on Water and Water Supply," published in 1878.
Though for several years, owing to pressure of business and the
advance of age, he had ceased to take an active part in the proceedings
of the scientific societies of which he was formerly an energetic
member, he did not lose that cordiality of manner and kindliness of
disposition, which have left a pleasant impression on the memory of
his friends.
   William Hallowes Millke was born, April         6, 1801, at Velindre, near
Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire. At this pretty spot, on the upper part
of the strath of the Towey, his father, Captain Miller, had a few years
previously fixed his residence. The associations of the family were essen
tially military. Captain Miller served through a part of the American
War ; his house was burnt by the rebels, and he was in other respects
a heavy loser. All the family papers were destroyed in this conflagra
tion ; but Captain Miller is believed to have been a descendant of a
distinguished officer who was Adjutant- General to General Wolfe.
He was twice married. Of his family by the first wife, two sons
were killed in action — one in the act of leading a storming party:
another, though crippled by wounds, lived to be a Lieutenant-
Colonel, and to receive the distinction of C.B. His daughter also
married an officer in the Artillery. Captain Miller, after his return to
England, and comparatively late in life, for he was then full sixty
years of age, married the daughter of a Welsh clergyman.             She was
the mother of William Hallowes Miller, and died a few days after his
birth.
   After receiving his earlier education at private schools, he proceeded
to St. John's College, Cambridge, and in the year 1826 graduated,
being fifth among the Wranglers in the Mathematical Tripos. In the
earlier part of 1829 he was elected a Fellow of his College, and pro
ceeded in due coui-se to the degree of M.A. For some time he filled the
office of a College tutor, and his first literary work was mathematical — a
" Treatise on Hydrostatics,"      published in 1831, and followed a few
                                "                        The two were after
years subsequently by one on Hydrodynamics."
wards republished in one volume, and formed              for many years the
chief text- book on that subject in the Cambridge lecture-rooms. This
treatise is conspicuous for its exactness and lucidity, though its terse
ness — a distinguishing feature in all the author's writings — makes it
a rather difficult book for a student of only average ability.        At this
time, the Chair of Mineralogy at Cambridge was occupied by Dr.
Whewell, who, on his election to that office in the year 1828, had
thrown himself energetically into its duties, and had especially de

                                      iii
voted himself to the study of crystallography.        Miller was attracted
to the same subject ; and four years later, when Professor Whewell
resigned, he used his influence to obtain the chair for his pupil. Thus,
in the year 1832, Miller was elected to the post, the duties of which
became the chief work of his long and laborious life.
    In 1838 Professor Miller was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
In 1841 he proceeded to the degree of Doctor of Medicine. To this
temporary diversion from more congenial studies he was compelled
by the statutes which at that time governed the College.             These
required that all the Fellows, after a certain time, should be in
Holy Orders, with the exception of four, two of whom were to be
students of medicine.      To one of these Fellowships Professor Miller
was transferred in the year 1834; but it is needless to add that,
though he complied with the requirements of the statute, he made no
attempt to follow medicine as a profession.        In 1844 he vacated his
Fellowship at the College, by marriage, in accordance with the existing
statutes.   However, thirty years afterwards he was again elected a
Fellow of his old College, under the statute (granted in 1860) em
powering the Society to elect as Fellows persons eminent for science
or learning, though in other respects technically disqualified. But
Professor Miller's work was now drawing near its end. From his
youth he had been a hard worker, and had lived perhaps almost too
sparingly.    He delivered his lectures as usual in the earlier part of
1876, but a change in the expression of his face began to be rather
marked, which seemed to forebode a giving way of his robust constitu
tion, and caused anxiety to his friends. Their fears were not ground
less. In the October term of 1876 a short course of lectures which he
had announced was interrupted by a slight stroke of paralysis. This
proved the beginning of the end. He was never able to meet his
class again, and the duties of the chair were henceforth discharged by
a deputy.     Very slowly, but very surely, his vital powers declined — a
torpor stealing alike over mind and body — till at last he fell asleep on
the 20th May of the present year (1880).
    Professor Miller's name is inseparably connected with two important
branches of scientific work.      The first of these belongs, as might be
                                                                      "
 expected, to mineralogy. "Crystallography," as it has been said, was
 Miller's science. It had taken its first shape in t he hands of Haiiy
 in the decade of years before he was born, and in those of Weiss, of
 Mohs, and especially of Franz Ernst Neumann and of Grassmann ; it
 had been receiving development during the years of Miller's youth
 and manhood."      To this his predecessor, Professor Whewell, had con
 tributed by an important memoir on the geometrical treatment of
                                       " Transactions of the
 crystal forms, published in the                                Cambridge
                           " Taking  this  memoir  and Neumann's
 Philosophical Society."                                           treatise
 of 1823 ('Beitrage zur Krystallonomie ') as his starting point,

                                      iv
Miller proceeded to develop a system of crystallography, which was
not published till 1838, but which was the most important work of
his life."    His system represented the face of a crystal by a symbol
composed of three numerals, or indices.         Selecting three crystallo-
graphic axes, parallel respectively to possible edges of a crystal, and
a face of that crystal making certain intercepts on these axes, and
taking the three simplest whole numbers (a, b, e, suppose) whose ratio
expressed the ratio of these intercepts, he expressed the ratio of the
intercepts of any other face of the crystal, by multiplying a, b, c
respectively by    -
                   ft
                      j,
                      K
                         j respectively,
                         m
                                         where h, k, I were integers,  and
formed the symbol of the new plane.
     "The elegant way" (to continue the words of Professor Maskelyne,
already quoted)
                   " in which this mode of representing a face lent itself
to yielding expressions for the relations between faces belonging to a
zone (i.e., faces that would intersect in edges parallel to the same line)
gave it a superiority over previous methods, due to its bringing the
symbols of the crystallographer into a form similar to that employed
in algebraic geometry.     Miller's work consisted in working out into a
beautiful system the indicial method of notation and calculation in
crystallography, and obtaining expressions adapted for logarithmic
calculations by processes of great elegance and simplicity.        Miller's
system, then, gave expressions for working all the problems that a
crystal can present, and it gave them in a form that appealed at
once to the Bense of symmetry and appropriateness of the mathema
tician."    He thus, as it has been well said, " placed the keystone into
the arch of the science of crystallography," and the
                                                         " future
                                                                  develop
ment of that science, there can be little doubt, will follow on the lines
laid down by Miller."
   Professor Miller's shorter communications on mineralogy and
physics are numerous and valuable, and, in addition to them and to
his original treatise, he published, in 1863, a tract on crystallography.
In 1852 a work appeared entitled a new edition of the " Elementary
Introduction to Mineralogy, by the late William Phillips," by
H. J. Brooke and W. H. Miller. It is, however, no disparagement
to either the original author or his fellow editor to say that Professor
Miller made this volume almost his own. As has been said by the
                            "
authority quoted above, The publication of this severe little volume
was an epoch in the science which it illustrated ; it contained a mass
of results obtained by Miller with all his accuracy and all his
patience through many years, and tabulated in his usual concise
manner.      It is a monument to Miller's name, though he almost
expunged that name from it."
   But Professor Miller's reputation does not rest only upon his work
as a mineralogist, great though that was.       His name is no less in

                                      V
separably connected with the difficult and delicate experiments and
investigations connected with the restoration of the standards of
measurement and weight, and with the subsequent labours of the
International Metric Commission.
     After the fire which, in 1834, consumed the Houses of Parliament,
it was found that the standards of measurement and weight there
preserved were hopelessly ruined, and a Commission was appointed
to consider the questions connected with their restoration. Professor
Miller was not, indeed, a member of that Commission, but it is well
known that his friendly assistance contributed greatly to guide the
 Commission in some of their more important recommendations, espe
cially in those which related to the means to be provided for con
tingent restoration of the standard of weight. In sections 3 and 5 of
the Act 5th George IV, it was directed that " in case of the loss of
 the standard, the yard shall be restored by taking the length which
 shall bear a certain proportion to the length of the pendulum, vibrat
 ing seconds of mean time in the latitude of London, in a vacuum,
 at the level of the sea; and that the pound shall be restored by
 taking the weight which bears a certain proportion to the weight
 of a cubic inch of water weighed in a certain manner." In their
 report, dated December 21, 1841, the Commissioners             decline to
 recommend the adoption of these provisions, for reasons which are
 given therein, and advise that each standard should be restored from
 measures and from weights then existing, which had been most care
 fully compared with the original standards, stating also that they were
  " fully persuaded that, with reasonable precautions, it may always be
 possible to provide for the accurate restoration of standards by means
 of material copies, which have been carefully compared with them,
 more securely than by reference to experiments referring to natural
 constants."
     In 1843 a Committee was appointed to superintend the construction
 of the new Parliamentary standards of length and weight, of which
 Professor Miller was a member, and to him was confided the construc
 tion of the new standards of weight: In the
                                                   " Philosophical Trans
          " for 1856 he describes at length " The operations for
 actions                                                         restoring
  the value of the Old Standard of Weight, for constructing the New
  Standard of a different value, for constructing various derived Stan
  dards, and for establishing the relative value of the Kilogramme," a
  paper which (to quote the words of the Astronomer Royal, endorsed
                                                                " will long
  by a former President of this Society, Sir Edward Sabine)
 be cited as a model of accuracy."
     He was subsequently a member of a new Royal Commission for
  "
    examining into and reporting on the state of the secondary standards,
  and for considering every question which could affect the primary,
  secondary, and local standards."

                                      vi
    In  the year 1870 he was appointed a member of the Commission
Internationale dn Metre. This led to various visits to Paris between
the above year and 1874.         More than one of his colleagues has ex
pressed in the warmest terms his sense of the valne of Professor
Miller's services to that Commission.      Perhaps there was no member
whose opinions had greater weight in influencing a decision upon any
intricate and difficult question.
    His services to this Society must not be forgotten in a sketch of his
life, however brief. Elected a Fellow in the year 1838, he was
appointed Foreign Secretary in 1856, a post for which he was emi
nently fitted by his accurate and extensive knowledge of French,
German, and Italian, his methodical habits, and unvarying courtesy, as
well as by his extensive scientific knowledge.
    To those who enjoyed Professor Miller's friendship three charac
teristics were conspicuous above all. One was the extent and the accu
racy of his knowledge. Not only on those subjects to which he had more
notably devoted himself, but on almost any question of physical science
he was an authority.      Younger men in Cambridge looked upon him as
a kind of living encyclopaedia, for their questions were at once met by
answers, clear, accurate, and concise.     As one of the most competent
judges now living in that University writes,                   I
                                                  " There was, think, no
person in Cambridge whose knowledge of natural philosophy on the
whole exceeded, or even equalled, that of Professor Miller.       He kept
up his reading to an extent that was surprising."
    Another was the simplicity of his disposition. Seldom has there
been a man with so few wants. To all except himself he was generous ;
hospitable to his friends, he was almost Spartan in his own habits.
This trait combined with the remarkable inventiveness of his mind, is
evidenced even in his laboratory. There the visitor is surprised to find
the most homely odds and ends utilised in the construction of instru
ments capable of performing delicate measurements.       " Give Professor
Miller," a friend has said, " some loose lenses, bits of glass tubing,
laths, copper wire, and especially some pill-boxes, and he will make any
instrument that he wants."
    The third characteristic was the remarkable combination which he
exhibited of independence of thought and freedom of opinion, with
gentleness of temper and speech, with forbearance,          courtesy,  and
respect   for the opinion  of others.  No one, however  conscious  of infe
riority, whether in experience or in mental powers, had any reason to
fear to speak in the presence of Professor Miller. His words were
sure to be received with consideration, often almost with deference,
beyond their deserts.
    His life's course was tranquil and full of quiet happiness. Until his
 last illness he enjoyed excellent health.   Year after year was spent in
 the labours — to him a pleasure — which have been briefly noticed, with

                                         vii
an    occasional visit to the Continent, either for duty or for relaxation.
He     delighted especially in the scenery of the dolomite mountains of
the    Italian Tyrol, spending among them many hours of quiet enjoy
ment, while their magnificent outlines were recorded with rare fidelity
by the accomplished companion of his life.
     Happy, then, in his domestic life, happy in the affectionate appre
ciation of numerous friends of varied ages and ranks, he was also
happy in seeing his work (though for honours and rewards he cared
less than most men) not unacknowledged by his contemporaries.                 In
addition to the honours mentioned above, he received in 1865 the
degree of LL.D. from the University of Dublin, and in 1876 that of
D.C.L. from Oxford. In 1870 he was awarded a Royal Medal by this
 Society.     He was a Knight of the Order of St. Maurice and St.
 Lazare of Italy and of the Order of Leopold of Belgium. He was
 also an honorary member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of the
 Mineralogical Society of France, and of Boston, U.S.A., a foreign
 member of the Mineralogical Society of St. Petersburg, of the Imperial
 Royal Academy of Sciences, Vienna, and of the Royal Society, Got-
 tingen ; and a corresponding member of the Academies of Berlin,
 Munich, Paris, St. Petersburg, and of Turin.
     William Lassell, LL.D.,      died at Maidenhead, October 5, 1880, aged
 eighty-two years.     He   was  born   at Bolton, Lancashire, June 18, 1799.
 He acquired the rudiments of education at a day school in his native
 town, during which time his father died, and thence went for eighteen
 months to an academy at Rochdale.
     In 1814 he entered   a merchant's     office at Liverpool, and there served
 a seven years' apprenticeship.     He    commenced business in Liverpool as
 a brewer about the year 1825, without, however, much taste or inclina
 tion for trade, and spent almost all his leisure time in his favourite
 pursuit of astronomy and the mechanics connected therewith.
     Mr. Lassell possessed a great love and aptitude for mechanical
 invention, and for this reason " he belonged," to use the words of Sir
 John Herschel, " to that class of observers who have created their own
 instrumental means, who have felt their own wants, and supplied them
 in their own way." The qualities which enabled Mr. Lassell to do all
 this made him what he was.         The work was the revelation of the man.
 He felt precisely  where   lay the  difficulties and wants which met him in
 his work, because he was sansitive and sympathetic.              He could deal
 successfully with these difficulties and supply these wants often in a
 masterly and original way, because he could think for himself cautiously
 yet boldly.    He could work out his conceptions in new and difficult
  directions to a successful issue, because the constancy of his character
  showed itself here in concentration of thought and perseverance of
                                                                      c

                                    Vlll
action. These qualities — sensitive sympathy, wise prudence, constancy
— were those which pre-eminently characterised him as a man, and
 made him to those who knew him a friend of rare worth.
   In  the history of science Mr. Lassell's name will rank with those of
 Herschel and the late Lord Rosse in connexion with that essentially
British instrument, the reflecting    telescope, whether we consider the
genius and perseverance displayed in the construction of these instru
ments or the important discoveries which have resulted from their use.
About 1820 Mr. Lassell, then in his twenty-first year, began to con
struct reflecting telescopes for himself. It is perhaps to circumstances
which he at the time considered unfavourable, that science is indebted
for much that Mr. Lassell has accomplished. At that time ho did not pos
sess sufficient means to enable him to purchase expensive instruments,
and besides " his business avocations were such as most men consider
of an engrossing nature." The value to him in his subsequent work of
the energy and power of resource which were in this way so strongly
developed in his character at an early age, it is difficult rightly to
appraise.     His success with the first two instruments, which he
attempted simultaneously (a Newtonian of seven inches diameter and a
Gregorian of the same size), encouraged him to make a Newtonian of
nine inches aperture. The instrument, which was erected in an observa
tory at his residence near Liverpool, happily named Starfield, may be
said to form an epoch in the history of the reflecting telescope, in conse
quence of the successful way in which Mr. Lassell, on a plan of his
own, secured to it the inestimable advantages of the equatorial move
ment.    The several mirrors made for this instrument were of great
excellence.    The observatory note-books of the late Mr. Dawes, which
are in the writer's possession, bear record to the delicate tests for
figure to which these mirrors were put on the occasions of the frequent
visits of Mr. Dawes to his friend's observatory.     With this instrument
Mr. Lassell diligently observed, and detected, without knowledge of its
existence, the sixth star in the trapezium of the nebula of Orion. This
instrument is fully described in the twelfth volume of the " Memoirs of
the Royal Astronomical Society."
   About the year 1844 Mr. Lassell conceived the bold idea of con
structing a reflector of two feet aperture and twenty feet local length,
to be mounted equatorially on the same principle.       He spared neither
pains nor cost to make this instrument as perfect as possible, both
optically and from the mechanical side. As a preliminary step, he
visited the late Earl of Rosse at Birr Castle, and commenced the
specula for the new instrument upon a machine similar in construction
to that employed by that nobleman.       After some months' work, he was
not satisfied with this apparatus, and was led in consequence to contrive
a machine for imitating as closely as possible those motions of the
hand by which he had been accustomed to produce perfect surfaces on

                                     ix
smaller specula. " The essential difference of these constructions," to
use the words of Sir George Airy, " as regards the movements of the
grinder is this : that in Lord Rosse's apparatus every stroke is very
nearly straight, while in Mr. LasselPs apparatus there is no resem
blance to a straight movement at any part of the stroke." This is not
the place to describe the many new contrivances in the mode of support
of the mirror, in the equatorial mounting, in the polishing machine,
and in the arrangements of the dome under which it was erected,
which enabled Mr. Lassell to bring his telescope to a high degree of
perfection.  In this connexion it should be noticed, to use Sir John
Herschel's words, " that in Mr. Nasmyth he was fortunate to find a
mechanist capable of executing in the highest perfection all his concep
tions, and prepared by his own love of astronomy and practical
acquaintance with astronomical observations, and with the construction
of specula, to give them their full effect."
    With this fine instrument he discovered the satellite of Neptune.
This minute body was seen on October 10th, 1846, but it was not until
the next year that it could be satisfactorily followed, and its existence
fully confirmed. The superiority of the telescope, and the vigilance
and skill of the observer were further shown by the discovery in 1848,
simultaneously with Professor Bond in America, of an eighth satellite
 of Saturn, of extreme minuteness, which was named Hyperion. In
 1851, after long and careful search, he discovered two additional
 satellites of the planet Uranus (Umbriel and Ariel), interior to the
 two discovered by Sir "William Herschel in 1787.
     In the autumn of 1852, he took this twenty-foot telescope to
 Malta, and observed with it there through the winter. A very care
 ful and detailed drawing of the nebula of Orion, and drawings of
 several planetary nebulee. made at Malta, will be found in vol. xxiii
 of the " Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society." With respect
 to the planets, his discoveries, to use his own words,
                                                             " were rather
 negative than otherwise," for he was satisfied, that without great
 increase of optical power, no other satellite of Neptune could be
 detected.                                           I
              With regard to Uranus, he says, " am fully persuaded
 that either he has no other satellites than the four, or if he has, they
 remain yet to be discovered."
     Mr. Lassell's energy and zeal in the cause of science did not
 permit him to remain content with this magnificent telescope. His
 last work was a much larger telescope, four feet in aperture, and
 thirty-seven feet focus, mounted equatorially, which was erected at
 Malta, in 1861.       The work done with      it, with Mr. Marth's as
  sistance, during the next four years,   isfully described, as well as the
  instrument itself, in vol. xxxvi of the " Memoirs of the Royal Astro
  nomical Society."     This work consists of numerous observations of
  nebula} and planets, anda    catalogue of the places of 600 new nebula)

                                       X
 discovered at Malta.     It is not possible to suppress a feeling of    regret
 that this grand instrument no longer exists.
    Mr. Lassell was very successful in the great brilliancy and         perma
 nence of polish of his mirrors.       Within the last few years the writer
has been shown specula by Mr. Lassell, which had been polished for more
than twenty years, and which appeared as bright as if bat just removed
 from the polishing machine.         His earlier metal differed from that
employed by Lord Rosse, in that it contained             a small   quantity   of
arsenic in addition to copper and tin.         In the   case  of his four-foot
 mirrors, the arsenic was omitted.      He seems to     have considered that
the perfection of the metal depended upon the          accurate relative pro
portion of the copper to the tin, and that, in consequence of the
uncertainty of the state of purity of the metals, this proportion would
be obtained with the necessary accuracy only by a series of testings,
while the metal was in the pot.
    After his return from Malta, Mr. Lassell purchased a residence near
Maidenhead, and erected there in an observatory, bis equatorial tele
scope of two-foot aperture. Mr. Lassell's experience in re-polishing his
four-foot mirror, suggested to him some alterations in his polishing
machine.     After his return, he was able to carry out experiments is
connexion with the suggested alterations in a workshop erected at
Maidenhead, and succeeded in constructing an improved form of
                                                    "
polishing machine, which is described in the Philosophical Transac
       "
tions    for 1874. The numerous papers by Mr. Lassell, to be found in
     "                               "           "
the     Monthly Notices," and the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical
Society, bear abundant record to his industry and skill, and make us
feel that in Mr. Lassell's death we have to deplore the loss of one who
contributed largely to the advancement of the science of his age.
    Mr. Lassell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society
in 1839, he received the Gold Medal of that Society in 1849, and in
1870 was elected its President, which office he held for two years.
He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849, and received one of
the Royal Medals in 1858. Among other honours conferred upon
him, may be mentioned an honorary degree from the University of
Cambridge, and the honorary Fellowship of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, and of that of Upsala.
    Dr. William Shaepet was born at Arbroath, in Forfarshire, Scot
land, on the 1st of April, 1802. His father was an Englishman and
belonged to Folkestone, in Kent, till the year 1794, when he migrated
to Arbroath, and there married Mary Balfour, a native of that place;
but, he dying shortly before the birth of his son William, Mrs. Sharpey
was afterwards married to Dr. William Arrott, a medical practitioner
of Arbroath, in whose family the subject         of this notice was  brought
up.

                                     xi
     William Sharpey'8 education was carried on up to the age of fifteen
at the public school of Arbroath. In November, 1817, he entered the
University of Edinburgh as a student in the Faculty of Arts, attending
the Greek and Natural Philosophy classes.
     In 1818 he commenced his medical studies, in the University and
the extra-academical     school of Edinburgh.    In the latter school his
teacher in anatomy was Dr. John Barclay, well known for his
energy as a writer and lecturer and his ingenuity as an observer
in human and comparative anatomy.               In chemistry his chief
instructor was Dr. John Murray, of whose scientific accuracy and
judgment Dr. Sharpey always spoke in the warmest terms.               In
 1821, at the age of nineteen, he obtained the diploma of the Edinburgh
 College of Surgeons.     He then passed some months of that year in
 the study of anatomy at Brookes' School in London, and in the
 autumn proceeded to Paris and remained there for nearly a year, in
 attendance upon the medical and surgical wards of the hospitals,
 more especially in the surgical wards of the Hotel Dieu, under the
 instruction of the celebrated Dupuytren.      In Paris he had the com
 panionship of his friend Dr. Robert Willis, and he first made the
 acquaintance of Professor Syme, with both of whom he was ever after
 on the most intimate and friendly terms.
     In August, 1823, he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine in the
 University of Edinburgh, his printed inaugural dissertation bearing
 the title "De Ventriculi Carcinornate ;" and in the latter part of the
 year he went again to Paris to complete his studies in medicine and
 surgery at the hospitals, and in natural history at the . Garden of
 Plants. After his return from France in the summer of 1824, his
 plans seem to have remained for some time undecided until near the
 end of 1826, when he finally resolved not to embark in medical
 practice, but to devote himself to anatomical and physiological pur
 suits, for which he had long had a predilection, and to the study of
 which he had already given a considerable share of attention.
     With this view he resolved upon completing his continental travels,
 and obtaining the advantages of study in the Italian and German
 schools, as he had already done very fully in the French ; and
 accordingly, in the autumn of 1827, he proceeded by way of Paris and
  Geneva to Switzerland, in which he made a three months' pedestrian
 tour.    He then travelled in the north of Italy, visiting Milan, Pavia
  (where he spent some time in company with Panizza), Genoa, and
  Florence.   The winter was passed in Borne, Naples, and other places
  of interest in central Italy ; and in the spring of 1828 he turned
  his steps northward, taking the way of Bologna, Padua, and Venice,
  to Verona and Innsbruck.       The summer was spent in Austria and
  North Germany, and he finally reached Berlin in August, where it
  was his main object to devote himself to the study of anatomy.      In

                                           xii
doing this lie had the inestimable advantage of the assistance and
friendship of Professor Rndolphi ; and for nine months he gave the
whole of his time with the closest application to the minnte and fnll
dissection of the hnman body, — the only way, as he himself expressed
it, in which any one could obtain the knowledge necessary to a com
petent teacher of the subject.
   As already mentioned, Dr. Sharpey made considerable parts of his
foreign travels on foot, with his knapsack on his back, picking np
acquaintance with fellow travellers as he went, mixing with the
natives of the several places he visited, and storing up in his wonder
fully tenacious memory that fund of observation, anecdote, and inci
dent, which always surprised and delighted those who afterwards heard
him narrate his travels.
   On his return from the Continent, in the autumn of 1829, he esta
blished himself in Edinburgh, and engaged in microscopic observation
and scientific anatomical research      and, in 1830, as a necessary pre
                                              ;
liminary to his being qualified as a teacher, he obtained the Fellowship
of the College of Surgeons, and presented a probationary essay " On
the Pathology and Treatment of False Joints " (after fracture)      a sub;
ject which was no doubt suggested by his intimacy with Mr. Syme, to
whom the printed essay          inscribed. In the summer of 1831, Dr.
                                 is
Sharpey again spent three months in Berlin, on this occasion being
chiefly employed in collecting anatomical preparations and other
materials for the illustration of the course of instruction in anatomy
which he had in view to deliver in the following winter. This long-
cherished object he carried into effect by giving, during the session of
1831-32,     course of systematic lectures on anatomy in the extra-
             a
academical school of Edinburgh in association with Dr. Allen Thomson,
who taught physiology. This association subsisted during the four
following years of Dr. Sharpey's stay in Edinburgh.        At this time a
keen competition existed among the four teachers who, in addition to
the Professor within the University, divided among them the students
who applied for instruction       and as Dr. Sharpey's class increased
                                      ;
during   the period   mentioned    from twenty-two to eighty-eight, we
may regard his success as complete in point of number, while his
reputation as a teacher and man of science had advanced in a still
greater degree, so that he had now come to be generally known both in
the seat of his labours and at a distance as one of the most judicious,
learned, and accurate investigators and teachers of his favourite
science.
      From    1829 to    1836,   Dr. Sharpey was also actively engaged          in
         investigations among which the earliest and perhaps the
scientific                   ;
most novel and important were those on ciliary motion, described in              a
paper published in 1830    On    peculiar Motion excited in Fluids
                                 ("       a
by the       surfaces   of   Certain      Animals,"   " Edin.   Med.   and   Surg.

                                        xiii
Journal," vol. civ, 1830). By the observations which were described
in this paper, many of which were entirely new, Dr. Sharpey
appears to have been the first to point out distinctly the general
distribution among animals, and the essential nature and uses of the
phenomena of ciliary motion ; and although it is true that he
afterwards found he had been anticipated in one of the most im
portant of his observations, and that at the time of his first publica
tion, from the want of a sufficiently powerful microscope, he was un
successful in detecting the presence of cilia in the Batrachia, his later
 observations led to that result, and his observations on a number of
animals greatly amplified and confirmed the general conclusions which
followed from the important discovery by Purkinje and Valentin in
 1834, of the existence of cilia in vertebrate animals.
     In 1835, Dr. Sharpey published in il The Edinburgh New Philo
 sophical Journal," a translation of the preliminary memoir in which
 the discovery of Purkinje and Valentin was announced, and at the
 same time gave an account of additional observations on the subject
 made by himself ; and he soon afterwards embodied the whole of the
 information on Cilia and ciliary motion in a systematic form in his
 article " Cilia," published in the " Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and
 Physiology," in 1836, but which he had been engaged in preparing for
 several years previously.
      Dr. Sharpey also contributed the article     " Echinodermata," which
 appeared     in the same publication in 1837, and which, like that of
  " Cilia," contained     a large amount of original matter, and added
  greatly  to  his scientific reputation.
      In 1833 he published an abstract of Ehrenberg's discoveries on the
  Infusoria in " The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal." In 1834
  he took an active part in the proceedings of the Meeting of the British
  Association at Edinburgh, and communicated a paper founded on his
  own observations on the peculiar convoluted disposition of the blood
  vessels  in the common porpoise.
      In 1834,  Dr. Sharpey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh.
      We now come to the period of Dr. Sharpey's career when he was
   about to be called to a wider sphere of exertion in the metropolis.
   In the summer of 1836, upon the resignation by Dr. Jones Quain of
   the chair of Anatomy and Physiology in the then University of
   London, a desire was felt by the leading professors and authorities of
   that institution to give greater prominence than had previously been
   done in the London schools of medicine to the subjects of physiology
    and physiological anatomy, and, after due inquiry, Dr. Sharpey was,
    in the course of July, selected as the fittest person to fill the chair
    and carry out the object in view.       He was accordingly appointed to
   the chair designated       as of Anatomy and Physiology,      while Mr.

                                    XIV
  Richard QtTain was named Professor of Anatomy ; it being de
 termined that Dr. Sharpey should in hia course treat fully of physi
  ology, or of the functions of the body along with minute and visceral
  anatomy, and that Professor Quain should occupy himself with the
  descriptive and practical departments of anatomy.        There was thus
 established in London, for the first time, the full and systematic teach
  ing of physiology, which had previously been only imperfectly treated
 as an appendage to the courses of anatomy in the London medical
 schools.
     The great success of Dr. Sharpey     as a   teacher in his favourite
 departments of biology was from the first apparent in the large
 number of his pupils, the close attention and deep interest with
 which he was listened to, and the marked inflnence which he
 exercised    on the minds of the students, and in all the affairs of
 the school with which he was now connected.        With all the interests
 of University College, as it was named after the institution of the
 London University, he soon became identified, while at the same
 time he took an active part in the business of other scientific bodies
 of the metropolis.
     Dr. Sharpey never wrote out his lectures, excepting an intro
 ductory one, and he delivered them all without any assistance from
 writing beyond very short jottings on small slips of paper. He made
 use of diagrams and pictorial illustrations as well as of anatomical
 preparations and physiological experiments, and he was one of the
 first to introduce the employment of the microscope for the practical
 illustration of his lectures. For this purpose he employed more than
forty years ago a revolving table which still exists in the physiologi
cal laboratory of University College, and which enabled a number of
persons in succession to observe through one microscope ; the first
attempt made in London to illustrate physiological lectures micro
scopically. And thus in later times, when the improvement of the
apparatus and methods of experimenting had become greatly ex
tended, he lent all his influence to the establishment of the practical
teaching in physiology which has since been so fully carried out in
 the Jodrell Laboratory for practical physiological experiment and
 research.
    Dr. Sharpey's course of instruction was continued much in the
same form during the long period of thirty-eight years in which he
held the chair ; the same scrupulous care in the preparation of his
lectures, and the same conscientious    performance of his public duties
which he had shown in the earlier and most vigorous periods of his
life being maintained to the last ; and when we consider the number
of those who followed his instructions, varying, with the fluctuating
numbers attending the school, between 100 and 350 in each year, the
 wide-spread influence of his teaching can easily be understood.    Many

                                      XV
 of his pupils now hold high and important positions in the medical
 profession and in other departments of science ; and all of them are
 ready   to acknowledge, and none more emphatically than the most
 distinguished among them, their debt of gratitude to their biological
 teacher, not alone for the exact and solid information which they
 derived from his instructions, but also for the scientific spirit and
  love of truth which he endeavoured to instil into their minds.
     Dr. Sharpey was by no means a copious writer ; and indeed, it may
 be said that from his extreme fastidiousness with regard to all that
 emanated from his pen, he was much too sparing of authorship.
 Accordingly, much of the original observation and thought on
 scientific subjects which cost him prolonged labour, and involved
 much research, was made known by him only through his lectures, or
 was published in a more or less fragmentary form in connexion with
 such systematic works as " Baly's Translation of Miiller's Physiology,"
 and " Quain's Anatomy."         In the first of these works, it is well
 known that the excellent translator, who was a distinguished pupil of
 Dr. Sharpey 's class, derived much assistance in his labours from
 his teacher ; and several notable additions were made to the work
 by contributions from Dr. Sharpey's pen. Among these, one of the
 most important is that taking the modest form of a note, in which
 lie gave an account of original observations made by himself on
 the structure of the uterine glands and membrana decidua, and
 brought forward the first rational explanation of the manner in
 which the human ovum comes in the commencement of pregnancy
 to be imbedded in the substance of the decidua.        In 1843-46, Dr.
 Sharpey published,    as  joint  editor with Professor  Richard Quain,
                                          "
 the fifth edition of Dr. Jones Quain's Elements of Anatomy," which,
 from the amount of new matter introduced, and changes made by
 the editors, assumed almost the character of a new work. In this
 edition, the general anatomy was entirely re-written by Dr. Sharpey,
 and has ever since been looked upon as a standard work on the sub
ject of which it treats, containing the record of a large number of
 original observations upon the minute structure and growth of bone,
 and on many other subjects.
                                      " The Anatomy of the Brain and
           "
 Heart," Of the Organs of Respiration and Voice," " Of Digestion
 and Reproduction," were also from his pen. With the three sub
sequent editions of this work, Dr. Sharpey remained connected as one
of the editors till the time of his death.
     In 1862, Dr. Sharpey delivered the " Address in Physiology," at
the thirtieth annual meeting of the British Medical Association, held
in London in that year ; and, as President of the Biological Section
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at the
 Dundee Meeting in 1867, he delivered an address, in which, as in the
one previously mentioned, he ably reviewed the progress of physi-
                                                               d

                                       xvi
   ology, more especially as regards the application of exact   methods of
   research to the investigation of physiological problems.
      Dr. Sharpey was appointed       one   of the examiners in anatomy
  to the University of London, when that body obtained its charter
  to grant degrees in 1840, and continued to perform the duties of
  the office during the long period of twenty-three years.      He was, at
  a later period, a Member of the Senate of the University.         He w
  also during fifteen years one of the members appointed by the Ciwni
  on the General Council of Medical Education and Registration. H«
  acted for some time as one of the Treasurers of the Council, and took
  a deep interest in the various subjects connected with medical educa
  tion and polity, which claimed its attention.   Dr. Sharpey was alto a
  member of the Science Commission, which met under the presidency
  of the Duke of Devonshire, from 1870 to 1875, and, taking an acnVt
  part in its proceedings, he aided greatly by his sagacity and knowledge
 the deliberations of that body.      He was also one of the Trustees of
 the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, and i
 member of many scientific societies of this and other countries.       He
 received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edin
 burgh in 1859.
     Dr. Sharpey's connexion with the Royal Society began by hi.
 election as Fellow, on the 9th of May, 1839. He became a Member
 of the Council in 1844-5, and was appointed one of the Secretaries in
 place of Mr. Bell in 1853.       This office he held for nineteen years,
 or till 1872, when the failing condition of his eyesight, obliged him to
 resign.    He was again chosen a Member of Council for the next two
 years.
     All those who attended the Society, or took part in its proceedings,
 are well aware of the strong and steady interest which Dr. Sharpey
 took in all its affairs, and of the great amount of anxious care and
 judicious labour which he devoted to the promotion of its welfare. In
 the course of so long a membership and official connexion with the
 Society, there were necessarily many incidental pieces of business in
which he whs particularly engaged. It is sufficient to mention as
among the more important of those which occupied his attention,
the following, viz. : — 1. The correct and speedy publication of the
 Society's Proceedings and Transactions which fell under his superinten
 dence.     2. The introduction, in 1848, of the mode of electing Fellows,
by which the Council is made primarily responsible for the selection
of the persons to be elected by the Society.       3. The removal of the
Society with     its library and  other property from Somerset House to
Burlington House, in 1857, and the subsequent transference to the
new apartments in that locality. 4. The compilation and publication
of the Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers, in which his ex
tensive and accurate knowledge of scientific literature enabled him

                                  xvii
to render most important assistance. It may be further mentioned,
that in 1870, along with other members of the Society, he was active
in the introduction of   a new plan for the election   of Councillors, by
which effect was given to the opinion of the whole Council, instead of
the members being nominated by the President as previously.
   Up to the age of sixty-eight or seventy, Dr. Sharpey retained most
of the vigour of his earlier years ; but about the year 1871, and still
more decidedly in the following year, while some other signs of
advancing age showed themselves in the partial failure of his digestive
and locomotive powers, the rapid increase of a cataract, which affected
both eyes, together with some dulness of hearing, began to interfere
seriously with the efficient and easy performance of his official duties,
and to take much from his pleasure in society ; and very soon these
affections led to his retirement, first, as already stated, from the
Secretaryship of the Royal Society, in 1872, and second, from his
Professorship in University College, in 1874. These infirmities were
partially remedied by the operation of extraction of the lens of the left
eye, in May, 1873, and of that of the right eye in October, 1876 ; but
the recovery was not sufficient to give him more than a very limited
use of his sight.
   About the same time, Dr. Sharpey became subject to occasional
attacks of bronchitis, from exposure to cold. One of these, occurring
in 1878, was of great severity, and in the present year a renewed
attack of the same malady with which he was seized at the end of March
proved fatal on the 11th April, or ten days after he had completed his
seventy-eighth year.      He was buried in the Abbey graveyard of
Arbroath, his native town, on the 17th of April, and on the day of
the departure from London, his remains were accompanied by a large
number of his friends and former pupils to the Euston Station of the
North- Western Railway.
   In 1869 the friends and former pupils of Dr. Sharpey, being desirous
to carry out a design which had been for some time in contemplation
of showing their regard for him, and establishing a permanent
memorial of his services to University College and to science, raised
by subscription a sum of money for endowing a Sharpey Memorial
Scholarship in connexion with University College, and for presenting
to the college a portrait in oil, and a marble bust.    The proceedings
in connexion with the presentation of this memorial were naturally a
source of much gratification to himself and to his friends.
   In 1872 he made over his large and well-chosen biological library to
University College, and at his death he bequeathed from the small
property which he left a sum of £800 to increase the endowment of
the Sharpey Scholarship in physiology.
   Upon his retirement from his Professorship in 1874, Mr. Gladstone's
Government accorded Dr. Sharpey an annual pension of £150 on

                                      XV111
 account of his eminent       services   as a public   teacher and man of
 science.
    From what has now been said it will be seen that Dr. Sharpej
 did not enter upon any active sphere of exertion, either as an investi
 gator or as a teacher, till he had attained his twenty- eighth year; but
 with characteristic caution he was, during a number of years, preparing
 himself with the greatest diligence and care, by literary and scientific
 study, as well as by continental travel, for the duties of his after life.
    As a scientific investigator he was characterised by scrupulous
 care and accuracy in all his observations, and by an extensive and
 intimate acquaintance with what was previously known on the
 subjects.   Thus it happens that though, as already remarked,            he
 cannot be regarded as a copious observer or extensive discoverer of
 new facts, yet all the observations he has recorded may be ranked
as important contributions to science at the time when they were
 made, and the greater number of them have retained their valae to
 the present day, notwithstanding that the subjects to which they
 belong may, from the advance of knowledge, have considerably changed
 their aspect.
    As a systematic author there is everywhere apparent in his writings
the same scrupulous accuracy and full knowledge of his subject, com
bined with a simplicity and clearness of statement, an appropriate
choice of language, and a critical acumen, which have given them a
high and lasting value.      We have, it is true, to regret the fastidious
ness which deterred him from more copious publication, but we mav
console ourselves with the reflection that all he did publish bears the
stamp of excellence, and that in abstaining from more extended literary
productions he was ever spending his time and energies in the instruc
tion of his pupils and the advancement of the business of the scientific
institutions with which he was connected.
    Dr. Sharpey's usefulness and influence were probably more con
spicuous in his labours as a public teacher than in any other capacity.
During the forty-three years in which he was constantly occupied in
giving lectures on Anatomy and Physiology, he devoted himself with
ardour and perseverance to perfecting the information which he had
to communicate to his pupils, and to extending and improving the
means of illustrating his lectures, so that he was uniformly listened to
with the closest attention and regarded as the highest authority
on the subjects which he taught.        Thus too, it happened that be was
very frequently   consulted   by  former   pupils as well as by others with
regard to the preparation and publication of memoirs or more exten
sive works which they had in contemplation, and it is easy to under
stand the advantages which accrued to those who appreciated and
followed his advice, or the opposite effect which sometimes occurred
from its being disregarded.

                                    XIX
    But the effect of Dr. Sharpey's teaching upon a large number of
pupils did not proceed alone from the superiority of the information
conveyed, or the implicit reliance which his pupils placed in the fulness,
accuracy, and truthfulness of the statements of their teacher, but it
was also due to, and greatly enhanced by, the feeling of friendly
attachment, and even of filial affection amounting to reverence, which
was inspired in the minds of the pupils by his uniform kindness,
justice, and candour.
    In the other public offices held by Dr. Sharpey during the greater
 part of the time of his residence in London, the superior qualities of
 his mind had equal scope in conducing to the efficiency and usefulness
of his services.     As an examiner in the University of London and
afterwards as a member of the Senate, as Secretary of the Royal
 Society, as Member of the General Medical Council, as one of the
 Science Commissioners and a trustee of the Hunterian Museum, his
 extensive knowledge, unbiassed judgment, and strict impartiality,
 while they gave weight to his opinions and suggestions, aided largely
in the promotion of measures favourable to the interests of science and
 the public good.
    Of the more private features of Dr. Sharpey's life and character it
is difficult for those who have been most intimate with him to express
their estimate in sufficiently moderate terms. While he was universally
admired for the extent and accuracy of his acquirements and respected
for the soundness of his judgment, he was not less esteemed and
beloved for the gentleness of his disposition, the kindness of his heart,
and the geniality of his nature. His powers of memory, naturally
good, were carefully cultivated by the systematic turn of his mind
and strengthened by exercise.      His friends remember with delight
the readiness with which, in the course of conversation, he could
call up a desiderated quotation, or supply a fact on some doubtful
point in history, philosophy, or science, or tell humorously some anec
dote which was equally apposite and amusing. He had not a single
enemy, and he numbered among his friends all those who ever had the
advantage of being in his society.
   John Stenhouse, the son of William Stenhouse and Elizabeth
Currie, his wife, was born at Glasgow, 21st October, 1809, and
educated first at the Grammar School, and subsequently at Glasgow
University, where he studied from 1824 to 1828.
   His tastes in early life were more literary than scientific, but owing
to weak eyesight he was obliged to give up literature as a pursuit,
and devoted himself to Chemistry, which he studied under Professor
 Graham and Dr. Thomas Thomson. His training in this science was
first acquired at the Andersonian University, now Anderson's College,
 Glasgow, and it was probably on this account he always took such a
                                                                e

                                     XX
lively interest in this Institution : during his lifetime he nscd all his
interest to obtain bursaries and otherwise promote the study of his
favourite science, and by his will he left a legacy to found a Scholar
ship in connexion with the Chemical Chairs in that College.
   He attended the Chemical lectures at Glasgow University in 1837,
1838, and 1839, and shortly afterwards left Glasgow for Giessen,
where he continued his chemical researches under Liebig, and became
acquainted with many of his fellow pupils, whose names have since
become illustrious as workers in this portion of the field of science-
It is apparently shortly before this time that his first paper, entitled
" Darstellung und Analyse des Hippursaures -<E there," was published
in the " Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie," vol. xxxi, p. 148
(1839). He was with Liebig, at Giessen, about two years, and then
returned to Glasgow, where ho remained until the failure of the
Glasgow Commercial Exchange deprived him of the fortune be
queathed him by his father, which had hitherto rendered him inde
pendent.
   Stenhouse   received   his degree of LL.D. in May, 1850, and it was
about this time that he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Professor
ship at Owens College. He left Glasgow for London in January, 1851,
and in the following month was appointed Lecturer on Chemistry to
the Medical School at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, but was obliged to
resign the appointment in 1857 owing to a severe attack of paralysis.
He then went to Italy, and resided there with his mother until her
death, which took place at Nice in February, 1860.        He returned to
England    in June   of  the  same  year, and again commenced scientific
research with that indomitable energy which was so characteristic of
 him, and which enabled him to overcome the obstacles occasioned
by his bodily infirmities.
    In 1865 he succeeded Dr. Hofmann as one of the non-resident
 Assayers to the Royal Mint, but was deprived of the appointment when
the office was abolished in 1870.      In November, 1871, a Royal Medal
of the Royal Society was awarded to him for his long-continued
 chemical researches, which have proved of great value in the arts and
manufactures.
    During the last four years of his life he suffered greatly from rheu
matism in the eyelids, which compelled him to live almost constantlv
 in a darkened room, and at times caused him the greatest pain.         It
was not, however, until within a few weeks of his death that he became
 sensibly feebler ; he ultimately sank into a sleep, and died a painless
death from old age and decay of natnre in the early morning of the
31st December, 1880, in the seventy-second year of his age.        He was
buried on the 6th of January in the High Church New Cemetery in
Glasgow, on the north side of the Cathedral.
    Dr. Stenhouse was one of the few surviving founders of the Chemical

                                    xxi
Society, a Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, an honorary member of
the Berlin Chemical Society, as also of the Philosophical Society of
Manchester, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
   It will be evident from an inspection of the titles of the numerous
papers (more than 100 in number) published by Dr. Stenhouse during
the past forty years, in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal
Society, the
              " Journal of the Chemical Society," " Liebig's Annalen,"
and other scientific journals (either alone or in conjunction with
Mr. C. E. Groves), that these for the most part relate to what
may truly be called
                         " Organic Chemistry," the chemistry of com
pounds found in organised bodies, so that his name will long be asso
ciated with numerous carbon compounds obtained from plants, and
derivatives formed from them. Among all these he applied himself
chiefly to the principles from the lichens, and made known the results
in eighteen papers.    One of his communications, published in 1880,
is worth mention as it relates to " Betorcinol," a substance he had
discovered some thirty-two years previously.         It is but seldom that
a chemist lives to complete a work begun so long before.
   Although the eminence he attained in organic research is fully
recognised, his contributions to our technical knowledge are not so
generally known. He was the author of many ingenious and useful
inventions in dyeing, waterproofing, sugar manufacture, and tanning ;
but the greatest and most permanent benefit has been conferred by
his application of the powerful absorbent properties of wood charcoal
to disinfecting and deodorising purposes, which took the form of
charcoal air-filters and charcoal respirators.
   Of Dr. Stenhouse's personal character, those who knew him inti
mately could never speak too highly, his general conversation and
fund of anecdote rendering him a most pleasant companion.            His in
genuity and quick perception   were  remarkable,   and  this combined  with
his unflagging industry, and patience and resignation in great bodily
suffering, enabled him to continue his scientific work with unabated
vigour, even after the effects of paralysis prevented him from per
forming experiments with his own hands.
   Humphrey Lloyd was born in Dublin on the 16th of April, 1800.
His father was the Rev. Bartholomew Lloyd, afterwards Provost of
Trinity College, Dublin, at that time a Junior Fellow. Having re
ceived his early education at Mr. White's school in Dublin, he entered
Trinity College on July 3, 1815, obtaining at the Entrance Examina
tion, which was at that time altogether classical, first place among
sixty-three competitors.    He obtained Scholarship (Classical) in 1818.
At the examination for the degree of B.A. he obtained the Science
Gold Modal, the highest honour which could be gained by an under
graduate.    In  the year 1824 he obtained    a Fellowship, given then, as
                                                                   d

                                   XXII
 now, to the best answerer at a special examination. He was elected,
 in 1831, to the chair of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, which
he filled with distinguished ability till 1843, when he became a Senior
Fellow.    In the year 1862 he became Vice-Provost, and in 1867, when
the Provostship became vacant by the death of Dr. Macdonnell, he
 was chosen by the Government of the day to fill the place.        He con
tinued to discharge the duties of this important office with unwearied
assiduity till his death, which occurred, after a few days' illness, on
the 17th of Jannary, 1881.
    Dr. Lloyd was President of the Royal Irish Academy from 1846 to
1851, and on the visit of the British Association to Dublin, in 1857,
he was elected to the Presidency of that distinguished Society.
   In 1856 the University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of
D.C.L., Honoris Causa, and in 1874 he received from the Imperial
Government of Germany the Cross of the Order " Pour le Merite."
   Dr. Lloyd's most important contributions to science were made in
the departments of optics and magnetism.         It will be convenient, to
consider these subjects separately, taking the contributions to each
subject respectively in the order of time.
   His first contribution to optical science was a systematic work on
plane (as distinguished from physical) optics.       It was entitled " A
Treatise on Light and Vision," and was published in the year 1831.
This book possesses a high scientific value.
   The year 1832 was distinguished in Dr. Lloyd's life by, perhaps, his
most remarkable single scientific achievement, namely, the experi
mental proof of the phenomenon of conical refraction. The discovery
of conical refraction presents one of the instances — rare in the history
of physical science — in which theory was able not merely to account
for a phenomenon but to predict it. Reasoning mathematically on
the theory of Presnel, and giving a suitable physical interpretation to
the mathematical results which he obtained, Professor (afterwards Sir
William) Hamilton deduced the remarkable consequence that, in
certain cases, the two rays into which an incident ray is usually
divided by a crystal are replaced by an infinite number of rays, form
ing a luminous cone or cylinder. Anxious to submit this extra
ordinary result to the test of experiment, he requested Dr. Lloyd to
undertake the experimental investigation of the phenomenon.              It
would be impossible to give here a detailed account of the difficulties
attendant upon this inquiry.      Suffice it to say that they were over
come by the experimental ability of Dr. Lloyd, who succeeded in
giving a perfect experimental demonstration of this remarkable pheno
menon in both its varieties.    He also established experimentally the
law by which the polarisation of the rays composing the luminous
cone is governed.
   This successful investigation at once brought Dr.    Lloyd to the front

                                      xxiii
rank among the cultivators of optical science, and in the year 1833 he
was requested by the British Association to report on the condition of
physical optics.     The report prepared in compliance with this request
was laid before the British Association in the year 1834, and may be
regarded as a handbook of the progress of the science to that date.
   Shortly after the publication of the experiment which established
the reality of conical refraction, Dr. Lloyd described to the Royal
Irish Academy an important experiment upon the interference of
light proceeding directly from a luminous source with light coming
from the same source, but reflected at a very high angle of incidence
from a plane surface.       By means of this experiment he was able to
make an important contribution to the theory of reflected light.          The
phenomena of thin plates require us to admit that a semi-undulation
is gained or lost by the light in the process of reflexion at one of the
surfaces.     But these phenomena do not decide the question whether
this modification takes place at the surface of the rarer or of the
denser medium.        Dr. Young had given the preference to the former
of these alternatives ; but Dr. Lloyd derived from the above-mentioned
experiment a strong argument in favour of the other.            The details of
this experiment are published in the seventeenth volume of the
" Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy."
   In 1836 Dr. Lloyd published the first part of his lectures on the           '
 " Wave Theory of Light," including the phenomena which are inde
pendent of polarisation and double refraction. To this was subsequently
added a second part in which the phenomena of polarisation are dis
 cussed.
   A communication       received  from Sir David Brewster, detailing some
 remarkable appearances which he had observed in connexion with the
phenomena of thin plates, induced Dr. Lloyd to turn his attention to
that subject, the light incident on the plate being supposed to be
polarised.     A communication on this subject was made by him to the
 British Association in 1841, but the complete investigation of the
                                                                     " Trans
phenomenon was published in the twenty-fourth volume of the
actions of the Royal Irish Academy," having been laid before that
 Society in 1859.
   Assuming the truth of Fresnel's expressions for the intensity and
phase of polarised light reflected from the surface of an ordinary
medium, Dr. Lloyd showed that the reflected light is elliptically
polarised.     He assigned the law of this elliptic polarisation, which
passes   into plane polarisation where the incident light is polarised in,
or at right angles to, the plane of incidence.            He also gave the
explanation of    the  phenomena    observed   by Brewster,  where the index
of refraction of the plate is intermediate between those of the bound
ing media.
   But it will probably    be felt that the link which associates Dr. Lloyd's

                                   xxiv
name most indissoluble with the science of the nineteenth century is
to be fonnd in the subject of terrestrial magnetism.    It is here tha:
his labours, whether conducted singly or in association with other
investigators, have left the most permanent mark ; and it is not t«
much to say that no single individual contributed more largely to thf
success of the effort which was made to perfect by observation our
knowledge of the earth's magnetic force.
   At the first meeting of the British Association in 1831, the Com
mittee of Section A reported that it was highly desirable that a
series of observations upon the intensity of terrestrial magnetism in
various parts of England be made by some competent           individual,
similar to those which had been recently carried on in Scotland bv
Mr. Dunlop. In compliance with this suggestion, some experiments
were made in the neighbourhood of Liverpool, by W. S. Traill, M.D..
the results of which were laid before the Association in 1832.         In
 1833 the Committee extended their recommendation so as to include
the whole kingdom, appointing as a Standing Committee, charged
with the promotion of these objects, Professors Christie, Forbes, and
 Lloyd.    At the same time Dr. Lloyd undertook to make the required
observations in Ireland.    These observations were carried on in the
year 1834 by Dr. Lloyd, with the assistance of Captain (afterwards
 Sir Edward) Sabine, and subsequently of Captain (afterwards Sir
 James) Ross.       A brief commmnieatiom on the method of these
 observations was made by Dr. Lloyd to the Association in 1834.        In
 this communication he described a new method of obtaining the
values of the intensity and the dip, by observation of a magnet
 turning round a horizontal axis.      This method had been previously
communicated to the Royal Irish Academy by Dr. Lloyd (October,
                                                                " Trans
 1833) and is published in the seventeenth volume of their
 actions." A full report of observations made at twenty-four stations
 in various parts of Ireland was laid before the British Association in
 1835, and is published, along with a magnetic chart of Ireland, in the
 Report for that year. This was followed, in 1838, by an elaborate
 memoir, " On the Magnetic Survey of Great Britain," from the pen
 of Major Sabine, embodying the results of observations made by-
 several distinguished physicists, including Dr. Lloyd.
    In the same year the Association came to the conclusion that a
 wider scope ought to be given to the inquiry, by establishing stations
 for simultaneous magnetic observations in various parts of the world.
 As it was impossible for private individuals to carry out so extensive
 a plan, it was resolved to endeavour to obtain the co-operation of the
 Government, and a Committee, consisting of Sir J. Herschel,
 Dr. Whewell, Mr. Peacock, and Dr. Lloyd, was appointed for this
 purpose.     The representations   made by this Committee, strongly
 backed by the Royal Society, were successful, and Magnetic Observa

                                       XXV
tories were erected in various parts of the world.        The high apprecia
tion   formed of Dr. Lloyd's scientific ability was proved by the fact that
the duty of drawing up instructions for the observers at these several
stations was intrusted to him. It was also provided that he should
receive directly from the stations the reports of the observers.         As a
further proof of Dr. Lloyd's high reputation in this branch of science,
it may be mentioned that the Director of the Magnetic Observatory
at Cadiz visited Dublin for the purpose of consulting him as to the
best methods of observing.
    In the year 1837, Dr. Lloyd had induced the Board of Trinity
College to commence the erection of a Magnetic Observatory within
the precincts of the College.        This observatory was completed in the
year 1838, and observations were regularly carried on under his per
sonal superintendence for several years. The instruments used in this
observatory were constructed under the direction of Dr. Lloyd, and
were in large part devised or greatly modified by him.           Instruments
 similar in their construction to those used in the Dublin Observatory
 were subsequently     employed in other observatories throughout the
 world.     The observations made in Dublin were published in two
 quarto volumes in the year 1869. They form an important part of
 the great series of magnetic observations begun by an individual in
 Scotland — passing thence into the hands of a Society, and by them
 extended throughout the British Isles — taken up finally by the nation
 and extended over the world. No nation ever engaged in a more
 important scientific enterprise ; no individual held a more prominent
 place in that enterprise than Dr. Lloyd.
    Besides his share in this great public work, Dr. Lloyd was con
 tinually and actively engaged in his individual researches, the results
 of which were from time to time given to the world, generally in the
 " Transactions" or "Proceedings" of the Royal Irish Academy. Among
 these may be noticed a memoir
                                      " On the Mutual Action of Two Per
manent Magnets," readbefore the Academy in February, 1839. The
 importance of this communication in its bearing on the question of
 terrestrial magnetism, was recognised by the Committee in their
 "Report to the British Association," in 1841. Besides optics and
 magnetism, Dr. Lloyd communicated           to the Royal Irish Academy,
 from time to time, valuable papers on meteorology.              In the year
                     in  a collected   form, under  the title " Miscellaneous
 1877,  he published
 Papers connected with Physical Science," his principal contributions to
 the Transactions of the British Association, and of the Royal Irish
Academy.       He also published in 1874, a systematic treatise on
 "Magnetism, General and Terrestrial."           The third edition of his
                 "
 treatise on the Wave Theory of Light
                                             " was published in 1873.
    As head of the University of Dublin, Dr. Lloyd won golden
 opinions from all those who came into relation with him.          His policy

                                 xx vi
was pare and liberal, guided by broad principles, and ever mindful of
the greatness of the institution which he ruled.  His University — his
country — the world of science, will remember him long.
