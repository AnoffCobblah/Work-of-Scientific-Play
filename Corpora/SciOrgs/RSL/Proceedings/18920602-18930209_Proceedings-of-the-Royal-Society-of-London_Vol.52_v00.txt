I. " On the Method of Examination of Photographic Objectives
       at the Kew Observatory."            By Major L. Dabwin. Com
       municated by Captain Abney, R.E., F.R.S.                     Received
       April 13, 1892.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The paper describes the method of examination of photographic
objectives which has been adopted at the Kew Observatory, chiefly
on the recommendation of the author.           In selecting and devising the
different   tests, Major  Darwin  acted  in  co-operation with Mr. Whipple,
 the Superintendent of the Observatory, and was aided by consulta
tions with Captain Abney.
    The object of the examination is to enable any one, on the pay
ment of a small fee, to obtain an authoritative statement or certificate
as to the quality of an objective for ordinary purposes; the amount
of time that can be devoted to each experiment is therefore strictly
limited.
    An example is first given of a "Certificate of Examination" sncb
as would be obtained from Kew, and then the different tests are dis
cussed in detail.     Many of them are done by well-known methods,
which need not here be mentioned.           For the greater part of the ex
 amination, an apparatus called the testing camera " is employed, and
                                        "
 this is fully described in the paper.      The following are the different,
 items in the Certificate of Examination, including the various tests to
 which the objective is subjected, or the subjects about which in
 formation is given   : —
     (1.) to (4.) Under these headings are given a description of the
 objective, the date of receipt, the size of the plate for which the
 objective is to be examined, &c, &c. None of this information forms
 part of the result of the testing.
     (5.) Number of Reflecting Surfaces of the Lenses.
     (6.) Centering in Mount.
     (7.) Visible Defects, such as Veins, Feathers, §x.
     (8.) Flare Spot.
     (9.) Effective Aperture of Stops, which is given for each one sup
  plied with tho objective.    In recording the results, it is proposed that
  the system of numbering recommended by the International Photo
  graphic Congress of Paris of 1889 should be adopted.
     (10 ) Angle of Cone of Illumination,          tyc.
                                                        — Under this heading
  several useful items of information are given, such as the extreme
  angle of the field which is illuminated by the objective without
  reference to definition; the angle of field which is required to cover
  the plate of the size for which the objective is being examined ; and,
  the largest stop of which the whole opening can be seen from tho

 1892.]      Examination of Photographic Objectives at Kew.              3
whole of the plate.     With reference to this last item, it is shown how
if  a larger stop than the one here named is used, the illumination
will fall off very rapidly towards the edges of the plate, whereas
there will be no improvement in this respect by using a smaller stop.
    (11.)  Principal  Focal   Length. — This is found by revolving     the
camera    through a knowu angle, and measuring the movement of the
 image    of a distant object on the ground glass ; with the testing
camera it is so arranged that an angular movement can be given with
great ease and accuracy, and that the angle is such that half the focal
length is directly read off on a scale on the ground glass.           The
oliservation is made, and the focus adjusted, when the image is at a
point some 14 degrees from the axis of the objective, and the effect
of distortion and curvature of the field is discussed ; it is proved that
the focal length thus obtained, even though it may not be identical
with the principal focal length as measured on the axis, is never
theless what the photographer in reality wants to ascertain.
    (12.) Curvature of the Field.
                                    — The amount of movement of the
ground glass to adjust the focus at different parts of the field is
measured, and the results are recorded to show the curvature.            A
table is given by which it can be seen what is the largest stop which
can be used so as to produce negatives up to a certain standard of
excellence in definition.
   (13.) Distortion.
                     — This test depends in principle on ascertaining
the sagitta or deflection in the image of a straight line along one side
of the plate.    In the discussion it is shown that to give the total dis
tortion near the edge of the plate would not answer practical require
ments, and that the proposed method of examination does give the
most useful information that can be supplied.
   (14.) Definition.
                     — This is found by ascertaining what is the thinnest
black line the image of which is just visible when seen against a
bright back-ground.       It is shown that this is the best method thnt
could be devised of measuring the defining power of an objective,
and that it is not open to serious objections on theoretical grounds.
   (15.) Achromatism.
                        — Under this heading is recorded the difference
of focus between an object when seen in white light and the same
when seen in blue or red light.       How to estimate approximately the
diffusion in the image dne to any defect in achromatism is discussed.
   (16.) Astigmatism.
                       — This test is performed by measuring the dis
tance between the focal lines at the corner of the plate, and by cal
culating from the result thus obtained the approximate diameter
of the disc of diffusion due to astigmatism.     The reflection of a lamp
in a thermometer bulb is employed to give a fine point of light, and
the positions of the focal lines are obtained by noting when the inmgo
 of the object appears as a fine line, first in one direction, and ther
 in another, as the focus is altered.

   To the memoir which      I had the honour to present to the Royal
Society on this subject in 1882*     I appended a note from Dr. Scudder,
of Cambridge, U.S., so well known for his researches in fossil Insects
and   Arachnidans, in which he gave a preliminary account of the
remains of Arthropods in my collections which            I  had submitted to
him. He has only in the present year completed his examination of
these remains, most of which are very fragmentary, and much
damaged by unequal pressure.         The result has been embodied in a
Report on Canadian Fossil Insects, now in course of publication by
the Geological Survey of Canada.
   In this report he will describe from the contents of the Sigillarian
stumps extracted by me, with the aid of the grant of this Society,
three new species of Myriapoda, making, with the five previously
known from these remarkable repositories, eight in all, belonging to
two families, Archiulidee and Euphoberidro, and to three genera,
Archiulus, Xylobius, and Amynilyspes.           The three new species are
Archiulus euphoberioides, Sc., A. Lyelli, Sc., and Amynilyspes (sp.).
The remains of Scorpions he refers to three species, Mazonia acadica,
Sc., Mazonia (sp.), and a third represented only by small fragments.
The characters of the species referred to Mazonia he considers as
tending to establish the generic distinctness of Mazonia from Eoscor-
pius. Dr. Scudder also notices the fragment of an insect's head con
taining part of a facetted eye, mentioned in my memoir, and considers
it probably a portion of a Cockroach.
   Much credit is due to Dr. Scudder for the care and skill with
 which he has worked up the mostly small and obscure fragments
 which   I was able to submit to him, and which are probably little
more than debris of the food of the Amphibians living for a time in
 these hollow stumps, and devouring such smaller animals as were so
 unfortunate as to be imprisoned with them.            In this connexion the
 suggestion of Dr. Scudder is worthy of attention, that the scaly
 armour of the smaller Microsaurians may have been intended to
 defend them against the active and venomous Scorpions which were
 their contemporaries, and some of which were sufficiently large to
                        * '

                                 (Abstract.)
   The subject of this paper is the hippocampal region of the brain in
anosmatic animals.       Several specimens of the brain of the bottle-
nosed whale, narwhal, porpoise, and calf-seal were obtained for the
pnrpose of studying the extent to which the hippocampus in animals
totally destitute of the sense of smell, or possessing it in a very small
degree, departs from the ordinary type.
    The hippocampal region was, in each case, cut into a series of
  ections, which showed that there is, in the brains of Hyperoodon
and Mxmodon, no fascia dentata; in Phoccena this formation is very
rudimentary ; in Phoca it is rather less strongly developed than in
man.
   As a standard of comparison, the hippocampus of the ox was
studied in a similar manner. Certain points which have not been
described hitherto with regard to the anatomy and histology of the
hippocampus in macrosmatic brains are noticed. Other peculiarities
in the general form and in minute structure which distinguish
the brains of anosmatic animals are also mentioned incidentally.
    The discovery that the fascia dentata is completely absent in
animals which possess no olfactory bulb or tract, and that it varies
in development directly as the size of these organs, throws light upon
the function of the hippocampal region, and seems to call for a fresh
definition of its several parts and a revision of the nomenclature of
the region.      The paper contains an historical survey of the ter
 minology   and  suggestions for its revision.

      Measurement of Small Electrostatic! Capacities." By LORD
      Kelvin, P.R.S. Received May 31, 1S92.
   In the title of this paper as originally offered for communication
" Air  Condenser
                  " stood in
                              place of "Air Leyden," but it was accom
panied by a request to the Secretaries to help me to a better designa
tion than " Air Condenser " (with its ambiguous suggestion of an
apparatus for condensing air), and       I  was happily answered by Lord
                                                    " leyden " to denote a
Rayleigh with a proposal to use the word
generalised Leyden jar, which      I have gladly adopted.
   The apparatus to be described affords, in conjunction with a suit
able electrometer, a convenient means of quickly measuring small
electrostatic capacities, such as those of short lengths of cable.
   The instrument is formed by two mutually insulated metallic
pieces, which we shall call A and B, constituting the two systems of
an air condenser, or, as we shall now call it, an air leyden.          The
systems  are  composed   of  parallel plates,  each set  bound together by
four long metal bolts.      The two extreme plates of set A are circles
of much thicker metal than the rest, which are all squares of thin
                                    Fig. 1.

1892.]     and Measurement of Small Electrostatic Capacities.                7
sheet brass.    The set B are all squares, the bottom one of which is of
much thicker metal than the others, and the plates of this system
are one less in number than the plates of system A.             The four bolts
binding together the plates of each system pass through well-fitted
holes in the corners of the squares ; and the distance from plate to
plate of the same set is regulated by annular distance pieces which
are carefully made to fit the bolt, and are made exactly the same in
all respects.    Each system is bound firmly together by screwing
home nuts on the ends of the bolts, and thus the parallelism and
rigidity of the entire set is secured.
   The two systems are made up together, so that every plate of B is
between two plates of A, and every plate of A, except the two end
ones, which only present one face to those of the opposite set, is
between two plates of B.          When the instrument is set up for use,
the system B rests by means of the well-known " hole, slot, and plane
arrangement,"*     engraved on the under side of its bottom plate,
on three upwardly projecting glass columns which are attached to
three metal screws working through the sole plate of system A.
These screws can be raised or lowered at pleasure, and by means of
a gauge the plates of system B can be adjusted to exactly midway
between, and parallel to, the plates of system A.                The complete
leyden stands npon three vulcanite feet attached to the lower side of
 the sole plate of system A.
   In order that the instrument may not be injured in carriage, an
arrangement, described as follows, is provided by which system B
can be lifted from off the three glass columns and firmly clamped to
the top and bottom plates of system A.
   The bolts fixing the corners of the plates of system B are made
long enough to pass through wide conical holes cut in the top and
bottom plates of system A, and the nuts at the top end of the bolts
are also conical in form, while conical nuts are also fixed to their
lower ends below the base plate of system A. Thumbscrew nuts, /,
are placed upon the upper ends of the bolts after they pass through
the holes in the top plate of system A.
   When the instrument is set up ready for use these thumbscrews are
turned up against fixed stops, g, so as to be well clear of the top plate
of system A ; but when the instrument is packed for carriage they are
screwed down against the plate until the conical nuts mentioned
above are drawn up into the conical holes in the top and bottom
plates of system A ; system B is thus raised off the glass pillars, and
the two systems are securely locked together so as to prevent damage
to the instrument.
   A dust-tight cylindrical metal case, h, which can be easily taken off
for inspection, covers the two systems and fits on to a flange on

system    A.   The whole instrument, as said above, rests on three
 vulcanite legs attached to the base plate of system A ; and two
 terminals are provided, one, i, on the base of system A, and the
other, j, on the end of one of the corner bolts of system B.
   The air leyden which has been thus described is used as a standard
of electrostatic capacity.  In the instrument actually exhibited to the
Society there are twenty-two plates of the system B, twenty-three of
the system A, and therefore forty-four octagonal air spaces between
the two sets of plates.    The thickness of each of these air spaces is
approximately O301 of a centimetre.         The side of each square is
10'13 cm., and therefore the area of each octagonal air space is b5'l
sq. cm.    The capacity of the whole leyden is therefore approximately
•14X85-l/(47rX0-30]),or 990 cm. in electrostatic measure; or TlxlO-1"
c.g.s., electromagnetic measure; or 1"1 X 10-9 farads, or IT x 10-3 micro
farads.    This is only an approximate estimate founded on a not
minutely accurate measurement of dimensions, and not corrected for
the addition of capacity, due to the edges and projecting angles of
the squares and the metal cover.       I hope to have the capacity deter
mined with great accuracy by comparison with Mr. Glazebrook's
standards in Cambridge.
   To explain its use in connexion with an idiostatic electrometer for
the direct measurement of the capacity of any insulated conductor, I
shall suppose, for example, this insulated conductor to be the

insulated    wire of a short length of submarine cable core, or of
telephone, or telegraph, or electric light cable, sunk under water,
except a projecting portion to allow external connexion to be made
with the insulated wire.
   The electrometer which      I  find most convenient is my " multi
cellular voltmeter," rendered practically dead-beat by a disc under
oil hung on the lower end of the long stem carrying the electric
" needles "
              (or movable plates). In the multicellular voltmeter used
in the experimental illustration before the Royal Society, the index
shows its readings on a vertical cylindric surface, which for electric
light stations is more convenient than the horizontal scale of the
multicellular voltmeters hitherto in nse ; but for the measurement of
electrostatic capacity the older horizontal scale instrument is as con
venient as the new form.

electric machine, or even a stick of rubbed sealing-wax may, how
ever, be used, but not with the same facility for giving the amount
of electrification desired as the voltaic battery.
   One end of the voltaic battery is kept joined metallically to a wire,

 with the case C of the multicellular, and with the case and
plates A of the leyden, and with a fixed stnd, S, forming part of the
 operating key to be described later. The other end of the voltaic
 battery is connected to a flexible insulated wire, FFF, used for
                                                           J
 giving the primary electrification to the insulated wire of the cable,
 and the insulated cells     II  of the multicellular kept metallically
 connected with J.      The insulated plates, B, of the leyden are
 connected to a spring, KL, of the operating key referred to above,
 which, when left to itself, presses down on the metal stud S, and
 which is very perfectly insulated when lifted from contact with S by
 a finger applied to the insulating handle K.    A second well insulated
 stud, S', is kept in metallic connection with    J  and I (the insulated
 wire of the cable and the insulated cells of the multicellular).
    To make a measurement the flexible wire F is brought by hand to
 touch momentarily on a wire connected with the stud S', and imme
 diately after that a reading of the electrometer is taken and watched
 for a minute or two to test either that there is no sensible loss by
 imperfect insulation of the cable and the insulated cells of the multi
 cellular, or that the loss is not sufficiently rapid to vitiate the
 measurement.     When the operator is satisfied with this he records his
 reading of the electrometer, presses up the handle K of the key, and
 so disconnects the plates B of the leyden from S and A, and connects
 them with S', J, I. Fifteen or twenty seconds of time suffices to take
the thus diminished reading of the multicellular, and the measurement
is complete.
    The capacity of the cable is then found by the analogy : — As the
 excess of the first reading of the electrometer above the second is to
the second, so is the capacity of the leyden to the capacity of the
cable.
    The preceding statement describes the arrangement which is most
convenient when the capacity of the cable exceeds the capacity of the
leyden.    The plan which is most convenient in the other case, that is
to say, when the capacity of the cable is less than that of the leyden,
                                  J
is had by interchanging B and throughout the description. In this
case, a charge given to the leyden is divided between it and the cable.
The capacity of the cable is then found by the analogy: — As the
second reading of the electrometer is to the excess of the first above
the second, so is the capacity of the leyden to the capacity of the
cable.
   A small correction is readily   made with sufficient accuracy, for the
varying capacity of the electrometer, according to the different posi
tions of the movable plates, corresponding to the different readings,
by aid of a table of corrections determined by special measurements

       on Chemistry and Physics in St. Mary's Hospital Medical
       School. Received May 13, 1892.
    The experiments described in the previous five papers* have shown
inter alia that when the critical curves are delineated deduced with
lead (or bismuth) as heavier immiscible metal, zinc as lighter ditto,
and tin (or silver) as " solvent," the curves where bismuth is sub
stituted for lead lie inside, and those where silver is substituted for
 tin outside, the original curves ; and, further, that in certain cases the
formation of definite atomic compounds between particular pairs of
metals leads to marked results as regards the mutual relations of
the various pairs of conjugate points. Thus, silver and zinc form
the compounds AgZn5 and Ag4Zn„, with the result of producing
marked bulging (inwards or outwards) of the curves deduced with
these two metals associated with either lead or bismuth.                       Tin and
zinc appear to form the compound SnZru, with the result of causing a
peculiar convergence of the tie-lines when the proportions of metals
mixed together permit of the formation of lighter alloys containing
tin and zinc in approximately this ratio. Again, the alloys of lead,
zinc, and tin are remarkable in that the lower ties slope in one
direction, and the upper ones in the opposite direction ; and the
position where the angle of slope of the lower ties is greatest (which
is approximately the point where the excess of tin percentage in the
lighter alloy over that in the heavier one is a maximum) is situated
very near to that corresponding with a ratio of tin to lead in the
heavier alloy denoted by the formula SnPbj.
    The following experiments were made with mixtures of metals cor
responding with those previously described, excepting that aluminium
was substituted for zinc. One general result appears to be that this
substitution always causes the curve to lie outside of its former
position ; and another, that as aluminium does not appear to unite with
silver to form compounds analogous to AgZn6 and Ag4Zn6, the peculiar
bulges observed with silver-zinc-lead and silver-zinc-bismuth alloys
are not visible with silver-aluminium-lead                  and silver-aluminium-
bismuth alloys.
    These experiments were commenced about four years ago, at
which time moderately pure aluminium was not in the market in any
quantity; at least, a number of samples of metals prepared by

pounds of aluminium in the highest practicable state of purity ; but,
although several of these were stated to contain 98 to 99 per cent, of
aluminium and upwards, on analysis far greater amounts of impurity
than 1 or 2 per cent, were generally found to be present.                   Thus, ono

therein.
   In some cases, when the amount of aluminium in the upper alloy
¦was large and the other constituents small, the aluminium was taken
by difference, the percentages being corrected by means of the above
analysis to what they would hare been if reckoned on the sum of the
aluminium and the other two metals as 100. When, however, the
other constituents were present in larger quantity the aluminium was
directly determined, the alumina ultimately precipitated being col
lected and weighed, and the Si02 and Fe,03 present therein subse
quently determined and subtracted so as to obtain a corrected deter
mination of the aluminium ; the percentages were then reckoned on
the sum of the aluminium thus found and the other two metals as
100.    Thus, for example, an alloy of tin, lead, and aluminium was
found to contain 12'01 per cent, of tin and 1"71 per cent, of lead;
hence, reckoning the difference, 86-28 per cent., as aluminium, silicon,
and iron containing 95"81 per cent, of the first, the corrected ana

   On the other hand, an alloy of silver, aluminium, and lead was
found to contain the following percentages of these three metals

alumina after subtraction of silica and ferric oxide contained in the

    In the   case of the lighter alloys containing tin, aluminium, and
lead (or bismuth) with large percentages of tho first metal, it was
sometimes found that a notable amount of oxygen was absorbed by
the ingot whilst standing molten for eight hours, so that a per
 ceptible deficiency from 100 was observed when all the constituents
 were added together.          With silver-aluminium-lead and silver-
 aluminium-bismuth alloys this was not the case ; on the other hand,

                    Mixtures of Aluminium, Lead, and Tin.
    A number of ternary mixtures were prepared by melting alu
 minium, and then adding weighed quantities of lead and tin, and
 stirring vigorously.      A considerable amount of scoria? was usually
 formed, the lead partially oxidising, and the presence of the lead
                                         " flour "
 oxide formed causing the mass to                   considerably ; usually the
 molten portion was      run  off into an  ingot mould, and then re-melted,
 and when in the pasty stage preceding complete fusion rubbed
about in the bottom of the crucible with a hot fireclay pestle, so as to
promote intermixture.         Finally the temperature was raised, so as to
bring about complete fusion, and after more vigorous stirring the
 liquid metal was poured into red-hot narrow clay crucibles or test-
tubes, and maintained molten in a lead bath for seven to eight hours
in the manner previously described.            The temperature during this
period of tranquil fusion lay between 750° and 850°, and averaged
close upon 800°, as determined by the platinum                    specific heat
pyrometer (Part I).         No flux of any kind was used during the
previous meltings and stirrings, oxidation being diminished as far
as practicable by directing a current of coal gas into the crucible ;
notwithstanding a much larger amount of oxidation usually took
place than with metallic mixtures fused together with potassium
cyanide, as in the previous experiments.            The metal thus oxidised
was usually chiefly lead, the tin and aluminium present being com
paratively unaffected ; the uncertainty as to the amount of lead
thus removed in any given case prevented any accurate calculation
being made respecting the relative weights of the three metal a
present in the final compound ingot ultimately obtained ; the weight
of this was always considerably less than the joint weights of the
three metals originally used, partly through oxidation, but prin
cipally because the formation of oxide led to a copious amount of

" flonring " of the molten metal,       a considerable proportion       of the
alloys being reduced to minute particles that did not coalesce with
the rest of the molten mass, and remained in the crucible when the
fused metal was poured into tho clay test-tubes.         This same flouring
action was equally observed when bismuth was substituted for lead ;
 whilst with silver as solvent metal instead of tin it was still more
 marked ; frequently not more than three-quarters or two-thirds of
 the metals originally weighed up (40 to 50 grammes) were obtained
 as final compound ingot, and sometimes even less ; the deficiency
 varying according to the success or otherwise of attempts to exclude
 access of air whilst stirring.
    The analysis of the alloys thus prepared was carried out as
follows : — A weighed portion was dissolved in hydrochloric acid con
 taining a little nitric acid, and the solution largely diluted.
 Sulphuretted hydrogen in excess was then passed through, and the
 solution containing aluminium, &c, filtered off from the precipitated
 sulphides of tin and lead. These were then separated by sulphide
 of ammonium, and finally weighed as SnOa and PbS04 in the usual
 way. The filtrate was saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and
 allowed to stand two or three days to ensure the separation of the
 last traces of tin ; finally ammonia was added, and the precipitate
 collected, washed, and ignited. The weighed impure alumina was
 then redissolved by long boiling with hydrochloric acid, any silicic
 acid present separated by evaporation to dryness, &c, and the iron
 present estimated volumetrically.        It was found impracticable to
 obtain good results by treating the alloys with nitric acid alone, not
 only because alloys containing much aluminium are only attacked by
 that acid with great difficulty, but also because the tin as determined
 by weighing the undissolved SnOa was over-estimated to an unknown
 amount on account of the presence of silicon, partly left undissolved
as such, partly converted into silicic acid more or less retained by
 the tin oxide ; so that it was necesary to fuse the impure SnO, with
sulphur and sodium carbonate to convert into soluble sulpho-
stannate, to precipitate tin sulphide from the filtered aqueous solu
tion by acidulation, and ultimately to roast and weigh as SnOa.*
    The following corrected percentages (reckoned on tin + lead -f
aluminium = 100) were obtained from the examination of 25 com
pound ingots representing 50 alloys.       In the preparation of these the
lead and aluminium were originally weighed up in the proportion of
about 2"5 to 1 for the ingots containing smaller amounts of tin ; on
account of the low density of aluminium this resulted in the forma
tion of approximately equal volumes of heavier and lighter alloy
   • With aluminium-bismuth-tin alloys the SnOs undissolved by nitric acid also
retains bismuth left behind as sulphide on conversion into sulphostannate and
treatment with water (tide Part III).

formed in each case. With the mixtures yielding tbe upper tie-lines,
the proportions were altered successively to 1'5 to 1, and, finally, to
1 to 1, as the difference in density between the two alloys formed
diminished ; so as still to give rise to the formation of the two alloys
in approximately equal quantities by volume.                          It was found that
when lead and aluminium (without tin) were fused together, well
intermixed, and then allowed to stand molten at about 800° for some
hours, the lead retained, on an average, O07 per cent, of aluminium
dissolved, and the aluminium 1-91 per cent, of lead (mean of nine
experiments altogether).

 resemble zinc-tin-alloys         in that they furnish a critical curve, the

    This coincidence would seem to suggest that the peculiar disposi
tion of tie-lines with these two series of alloys (not observed with
any others) is due to the tendency       towards the formation of the
definite compound, SnPb3; on the other hand, in neither case is any
bulge inwards or outwards noticeable in the contour of the criticnl
curve at the part corresponding with this compound, such as is
observed in the case of the atomic compounds AgZn5 and AgtZn5.

 central point of that part of the curve where this tendency is mani
 fest (marked P in the figure) is that representing the composition
 tin = 49, lead = 6, aluminium = 45, which is close to that represented
 by the formula SnAL,, so far as the ratio between tin and aluminium
 is concerned.

    A series of mixtures of aluminium, bismuth, and tin was prepared
in just the same way ; the analysis of the ternary alloys formed was
carried out in precisely the same fashion, excepting that the bismuth
sulphide separated from tin sulphide was weighed ultimately as
Bij03 ; the results calculated on the sum of aluminium 4- bismuth +

                 Mixtures of Aluminium, Lead, and Silver.
   The foregoing     experiments  show   that no material  alteration  is
produced in the general characters of the critical curves for alloys
containing lead (or bismuth) and zinc as immiscible metals and tin
as solvent   metal, "when aluminium is substituted for zinc, excepting
that the curves are raised through the diminished solubility of the
two immiscible metals jointly in the solvent.     The following experi
ments show that a similar result follows when silver is substituted
for tin as solvent ; with the difference that, whereas bulges exist in
the lower parts of the critical curves when silver and zinc are simul
taneously present, owing to the formation of the definite compounds
AgZn5 and Ag4Zns (Part V.), no such bulges are noticeable when silver
and aluminium are employed ; suggesting either that corresponding
compounds of silver and aluminium are not formed at all ; or that, if
they are formed, they are more readily dissociated and broken up on
standing molten for seven or eight hours than is the case with the
silver-zinc compounds.
   A series of mixtures of aluminium, silver, and lead was prepared,
precisely as above described (the same aluminium being used), the only
difference being that, on account of the higher fusing point of some of
the alloys formed, the crucible in which the first fusion and inter
mixture took place was heated by a small Fletcher's blast gas furnace,
instead of a large Bunsen gas burner, provided with a clay jacket and
iron chimney, the heat from which, though sufficient for all the mix
tures previously described, was not always high enough to permit of
the less fusible highly argentiferous alloys being poured into the
clay test tubes cleanly, and without partly solidifying in the crucible
during the transference.       The temperature of the lead bath was
similarly   increased   by using differently arranged burners in such
fashion as to maintain a perceptibly higher temperature than any
hitherto used, ranging between 830° and upwards of 900°, and averag
ing about 870° or somewhat higher.
   For the lower ties (smaller silver percentages) the lead and alumin
ium were used in the proportions 2 to 1, so that the volumes of the
heavier and lighter alloys formed should not differ widely ; for the
upper ones increasing proportions of lead were found to be requisite
to bring about the same result, so that for the highest ties obtained
the lead and aluminium were originally used in the proportion 10 to 1.
Owing to oxidation of lead, however, the ratio of the quantities of
 the two metals present in the compound ingots finally obtained was
 perceptibly less than this, by an amount too variable to allow an
 average to be even approximately estimated.
    The analysis was made by dissolving in nitric acid and precipitating
 silver as chloride ; the filtrate was evaporated with excess of sulph

results being fiually calculated on the sum of silver + aluminium +
lead as 100.

that aluminium and silver do not form definite atomic compounds
analogous to AgtZn5 and AgZns on the one hand, or to AlSnj on the

the raising of the curve brought about by the substitution of lead

   Obviously no marked irregularity of contour is noticeable, nor
any change of direction of tie-lines, nor any tendency to converge

VI. " The Conditions of the Formation and Decomposition of
       Nitrous Acid." By V. H. Veley, M.A., University Museum,
       Oxford. Communicated by Professor Odling, F.R.S.                       Re
       ceived April 12, 1892.
                                   Introductory.
   Throughout the whole science of chemistry there is possibly no
reagent so frequently represented as taking part in various trans
formations, but of which so little definite is known, as nitrous acid.
In many text-books its properties are cursorily discussed in a few
Hues, while some writers have gone so far as to deny its existence
altogether even in the presence of nitric acid.           Among the commoner
examples    of  reactions  considered     to  be   effected by nitrous acid, it is
necessary only to mention the conversion of the primary paraffinoid
amines into the corresponding alcohols, the formation of nitroso- and
diazo-derivatives,     and the preparation of the fulminates.                In a
previous paper* it was my endeavour to prove that the solution of
certain metals in nitric acid was conditioned by the presence of
nitrous acid, and the cause of the chemical change explained on the
supposition that the acid is alternately formed and decomposed.
   As a fitting corollary to these investigations, it seemed worthy of
interest to examine to some extent the validity of this hypothesis by
endeavouring to imitate the reactions supposed to take place on
 solution of the metal, either when no metal is present, or when the
 metallic salt is either present or absent.
   The stability of nitrous acid in presence of nitric acid forms also a
 part of this research, and, conversely, the stability of nitric acid in
 absence of nitrous acid is discussed.
    In the present, as in my former, investigations, it will be under-

               Mr. V. H. Veley.        The Conditions  of the     [June 2,
stood that the term nitrous      acid is applied to that kind of matter
which decolorises potassium permanganate, liberates iodine from
potassium iodide, and gives various colour reactions with certain
organic bases.
         The Formation of Nitrous     Acid in Nitric Acid Solution.
    Nitrous acid is generally produced directly by the decomposition or
reduction of nitric acid effected (i) by heating the acid, (ii) by pass
ing nitric oxide or nitrous fumes into it, (iii) by electrolysis, or more
indirectly (iv) by addition of nitrogen peroxide to water, and (v) by
decomposition of metallic nitrites with acids.        The nature of these
several changes, their conditions, and the composition of the solutions
obtained form the main subjects of this investigation.
                          Tlie Metliods of Analysis.
    The following process was adopted for estimating the respective
amounts of nitrous and nitric acids in presence of one another ; the
total acidity was determined in the usual manner by means of
standard alkali, the nitrous acid by means of potassium permanga
nate ; from the factors thus obtained the amount of acidity due to
the nitric acid by itself could be readily calculated.        It was found
by experience not only in the present but also in previous investiga
tions that nitrous acid could not conveniently be estimated by the
addition of the permanganate solution until it is no longer decolor
ised, for the oxidation of the nitrous acid at the end of the operation
is gradual and not instantaneous.        This point does not seem to have
been noticed by    the  writers  on   quantitative analysis.   Accordingly
the method was modified as follows : — The solution of the nitrous
acid was added to such a quantity of the standard permanganate,
acidified with sulphuric acid, which was judged to be in slight excess
over that required to complete the oxidation, and the whole mixture
allowed to stand in stoppered bottles for half an hour.           The pink
liquid was then poured into potassium iodide solution, and the
 amount of iodine liberated by the excess of the permanganate deter
mined, as customary, by standard sodium thiosulphate solution.
 There was apparently no risk of any of the nitrous acid escaping
oxidation, and thus liberating iodine from the potassium iodide, if
the method was carried out as described.
    In order to test the accuracy of the process, some purified silver
 nitrite was recrystallised several times from water, a known quantity
 of it was weighed out, suspended in water, and decomposed by a
 slight excess of purified sodium chloride.         The amount of nitrous
 acid calculated as (N02) was determined in the solution, and for a
 test analysis the following may be cited : —

 1892.]       Formation and Decomposition of Nitrous Acid.                        29
      Amount of (N0a) in 1 c.c. calculated from
         the weighed quantity of silver nitrite
         taken                                                0 005963   gram.
      Amount of (NO,) in 1 c.c. found                         0 005974      „
The process is, therefore, accurate in this particular case to within
1 part in 600.      When smaller quantities of nitrous acid were to be
estimated,     the metaphenylenediamine method was adopted, the
coloration    produced being compared with a solution containing a
known quantity of nitrous acid by means of the form of tintometer
described in my former paper (vide supra).
                           The Stability of    Nitric Acid.
   It  seemed worthy of investigation to determine the actual tem
perature at which traces of nitrogen peroxide begin to be formed in
purified nitric acid of different degrees of concentration ; hitherto
only general statements are given in the text-books.*                   Samples of
acid of sp. gr. 1"5 and 1*4 respectively were purified by the method
of blowing a current of air at a temperature of 35°, and thus obtained
quite colourless; the latter was diluted (i) with its own volume, and
(ii) with three times its volume, of water. An acid of sp. gr. l-53
was prepared by distillation of recrystallised nitre with sulphuric
acid, and the reddish-yellow acid thus obtained was redistilled with
an equal bulk of sulphuric acid.             A number of attempts were made
to render this acid colourless by a current of air or carbonic acid,
but, notwithstanding several modifications, these proved unsuccessful.
Recourse was, therefore, had to distillation in vacuo in an apparatus
specially constructed of glass.
   The method of operation was as follows : — The slightly yellow acid
was placed in the distillation flask, and the receiver kept cooled by a
freezing mixture ; at a temperature of 45°, and under a pressure of
15 mm., the acid passed over without any visible ebullition.                    After
one-third of the liquid had been condensed, the receiver was changed,
and the remainder distilled over ; the first portions contained a
greater part of the nitrogen peroxide.                 The second distillate was
then redistilled     in  the  same   manner,    and   thus  a perfectly colourless
liquid was obtained (sp.gr. 0/0 = l-541)f containing only 0-011 milli-
   * Carius (' Ber. Deut. Chem. Gtes.,' 1870, p. 690) states that when pure nitric
acid of sp. gr. 1"51 is heated in sealed tubes to a temperature of 150° and upwards,
                                                                        " nitrous acid

gas j" above 250° the liquid contains such an abundance of nitrous acid that it
gives a blue colour on addition of a small quantity of water, and on further dilution
nitric oxide is evolved. Accordingly, the decomposition of the acid under these
conditions is expressible by the equation 2HX03 = Ns03 + 02 + II20.

     For each experiment 10 c.c. of the acid were placed in a small piece
 of combustion tnbing, which had previously been cleansed by being
 filled with concentrated nitric acid and allowed to stand for several
 hours, generally over night.            The tubes were then rinsed several
 times with water, and finally with water redistilled from potassium
 permanganate. It was hoped that by this method all reducing sub
 stances might be completely destroyed.                After introduction of the
 acid the tubes were quickly sealed up and then heated to various
 temperatures in water or paraffin baths.             The experiments were con

 for them, as concentrated nitric acid is decomposed by direct sunlight.

successful than the air (or carbonic acid) current method, usually described in the
text books, when acids of specific gravity greater than 1*5 are required perfectly
colourless.
    The distillation method, however, presents one of two alternate difficulties : on
the one hand, in each repetition of tho distillation the proportion of nitrogen per
oxide is decreased, on the other, that of the water is increased.

present in the most concentrated acid is doubled by heating under the

      It   is manifest from the figures given in the tables above that
  sample No.     I  was decomposed to some extent at 58°, and to a greater
   degree at 100°, sample No.       II  at 120°, sample No.    Ill at 155", and very
  rapidly     at 195°, sample No. IV at 195°, while the most dilate acid
  remained practically unaltered throughout.                 It would also appear
  that, provided every care be taken to eliminate reducing substances,
  especially of an organic character, and provided also that the acids
  ore not unduly exposed to sunlight, nitric acid is more stable than
  former experience indicated. It would be an interesting subject of
  enquiry to ascertain as to whether nitric acid is affected by shocks,
 as   I  have found that samples of acid purified so as to be practically
 free from nitrous acid were contaminated with that impurity after a
 railway journey.
         Formation of Nitrous Acid from Nitric Oxide and Nitric Acid.
     It  is a common matter of observation that when             nitric oxide gas is
 passed into nitric acid a greenish-blue solution is produced, which
 shows all the reactions of nitrous acid ; some writers, however, con
 sider that the nitric oxide gas is only dissolved as such in the nitric
 acid in that, when the liquid is warmed, the gas is again evolved.               It
 is more probable that nitrous acid is formed and subsequently decom
 posed, changes represented by the following equations : —
                        (I.) 2NO   + HN03 + H20 = 3HN02.
                       (II.) 3HN02 = 2NO + HN03+HsO.
     Clemente Montemartini* has proved that of these changes the
 latter proceed quantitatively, at least in dilute solution, in accordance
with the equation given.
    If these changes are strictly reversible, it would follow as a
necessary consequence that there would be a limit to the amount of
the nitrous acid produced, and this limit would be dependent upon
conditions such as concentration of acid and temperature. The equa
tion for equilibrium will be
                                   pjq = constant,
wherein p is the mass of nitric acid, and q is the mass of nitrous
acid, for when the limit is reached the amounts of nitric oxide gas
passing in and out would be identical, while the alteration of the
mass of water would be immaterial.
    On the other hand, if the phenomenon is merely that of solution,
the amount of nitric oxide gas dissolved should, other conditions
remaining the same, diminish under all circumstances as the temper
ature increases.

   To decide between these views, and to detormine the limit,
whether of nitrons acid formed or of nitric oxide dissolved, as the
case might be, a series of experiments were conducted in the follow
ing manner.
   Nitric acid was passed through an apparatus consisting of (1) a
wash-bottle containing soda ; (2) a set of Liebig's bulbs ; and (3) a
set of Geissler's bulbs both filled with nitric acid of the same con
centration, the latter of which was used for the analytical deter
minations ; and (4) a wash-bottle containing soda to prevent any
nitrous fumes, produced by the passage of the unaltered nitric oxide
into the air, from accidentally coming in contact with the acid experi
mented upon.        In these and succeeding experiments the apparatus
consisted wholly of glass, except for small pieces of rnbber tubing
which served for connections ; these were frequently renewed. Before
the nitric oxide was passed, the whole apparatus was filled with
hydrogen, my previous experiments having shown that this gas, when
ready-made, does not reduce nitric acid, but even mechanically blows
off any slight impurity of nitrous acid.            At the end of the operation
the Geissler's bulbs were quickly detached, and the acid blown out by
a rapid stream of carbonic acid.         While the experiment was proceed
ing the bulbs were kept in a water-bath, the temperature of which
was carefully regulated ; the passage of the nitric oxide was kept as
 uniform as possible.
    The following table contains the results of the first set of experi
ments ; not only of the actual amounts of nitric acid, and of nitrous
 acid, i.e., the reducing power, are given, but also of the percentage
amounts of these acids, taking the total acidity as 100 : —

    These result* show that the phenomenon, whether of reaction or
 of solution, was complete at the end of the first interval of time ; but,
 taken by themselves, they would not suffice to distinguish under

   It will  be evident from the above          experiments that the ratio of
nitrous to nitric acid increases slightly with rise of temperature up
to 32", but from this point it decreases so that the values at 9" and 42°
are nearly identical.
   These results, in the case of acid of the concentration used, would
seem to indicate that the phenomenon is not entirely one of solution,
but partly also of reversible chemical changes, the difference in their
relative intensities being greatest at or about 32°, and least at 52°, a
temperature at which nitrous acid by itself would be very rapidly
decomposed.      These results were also confirmed by experiments con
ducted with a sample of acid of half the concentration of that used
above.

    The liquids obtained in the experiments detailed %bove were of a
 blue tint, but it was also observed that in the case of the more con
 centrated acids red fumes were evolved to a slight extent, thus
 showing under these conditions a more complex reaction than the
 simple reversible change given above.             It is also to be noticed that
 the sum of the quantities of nitrous and nitric acids found are less
 than the quantity of nitric acid originally taken, thus showing that
 some unaccounted-for destruction of the acid had taken place.                       In »

   In the above series of experiments, when the nitric oxide gas was
first passed in a yellow colour was produced, but this speedily changed
into a deep green tint. It thus appeared that nitrogen peroxide was
at first produced and this was converted, possibly by the nitric oxide
and possibly, also, by the water present, into the green acid which
certain writers have considered to have the composition N203.Na03.HjO ;

   such an acid, however, would contain nearly 50 per cent, of nitrons
   acid.
       After most of the experimental work above detailed had been per
   formed, a paper appeared by F. Marchlewski,*                        entitled " Znr
   Kenntniss der verschiedenen Farbungen der Salpetcrsiiure," in which
   the anthor describes various experiments upon the reaction between
   nitric oxide and nitric acid. The main object of the paper was to
   determine the composition of the various coloured liquids produced
   when nitric oxide, nitrous fumes, and nitrogen peroxide are passed
   into nitric acid of different concentration. The method employed
   consisted in preparing such liquids and then decolorising them by a
   current of carbonic anhydride ; the gases evolved were passed into
   sulphuric acid and the solution subjected to analysis. The process is
   based upon the observations of Lunge that nitrous fumes give under
  these conditions nitrosyl sulphuric acid, while nitrogen peroxide
  gives a mixture of nitrosyl sulphuric and nitric acids, thus : —
                  (I.) 2HaS01 + NaOa      = 2SOJ.NO,.OH + HaO.
                (II.) H,SOt+N,04 = SO,.NO,.OH + HN03.
      It  might appear open to question whether the composition of these
  liquids can be ascertained by this indirect method, and whether a
  liquid apparently decolorised contains nothing but the residual nitric
  acid (more or less diluted) of the operation. My own experience has
 shown that it is extremely difficult to remove the last traces of the
 yellow colour from the more concentrated acids ; though, on the other
 hand, it must be allowed that the method of analysis adopted in tlie
 text would not distinguish between nitrous acid on the one hand and
 nitrogen peroxide on the other, the latter of which would appear in
 the course of analysis as an equimolecular mixture of nitrous and
 nitric acids. These remarks would, however, apply probably only to
 the two last series of experiments.             Marchlewski gives no observa
 tions of time, temperatnre, or degree of humidity of gase?, whether
 oxides of nitrogen or carbonic anhydride, nor a single control
 analysis of the residual nitric acid.             Some proof is given that the
 difference      between   the  green    and  blue  acids is dependent upon not
only the water present but also upon the dissolved nitric oxide.
Marchlewski seems to be quite unaware of the observations of
Peligot.t made nearly forty years ago, upon the same subject.

40                  Mr. V. H. Veley.      The Conditions      of the        [June   2,
    Certain experiments were made upon the action of dry nitric
oxide upon nearly anhydrous nitric acid (sp. gr. 7/7° = 1"5326), the
preparation of which has been described in a previous section.                    The
air was driven out of the apparatus by a current of carbonic acid
dried by passage through a wash-bottle containing concentrated
sulphuric acid, and then through three drying tubes filled with
pumice and phosphorus pentoxide.              The nitric acid was contained in
the Geissler's bulbs as before (kept at a temperature of 11°), and
subsequent to them was another wash-bottle of sulphuric acid to pre
vent the access of moisture by backward diffusion.
    On passage of the nitric oxide gas, the portion of acid in the first
bulb was turned a yellow tint, which gradually deepened to an orange-
red ; when about a litre of the gas had been driven through a red
oil appeared floating upon the surface of the acid, and a few minutes
after the red oil turned a green tint, and for some time there were
two distinct liquids of different densities in the bulb, but afterwards
a green uniform liquid was obtained.             Meanwhile the portion of acid
in the second bulb had deepened in tint, then the red oil was formed,
and the other phenomena in due succession.               (The weight of the acid
at this point had increased.) When about 4 litres of nitric oxide had
passed in the green liquid in the first bulb gradually turned to a
blue, which slowly evaporated into the second bulb, and eventually
only a few drops of an almost colourless liquid were left. Simul
taneously the portion of acid in the third bulb showed the transition
tints of yellow to orange with ultimate formation of the red oil, and
also dense red fumes passed out of the acid.                At this point the ex
periment was stopped, and the weight of the nitric acid was found to
have considerably decreased.
    The explanation of these changes, which were observed in part
by Priestley* at the end of the last century, seems to be as follows : —
At first nitrogen peroxide is formed by the mutual oxidation of the
nitric oxide and reduction of the nitric acid, and this is retained in
solution by the excess of the acid
                          2HN03+2NO = 3N,04 + 2H,0.

excess   of the peroxide separates out (the red oil). According to
the experiments of Peligot, nitric oxide passed into this gives a
green liquid.     The absorption and retention of the nitrogen per
oxide accounts for the gain in weight (about one-sixth) of the acid.
The reduction then proceeds further, and nitrous acid (the blue
liquid) is produced, thus : —
                     Sr,0«+2N04-2H,0 = 4HN02,
and this is evaporated by the continued current of the nitric oxide,
leaving finally only the water originally present, both free and com
bined, in the nitric acid. This destruction of the nitric acid accounts
for the loss in weight. As Priestley wrote : " Towards the end of the
process (of absorption of nitrous air by pale-yellow spirit of nitre),
the evaporation of the acid was perceived to be very great, and when
I  took it out the quantity was found to be diminished by one-half.
Also, it had become, by means of the process and evaporation
together, exceedingly weak, and was rather blue than green."
    Reaction between Nitric Oxide and Mercuric Nitrate in Nitric Acid
                                    Solution.
    In my former paper* it was shown that when a current of hydro
gen was passed through a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric
acid solution, the mercuric was reduced to a mercurous salt with
out any considerable formation of nitrons acid, which was, however,
prodnced in abundance when cupric nitrate was subjected to the
same action.      As it seemed probable that the nitrons acid which
might have been produced in the former operation was in reality used
up in the reduction of the mercuric salt, the experiment was re
peated in precisely similar manner, nitric oxide being substituted
for hydrogen. It was found, as before, that the mercuric salt was
reduced ; from 0'5 gram mercuric oxide dissolved in nitric acid
 (1 c.c. containing 0'2.t)49 gram acid) after passage of nitric oxide
for 3§ hours at a temperature of 35°, 0'019 gram of mercurous
chloride was obtained, while from a similar portion, through
 which the nitric oxide had not been passed, 0"0018 gram was pre
cipitated.    It is probable, then, that the hydrogen in the former
experiments reduced at first the free nitric into nitrous acid, which
in its turn reduced the mercuric nitrate, thus : —
               2ffg(N03)2-r2HN02 = Hg,(NO,)»+2HNO,.
No free nitrons acid would therefore appear in the course of the
operation.

                            Summary of Results.
   I.  The reaction between nitric oxide and nitric acid varies with
the concentration of the acid and the temperature ; with more con
centrated acids nitrogen peroxide is at first formed and then nitrons
acid ; with less concentrated acids the latter is produced at once.
   II. Only with quite dilute acids (of 30 per cent, concentration and
below) does the reaction between the nitric oxide and nitric acid
appear to be reversible ; the average value for pjq = 9 (p = quantity
of nitric, q of nitrous, acid), though the actual value varies from
3 to 4 per cent, on either side, according to the conditions of the ex
periment.
   III. With more dilute acids the amount of nitrous acid formed at
first increases slightly and then decreases with the temperature ; but
with more concentrated acids the amount uniformly decreases.
   IV. The proportional quantity of nitrous acid formed increases
with decrease of concentration, but the actual quantity is of conrse
less.
   It would appear that the simple reversible reaction between nitric
oxide and nitric acid becomes modified with acids above a concentra
tion of about 30 per cent, and a temperature of 32°. These were also
approximately the limits of concentration and temperature, above
which the reactions between metals and nitric acid could not bo
prevented by substances such as urea, potassium chlorate, and the
like. I will, however, merely allude to the point without wishing to
lay an undue stress npon possibly nothing but chance coincidences.
                The Bate of Decomposition of Nitrous Acid.
   The velocity of the decomposition of nitrous acid, presumably in
nitric acid solution, has been made the snbject of a previous investi
gation by Clemente Montemartini (vide supra).                 As a result of
several series of experiments this writer considers that the rate of
this decomposition may be expressed by the differential equation
                                                     *
               (I.)g    =  feC    or    (II.) k=        log-g?,
in which C is the concentration, T the time, and & is a constant.
   This equation will be discussed in the sequel. My experiments
were commenced primarily with a view of ascertaining if nitrous acid
is the more stable the greater the proportion of nitric acid present,
a point which was raised in the conrse of niy investigations on the
reactions of nitric acid and metals.       Further, it seemed probable that
the presence of metallic salts might also affect the stability of nitrons
acid, as Armstrong and Acworth* allude to the persistence with

which the nitrons acid ia retained by solutions containing the products
of the reaction between nitric acid and metals.         It also seemed
possible that snch a line of inquiry might throw some light upon the
nature of an acid intermediate between nitrous and nitric acids, in
whose existence certain writers believe, though the facts adduced at
present are perhaps hardly sufficient to warrant such a belief.
   The apparatus and method of experiment finally adopted were as
follows : — The nitrous acid solution was placed in a cylindrical tube
containing 100 c.c. up to a certain mark ; at its upper end were two
apertures, into one of which was sealed a glass delivery tube, while
the other could be wholly or partially closed by a small rubber plug
through which passed a pipette of exactly 2 c.c. capacity. The
former, which served for the passage of a stream of carbonic acid,
was sealed off at its lower end, the gas passing through a small pin
hole at the side, and thus not directly impinging upon the liquid ;
the space between the loosely-fitting plug and the glass wall serving
for its exit. At the end of certain intervals of time the plug wa.s
rammed in, whereby the pressure of the gas forced the liquid up the
pipette ; when this was filled up to the graduation mark the sample
was removed for analysis, while the aperture of the cylindrical tube
was partly closed meanwhile by a duplicate plug. The cylinder was
immersed in a water-bath, ihe temperature of which was kept
constant to within one-tenth of a degree on either side of that
required.    Before any observations were made the ratio of nitrous to
nitric acid present was determined.
         Nitrous Acid from Silver Nitrite and Hydrochloric Acid.
   The solution of nitrous acid was prepared in the usual manner by
the decomposition of recrystallised silver nitrite with a slight defi
ciency of hydrochloric acid, and the liquid filtered from the precipi
tated silver chloride into the decomposition flask. The amount of
nitrous acid was determined at the end of fixed intervals of time,
generally half an hour, and the results calculated on the hypothesis
that the volume of the liquid was maintained constant throughout
the course of the experiment.
   In the following table the results obtained are set forth, in which

  The greatest difference   occurs in the third value, which is rather
less than 2 per cent., which can readily be accounted for by errors of
experiment in dealing with a substance so susceptible of decomposi
tion as nitrous acid.  The curve which represents the concentration
of the acid in terms of time is a portion of a hyperbola, the differential
equation of which is
                                dC
                                dT              M'
which expresses the rate at which equivalent masses react, whether
it be of the nitric with the nitrous acid, or the nitrous acid with
itself; in each experiment 1/M is the amount of each unit mass
which reacts with the other per unit time when an unit mass of each
substance is present.
    If Clemente Montemartini's equation dcjdl = kC is correct, there
should be two reacting substances, one of constant concentration
throughout the reaction.      It      is,
                                     however, to be observed that the
values given for the constant        in his results differ widely among
                                       fe
themselves, often as much as 25 per cent, between the maximum and
minimum.       Further, all the results in each set of experiments are
referred to the first, the C0 of equation (ii), though there           no             is
especial reason that this analytical determination should be more
exact than those subsequent to it. With the general purport, how
 ever, of Montemartini's paper cannot but completely agree, namely,
                                 I
 that the rate of decomposition of nitrous acid      dependent upon the
                                                                  is
 tension of the superincumbent nitric oxide, without, however, neces
 sarily committing oneself to the view that herein presented       " trueis       a
 case of dissociation."
     It is worthy of remark that the curve representing the decomposi
 tion of nitrous acid  is  exactly identical with that of   previous case     a
 of chemical change investigated by myself, namely, the decomposition
 of formic acid into carbonic oxide and water,* in which the method of
 observation was precisely the reverse of that adopted in this research.
  For, herein, the concentration       determined at equal intervals of
                                         is
  time, but in the previous case observations were made of the times
  required for equal diminution of concentration. The results of other
  series of experiments are given below, the observed and calculated
 values for the concentration of the nitrous acid being compared in
 each instance.

   In all the above series of experiments the observed and calculated
results are as nearly approximate as can be expected, considering the
great instability of the nitrons acid, which is appreciably decomposing
even in the brief interval of time required for the transference of the
solution from the decomposition flask into the potassium permangan
ate.   In the last series of experiments quoted above, in which a
considerable proportion of nitric acid was purposely introduced, it is
to be noticed that the rate of decomposition is decreased, even though
the mass of nitrous acid originally present was greater, which should
of course produce an exactly opposite result. This would, therefore,
seem to indicate that nitrous acid is more stable in the presence of
excess of nitric acid.

    The curve representing the course of decomposition of the nitrous
 acid obtained by this method is precisely identical with that of the
 nitrons acid from the silver nitrite ; though the rate of decomposition
 is somewhat diminished. For if the series above be compared with
 Series XXV, which lasted for the same duration of time, yet though
 the mass undergoing change was nearly twice as great, and the tem

   On a comparison of the results set forth in the three preceding
series of experiments, it appears that the velocity of decomposition of
nitrous acid is an exponential function of the temperature, the former

increasing in geometrical as the latter increases in arithmetical                     pro
portion. This relation may be expressed by the equation
that is to    say, the difference of the logarithms of the amounts of
nitrons acid decomposed at the end of a given interval of time will be
constant for a constant difference of temperature. This is rendered
evident by the following comparison : —

    The rate of chemical decomposition of the nitrous acid is therefore
 practically doubled for every 20°, which would give a constant
logarithmic difference of 0'0151 for every degree. In this respect
 this change resembles another, otherwise totally different from it,
 namely, that between marble and hydrochloric acid,* which varies by
 a like amount for equal differences of temperature. This relation is
 also exemplified by another pair of experiments in which 20 c.c. of
 nitric acid through which nitric oxide gas had been passed were
 made with water up to a constant volume of 100 c.o.

    The greatest difference      between the observed and calculated results
 is shown     in the first two experiments, but this can in part       be accounted
 for by the     difficulty experienced in introducing the nitrous acid solu
 tion into the permanganate before that some of the liquid was pro
 jected from the measuring vessel by the rapidly evolved nitric oxide
 Ras.   The above three series of experiments show that whether the
 nitrous acid, produced from nitrogen peroxide and water, is of p.
  concentration of 0-45 per cent., or five times that amount, the rate of
                                                                           s 2

                Nitrons Acid from Nitrous Fumes and Water.
   When      nitrous fumes, from arsenious oxide and nitric acid, are
passed into water at ordinary temperatures of 12 — 15°, their absorp
tion is apparently very incomplete ; a liquid is obtained nearly colour
less, and containing 1 to 2 per cent, of free nitrous acid.                     This
solution gives off bubbles of gas very freely, especially when poured
from one vessel to another, thus calling to mind the behaviour of
solutions of hydrogen peroxide. This very rapid evolution of gas
introduced, as explained above, unavoidable errors in the method of
experiment adopted ; there is therefore not so complete an accordance
between the observed and calculated values as in the other series of
experiments.

    It  follows, therefore, from the experiments the details of which
are given above, that solutions containing both nitrous and nitric
acids, whether prepared from silver nitrite and hydrochloric acid, or
from nitric oxide and nitric acid, or from nitrogen peroxide and
 water, or from nitrous fumes and water, have this one property in
 common, that the diminution              of reducing material, presumably
 nitrous acid, therein contained, proceeds in accordance with the same
 law. The velocity of the change seems, however, to be dependent
 rather upon the ratio of nitrous to nitric acid than upon the actual
 masses of either of them.         But though these solutions have this one
 point   in   common,   yet  in  other   respects they differ most markedly.
 For bubbles of gas, namely nitric oxide, are rapidly given off from
 solutions prepared from nitrogen peroxide and nitrous fumes, and to
a less degree from silver nitrite, though solutions from nitric oxide
and nitric acid do not give off bubbles of gas in a similar manner.
 Again, all my former investigations* have shown that, whereas
 metallic lead does not readily dissolve in solutions containing nitrous
acid, and prepared from silver nitrite, yet it dissolves very rapidly in
solutions equally containing nitrous acid, but prepared from nitrogen
peroxide and water.        The cause for the similarity on the one hand,
and the dissimilarity on the other, must remain the subject of a fuller
enquiry.
                               General Conclusions.
    The main points of this enquiry may briefly                be    summarised     as
follows : —

 54         Formation and Decomposition      of Nitrom Acid.    [June   2,
    (i.) The formation of the impurity of nitrogen peroxide in nitric
 acid, imparting to it the well-known yellow tint, takes place in the
 case of the more concentrated acid, even at a temperature of 30°, and
 of the less concentrated acids at from 100 — 150°, even when the
 acid is not unduly exposed to sunlight.
    (ii.) The reaction between nitric oxide and nitric acid may be
regarded as reversible, thus : —
                     2NO + HN03 + H20           3HNO„
provided that the acid be sufficiently dilute, and the temperature
sufficiently low. Under these conditions equilibrium is established
between the masses of nitric acids when the ratio of the former to
the latter is, roughly speaking, as 9 : 1.       The actual ratio varies
slightly on the one side or the other, according to the conditions of
the experiments.      With more concentrated acids and at higher
temperatures    the chemical   changes taking place are more compli
cated, and the decomposition of the acid more profound.
   (iii.) The decomposition of solutions containing both nitric and
nitrous acids is also investigated ; the rate of the change is shown to
be proportional to the mass of the nitrous acid undergoing change.
The curve representing the amount of chemical decomposition in
terms of the mass present is shown to be hyperbolic, and illustrative
of the law

This holds good, whatever be the method employed for the produc
tion of the nitrous-nitric acid solution.
   The observed values for C or the concentration of the nitrous acid
are concordant with those calculated according to the above differ
ential equation within the limits of experimental error.
   The rate is dependent upon the ratio of the masses of the nitrous
and nitric acid, being the more rapid, the greater the proportion of
the furmer to that of the latter.
   In the particular case of the liquid prepared from nitric oxide and
nitric acid, wherein the reproduction of solutions of similar concen
tration presents less difficulty, it is shown that as the temperature
increases in arithmetical the rate of change increases in geometrical
proportion, in accordance with the equation

the value for k being 0O158.
   Finally, though the nitrous-nitric  acid solutions behave in a similar
manner as regards the diminution of the mass of the nitrous acid,
yer, in other respects, such as evolution of gases and the action upon
metals, they are dissimilar.

VII. " On      the   Theory of Electrodynamics, as affected by the
        Nature of the Mechanical Stresses in Excited Dielectrics."
        By J. Larmor, M.A., Fellow of St. John's College, Cam
        bridge. Communicated by Professor J. J. THOMSON, F.R.S.
        Received April 25, 1892.
     1. A   theory of electrodynamics was first precisely developed by
Maxwell,      which based the phenomena on Faraday's view of the
play of elasticity in a medium, instead of the conception of action at
 a distance, by means of which the mathematical laws had been
primarily evolved.        The electromotive equations of Maxwell how
 ever involve nothing directly of the elastic structure of this medium,
 which remains wholly in the background. They involve simply the
assumption of a displacement across dielectrics with such properties
 as to make all electric currents circuital ; all the equations of Ampere
 and Neumann for closed or circuital currents have then a universal
 validity, and no further hypothesis is required for the full develop
 ment of the subject.
     The theory was next discussed by Helmholtz in his memoirs on
 electrodynamics, in a way which took direct advantage of the picture of
 a polarised dielectric supplied by Mossotti's adaptation of the Poisson
 theory of induced -magnetisation.           Stated absolutely, this simply
 builds upon the assumption that at ecah point in the excited di
 electric there is something which has the properties of a current
 element (electric transfer or displacement), which is represented both
 in direction and magnitude by the electric force at the point multi
 plied by a constant factor; no more general starting point seems
 possible for an isotropic dielectric. The development of this hypo
 thesis, exactly on the analogy of a similar discussion with the
 Poisson-Mossotti phraseology in a previous paper,* leads to the
 necessity of recognising the existence of absolute electric charges on
 the faces of an excited condenser ; so that the exciting current causes
 the accumulation of these charges, and therefore is not circuital or
 solenoidal.      This defect of circuital character however practically
  disappears   in the limiting case when the constant ratio of the polar
  isation to the electric force is extremely great ; and then the theory
  becomes a concrete illustration of the general statements of Maxwell
  with respect to electric displacement.

56          Mr.  J.  Larmor.      Theory of Electrodynamics,          [June 2,
   It  was shown    in the paper above referred to that this hypothesis,
adopted by Helmholtz, led by itself — without any necessity for further
assumptions which its author introduced on various grounds — to the
nndulatory propagation of electromotive disturbances across dielectric
media, with the same transverse type of waves as constitute light.
There will usually be, in addition, a disturbance of a juasi-compres-
sional character, which, on the more special hypothesis of Helmholtz,
is also propagated as a wave of permanent type, but with different
velocity. The electric undulations of transverse type have been
detected by Hertz ; and the balance of evidence, from the experiments
of different authors, seems to point to the conclusion that their
velocities in different media are inversely as the square roots of
the specific inductive capacities.       Should this be fully verified, it
would follow demonstratively that the Helmholtz hypothesis must be
restricted to the special form which represents the Maxwell displace
ment theory; and the general equations of electrodynamics, or rather
the electromotive part of them, will be definitely established.
    2. The object here proposed is to pass on from the electromotive
to the ponderomotive properties of the electric field, and examine
whether the latter lend any strength to the conclusions derived from
the former.     Instead of a kinetic phenomenon like undulatory propa
gation, we shall now consider the static phenomena of the stress
produced in the material of a dielectric by its excitation ; and, to
avoid the complexity, both optical and mechanical, introduced by the
 elasticity of solids, we shall consider solely liquid dielectrics, on
 which a very valuable series of experiments has been made by
 Quincke.*     The mechanical stress in a fluid depends on one variable,
 the intensity of the hydrostatic pressure, and therefore may be con
 nected immediately with the distribution of the energy in the medium,
 by means of the principle of work.
    The arguments for the actual existence of a stress of the Maxwell
 type may be exhibited in a synthetical manner as follows : — Consider
 a condenser formed by two closed conducting sheets, one inside the
 other; and imagine the equipotential surfaces to be traced in the
 excited fluid dielectric between them.        It is a matter of experimental
 knowledge that there is a traction on each face, acting inwards, and
 equal, at any rate approximately, to KF'/8?r per unit surface, where
 F is the electric force. Now the electric potential and therefore the
 state of the dielectric fluid, will be in no wise altered if we imagine a
 very thin stratum along one of the equipotential closed surfaces to
 become conducting.        There will therefore be a normal traction given
 by the same formula, on each element of area of this surface.            If this
 traction  is an  affair  transmitted across the    medium,    the transmitting
 stress must be a tension KIP/Sb- along the lines of force.          To form an

opinion as to whether a medium transmitting stress in this way could
be imagined, let us suppose the dielectric divided into thin layers,
like those of an onion, by much thinner         conducting sheets, which
coincide with the equipotential surfaces.         The potential will not
thereby  be  altered   ;  we

equal and opposite charges will reside on the portions of the two
faces of each sheet intercepted by it.    The layers of dielectric will be
electrically independent of each other, being separated by conducting
layers.  Each dielectric layer will, therefore, form       condenser, and a
the energy of its electrification per unit surface will be K(£V)2/8xf, or
KPf/Ssr, where     t   the thickness at the point, and iV the difference

in  the medium must be symmetrical round the lines of force, and
deduce, by the condition of internal equilibrium, that the tension and
pressure of which       must thus consist are equal. A spherical system

discrepancy between these values might, perliaps, be amenable to
experiment ; but I find, on trial, that the difficulty of obtaining a
clean unelectrified surface is not easily overcome.
    The observation of Faraday, that short filaments of silk or other
dielectric material suspended in a fluid dielectric set themselves
along the lines of force when it is excited, is also evidence of actual
internal polarisation related to the lines of force.
    For the case of a fluid, the Faraday-Maxwell stress is made up of a
hydrostatic pressure, KF2/8jt, which is consistent with simple fluidity,
together with a tension KF*/47r along the lines of force, which
requires for its maintenance qualities other than those of isotropic
mechanical fluidity.
     3. The polarisation theory, in the form of Mossotti and Helmholtz,
which locates part of the electrification in a displacement existing in
the elements of the dielectric, and part of it in an absolute electric
charge situated on the plates of the condenser the cause of that dis
placement, is the representation of a wider theory which supposes
the electrostatic energy to be in part distributed through the di
electric as a volume density of energy, and in part over the plates as
a surface density.      If experiment show that the latter part is null,
 we are precluded from imagining any superficial chauge on the
plates which has a separate existence, and is not merely the aspect
 at one end of the displacement across the volume of the dielectric.
 We shall find reason to conclude that there is no superficial part in
the distribution of energy; this would carry the result that the ex
 citation of a condenser consists in prodncing a displacement across
 the dielectric which just neutralises the charge conducted to the
 plates ; it would also carry the result that all currents, whether in
 conductors or in dielectrics, must flow in complete circuits, and
 would therefore confirm the Maxwell theory of electrodynamics.
     The conclusion that the location of all the electrostatic energy in
 the dielectrics involves that all currents flow in complete circuits
 Beeni8 of importance sufficient to justify a few remarks on the nature
 of the evidence on which it is based. The only precise notion or
 illustration of the nature of the dielectric polarisation which has yet
 been advanced is that of Poisson, which has been at various times
 used and developed by Mossotti, Faraday, Thomson, and Helmholtz.
  It might be held merely on general grounds that it gives a correct

1892.]          as affected, by Stresses   in Excited Dielectrics.   59
 formal view of the phenomenon, though the dynamical machinery of
 which it represents the action is quite unknown.      But this presump
 tion is very much strengthened by the fact that the displacement or
 polarisation is known to present qualitatively the properties of a true
 current, and also that the theory of dielectric propagation developed
 from this basis presents all the general analogies to light propagation
 that have been experimentally confirmed by Hertz and others.
 Taking it then that dielectric polarisation is formally of this type,
the absence of a sensible absolute exciting charge on the bounding
plates will show that it must be, so to speak, self-excited, that it is
of the formal character of a displacement, of something pushed across
from one plate towards the other like an incompressible substance.
    4. Let us confine our attention for definiteness to the case of two
metallic plates immersed horizontally near together in an extended
mass of a fluid dielectric, so as to form a condenser.    The traction T
per unit area on the upper plate may by this arrangement be directly
weighed. Suppose that there is a small aperture in the centre of the
upper plate through which a volume of a different dielectric, say, a
bubble of air, may be introduced between the platps, so as to form a
flat cylinder co-axial with the plates and bounded above and below
by them. The extra pressure P in this air bubble, when the con
denser is excited, may be measured by a manometer in connexion
 with it, and it will give the means of determining the pressure in
the surrounding liquid dielectric.       This arrangement describes in
fact the plan of Quincke's experiments.
    At a point in the dielectric where the electric force is F, the
electric pressure will be proportional to Fl, say, A,F* for the liquid,
and AiF2 for the air. The air column in the manometer tube would
thus be in internal equilibrium with an electric pressure A]F: next
the liquid and null at the manometer end. We might at first glance
infer that under these circumstances the pressure A^' is not indi
cated by the manometer, which would thus record simply the electric
pressure in the liquid. But this air pressure is an internal stress ;
the equilibrium of any section of the air column requires, in order to
maintain  it,  the electric pressure against    of the air on the other
                                                  it
side of that section therefore, the indication of the manometer really
                      ;
gives the differential effect AaF,J— A,Fil.
    Let now the volume energy of the electrification be C1F2 in the
liquid, and CiF* in the air, each per unit volume and let the energies
                                                       ;
of such real surface electric distributions as might exist on the plates
in contact with these dielectrics be 2, and 2, respectively, each per
unit surface of both plates. These surface energies would involve in
their expression the electric potential as well as the force. We may
apply the principle of virtual work to determine the relations between
the quantities thus defined.

   Suppose that the distance between            the plates, with no         air babble
introduced, is slowly increased from     c to c+Sc against the tension
T»  which  tends  to draw    them  together.  The work done against T,
in raising the upper plate is the only source of the additional energy
of the system which appears when that separation is effected. Now
the value of P is not thereby altered, as the electrification remains
constant.   The volume energy contained in a cylinder of the liquid
of unit sectional area is therefore changed from C2F-c to C2F2c (1 + Icjc).
                                                                                   <f2,
The corresponding surface energy is changed from                     22 to ^j +

Therefore, by the principle of work,       T2   =   C^F* +     -~.
    Now suppose a large air bubble introduced between the plates ;
and suppose its volume to be increased by Sv owing to a virtual dis
placement produced by pressing in more air.           The virtual work Plv
so done must be equal to the increase of the internal energy of the
system due to the displacement.          This increase may be calculated
from the energy function of the actual conformation, not of the dis
placed position, as internal equilibrium subsists ; and all considera
tions as to change of intrinsic energy may thus be evaded.* For a
bubble of small dimensions its surface would, in fact, be increased by
the supposed displacement, and so there would be an increase of
intrinsic capillary energy ; with surface tension t, radius a, and a
semicircular meniscus ire, there would be an increase of amount
2 it'ctSci, that is irtcivja. Again, the electric forces P| and Fa in the two
media, measured not close up to the meniscus, are equal, because the
plates are each at uniform potential. Close to the centre of the
meniscus they are both tangential to it, and must also be equal on the
two sides. But along the slope of the meniscus they are oblique to
it and are unequal, their relation being determined on the ordinary
theory by the continuity of the normal component induction and of
the tangential component force. Thus the difference of electric
pressure across the meniscus will vary from point to point of             and      it,
its form will, therefore, be slightly altered by the electrification. It
follows from the observations of Quincke and others that its capillary
constant will not thereby be altered, as was to be expected because
there  is   no extra supply of molecular surface energy. There            also         is
the alteration of intrinsic energy due to the fact that the expansion
of the air bubble altera the electric force.           But, according to the
 principles just stated, these changes of intrinsic energy balance each
other, because all the parts of the medium are in internal equilibrium.
We may therefore consider the annular mass between two ideal
coaxial cylindric surfaces at distance from the meniscus, one in the

existence of this surface energy, unless we can suppose it to be the
energy of an action at a distance which is independent of the inter
vening medium altogether.
     The argument may also be expressed somewhat differently as fol
lows : — The plates of the condenser being supported independently,
 the existence of an extra pressure on the dielectric when the con
 denser is excited shows that part, at any rate, of the electric energy
 resides in the dielectric. That part must, on any view, either of
 action by contact or of quasi- magnetic polarisation, be proportional
 to the square of the electric force at the point, which is in fact con
 firmed by the experiments of Silow on a quadrant electrometer with
 its needle immersed in a dielectric liquid filling the quadrants. If
 this were the whole of the electric energy, the traction between the
 plates would be equal to the hydrostatic pressure in the dielectric, or
 at most differ from it by an amount which would be the same for all
 media.*       If this were only part of the electric energy, the difference
 would depend on the other superficial part. The experiments show
 that for a large number of liquids the difference is very nearly the
 same, so that if, after Quincke, we suppose it to be null for air or
 vacuum, it is null for all the others.          f   Hence either the superficial
 energy must be absolutely independent of the nature of the dielectric

 the division of the energy into two parts, one located in the dielectric,
and the other located on the plates and absolutely independent of the
dielectric, viz., that the latter might be the energy of a direct action
across space which        not affected by the dielectric. The experimental

reservation for possible modification in the form of residual correc
tions, bat not for change of principle.
    A theory has been developed by Helmholtz for fluids, and by
Kirchhoff, following him, for solid dielectrics, in which slight residual

as inconsistent with the dynamical       phenomena,    in favour of a

tether.
   Without entering here into detail as to the general characteristics
of this kind of polarisation, it will suffice to point out some of its
principal relations with regard to which misconception is easy, and
also to point out the modifications which are necessitated in its usual
form by the recognition of the discrete or molecular character of
the polarised elements.     In the Poisson theory of induced magnetism
the magnetic potential is the potential not of the actual magnetism,
but of the continuous volume and surface distributions             of ideal
magnetic    matter which   Poisson  substitutes for it.   The  forces  on a
magnetic molecule are therefore not to be derived from it.*           But if
we imagine a very elongated cavity to be scooped out in the medium
along the direction of magnetisation, and the molecule to be placed
in the middle of the cavity, the forces of the remaining magnetised
matter will be correctly derived from this potential.         This part of
the forcive will thus be derivable from a potential energy MP cos c,
where M is the moment of the molecule, F the rosultant force derived
from the magnetic potential, and c the angle between their directions ;
we may thus consider a potential energy function IF cos e per unit
volume.     We have to add to these forces the ones due to the rejected
 magnetic molecules which lay in the elongated cavity.             Now the
mutual action of contiguous magnetic molecules will be of the nature
of a tension along the lines of magnetisation and a pressure at right
angles to them, as Helmholtz remarked ;t but these stresses will not
 necessarily be equal in intensity ; nor will they represent the Faradny-
 Maxwell stress.since each component is proportional to the square of
 the coefficient of magnetisation, not to its first power.       In a fluid
 medium these forces also must be     derivable  from  an  energy function,
 for otherwise the medium could not be in equilibrium ; and the total
 potential energy per unit volume with its sign changed is equal to the
 fluid pressure. Thus in the polarised fluid the pressure is
that      is,
                                            \(k   +\J) F*.
   *   In estimating         these forces it is not allowable to replace the molecule bj its
three components parallel           to the axes in the usual manner.     This procedure would
le»d to error       if    there are electric currents in the field. Cf. Maxwell, ' Electricity,'

  64          Mr.  J. Larmor.      Theory of Electi odynatnics         [June  2>
     An actual illustration    in which the term involving X is of pre
 dominant importance ia afforded by a bunch of iron nails hanging
 end to end from a pole of a magnet ; the adjacent nails hang on to
 each other lengthways and repel each other sideways, while the
 action of non-adjacent ones is bat slight.
     Tn the electric polarisation theory the speciGc inductive capacity
 is K = 1 + 47t«.     The results of Quincke, above mentioned, after they
 had been corrected for an experimental oversight in the direct deter
 minations of the values of K by experiments on capacity, in accord
 ance with a suggestion made by Hopkinson,- made the electric
 pressure to be KFJ/8?r, consistently within the limits of experimental
 error for fifteen different substances.          Thus, even in the limiting
 Mnxwell form of the theory, which takes the absolute numerical
 value of K to be very great, this theory would not fit with the
 experiments unless X is zero.          Even by the purely mathematical
 device of taking the polarised elements to be right solids closely
 packed together, it does not seen possible to evade this argument.
    In an actual fluid polarised in the above manner each element
 might on the average be considered as lying at the centre of a cavity,
 a sort of sphere of action within which the other molecules in their
 motions do not approach it further.          On averaging the positions of
 these surrounding molecules during their motions with respect to
 the one under consideration, we arrive at the conception of a con
tinuous polarised medium with a cavity in it of the form of this
sphere of action. If this cavity were an actual sphere, the value of
X would be     \ w; and for cavities not very greatly different from the
spherical form, the alteration in this value would be insensible.
 Under no likely circumstances could the value of X come to be zero.
    Thus the limiting Helmholtz polarisation representation               of an
 excited dielectric, though complete as regards electromotive properties,
 would appear to fail to include the static ponderomotive phenomena
of electrification, and requires to be modified into some more con
tinuous mechanism, such as an elastic displacement in an sether
loaded with the molecules of the dielectric.
    It may be well to remark that, on account of the extreme smallness
of the magnetic coefficient k for all fluids, its square is of no account
in comparison, and therefore magnetic pressures are sufficiently repre
sented by the simpler formula \ kF*, by means of which Quincke has
measured the magnetic constants of various fluid media.
    5. The principal conclusions which have been arrived at axe here
enumerated.
    (i.) It is shown from experimental results that the stress in an
excited fluid dielectric between two condenser         plates consists, at any
rate to a first approximation, of a tension along the lines of force and
                           * '
                               Eoy. Soc. Proc.,' 1886.

 1802.]        as affected by Stresses in   Excited Dielectrics.          65
an equal pressure in all directions at right angles to them, superposed
upon such stress as would exist in a vacuum with the same value of
the electric force.
    (ii.) It is shown from experiments that the numerical value of
these additional equal tensions and pressures is, at any rate to a first
approximation, (K— 1)1^/8^, where F is the electric force, and K the
inductive capacity.
    (iii.) Such a distribution of .equal tension and pressure is the result
of a uniform volume distribution of energy in the dielectric, irre
spective of -what theory is adopted as to its mode of excitation.
    (iv.) If we consider the mode of excitation to be a gttasi-magnetic
polarisation of its molecules, the numerical magnitude of these stresses
should be
                                   Fa(l + X       ),
where X is a coefficient which depends on the molecular discreteness
 of the medium, and is probably not very different from the value -J jr.
 A discrete polarisation of the molecules does not account for the
 stress, so far as this coefficient is concerned.
    (v.) The stress which would exist in a vacuum dielectric is cer
 tainly due in part to a volume distribution of energy, as is shown by
 the propagation of electric waves across a vacuum.       There is thus no
 reason left for assuming any part of it to be due to a distribution of
 energy on its two surfaces, acting directly at a distance on each other.
 There is therefore ground for assuming a purely volume distribution
 of energy in the vacuous space, leading to a tension F2/8jt along the
 lines of force, and a pressure F'/Sjt at right angles to them.
    (vi.) The quasi- magnetic polarisation theory rests on the notion of
 a dielectric excited by a surface charge on the plates, and therefore
 involves a surface distribution of energy, except in the extreme case
 when the absolute value of K is very great ; in that case a slight
 surface charge produces a great polarisation effect, and in the limit
 the polarisation may be taken as self-excited.      Thus the absence of a
 surface distribution of energy leads to Maxwell's displacement theory,
 in which all electric currents are circuital, and the equations of electro
 dynamics are therefore ascertained.
    (vii.) It appears that even this limiting polarisation theory must
 be replaced, on account of the stress-formula in (iv), by some dynam
 ical theory of displacement of a more continuous character.
    6. We may perhaps attempt to form a more vivid picture of the
 interaction between aether and matter by following oat the ideas of
 Lord Raylcigh's version of Young's theory of capillarity.         We may
 conceive the compound medium, aather and matter, to consist of a
 very refined sethereal substratum, in which the molecular web of

66                 On  the   Theory   of Electrodynamics.             [June  2,
matter is imbedded.      The range of direct action between contiguous
parts of the aether would be very small, and that between contiguous
elements of matter large in comparison.            There exist disturbances in
which the matter- web is unaffected, its free periods being too slow to
follow them : these are propagated with great velocity as light, or
electrical radiations.     There are other disturbances in which the
matter-web is alone active ; these are so slow that the aether can
adjust itself to an equilibrium condition at each instant; they are
propagated as waves of material vibration or sound waves.
   When a dielectric is excited, we find ourselves in the presence of a
strain of an sethereal origin somehow produced ; it would relax on
discharge of the system with the velocity of light.            At an interface
where one dielectric joins another, the sethereal conditions will some
how, owing to the nature of the connexion with the matter, only
admit of a portion of the stress being transmitted across the inter
face ; and there will thus be a residual traction on the interface which
must, if equilibrium subsist, be supported by the matter-web, and be
the origin of the stress which has been verified experimentally.
Inside a conductor, the aether cannot sustain stress at all, so that the
whole eathereal stress in the dielectric is supported by the surface of
the matter-web of the conductor. At such interfaces the sethereal
part of the distribution of energy in the medium will be discon
tinuous.
   A formula has been given by Maxwell* for the intensity of the
pressural force produced by electric undulations in the aether striking
against a plate of conducting matter, a force which has apparently
not been detected for the case of light-waves.             If the notions here
suggested have any basis, this force may likely be non-existent.            For
the pulsations of the aether at this surface may be so rapid as to pre
vent their energy being communicated to the matter-web of the
conductor; and the energy will then be scattered and lost instead of
appearing as energy of material Btress. We may take as an illustra
tion a stretched cord with equidistant equal masses strung on it, for
which Lagrange showed that if the period of a disturbance imparted
at one end exceeds a certain limit, the disturbance will not be trans
mitted into the cord, but will be eased off within a short distance of
the point of application.      And also in a manner which forms a more
exact analogy, Sir G. Stokes has shown that the higher harmonics of
a telegraph wire vibrating in the wind have their pulsations too rapid
to get a grip on the air around them, and their note is therefore not
transmitted.
   This view would place the electrostatic and electrodynamio forces
on matter on a lower plane, and in the case of rapid or sudden
disturbance a more uncertain one, than the electromotive phenomena.

   About the end of last January, when my brother was fully occupied
in writing his paper on the Trade Winds for the Bakerian Lecture, he
called my attention to the well-known beams or ladders of light seen
below or above a lamp flame viewed with partially-closed eyelids,
and he gave me verbally an explanation of the phenomenon which
surprised me very much.          By some simple and interesting trials
with my own eyes, which he explained to me how to make, I was
perfectly convinced that his explanation was correct ; and believing
it, as Istill believe it, to be new, urged him to write a short paper

ber of parallel lines outside represent rays of light coming from                             a
flame several feet or yards away in the direction of F', to the eyelids,
the prismoids, and the undisturbed outer surface of the cornea between
the prismoids.     The lines within the eye below FF' represent the con
vergence to F, the image of the flame, of those of the external rays
from the flame which fall on the undisturbed portion of the surface
of the cornea. The lines within the eye above FF' represent rays dis
turbed by the prismoid of the upper eyelid which, incident on the
retina at bbb, give the perception as       of light coming from without
                                                  if
in   the direction of the dotted lines outside the eye.      It this per          is
ception that constitutes the appearance of the downward beams or
ladders of light, due to the prismoid of the upper eyelid. The rays
disturbed by the prismoid of the lower eyelid, in the position repre
 sented in the diagram, are all stopped by the lower part of the iris.
    Looking now at the diagram, we understand perfectly that           with             if,
 the eyeball and flame unchanged, the upper eyelid be gradually raised
a  little, the uppermost of the rays coming inwards from the prismoid
 will fall on the upper part of the iris and will be stopped by this
 screen.    Thus, the length of bbb upwards from          diminished, until

 all the beams from the prismoid are stopped by the iris, and the
 length of the apparent beams below the flame correspondingly
 diminishes to zero.     When the upper eyelid         wide open the flame

 the eyeball   remains with its axis in the direction of the flame, we

 the head, with the eyelids, is turned downwards, so as to bring the

    Notes on Quasi-Bay Beams of Light from Candles, or other tmall

                    Date of Note, 29th December, 1891.
   I have noticed decidedly this morning to the following effect : —
   In some cases (the nature of which        I intend to note further on)  I
found   that, when seeing a small gas flame with apparent descending
tail (or quasi-beam of rays), I could, by lowering the upper eyelid,
cat off vision of the flame, while leaving the tail visible; and, by still
further lowering the upper eyelid, I could cut off the upper part of
the tail, leaving the lower part, the part remote from the flame, quite
visible as before.     The contrast between lowering the upper eyelid
and lowering a screen (a card, for instance) in front of the eye was
very remarkable.      In the lowering of the card or other screen, the
tail vanishes before the flame is eclipsed ; but in lowering the eyelid
the flame is eclipsed first.
   In some attitudes I could not bring out these phenomena.           I  did
find them when awake in bed early in the morning, head on pillow
and light coming down from a gas flame obliquely to the eye.          Point
to which eye was directed seemed to do best when taken at an altitude
(angular) somewhat above the gas flame.
   Afterwards, this same morning, I found I could see the phenomenon
 when standing upright and looking at image of gas in mirror.           Bay
from image ascending obliquely ; eyesight directed above image in
looking-glass.
   Again, looking at a gas flame    a little above the level of the eye, I
stood erect and elevated my face,     directing my eyesight to above the

74          Beams   of Light  as if emanating from   Flames.   [June 16,
gas   ;  then lowered the upper eyelid and saw the downward tail
remaining when the gas flame was eclipsed by the eyelid.               The
theory of all this is clear to me, and in agreement with what I have
previously devised. — J. T.
   Take notice that to get the phenomena above sketched out to show
themselves, the edge of upper eyelid, where roots of eyelashes are
situated, must not shadow the prismoid when the eyelid is lowered
enough to cover the pupil from the direct rays of the candle or gas
flame.     After the candle is cut off from the pupil, the direct rays
from the flame must still be reaching the prismoid. This, I think,
tallies with the experimental conditions under which the tail was seen
when the flame was eclipsed by eyelid. — J. T.
    P.S. — Same day, 29th December.      On a little further consideration
I  notice that the elevation of the face is of no importance.    It is only
the elevation of the line of special direction of the eyesight [axis of
the eye] relatively to the line from flame to eye that is important. —

                                 (For paper.)
    Often   I  fail to see the apparently ascending beam above the
 candle or gas flame.     But I find that by very nearly shutting the eye
 I can see the ascending beam going up very high and the descending
 one at same time.     On bringing my open hand down from above as if
 to cut off the ascending beam I see the beam as if between my eye
 and my hand, and the flame begins to be eclipsed before the beam is
 cut off, or even diminished.
                    Note by the President of date June 16.
    I   had asked many friends well acquainted with optical subjects
 whether they knew of this explanation of the luminous beams, and
 all said no until yesterday evening, at the soiree of the Royal Society,
when Professor Silvanus Thompson immediately answered by giving
the explanation himself, and telling me that he had given it to his
 pupils in his lectures on optics, as an illustration of a concave
 cylindrical lens. He did not know of the explanation ever having
 been published otherwise than in his lectures.        I have myself also
 looked in many standard books on optics, and could find no trace of
intelligence on the subject. It seems quite probable, therefore, that,
 of all the millions of millions of men that have seen the phenomenon,
 none, within our three thousand years of scientific history, had ever
 thought of the true explanation except Professor Silvanus Thompson
 and my brother.

 1892.J           Voltaic Cells with Fused Electrolytes.                        75
III. " Voltaic Cells with Fused Electrolytes."                      By J. Brown.
       Communicated by Professor Everett, F.R.S.                         Received
       May 27, 1892.
    In attempts to compare          the observed electromotive forces of
voltaic combinations with the theoretical values found by Thomson's*
law, the discrepancies observed in many cases, and the difficulties
experienced in ascertaining their nature and origin, are well known.
It is evident that, in order to compare observations with theory, we
must know exactly the facts on which the theory is to be founded,
i.e., the true nature of the chemical reaction in the cell, and its rela
tion to the electric phenomena to be observed ; and for this purpose
simplicity in the construction of the cell is, in the present state of
knowledge, almost a necessity.            In many of the cells that have been
examined heretofore, this condition of simplicity is not realised ; and
the nature of the chemical action in them is not definitely ascer
tainable because of the complicated nature of the substances em
ployed.     I have referred to this point in the introduction to a paper
on the
         " Rdle of the Cation in Voltaic Combinations ; "f and in a
foot-note on p. 462, of that paper          I have again referred to what is a
very frequent cause of uncertainty, viz., the action of the solvent—
usually of course water —as distinct from the dissolved electrolys-
able substances.      This uncertainty is still more marked in the case of
Borne of Wright and Thompson's experiments^ where insoluble salts
suspended in solutions were supposed to be alone active to the
exclusion of both the water and the dissolved substances.                      The
solvent may act chemically on the metals, and affect the electro
motive force, either directly as an electrolyte, or indirectly by the
formation of films insoluble in itself, which act differently from the
metals or protect them from chemical action.                  Laurie§ and Braun||
have respectively shown that the lowering of the forces of aluminium
and magnesium in aqueous solutions is probably due to such pro
tective films ; Julius M. Werner^f considers the cause of the com
parative inaction of pure zinc in acids to be that, at the moment of
immersion, it becomes enclosed in a continuous film of hydrogen
which protects it from further action ; while with impure zinc the
hydrogen forms on the impurities only, leaving the zinc exposed.

 76                             Mr.   J.  Brown.                    [June  16,
The prol ability of such actions does not, I think, usually receive
sufficient consideration in electrochemical investigations.
    Again there is, in connection with the solvent, the uncertainty
whether, in calculating the mechanical equivalent of the action in
the cell, we should include the heats of solution of substances formed
by the action.       Where the product is easily soluble, the heat of
solution  is  probably adjuvant ; where insoluble, there is of course no
heat of solution adjuvant; where it is soluble with difficulty, the
heat of solution may be partly or to some unknown extent ad
juvant.
    The consideration of these difficulties, and especially the complica
tion probably caused by the action of the water on magnesium and
aluminium, as mentioned above, led me to the consideration of a
much simpler form of cell, in which the solvent with all its com
plications is abolished, and the simple electrolyte in the fused state
 used alone.
    The number of possible combinations of this kind is limited by
the considerations that the electrolytes must be fusible at reasonable
temperatures ; and that the boiling point of any component in a cell
must not be below the fusing point of the electrolyte in contact with
it. A few of the haloid compounds of the metals are suitable; and
the chlorides were chosen to begin with, as in some respects best
known.
   The results obtained show at all events the direction in which to
look for an exact accordance between theory and experiment
                      I. Cells with Simple Chlorides.
    The cells were of course of the two-fluid type, each metal being in
contact with its own chloride only, while the two chlorides were in
good contact with each other.          The type may be represented for in
stance as
                    Zinc |  ZnCla   |  MgClj   | Magnesium.
   We cannot say the fused electrolyte is always free from the com
plication of dissolved oxygen, for in some cases this makes itself
evident by the formation of oxychlorides.             This very formation of
oxychlorides may, however, remove the oxygen from the sphere of
action.
    We must admit also that in some of the combinations tried, action
goes on with open circuit, since several of the metals, notably iron
and copper, were somewhat corroded after immersion in the fused
salt.
   Further,    while the   difficulty    about   the  heat of solution of the
nascent Baits is avoided, there is a question        as to whether the heat of
solution of one fused chloride in the other, i.e., the heat of combina

 1802.]             Voltaic Cells with Fuxed Electrolyte*.                     77
 tion of the two chlorides with each other affects the electromotive
 force of the cell. It is impossible to answer this question without
 farther data of various sorts.         The small irregular variations from
 theory shown in the tables may possibly be due to some action of
 this kind. The results of experiment show, however, that these few
 complications have but a small effect ; very much less than those of
 the aqueous form of cell with its metals coated with oxide and
 hydrogen films, and its mixture of two or more electrolytes and dis
 solved oxygen, such as might perhaps be represented as
  Zinc + ZnO + H | ZnCl, + HsO + O  | MgCl, +  HsO + O | Magnesium  + MgH,Oj + H,
 which seems to be too complicated for exact calculation.
    In arranging the practical details, care was taken to keep the
 metals as clean as possible, the contacts good, the electrolytes fused
 but Dot boiling, and the temperatures fairly equal at the two metals ;
 also to prevent, as far as possible, the two chlorides from diffusing
 into one another. After trying various arrangements, that of which
 fig. 1 represents about half the actual size was adopted.
    A  V-tu.be A of hard glass,
                                   fojTned as shown, and supported by its
longer limb, contained one of the chlorides, in which dipped the
wire or strip of appropriate metal C.             The bend of this tube was
heated as required by one or two Bunsen burners.                Into the shorter
limb was inserted     the  other   tube  B,   its lower   end contracted some
what, and filled with a plug of asbestos, to act as a porous partition.
This smaller tube contained the second chloride, with its appropriate
metal D. When the metal represented by C was fusible at nearly

     78                            Mr. J.  Brown.                     [June  16,
    the same temperature as its chloride, it was first fused in the bend of
    the tube A, and then its chloride fused on it in the shorter limb.
    The melted metal was connected to the Thomson electrometer by a
    wire of either copper or iron dipping in it. When this wire was of
    copper, long contact with the fused metal seemed to dissolve it some
    what ; and a slight error may thereby be introduced in the cases of
    tin, zinc, and cadmium ; but this is probably not large in any case.
    For these fusible metals, a clay tobacco pipe was sometimes substi
    tuted for the tube A, the connecting wire passing through its stem.
   When the metal in the small tube was of this easily fusible kind, it
    was found best to add another asbestos plug, as at t, fig. 2, which
    was permeated by the chloride below it at k, and supported the fused
    metal g with its connecting wire /.
       While all mixture of the two chlorides was to be avoided as far as
   possible,  it was considered    especially  necessary   to keep the chloride
   of higher combining heat, which to save repetition          we may call H,
   from being permeated by that of lower combining              heat L, for the
   obvious reason that, when L mixed with H, its metal          became at once
   reduced on the metal in H, and the conditions were          thereby altered.
   If, for example, in the cell
                        Copper   |  Cu2Cl2  |
                                              ZnCl, | Zinc
  the copper chloride (L) diffuses into the zinc chloride (H), copper
  becomes reduced on the zinc, and the electromotive force is lowered.
      To obviate or mitigate this difficulty, the following precautions
  were taken : — The \/-tube A was first set up, and the chloride fused
  in it. When the arrangement was such that chloride H was in the
 small tube B, this tube was first held in the Bunsen flame till the
  chloride fused and saturated the porous plug to the end or nearly so.
  The tube B was then inserted in its place, any small mixture of H
 with L not being considered of importance. If, on the other hand,
 H was in A, and L in B, then B was simply heated till L was about
 fusing point, and was immediately inserted in A, so that H had time
 to soak up into the plug before L soaked down.
      The following was the usual plan of observing the electromotive
 force: —As soon as the electrolytes were in order, and the metals,
 previously connected to the electrometer, were inserted, the deflexion
 was noted immediately, and again after ahpnt five minutes.                The
 metals were then, if solid, taken out, cleaned, and re-inserted, and
the observations repeated.      In these sets of observations the variation

than with solid metals, the latter being more liable to surface altera
tions.      The adopted mean of each set was derived from tliose
experiments in which the theoretical conditions were most strict) -

    As regards the quality of the substance used, the zinc, lead, iron,
tin, and copper, and the chlorides of magnesium and tin, were pur
chased as pure. The other metals and chlorides were the substances
as supplied by the chemical manufacturers under their respective
labels.    In the case of metals forming more than one chloride, that
one was chosen in which a chlorine molecule Cl» gave the highest
heat of combination. The corresponding form aire are stated in the
tables of results. The heats of combination employed are Tbomsen's.
    Table  I gives the results obtained with the chlorides of the metals
as stated, together with the theoretical values ; the unit employed
being the electromotive force of a Daniell cell, which for the Daniell
I used may be taken as about 113.
    In calculating the theoretical value, it is assumed that the reaction
is simply the substitution, in the double fluid electrolyte, of the metal
with higher combining heat for that with lower ; and, therefore, that
the theoretical electromotive force is, according to Thomson's law,
simply proportional to the difference of their combining heats with
 chlorine, which is the anion of the electrolyte. This difference,
 divided by 50,130, the heat equivalent of a Daniell cell, gives the
 theoretical electromotive force for each pair, in terms of the Daniell.
 In practice, it is more convenient to divide, once for all, the heat of
 combination of each metal by the heat equivalent of the Daniell. The
 quotients thus found are placed under their respective metals in the
 table. It seems possible that these numbers may represent the true
 differences of potential at contact of metal and liquid.
    The theoretical electromotive force for any pair of metals is then
 given by the difference of their respective numbers.        In the table,
 this will be found in heavy type, at the intersection of the vertical
 and horizontal lines passing through any given pair of metals ; the
 metal to the right forming the negative pole of the arrangement.
 Immediately below each theoretical electromotive force, is placed
 that found by experiment, being the mean of the number of sets of
 experiments indicated by the figure in brackets below it. The highest
 and lowest observed values are stated to the right and left of it.
     In this table it will be observed that, while the mean experimental
 result for any combination of the metals zinc, lead, and tin agrees
 fairly well with Thomson's law ; those combinations in which silver,
 copper, or cadmium occur do not exhibit such good agreement ; and
 closer examination shows that mnch more consistent results ?ould be
 obtained by applying a constant correction for each metal.        I have
 determined, by a tentative process, the best values for these correc
 tions, and the results are shown in Table II. It is only a question of
 differences ; and if the correction for cadmium be taken as zero the
  corrections for all the other metals will be positive. A justification
  for this selection of cadmium will be found in a later paragraph.

difference of temperature to be employed), and the other junction at
a red heat, the observed electromotive force was about 0*1 Daniell,

lamp from one       Bide  of the cell to the other.         A silver chloride cell of
 the same form gave a similar result.                Lead was tested in the fused
state   in  two asbestos-plugged tubes, like B, fig. 1, immersed in a
 \/-tube containing fused lead chloride. The other easily fusible
metals, tin, cadmium, and zinc, -were tested in \/\/-shaped tubes, open
at the apex in the middle, for introduction of the chloride after the
metal had been fused in the two lower bends. With all the easily
fusible metals, except zinc, the tubes were made sufficiently long to
allow the portion of metal surrounding the copper connecting wire
to remain solid, so as to avoid risk of alloying from long fusion in
contact with the copper.
    In all cases, except cadmium, with which in three carefully-made
experiments,     I  found no decided effect, the hotter metal was found
to be the negative pole of the arrangement. Zinc was somewhat
doubtful, and may have been influenced by alloying with the copper
connection.

these thermal cells, the results of these rough experiments are given

    There is a kind of rough correspondence between the numbers in
the two columns, but the inexact nature of the experiments of column
A   precludes a strict comparison.
    I had no means of measuring, otherwise than by rough estimation,
the difference of temperature between the two sides of the cells ; but
as a mere    approximation it might be taken for tin as rather less than
the difference between the freezing and boiling points of stannous
chloride, or say 300° C. ; for zinc and copper it was rather more than
this, and for lead and silver less, as their chlorides are less easily
fusible, and the higher temperature was limited to the softening point
of the glass tube.
    Besides  the experiments of Gladstone and Tribe mentioned above,
others bearing less definitely on the subject have been made by
Andrews,* Hankel,f and more recently by Mr. T. Andrews,J of
Sheffield.

     As regards these currents due to difference of temperatures, Andrews
 concluded, from the non-corrosion of the platinum wires used by him,
 that the action was in his experiments thermo-electric.                   Gladstone
 and Tribe state that in their experiments " it is difficult to imagine
 that chemical action in any way initiates the current." Their experi
 ments show clearly, however, that the phenomenon is of electrolytic
 nature, since the current formed is accompanied                by the solution of
 metal at the hot side, and its deposit in crystalline form at the cooler
 electrode.    The same effect was also observed in my experiments with
 copper in its fused double chloride ; a large deposit of crystalline
metal was found on the cooler wire after the current had passed for
an hour.       The action must, therefore, be of electrolytic or voltaic
character ; and the application of Thomson's law to these unequally
heated cells wonld suggest that, with the apparent exception of
cadmium, there is an increase with temperature of the heats of com
bination of the metals with chlorine, conjoined with a possible Peltier
effect.     Such a variation is, in fact, well ascertained in other cases ;
and Thomson* gives a formula for its calculation from the specific
heats of the bodies involved.            The want of data for the fused sails
prevents its further discussion here.
    Assuming this variation of the heats of combination to exist, and
assuming, also, that the chemical energy is all adjuvant at the various
temperatures,t we could directly account for the additive corrections
empirically deduced from Table            I and applied in Table II, the num
bers in Table I being founded on Thomsen's heats of combination
obtained at 18° to 20°, while ray experiments were made at tempera
tures several hundred degrees higher.               It will thus be important to
determine the temperature co-efficients of these cells, and I hope to
do so at some future time.
   Another point demanding careful attention is the extent to which
these cells are reversible.         The following experiments bear on this
subject   : —
    Two clay tobacco pipes were clipped by their stems in wooden
supports, one in each, and placed with their bowls touching and
facing upwards.          One contained some melted zinc, and the other
melted tin, with iron connecting wires through the stems.                        The
respective chlorides were fused over these metals and connected
together by a bunch of asbestos, a notch having been cut at the point

   t  [This  assumption  is of course provisional.    It was necessary because of the
absence of any investigation here as to what part, if any, of the energy is non-
adjutant. Helmholtz and other well-known authors have discussed this question
in connexion with the ordinary aqueous form of cell, but     I have not attempted its
investigation  as yet in the present  case.  When the temperature coefficients and
other data have been obtained this may be undertaken. — Aug. 2, 1892.]

   Except in the zinc-silver cell, and to a minute extent in the zinc-
tin cell, there is no evidence of polarisation by reversal.               The other
two cells show the remarkable property of possessing a greater
electromotive force after short circuiting than before it ; and since
this recurs repeatedly in the observations on both cells, it would
seem to be more than accidental.
                         II.  Cells icith Double Chlorides.
   As   I  have already stated, the present investigation was suggested
by the behaviour of magnesium and aluminium in aqueous electro
lytes ; and as a matter of fact these metals were experimented on in
the more complicated cells described below before the simpler cells of
Table   I  were tried.      Owing to the high fusing point of magnesium
chloride, and the volatility of the aluminium compound, it was incon
venient to work with these chlorides in the fused state ; and this
difficulty had to be surmounted by employing the double chlorides of
magnesium and potassium, and of aluminium and sodium.                      A similar
method was adopted with ferrous chloride, which is infusible by
iteelf.
   It may be objected that this method introduces a solvent, the very
complication which it is desired to avoid, since potassium chloride
may be looked upon as the solvent of the other chlorides.                     But in
comparing fused potassium chloride with water as a solvent of
chlorides, there are two important differences,                  (i) With potassium
chloride, the anion is the same as that of the dissolved substance,
while with water it is not. (ii) The heat of combination K, CI is
greater than that of any of the other chlorides X, CI dissolved
in it in these experiments ; therefore the metal X when immersed

in the double salt does not decompose the potassium chloride, but
only reacts with its own chloride.            Henco we have grounds for
assuming    that    potassium   chloride   remains   practically inert, so far
as concerns any direct chemical action between it and the metal
immersed.      The potassium chloride         is,
                                                however, active in another
way, viz., in combining with the various metallic chlorides to form
their double salts and the heat of this combination should no doubt
                   ;
be taken into account.        Unfortunately, the heats of formation of
these double salts appear to be unknown.            If they are nearly equal,
so  that their  differences  are small   in comparison with the whole heat
equivalent of the cell, their effect will be negligible. A comparison
of Tables   Iand  II   shows that this   is  probably so, but naturally the
results of these experiments with double salts cannot be compared
with theory quite so satisfactorily as those with simple chlorides.
   In any given experiment the two chlorides employed should be either
both double or both single, to avoid the complication which would
otherwise be introduced by the formation of double salt on one side
                                                    a
ai.d not on the other.      In the preliminary stage of this work, some
experiments    were   made   without observance of this rule, and the dis
cordant results obtained showed that          it cannot be disregarded.     It
was therefore necessary to form double chlorides for all the metals
employed    ;and the combinations whose formulae appear in Table          III
were found, either by reference to the books or by experiment, to be
suitable.
   The experiments were carried out in the same way as the first set,
and the results are given in Table III, where for magnesium, iron,
and aluminium, they are stated in the same form as in Table      ForI.
the other metals, only single observations, as a rule, were made, for
c< mparison with Table   I. The corresponding numbers in both tables
me at least of the same order of magnitude, the difference only in
one case appearing in the first decimal place.

   While the results in Tahle            III are naturally       not  so regular    as those
in Table  I,  most of them are nearer the theoretical values than those
of the same combinations in aqueous solutions. In this respect the
results for cells in which magnesium or aluminium is concerned are
particularly striking.           For comparison       I  take the following nnmbers
(in volts)    for   metals      in  aqueous     solutions    of their chlorides, from
Wright and Thompson ;* Braun,t has found a similar discrepancy
for magnesium in aqueous cells, and attributes it to hydrogen de
posited on the magnesium.

   A still   closer agreement between the observed and theoretical
numbers for the metals in Table              III  is produced by the application of
empirical corrections, as         in  Table IV ; and these are of a similar order
of magnitude in the two tables, except in the case of zinc.
   On testing iron, aluminium, and magnesium for electromotive force
due to difference of temperature, iron was found to behave like copper,
the hot metal being the negative pole. Aluminium in its double
chloride with sodium gave, at first, a strong similar effect ; but after
some twenty minutes — when a dark deposit, which appeared to con
tain lead, carbon and iron reduced by the immersed metal, had ceased
to separate, and the liquid had become colourless and clear — the effect
ceased.    It may have been due to impurity in the chloride. With
magnesium I could not detect any electromotive force due to difference
of temperature.        Therefore, considering the uncertainty introduced
by these irregularities, and the complication introduced by the use of
double salts, cadmium has been allowed to remain as the zero of the
scale of corrections, as in Table II.
   My experiments were carried out in the laboratory of Queen's
College, Belfast, and I am much indebted to Professor Everett for
permission to work there and for the use of his electrometer and
other apparatus.          I   am also indebted to Professors Everett and

G.   F. Fitzgerald and to Mr.      J. Larmor for several important sugges
tions.
    Since writing the above, my attention has been called to a paper by
L. Poincare,* " Snr les Piles a Electrolytes Fondus et sur les Forces
Thertno-electriques a la Surface de contact d'un Metal et d'un Sel
Fondu."      M. Poincare has measured the thermo-electric actions in
one or two thermo-cells similar to those which           I  have described, and
finds the following thermo-electromotive forces for a difference of 1°
between the two metal electrolyte junctions, the sign being that of
hotter pole : —

    The sign for tin does not appear to be given ; that for zinc is the
reverse of my result. M. Poincare' has also measured the electro
motive force of one voltaic cell with fused electrolytes,

and finds    it to be 0'335 volt. My result, in Table I, when reduced
to volts, is 0-350.     He finds for the value just after solidification of
the electrolyte, 0 37 volt, and considers that, in order to obtain the
true heat equivalent of a cell with fused electrolytes, the latent heat
of fusion of the salts used should be deducted from Thomson's heats
of combination for the solid salts. There would appear to be, on
 theoretical grounds, some doubt on this point. It could be experi
 mentally tested more definitely if data for these heats of fnsion were
 available.
                                     Synopsis.
    In instituting  a comparison of the observed electromotive forces of
 cells with their theoretical values, as given by Thomson's law, the
 simpler the construction of the cell the more easy is it to ascertain
 the nature of the chemical      action going on in it, upon which the cal
 culation rests.
    In cells with aq aeons electrolytes, the solvent introduces several
 irreducible complications, arising from possible action of the solvent
 itself as an electrolyte, from the formation of insoluble films (either
 inactive and protective as oxides, or active, as hydrogen), or from
 the uncertainty of calculations involving heats of solution of the pro
 ducts of voltaic reaction.

of solution, these complications are, to   a large extent, avoided  ; and,
as a matter of experiment, two fluid cells made up of metals immersed
each in its own fused chloride, give results nearer the theoretical
values than those obtained   with aqueous solutions. This is specially
noticeable in the case of metals with high heats of oxidation as in the
case of magnesium and aluminium.
   The electromotive forces of cells containing pairs of the metals,
tin, lead, and zinc, come oat nearest to the theoretical values.       The
other metals which were tried did not give so close an agreement,
but can be brought into agreement by applying constant corrections,
one for each metal ; and reasons are given for attributing these
corrections to the high temperatures of the cells as compared with
the temperatures for which the recognised heats of combination are
true.
   Four of the cells were tested by passing currents through them in
both directions alternately, and noting the electromotive force after
the passage of each current. Polarisation was observed to a small
extent in one case— zinc-silver; in the others it was practically
absent.

                               (Abstract.)
   Continuing the examination of the physiological action of various
pure organic nitrites of the paraffin series (Part I ; Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
                                                       '
1891), the authors have studied their effect on striated muscular
tissue. When the vapours of these nitrites come into contact with
the mnscle a paralysant effect is observed.         All the experiments
were made with the triceps     and  gastrocnemius of R-ana temporaria.
The muscle was contained in a specially constructed              air-tight
chamber, which, whilst it admitted of connexion being made between
the muscle and the recording apparatus, rendered it possible to bring
into contact with the muscle the vapour of a known quantity of the
nitrite without any loss taking place. A very extensive series of
experiments was necessary, as it is unsafe to contrast the gastro
cnemius of one frog with that of another, so that the action of every

member     of the series of nitrites had to be contrasted with each of
the other members          on the companion gastrocnemii of the same
animal, and      each experiment was repeated three times, and often
five or six times.     The amounts of the nitrites employed       varied be
tween    ^  and       c.c.
    Several series of concordant results have thus been obtained which
lead to two different orders of activity, viz., (1) with reference to
the    extent   to   which     equal quantities of nitrites shorten the
resting muscle, and           (2) with reference to the rapidity with
which the shortening is produced.           The order of activity of the
nitrites as regards the extent of the shortening they induce is as
follows : — (i) Iso-butyl, (ii) tertiary amyl, (iii) secondary butyl,
 (iv) secondary propyl, (v) propyl, (vi) tertiary butyl, (vii) batyl
 (viii) a-amyl, (ix) /3-amyl, (x) ethyl, (xi) methyl. The order
representing the speed with which shortening occurs is (i) methyl,
(ii) ethyl, (iii) secondary propyl, (iv) tertiary amyl, (v) primary
propyl, (vi) tertiary batyl, (vii) secondary butyl, (viii) «-amyl,
(ix) /3-amyl, (x) primary butyl, (xi) iso-butyl.
    The effect of these nitrites in interfering with the active contrac
 tion of a stimulated muscle has also been studied, and it has been
 ascertained that very minute doses, insufficient to cause passive con
 traction, interfere in a marked degree with the active contraction
 and cause the muscle to fail in responding to stimulation, whilst the
companion muscle, contained in a closed chamber free from nitrite
vapour, still responded to stimulation.
    The remainder of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the con
 nexion between the various phases of physiological action and the
 chemical constitution of the nitrites which give rise to them.         This
 discussion cannot be adequately abstracted.         The principal conclu
 sions which have been arrived at are briefly as follows : — The
 physiological action of these nitrites is not solely, and in some cases
 not even mainly, dependent on the amount of nitroxyl (N0a) they
 contain.
    In  respect of all phases of physiological activity, the secondary and
 tertiary nitrites are more powerful than the corresponding primary
compounds.        This is to be chiefly attributed not to the direct physio
logical action of the secondary and tertiary groups, but to the great
 facility with which these compounds suffer decomposition mainly
 into the alcohol and nitrous acid.      In respect of the acceleration of
 the pulse, the power of the nitrites is directly as their molecular
 weight, and inversely as the quantity of nitroxyl they contain. They,
therefore, fall into an order of physiological activity which is identical
 with that in which they stand in the homologous series. This same
relationship, increase of physiological activity corresponding with
rise in molecular weight, may also be traced, though less uniformly,

 1892.]         On the  Estimation of Uric Acid in Urine.             93
in their power of reducing blood-pressure,   and of inducing   muscular
contraction.
   This order appears to be the result not so much of the direct
physiological influence of the substituted methyl groups as of the
increased chemical instability which their presence confers on the
higher members of the series. In respect of the duration of sub
normal pressure, as well as of the rapidity with which muscular con
traction ensues, the activity of the nitrites is expressed by an order
which is for the most part the reverse of that representing their
power in accelerating the pulse, reducing blood-pressure, and con
tracting muscular fibre, this order being in general contrary to that
of the homologous series. In these respects the more volatile nitrites
of low molecular weight which contain relatively more nitroxyl are
the most active.       It appears probable that these simpler nitrites
more readily attach themselves to certain constituents of blood and
muscle, and thus act more quickly than the higher compounds, whilst
their greater stability causes their effects, i.e., reduction of blood-
pressure, Ac., to endure for a greater length of time than that of the
higher and more easily decomposed bodies.
   A large proportion of an organic nitrite is changed into nitrate in
its passage through the organism, and is excreted as an alkali nitrate
in the urine.
   The results which have been gained by this research have an im
portant bearing on the therapeutic employment of the nitrites.
It   is proposed elsewhere to consider what the outcome of this
investigation is for practical medicine.
V.     " On   the Estimation of Uric Acid in Urine : a New
      Process by means of Saturation with Ammonium Chloride."
      By F. Gowland Hopkins, B.Sc, Gull Research Student at
      Guy's Hospital. Communicated by Dr. Pte Smith, F.R.S.
      Received May 30, 1892.
   The process to be described depends upon the following facts : —
   1. Ammonium urate is wholly insoluble in saturated solutions of
ammonium chloride.
   2. If solutions, such as urine, which contain the mixed urates of
different bases be saturated with ammonium chloride, the large
mass-influence of the latter ensures the rapid and complete conver
sion of all the uric acid into biurate of ammonium, which, in accord
ance with (1), is, pari passu, thrown out of solution.    In the case of
urine, saturation with ammonium chloride is followed by a complete
precipitation of the uric acid present in the course of two hours at
most.

 94                          Mr. F. G. Hopkins.                  [June  16,
   It has long been known that ammonia, and salts of ammonia, will,
 after long standing, so completely precipitate the nric acid from
urine that subsequent treatment with acids produces no further pre
cipitate (Wetzlar, ' Beitrage zur Kenntniss            des menschlichen
 Harns,' Frankfurt a.M. 1821, p. 19). Fokker, moreover, observed
that when a solution of any urate is made alkaline, and then mixed
¦with a solution of ammonium chloride, the uric acid slowly separates
out as the biurate of ammonia.         Upon this observation the well-
known Fokker- Salkowski process is based.
   But the crucial fact that saturation with the ammonium chloride
renders the separation rapid and absolutely complete does not seem
to have been previously observed.       The importance of this fact in
any attempt to estimate uric acid by means of its separation as
ammonium urate will be seen when it is remembered that, hitherto,
in all such processes a large correction has to be made to allow for
incomplete separation, even after long standing.         In the Fokker-
Salkowski process, for instance, the factor which has to be added to
the result amounts to, at least, 25 per cent, of the total variable dealt
with, a necessity which would seem to render the process of little
scientific value {vide Fokker, Pfliiger's ' Archiv,' vol. 10, p. 157,
1875; Salkowski, Virchow's 'Archiv,' vol. 68, p. 401, 1876).            In
the method about to be described no such correction is necessary.
   The following experiments with pure urates will show the complete
separation of ammonium urate which occurs after saturation with the
chloride.
   In each case pure uric acid, prepared by means of the sulphate,
was used.      The ammonium salt precipitated was decomposed by
means of HC1, and the uric acid subsequently washed and weighed,
due allowance    being made for washings : —

  The presence of excess of bases, other than ammonia,          delays the

 precipitation, but, as stated above, two hours is amply sufficient in
 the case of urine.      (Vide note (6), infra).
     The process of estimation in urine may be carried out as follows : —
     To 100 c.c. of the urine, finely-powdered pure ammonium chloride
 is added in excess, about 30 grammes being necessary.         The solution
 is allowed to stand for two hours, with occasional stirring, and the
 precipitate then filtered off through a thin filter paper.
    The precipitate is then washed with a saturated solution of
 ammonium chloride. If a few crystals of the solid salt used for pre
 cipitation are still undissolved at the time of filtration, it is of no
 disadvantage; the light flocculent urate is easily washed first on to
 the filter, the crystals being then dissolved in a minimum of distilled
 water and used for washings.
    After it has been washed twice or thrice with the saturated
 chloride solution, the urate is washed off the paper into a small
 beaker by means of a jet of hot distilled water.
    The ammonium urate is then decomposed by boiling with a slight
 excess of HC1, the solution concentrated, if necessary, and the uric
 acid allowed to separate out. It may be finally determined by any
 accustomed method.        (Vide, however, note (c), infra).
                                     Notes.
    (a.) The ammonium chloride used must be pure.         Since 30 grammes
are used to precipitate 100 c.c. of urine, and only some 30— 40 milli
grammes of uric acid 'finally weighed, it is obviously fatal to the
accuracy of the process if even a very small percentage of insolu
ble matter is present in the salt. In some samples, sold as pure, I
have found appreciable quantities of sand, and, in others, an amount
of fibre from the filter used in the preparation of the salt equal to
2— 3 milligrammes in the 30 grammes.              Other mineral salts of
ammonia will precipitate the urate on saturation, but none are so
satisfactory as the chloride.
    (6.) The presence of free ammonia greatly accelerates the separa
tion of ammonium urate after saturation with ammonium chloride.
    The addition of AmHO to urine obviously involves the separation
of phosphates.       But, if the samples be first saturated with the
chloride, and the hydrate subsequently added, the separation of
urinary phosphates is greatly modified.          No gelatinous precipitate
comes down, but only a small quantity of triple phosphate crystals,
such as neither adds appreciably to the bulk of the urate precipitate
nor increases the difficulty of filtration (this is rendered evident if
the precipitate produced by AmCl in an acid urine be first filtered off
and AmHO added to the filtrate).
   If, therefore, time is of special importance, AmHO may be safely

                              Mr. F. G. Hopkins.                [June   16,
added after saturation      with AmCl. The orate, plus phosphate, may
now be   filtered off within ten minutes, and the uric acid liberated in
the usual way.
   In describing the process above, standing for two hours is recom
mended where AniCl is added alone.           In a very large percentage of
urines, however, if not in all, one hour will be found enough.
   (c.) The final determination of the separated uric acid may, of
course, be carried out by means of weighing on a tared filter paper,
or on a Ludwig's glass-wool filter.
   Personally, however, I greatly prefer to filter the crystals through
a small filter of the kind sold by Schleicher and Schull, and called by
them " Gehartete
                     "
                        filter paper.  From these the uric acid may be
very easily washed, without loss, into a weighed glass basin. The
washings are then evaporated to dryness on the water-bath, the
residue dried at 110° C, and weighed.
   A Volumetric Method. — Recent experience has convinced me of the
utility of permanganate solutions (vide Sutton's ' Volumetric Analysis,'
4th ed., p. 89) for the accurate titration of urates; so much so
that I believe uric acid, once separated, by any method, from ad
 mixture with other organic substances, may be better titrated than
weighed.
   At temperatures      ranging round 60° C. a perfectly determinate
reaction     occurs, involving the instantaneous decolorisation of the
permanganate ; and, though oxidation continues on standing greatly
beyond the limits of this reaction, a perfectly definite end-point is
obtainable, giving results which will be found extremely accurate.
   The uric add separated, as above, from 100 c.c. of urine is, after
washing, dissolved by warming with a minimum of Na,COj.                The
 solution is then cooled to about 15°      C,  made up to 100   c.c, trans
ferred to a flask, rapidly mixed with 20 c.c. of pure strong sulphuric
acid, and then immediately titrated with one-twentieth normal potas
sium permanganate solution.         The addition of 20 per cent, of sulph
uric acid produces just such a temperature as is required for the
reaction. The end-point is marked by the first appearance of a per
manent pink flush.         On standing, the colour continues to disap
pear, but this slow decolorisation is in marked contrast with the
instantaneous nature of the first reaction. Careful experiments with
pure urates have convinced me that uric acid may be thus estimated
to within less than half a milligramme.
   One c.c. of twentieth normal permanganate of potassium, made by
dissolving T57H grammes of the salt in 1 litre of distilled water, is
equal to 0'00375 gramme uric acid.
   In the ' Guy's Hospital Reports ' for 1891 1 have described a method
in which the ammonium urate precipitate, obtained by saturation
with AmCl, is directly titrated with permanganate.         As this precipi

high, but the method will be found sufficiently accurate for clinical

 98             On  the Estimation of Uric Acid in Urine.         [June  1 6,
 upon the use of a purer ammonium chloride, but chiefly upon a
precaution in Ludwig's method to which reference is made below.
                            Notes on other Processes.
    Having regard to the discussion at present going on with respect
to the whole question of uric acid estimation, it may not be out of
place to chronicle such experience of other processes as has been
 gained in the course of working out the method just described.
    In comparing the ammonium chloride figures with those of Lud
wig's process, the experiments marked Series 1 above indicated an
excess by the former method equal to some 3 milligrammes from the
 100 c.c. of urine.   As stated above, a part of this excess was due to
impurities in the ammonium chloride, but it was mainly due,                 I
believe, to a destruction of uric acid which occurs in Ludwig's pro
cess when the silver urate is treated with the alkaline sulph-hydrate.
It is, of course, well known that uric acid is decomposed on heating
with caustic alkalies, but it is hardly recognised with what great
ease the decomposition takes place.        I find that, on boiling 50 milli
grammes     of  pure   uric  acid briskly  for  five minutes with 10 c.c. of
Ludwig's sulphide solution (vide Nenbauer and Vogel, ' Analyse des
Harns,' p. 543), i.e., the amount used to decompose the silver salt
from 100 c.c. of urine, there is always an appreciable loss, sometimes
amounting to 3 milligrammes.         It is therefore obvious that even five
minutes' boiling would be fatal to the accuracy of an estimation. In
Series 2 above, the silver compound was thoroughly shaken up
with the sulphide in the cold, and only just heated to boiling before
filtration.
    Mr. E. Groves, B.Sc, has recently described (' Journal of Physio
logy,' December, 1891) a modification of Ludwig's method which              I
have several times employed.          Mr. Groves uses potassium iodide
instead of the sulphide to decompose the silver urate.         In my hands
the method has always given results which are decidedly too low,
owing doubtless to the action of the liberated iodine upon the uric
acid in the acidified filtrate.
    I have performed a large number of experiments with Haycraft's
method, and have found that results obtained by its means are
invariably too high, while the proportionate error undoubtedly
appears to be variable.      This appears to be the common experience.
My    own   experiments,    however,   lend no support to the extraordi
narily wide variations from the truth which some observers, espe
cially in England, have ascribed to it.          I  should put the limit of
error at from +10 to +15 per cent.
    In conclusion, it may be claimed for the separation by means of
saturation with chloride of ammonium that it yields results which

   VI. " On the Potential Difference required to produce a Spark
        between two Parallel Plates in Air at Different Pressures."
        By   J. B. Peace, M.A., Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cam
        bridge. Communicated by Professor J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.
        Beceived May 24, 1892.
                                   Introductory.
     The   following is an account of an investigation into the relations
  between    potential difference, spark-length, and pressure when dis
  charge takes place between two parallel plates in air.             The in
  vestigation was undertaken at the suggestion of Professor J.              J.
  Thomson, and has been carried out in the Cavendish Laboratory in
  Cambridge.
     Preliminary experiments were made in July and August, 1890,
  in which    a small Wimshurst machine was used, and the potential
  difference was measured by one of Lord Kelvin's vertical electro
 static voltmeters.        For sparks of some length fairly consistent
 results were obtained, but in the case of short sparks accurate
 measurement of the potential difference was difficult.        Use was then
 made of a large number of small secondary cells, and, at the same
 time, more accurate measurements           of the spark-length were made.
 At first about 500 cells were used, so that steady potential differences,
 ranging up to about 1,000 volts, could be maintained, and sparking
 differences up to about O'l mm. were examined.          The results of these
 experiments showed very fair agreement with those of other observers;
 they were sufficiently consistent among themselves to show that the
 cells could be relied on.       More cells were therefore set up, and all
 were carefully tested as to equality, rate of fall of charge, &c.
    Apparatus was then constructed by which discharge at different
 pressures could be examined.          Description of this apparatus, which
is sketched in fig. 1, and an account of the method and results of
observations made with it in July and August, 1891, are given in
Part I below. At first some difficulty was found in making the bell-
jar and its connexions sufficiently air-tight, but when this was over
come an effect similar to that observed by De la Rue and Miiller in
discharge in exhausted tubes became apparent ; that is, it was found
that, as the pressure diminished, the potential difference required to
produce a spark across a given distance fell to a minimum value, and
then began to increase rapidly.          To examine this effect more fully,
the observations were confined to pressures ranging from 20 to

100       Mr.  J. B. Peace.   Potential Difference required     [June 16,
300   mm.    of mercury, the water-pump which was used, and the
stuffing-box through which the sparking distance was adjusted, not
admitting of observations at lower pressures.        The results of these
observations are tabulated below, and appear in the curves in figs. 2,
3, and 4.
   When these results were examined and compared,           it was found
that the curves connecting potential     difference and pressure not only-
exhibited the minima above mentioned, but also crossed each other,
showing that at low pressures the shorter spark required the greater
potential difference.    As this seemed a point of some importance, it
was decided to make a more direct investigation, and with this view
apparatus was constructed and observations made in April, 1892.
This apparatus is described, and the results obtained are recorded in
Part   II below.    The observations were confined to pressures ranging
from 2 or 3 up to 50 mm. of mercury, and the results confirmed and
extended those formerly obtained.
                                   Part I.
   A sketch of the apparatus used is given in fig. 1. An inverted
bell-jar, communicating with a water-pump, had its mouth ground
and fitted with a brass cover, C.     This cover carried the attachments
of the discharge plates P, P, and the micrometer screw S. The screw
had a pitch of       inch, and its head was graduated in hundredths of
a revolution.     A short steel rod, fixed to the sliding frame of the
screw and working through a stuffing-box in the centre of the cover
C, carried an insulating block, to which the upper discharge plate
could be readily attached.      The lower plate was fixed to an ebonite
disc which was rigidly suspended from the cover C. The plates were
of brass, highly polished, and were about 2f inches in diameter. The
lower plate was plane, the upper was slightly convex, having a radius
of curvature of about 9 inches.      Short flexible wires passed from the
 plates to insulated terminals passing throngh the cover.      From these
 terminals leads passed to mercury cups, M, by which connexion
 could be made, on the one hand with the leads of the telephone T,
 and, on the other hand, with leads passing to the secondary cells and
 to the voltmeter.
    The cells were arranged in groups of eighteen in series; for
 charging, the groups were arranged in parallel ; for spark discharge
 they were arranged in series, while the leads passing to M could be
 connected to the terminals of any required number of cells. In the
 discharge circuit there were also a simple make-and-break key and a
 veiy high resistance, the latter to prevent the setting up of an arc
 discharge between the plates. This resistance was usually a black-
lead line on a strip of ebonite.

1892/J     to produce a Spark in   Air  at different Pressures.       101
                                  Fig! 1.
   The path from the bell-jar to the pump passed through sulphuric
acid, and was also connected    to a mercury gauge, G. Air could be
admitted to the jar through the stop-cock K, after passing through
cotton wool and sulphuric acid.
   The following was the usual course of a series of observations : —
While the cells were charging, which generally occupied about one
half hour, the plates were polished and fixed in position, the cover
fitted to the mouth of the bell-jar, and the pump put in action. The
screw reading for contact of the plates was taken, the upper plate
being moved downwards till contact took place and completed the
telephone circuit.    The plates were set at any required distance
apart, the upper plate being, in all cases, moved downwards to its
final position.
   When the cells were charged they were allowed a few minutes to
reach a steady state and were then joined up in series, and various
groups of 500 tested by the electrostatic voltmeter ; in this, the smallest
weight being used, one scale division read 50 volts, so that direct
reading gave ten times the voltage of a single cell.        This measure
ment was repeated at intervals during each experiment, and only
those observations were preserved in which the cells either remained
practically constant, or fell in potential difference so slowly and
uniformly that accurate allowance could be made.
   The plates being now at a known distance and the air at a known
pressure, regulated by the pump on the one hand and the stop-cock
K on the other, the number of cells connected to the plates, always at
first well under what was required to produce discharge, was gradu
ally increased until the spark passed, and the potential difference

  102    Mr.  J.  B. Peace.   Potential Difference required     [June 16,
 was taken as being proportional to the number of cells.       The obser
 vations were made for a series of pressures ranging         from 20 to
 300 mm. of mercury.
    When the apparatus was first used, a fixed potential difference was
 given to the plates, and the pressure gradually lowered until a spark
 passed.   When, however, it was found that, in certain circumstances,
 a diminution of pressure required an increase of potential difference,
 this method was abandoned, and that described above was adopted.
    Within the specified range of pressure a considerable number of
observations were made in July and August, 1891, for spark-lengths
corresponding to 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, and 400 divisions of the
Rcrew head.      The mean results of these observations are given in
the following tables.     Each table represents the mean of at least
three series of observations, taken at considerable intervals of time,
and generally showing very close agreement with each other.
   From the observed potential difference the electrostatic force has
been deduced, that is, the potential difference (in electrostatic units)
per centimetre of spark-length.     The electrostatic force is given in
the third column of the following tables, the first column containing
the air pressure in millimetres of mercury, and the second the-
potential difference in volts, while d is the spark-length, as measured
above.
   The tables are represented by the curves of figs. 2 and 3, fig. 2
showing the connexion between potential difference and pressure for
various constant spark-lengths, and fig. 3 showing the connexion
between electrostatic force and pressure for the same spark -lengths.
From these are deduced the curves in fig. 4, showing the relation
between potential difference and spark-length for various constant
pressures.

   These results, and the curves representing them, present two
features, already mentioned, which call for remark.             In the first
place, the potential difference  curves  in  fig. 2 exhibit minima at pres
sures which are relatively high.       The following table (p. 107) gives
the minima shown by the curves, as drawn in fig. 2.
   In every series of observations these minima were well marked,
and for different series the pressures corresponding to the minimum
potential difference for a given spark-length were always in close
agreement.    These minima are considered again below, in connexion
with the results of Part II.

and pass above each other, or, which is the same thing, the curves
in fig. 4, showing the relation between potential difference and spark-
length for given pressures, also exhibit minima.            This effect, though
appearing consistently, was not very distinctly marked, but there
were indications that it would be more apparent at lower pressures,
and, therefore, it was thought advisable to submit it to more direct
investigation.    For this purpose new apparatus was fitted up, as
 described below.

                                  Part II.
   The apparatus used is sketched in fig. 5.         Two pairs of plates
at different distances     apart, but with same air pressure, were
arranged in parallel, so that an alternative path was offered to the
discharge.    The two pairs of plates were enclosed in two small
receivers.   The lower plate in each rested on an insulating stand ; the
upper plate was supported and separated from the lower by small thin,
discs of ebonite, mica, or glass.    The four plates used were plane, and
the thickness of the separating discs, as measured by the screw
calipers, is taken as the length of the spark. The receivers rested on
well-ground brass base plates, into each of which were sealed two
narrow glass tubes, containing mercury, and having sealed platinum
wires passing to the outside ; flexible wires passed from the discharge-
plates and dipped into the mercury in the tubes.            One of these
tubes served also, in each case, to give connexion with the pumps.
Two pumps were used, the water pump for rapid exhaustion to about
30 or 40 mm. of mercury, the mercury pump for lower pressures.
Pressures of from 2 to 3 mm. of mercury were easily reached, and
could be maintained for any length of time.

                          To tb» C*Us.
   The platinum wires, in connexion with the plates, dipped into
mercury cups in the paraffin blocks N\ and N8 ; from these leads
passed to the block M, where either one pair of plates, or both, could
be connected to the leads passing to the cells.       The cells were used
in the same manner as before ; the potential difference, however,
instead of being reckoned as proportional to the number of cells
applied, was measured directly by a cylinder quadrant electrometer.
This was used in order to avoid a fresh examination into the uni
formity of the cells.

1892.]     to  produce a Spark in    Air at different Pressures.        109
   The apparatus was set up, and the observations tabulated below
were made in April, 1892.          These observations were confined to
pressures lower than 50 mm.        In each case the two pairs of plates
had air-gaps of very different length, so that each series of
observations amounted to a determination of two separate potential
difference and spark-length curves. The sparks were separately
examined, until pressures were reached at which the potential differ
ences necessary for discharge became nearly equal, and then the two
pairs of plates were simultaneously connected to the cells.             The
crossing  of  the potential difference  curves  was  thus directly verified,
a slight lowering of the pressure transferring the discharge from the
shorter to the longer air-gap.
   The plates used in this experiment were, all four, plane and
polished.    Two were of brass, one of copper, and one of zinc. When
the different plates were interchanged between the long spark-gap
and the short, no difference was observed in the potential difference
required for discharge at given difference and air-pressure. That
there might be no doubt as to whether the discharge was passing
actually between the plates, or was taking a longer path from edge to
edge, the edges of the plates were only very slightly rounded off. At
low pressures there was considerable tendency to a brush discharge
from the edges, but this was considerably reduced by an extremely
thin coating of shellac varnish.
   The results given below are those of three single series of observa
tions made on April 21, 22, and 23, respectively. All of these were
repeated on the same or other days, and in all cases there was almost
exact agreement.       For convenience of reference these series are
called A, B, and C, the suffix 1 referring to the left-hand, and the suffix
2 to the right-hand, spark-gap.        As in the former case, the tables
give corresponding pressure, potential difference in volts (V), and
electrostatic force in C.G.S. units (F). Curves, similar to those given
in fig. 2 and 3, representing potential difference and pressure, and
electrostatic force and pressure, are also given in figs. 6 and 7.

the supported plate, especially in those cases in which several thick
nesses of mica or ebonite were used.    The essential point of this part
of the investigation, however, was not the accurate determination of
spark-length,    but the direct comparison of discharge across two
spark-gaps known to be of very different length.

   The appearance of the spark-discharge changed with the pressure
in the usual manner.            At ordinary pressures the discharge was a
bright    white   spark, gradually passing, as the pressure was lowered,
into a purplish glow. In the case of the flat and convex discs of
Part I, the purple discharge, at first central and narrow, gradually
spread out and at low pressures filled the space between the plates.
The appearance of the spark could not, however, be carefully
examined, as the circuit was always broken as soon as discharge
occurred in order to avoid damage to the surfaces of the plates.
When these were examined by breathing on them after a number
of sparks had passed at low pressures, it was always found that
the part of the surfaces most affected by the discharge was an annulus
at some little distance from the centre.             With the flat plates used in
Part TI, the discharge was generally diffused over the space between
the plates.
   Observations of spark discharge between plates in air at different
pressures have been made by Warren de la Rue and H. Miiller* and
by Macfarlane.f         Their results do not present the features to which
attention has been called in the present paper, nor could they do so,
as the curves for potential difference and pressure for the spark-
lengths they examined would show no evidence of a minimum poten
tial difference at the lowest pressures they considered.             In both cases
the spark-length was about 0-13 inch, and the lowest pressure 20 mm.
of mercury.
   In conclusion,      I   have to express my thanks to Professor J. J.
Thomson, to whom          I  have been indebted for advice and suggestions

             Influence of Magnetisation on Corrosion of Steel.
   In connexion with, and during the progress of, the electrical portion
of my research on " Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron,"
Parts I, II, and     III  (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vols. 42, 44, and 46), numerous
gravimetric experiments were conducted, with the object of investi
gating the influence of magnetisation on the corrosion of iron and
steel.   I selected as the corrosive fluid a solution of cupric chloride,
being partly guided in this choice by the results obtained with
solutions of this salt in the electrical portion of the investigation.

   The action    of this salt on iron and steel is also very powerful, and
  ensures freedom from the disturbing influences of violent effervescence.
  Moreover, the results obtained with a copper solution of this nature
  afforded an opportunity of simultaneously obtaining an indication of
  the influence of magnetisation on the electrolytic deposition of copper
  from its solutions on iron and steel. The investigation was conducted
  as follows : the steel bars employed were of the lengths and diameters
  given in Table I, each pair being cut adjacently from a long finely-
  polished rod, so that the bars were as near as practicable alike in
 general composition and structure.        For every set of experiments one
 of the steel bars was magnetised, the other being retained in its un-
 magnetised state.       The bars were each weighed on the balance, and
 afterwards each bar was immersed in an equal quantity of cupric
 chloride solution, in separate beakers, a considerable       distance apart
 (see fig. 1) ; the two beakers were of the same diameter and fluid
 capacity ; the bars were placed in the beakers in the position shown
 in fig. 1.   On the completion of the periods of immersion stated in
                                     Fig. 1.
Table     I, each bar   was taken out, and on removal     from the solution
the electro-deposited copper was mostly found surrounding the steel
bar in the form of a compact hollow pipe or cylinder ; this was easily
drawn off from the remains of the steel bar, which formed a kind of
core within.       The rods were carefully washed and cleansed from any
loosely adherent copper and carbonaceous          deposit, dried, and then
weighed.       A  new pair of finely polished steel bars, one magnetised,
the other unmagnetised, was prepared in the above-named               manner
for every experiment.       The results obtained are stated in Table I.
    The cupric chloride solution was prepared as follows : 4 ounces of
crystallised cupric chloride were dissolved in 20 fluid ounces of water,
and each steel bar was immersed as previously described in an equal
quantity of this solution. A fresh solution of CuCl was prepared for
every set of observations, and the methods resorted to, with manipu

lative care, ensured exactitude for purposes of comparison between
the behaviour of the magnetised and unmagnetised steel bars in the
corrosive fluid.
   An average of the twenty-nine experiments in Table I indicates an
increase of corrosion in the steel due to magnetic influence of about
3 per cent, under the conditions of experimentation.
   The steel bars were not highly magnetised, and        I purposely ex
posed them to the action of the solution for somewhat long periods
in the present experiments, as thereby, perhaps, affording a better
indication of the influence of magnetisation on general corrosion, the
almost immediate effect of magnetisation on the corrosion of steel
having been demonstrated in the electrical observations of Part II.
   It is probable that the deviation in the individual results of
Table I, in the extent of the loss by corrosion, may be attributed to
variation in the extent to which the several bars were magnetised.
The results recorded in the present paper indicate that magnetisation
exerts an effect, though small, on the extent of the corrosive action of
copper salts on iron and steel. This is probably owing to the local
currents, set up by magnetisation between the polar and central
 portions of the bars, inducing somewhat greater chemical action.
    In some of the experiments with the copper solution which con-
 tained the more highly magnetised bars, the copper solution was of a
perceptibly lighter colour towards the end of an experiment when
compared with the colour of the copper solution containing the
unmagnetised steel bar.

    A study of the spectra of flames offers many points of interest. It is
                                             '
 long since A. Mitscherlich (Poggendorff's Annalen,' vol. 116, p. 499 ;
vol. 121, p. 459) showed that the spectra of flames are, for the
most part, those of compounds of the elements present, and contain
comparatively few rays proceeding directly from the elements them
selves.   But there are many questions still undecided. For example,
it is not known whether the vibrations which give the spectra of com
pounds in flames are those which the molecules of the compounds in
question woald assume under the action of a high temperature alone,
 or whether they are not vibrations of a different order, arising during

chemical changes, and deriving their energy directly from the
 chemical energy of the interacting substances.           When the absorption
 spectrum of a compound is observed to correspond with its emission
spectrum in a flame, we may infer that the vibrations are those which
the compound molecule assumes when sufficiently heated.                 But there
are not many         cases  in  which    this  has been   observed.    We    have
observed it in the case of cyanogen ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 44, p. 247,
note), but we are not certain of any other case. The difference
between the spectrum of the base of a flame and that of the upper
part, observed in many flames, lends support to the supposition that
there are rays which originate in the chemical change, perhaps
occurring in the molecules which are in intermediate stages of the
change, and not assumed by the molecules which are the final pro
duct, even -when intensely heated in the upper part of the flame.
The fact that the same rays which are seen in the base of a flame
may be sometimes generated by electric discharges in the gases which
are burnt in the flame, or in their products of combustion, is not at
all inconsistent with this supposition, for such discharges certainly
have electrolytic effects, and may very well give rise to molecules in
the intermediate stages between one state of chemical combination
and another.*       The flames of substances, such as the organo- metallic
compounds, into which metals enter as chemical ingredients, have not
hitherto, so far as we know, been observed, and it is to two such
flames that these notes refer.
                   Spectrum    of the Flame of Nickel- Carbony I.
   The remarkable compound of nickel and carbonic oxide, Ni(CO)4,
discovered by Mr. Mond, burns in air with a luminous, smoky flame,
and the spectrum it emits appears to be a continuous one. When the
vapour is burnt in oxygen instead of in atmospheric air, the spectrum
still appears to be quite continuous ; in fact, such a spectrum as
carbonic oxide, without any nickel, gives under similar circumstances.
This, however, is only in appearance, because the brightness of the
continuous spectrum overpowers the feebler bands and lines which
belong to the flame of the nickel compound. These bands and lines
come out when the vapour of the nickel compound is diluted with a
   * It is sometimes assumed in books on chemistry that tho atoms whioh form a
chemical compound can never be in an intermediate state between complete separa
tion and complete combination. So inconceivable an assumption would hardly have
been made except to support a theory, but it has nevertheless obtained a certain
currency.    It is supported by no fact and no analogy. Two atoms wliich are
within the spheres of each other's influence, but have not yet reached the state of
relative tranquillity which we recognise as chemical combination, may very con
ceivably be the seat of very violent agitation and vibratory motions, which cease
when they are actually combined.

good deal of hydrogen.    We have employed two methods of making
such a mixture.   The first was by passing stream of dry hydrogen,
                                                      a
mixed with carbonic oxide, over reduced nickel in a glass tnbe, and
burning the issuing gas in a double jet with oxygen either outside
or inside the burning gas.         The nickel was freshly reduced at           a
gentle heat with hydrogen, and allowed to cool in carbonic oxide.
When quite cold the stream of mixed hydrogen and carbonic oxide
was found to take up quite enough nickel at the temperature of the
room, and would continne to do so for some hours.              After    time,
                                                                          a
however, the nickel required to be again warmed in               acurrent of
hydrogen, when some water was given off, and the metal recovered
its sensitiveness.     Another plan was to pass         stream of hydrogen
                                                          a
through a  JJ   -tube containing a little of the liquid nickel compound
in the bend. The result was the same in each case, but the propor
tion of vapour of the compound was more easily varied (by simply
varying the proportion of carbonic oxide in the stream of gas) in the
former method.        The mixed gas and vapour burnt in air with a
smoky   flame,   but in a full supply of oxygen with a bright yellowish-
green flame without visible smoke.          The first jet we used was of
platinum,   but   nickel-carbonyl deposits nickel at a red heat, so that
the platinum soon became coated with a thick deposit of nickel, which
choked the orifices.      This nickel adhered so closely to the platinum
that it could not well be removed mechanically, and had to be dis
solved off. We found          it,
                                therefore, more convenient to use a jet
made of    a  piece of porcelain tube, about       cm. in diameter, with a
                                                      1
narrow porcelain tube, fitted by means of a cork, in the axis of the
wider tube. The mixed gas and vapour were passed either through
the inner or through the outer tube, and oxygen through the other.
The porcelain being a bad conductor, no nickel was deposited on it,
except close to the orifice, whence              could be easily removed
                                                 it
 mechanically    without   disturbing   the  apparatus.     The porcelain, of
course, added some lines to the spectrum, but these were easily
detected. In fact, we noticed only the lines of sodium, calcium, and
lithium.
   The spectrum of the flame of the nickel-carbonyl thus diluted con
sists of two parts (1) the spectrum of the main body of the green
                         :
flame, (2) that of the base of the flame when the oxygen      outside,
                                                                     is
and of the surface of the small inner cone when the oxygen     inside,is
the flame.
   The spectrum of the main body of the flame consists of a series of
shaded bands, brightest in the green, but extending on the red side
beyond the red line of lithium, and on the violet side well into the
blue, though with rapidly diminishing distinctness. These bands have
their sharp bright edges on the more refrangible side, that is, they
are turned in the opposite direction to the bands produced by electric

  120       Profs. G. D. Liveing and       J.  Dewar.     On the    [June 16,
 discharges    in carbonic oxide at low pressure.       The positions of the
 bright edges of the bands in the flame of          the nickel-carbouyl have
 some correspondence         with those of the bands produced by electric
 discharges in carbonic oxide, but it is not a very close one, and may
 be only accidental.        With the dispersion employed, which gives a
 difference of deviation of 2° 52' between D and F, there was no sign
 of a resolution of these bands into lines.        The brightest bands had;
 however, their more refrangible edges pretty sharply defined, while
 the less bright bands, especially those in the blue, were very hazy.
 A certain amount of continuous spectrum, of course, overlay the
 bands, and made them somewhat less distinct.              Photographs show
 that this continuous spectrum continues as far as          \ 3500, but fading
 sensibly   from   A- 4200   onwards.  The   photographs    do  not show any
 extension of the bands beyond the blue.
    Besides the bands, a few lines, but only a few, in the visible part of
the spectrum, extend into the upper part of the flame. Of these few
only one is a known line of nickel ; it is the green line X 5476. This
was also the only line of nickel which we observed in the visible part
of the spectrum in explosions of hydrogen and oxygen in a nickel-
lined tube (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 36, p. 475).
   In the ultra-violet part of the spectrum of the flame a great
number of nickel lines were photographed ; indeed, by far the greater
part of the lines of nickel found by us in the arc (' Phil. Trans.,'
vol. 179 (1888), A, p. 247) between A. 3972 and            \  29435. In this
case also there is a close correspondence between the spectra of the
flame and of the explosions, except that the lines of the flame are
much more numerous than those recorded of the explosions.                 This
difference,   however,   is  probably due to  the much   shorter  exposure of
the photographs of explosions.          Although the photographs show
lines as high as X 2943, the lines in this region are very faint, and
gradually die out in proceeding from the less to the more refrangible
side of the spectrum. In the region about L, M, and N the lines are
very strong, so that it is for rays of those rates of vibration that
nickel is most sensitive at the temperature of the flame.
    Turning now to the base of the flame, we find a great number of
lines, of which most extend but a short distance from the bottom of
the flame.      They form two principal groups, one in the orange and
red, and the other in the citron and yellow.         These lines are for the
most partly sharply defined, and in the more refrangible parts of each
group very fine and closely set.          They are probably channellings
following Rydberg's         law, and  somewhat    confused by overlapping.
The diagram indicates the strongest of these Hues, as they appear on
the background of shaded bands in the flame. It is drawn to a scale-
of oscillation frequencies.
   None of these lines appear to be nickel lines, and, as they are limited

to the base of the flame, they cannot   be ascribed to any of the final
products of the combustion, such as nickel oxide, but must be due
either to the as yet unaltered molecules of nickel carbonyl, or to some
molecules   intermediate between that compound and the products of
combustion which have only a transitory existence, and may perhaps
have a 'transitory agitation of a particular kind imparted to them by
the chemical energy which changes its form in the combustion.

    The more refrangible lines in the foregoing table were very faintly
depicted on the photographic plate, and it is possible that a more
lengthened exposure than the fifteen minutes, which we employed in
the region where the lineB were faint, would have brought out more
lines. The continuous spectrum of the limelight extends some dis

 observe any fairly strong rays which might be peculiar to the flame.
 In the visible part of the spectrum the three well-known rays of zinc
 in the blue X 4812, 4721, and 4681 were easily seen. Photographs of
 the more refrangible part of the spectrum showed no trace of the
 ultra- violet lines of zinc ; no more, in fact, than the flames of hydro
 carbons usually show.      Nor did there appear to be any rays from the
 base of the flame other than those seen in hydrocarbon flames in
general.      In our observations on explosions (loc. cit.) we did not find
that a zinc lining to the tube in which the oxy-hydrogen gas was
exploded brought out any zinc line, either in the visible or ultra
violet part of the spectrum. The flame of the compound containing
zinc chemically combined may be supposed to give the rays of zinc
more readily .than the exploding gases, which merely take up the
metal mechanically. But the flame does not, in either case, seem hot
enough to develop the ultra-violet rays, though these are very strongly
developed in the arc.
IX. " Preliminary Note on the Pressure developed                   by some
       New Explosives."          By Captain Noble, C.B., F.R.S.         Re
       ceived June 10, 1892.
    For a considerable time     I  have, with the assistance of Sir P. Abel
and Professor Dewar, been engaged          in researches   upon the new ex
plosives which during the last few years have attracted so much
attention, and which apparently are destined to do much in develop
ing the power of modern artillery.
    From the nature of these researches and the considerable scale
upon which they have to be conducted, as well as from certain diffi
culties which have manifested themselves,         I  am not at present in a
position to submit to the Royal Society the results of these experi
ments ; but, as one particular portion throws light upon a question of
considerable importance,      I  propose very shortly to give the results at
which     I have arrived, leaving fuller details for a subsequent communi
cation.
    Artillerists of all nations are pretty well agreed that, save under
exceptional circumstances, the maximum working pressure in a gnn
should not exceed 17 tons per square inch or, say 2500 atmospheres.
                                                        I
The reasons for this limitation are weighty, but need not here dis
cuss them.      Now, taking cordite and pebble powder as illustrations,
since we can, even in guns not designed to fire the former explosive,
obtain with the same maximum pressure, energies higher than those
obtained with pebble powder by nearly 50 per cent., it is obvious that

124             Capt. Noble.      Preliminary Note on   the       [June   1(5,
this extra energy must be obtained from the development of higher
pressures in the forward portions of the guns, and it naturally became
a question of considerable importance to determine over what surface
these higher pressures extended, and to ascertain if they in any
serious degree affected the safety of the chase.
    At Woolwich, to settle this point, certain guns were prepared in
which crusher gauges were placed at various points along the bore,
and results were obtained to which I shall presently more particularly
allude ; but, considerable doubt having been thrown on the reliability of
these crusher gauges,   I  considered it desirable in a matter of so great
importance to ascertain the pressures by altogether independent means,
and thus either confirm the crusher-gauge results, or, if the two sets
 of results should prove to be not altogether in accordance, to throw
 some light upon the causes of such discrepancies as might exist.
    The crusher gauge       is,
                             to those who interest themselves with such
 subjects, so well known, that    I shall not attempt here to describe      it,
 andI   will only say that have very great confidence in the accuracy
                            I
 of its results when properly used. Personally   I     have during the last
 twenty-five years     made   many    thousand    observations  with these
 gauges, and when properly prepared and judiciously used, not only
 have I   found their results accordant inter se, butI      have by totally
 different determinations corroborated their accuracy. But have always
                                                              I
 held that this gauge and all similar gauges will cease to be either
 reliable or accurate if  there be any probability of the products of ex
 plosion being projected into the gauge at   a    high velocity, the energy
 stored up in such products being impressed on the gauge in the form
 of pressure, and this contingency might and does arise either when
 the gauge is   placed in the forward part of a gnn, where necessarily
 the products are in rapid motion, or in the case of the detonation of
a  high explosive but, as
                  ;           I have gone pretty fully into this question
 elsewhere,
          I     need not here pursue the subject further.
    The crusher-gauge determinations for cordite, made at Woolwich
 for the Explosives Committee, under the presidency of Sir F. Abel,
 having been made in a 4-7-inch quick-firing gun, arranged a similar
                                                   I
 gun in such a manner that        was able to obtain a curve determined
                                  I
 from the time at which the projectile passed sixteen points arranged
 along the bore.      From this curve, by methods    I      have elsewhere
 described, the curve giving the velocity at all points of the bore can
 be deduced, and from the curve of velocity the pressures generating
 these velocities can also be deduced.
    For the particular purpose of this investigation  it   was desirable to
 compare the pressures of different explosives, and the present note
 gives the result of four explosives differing widely in nature and in
  composition.
    The explosives used were as follows —:

    a.  Ordinary pebble powder of the Service.             A   charge   of  12   lbs.  •
was used     ; this charge gave rise to a mean pressure of 15-9 tons per
square     inch   (maximum, 16'8 ; minimum, 14'9), or a mean of 2424
atmospheres (maximum, 2566 ; minimum, 2277) as determined by
the crusher gauge in the powder chamber.              It gave to a 45-lb. pro

temperature of 0° C. and a barometric pressure of 760 mm. generates
280 c.c. of permanent gas, and develops 720 gramme units of heat.

                                                                                       '
38 per cent, of ammonia nitrate, and 22 per cent, of charcoal.                   The
charge in this case was 10 lbs. 8 ozs., and the mean crusher gauge
pressure was 15'3 tons per square inch (maximum, 16 4 ; minimum, i
14"2), or a mean of 2332 atmospheres (maximum, 2500; minimum,
2165) ; the muzzle velocity with the same projectile was 2036
ft.-secs., and the muzzle energy 1293 ft.-tons. A gramme of amide:
powder generates 400 c.c. of permanent gases, and develops 821 units
of heat.                                                                               I
    c.  Ballistite.   With this true smokeless powder the charge was re
duced to 5 lbs. 8 ozs., the sides of the- cubes being 0'2 inch. The
mean crusher-gauge pressure was 14 3 tons per square inch (maxi
mum, 14'5; minimum, 14'1), or a mean of 2180 atmospheres
 (maximum, 2210 ; minimum, 2142).                 The muzzle velocity was
2140 ft.-secs., and the muzzle energy 1429 ft.-tons.                A gramme of
ballistite generates      615 c.c. of  permanent gases,         and  gives rise to
 1365 gramme units of heat.
     d. With the fourth explosive, Cordite, a charge of 5 lbs. 10 ozs. of
,0'2 inch diameter was fired.       The mean chamber crushcr-gaugo pres
 sure was 13'3 tons per square inch (maximum, 13 6 ; minimum, 12 9),
 or a mean of 2027 atmospheres (maximum, 2070 ; minimum, 1970).
 The muzzle velocity was 2146 ft.-secs., and the muzzle energy 1437
 ft.-tons.     A gramme of cordite generates 700 c.c. of permanent gases
 at 0° C. and 760 mm. of barometric pressure.              The quantity of heat
 developed is    1260  gramme   units.    In the  case  of this explosive, as well
 as in that of ballistite, a considerable quantity of aqueous vapour has
 to be added to the permanent gases.
     The results of these observations are graphically given in the
  figure. The ordinates show both the positions at which the pres
  sures were determined, and the magnitudes of these pressures.                    On
  the axis of abscissa? is shown the travel of the shot in feet.

that is to say, three rounds with the breech and three with the muzzle
plugs, or six in all.
   In the calculation of the pressures it is assumed that before and
after the complete ignition of the explosive the pressures will uni
formly increase and then uniformly decrease, following the laws
regulating the relation between the pressure and volume when per
manent gases are permitted to expand with production of work.
   It is in the highest degree improbable that in any experiment
is this assumption strictly true. In the case of " brisante powders,
                                                               "
and of high explosives which can be detonated, we know that even in
moderately-sized chambers there are wide variations in pressure; and
even when there is comparatively slow combustion, as with ballistite
and cordite, it appears probable that the generation of a consider
able quantity of the gases may take place in different portions of the
lx>re, giving rise to a corresponding difference in the pressure, and it
may be that a portion of the discrepancies of the crusher gauge when
placed in forward positions in the bore, to which       I  shall presently
allude, are due to this cause.
   But such irregularities would not very seriously alter the curves
shown in the figure. The areas inclnded between the final ordinate,
the curve, and the axis of abscissa?, being the total energy impressed
on the projectile, would of course remain unaltered ; but the curves,
instead of the regular figure there shown, would have a wavy
outline, and would show several maxima and minima. These irregu
larities of press are are of no appreciable importance when the
strength of the gun, in a radial direction, is considered.
   From the same plate can be at once obtained the pressures for the
four explosives at any point of the bore; bnt for the purpose of
applying these results to other guns I give in the annexed table for
different densities of the products of explosion (1) the pressure which
has been determined in a closed vessel, (2) the pressure at the same
density, which has been found to exist in the bore of the 4' 7-inch
gun where the gases have been expanded, doing work on the pro
jectile.

   It  must be understood that the differences existing between the
close-vessel pressures and the pressures observed in the bore at the
higher gravimetric densities are, in great measure, due to the explo
sive at these densities not being fully consumed.                  An examination of
the results obtained would lead to the conclusion that with the
particular size of cordite employed tolerably complete combustion
cannot be assumed to have taken place until the projectile has
travelled some 6 or 7 feet through the bore. Indeed, if the size of
cordite fired in this gun be even slightly increased, a portion of the
cordite is blown from the muzzle unburned, and it is one of the most

striking proofs of the regular combustion of the explosive that in all
such recovered cordite the diameter is so uniformly decreased that it
might readily be mistaken for newly-manufactured cordite of smaller
dimensions.
    I now make a comparison between the pressures given by cordite
as shown on curve B (see fig.) and those obtained from crusher
gauges.     To facilitate this comparison I have added to the pressure
         I
curves have described a curve showing the pressures developed by
cordite wlien fired in a close vessel, and I have further added the
results of five rounds of cordite fired for the Explosives Committee
in the crusher-gauge gun, the pressure of each individual round at
each point of observation being indicated.
    The sample of cordite used in these experiments was not of the
same make as that employed in my own. The pressures given on the
axis of y denote those taken in the powder chamber, and are compar
able with the crusher-gauge pressures I have given as derived from
 my own experiments.       It will be observed that the mean chamber
 pressure indicated is two- or three-tenths of a ton higher than that
                                                      I
 I obtained ; but it will be further observed that if attempt to draw
 a pressure curve through the mean of the crusher-gauge observation,
 sui-h curve would indicate pressures far higher than are necessary
 and sufficient to develop the work impressed on the projectile.
    Again, the pressures indicated after the projectile has moved
 1 foot are about 2 tons per square inch higher than those observed in
the powder chamber, and it will be further noticed that not only are
 these observations, at all events at certain points, considerably too
 high, but they exhibit in the forward part of the bore variations
 quite unknown when the pressures are taken in the powder chamber.
    Thus, in the particular experiments I am discussing, the mean
 pressure in the powder chamber being about 13-5 tons, the extreme
 variation in the five rounds amounts only to about   \\ tons per square
 inch, while the crusher gauge placed in the chase at a point about
 8j feet from the seat of the shot, gave in the same number of rounds
an extreme variation of 3 tons per square inch, the mean pressures
being only about 4 tons, and it will further be noted that, while some of
the rounds indicated pressures below those deduced by the method        I
have described, other rounds at the same point indicated pressures
even exceeding those which would have existed under the same gravi
 metric densities in a close vessel.  It may also be noted that from the
crusher-gauge experiments,      round  5 should have given the lowest
 muzzle energy of the series ; as a matter of fact it gave the highest.
    My conclusion, therefore, is that, although crusher gauges placed
in the chase may, and doubtless do, give valuable comparative results,
 they cannot be relied on for absolute determinations, unless confirmed
 by observations altogether independent in their nature.

X. "The Reserve Proteid of the Asparagus Root."               By S. H.
       Vines, F.RS., and J. R. Green, M.A., F.L.S.            Received
      June 10, 1892.
   The object of research was the determination of the nature of the
substance,  presumably a proteid, from which is formed the asparagin
which is so abundantly present in the young shoots of the plant in
the spring.    The researches were carried on during the springs of
 1691 and 1892, and results hare been obtained which are sufficiently
definite for publication.
   Microscopical Observations. — When a transverse section of a fresh
root, taken from the plant while in a state of winter-rest, is mounted
in alcohol on a slide, and is at once examined with the microscope,
some of the parenchymatous cortical cells are seen to contain rela
tively large masses of irregular shape.   When water is run under the
cover-slip these masses at once dissolve.    From their general appear
ance and their reaction with iodine these masses probably consist of
some form of proteid.
                          Chemical Observations.
   a. Watery   Extract. — The watery extract was made by pounding
the fresh root in a mortar with distilled water (generally 100 c.c.
water to 100 grams root), and straining off and filtering the liquid.
The resulting extract was faintly yellow, slightly opalescent, and
feebly acid. On boiling it gave a dense precipitate, which gave a
good xanthoproteic reaction, thus indicating its proteid nature.    The
liquid filtered off from the precipitate gave a faint xanthoproteic
reaction. In some experiments the extract was carefully neutralised
with ammonia to precipitate the phosphates, and then some common
salt (NaCl) was added to throw down a substance of unknown nature
but not a proteid, the presence of which was detected at an early
stage in the investigation ; the neutral liquid then filtered off gave
only a turbidity on boiling; when the liquid was made slightly
alkaline the same result was given; but in both cases when the
extract was made faintly acid a good precipitate was obtained on
boiling. The coagulation point was determined to be 71 — 73° C.
   The watery extract gave a good xanthoproteic reaction; a fairly good
reaction with Millon's reagent; no satisfactory reaction with acetic
acid and potassic ferrocyanide or with potassic hydrate and copper
sulphate.
   When alcohol in excess was added there was a dense precipitate
which at first was soluble again in water, but which became for the
most part insoluble if allowed to remain for some time in contact

1892.]         The Reserve Proteid        of the Asparagus Root.               131
with the alcohol.        This precipitate when suspended in water, after
prolonged contact with alcohol, gave a good xanthoproteic reaction.
   "When the watery extract was allowed to drop into a tall jar con
taining distilled water, there was no precipitation or turbidity.
Similarly, when some of the extract was diluted with fifteen times its
volume of distilled water, and a stream of COj was passed through
the liquid for 1 — 6 hours, no turbidity was apparent.
   When some of the extract was subjected to dialysis in a stream of
running water for four days, and the dialysis afterwards continued
for two days in large excess of distilled water, a finely granular pre
cipitate was formed in the dialyser, which when filtered off gave no
xanthoproteic reaction, whilst the filtrate still coagulated at 71° C.
    The proteid was therefore soluble in distilled water, being thrown
down neither by dilution nor dialysis.
    Portions of the extract were shaken up to saturation for some days
with crystals of the following neutral salts : NaCI, MgS04, MgS04
and NaaSO,, (NH^SOv
    With NaCI     there was a slight precipitation of the proteid, but the
       greater part of it remained in solution.
    With MgSOt there was a more copious, but still incomplete, pre
       cipitation of the proteid : on saturating the filtrate with NajSOi
       no further precipitate fell.
    With (NH4)2S04, when the saturation was continued for a month,
       the whole of the proteid was precipitated.
    b.  Salt Solution Extract. — This extract was prepared by using 10
 per   cent, solution of NaCI instead of distilled water, as in the former
 experiments.       The reactions were generally the same as those given
 by the watery extract ; but the undetermined substance, which is pre-
 cipitable by salt, was present in much smaller quantities, and the
 precipitates of proteid were less bulky than those given by the
 watery extract.
    Conclusions as to the Proteid. — It appears from the foregoing ex
 periments that the root of the asparagus contains a single reserve
 proteid. Inasmuch as it is readily soluble in distilled water, it is
 essentially an albumin ; at the same time, its reactions with neutral
 salts indicate a relationship to the globulins which is not manifested
 by the animal albumins. However, proteids- other than globulins are
 precipitated on saturation of their solutions with neutral salts ; thus
 Schafer* and Halliburtonf have both shown that serum-albumin is
 completely thrown down on double saturation with magnesium and
 sodium sulphates, and Kiihne and ChittendenJ have found that the

albumose8 are precipitated by NaCl from their,        in some cases neutral,
 in others faintly acid, solutions.
    Besides the proteid we have found three undetermined substances
 in the extracts, neither of which is proteid.      The first of these (1) is
 the substance which is present in considerable quantity in the watery
 extract, and which is precipitated on adding a small amount of salt.
    (2.) When a portion of the first extract is freed from proteid by boil
 ing, and then the filtrate poured into alcohol, a precipitate is formed,
 fairly copious but much less than that formed when the unboiled
 extract is similarly neutral, as described above. This remains soluble
 in water after prolonged action of the alcohol, but the solution gives
 no xanthoproteic reaction.
    (3.) When the alcohol is evaporated to dryness a sticky residue is
 left, which also is soluble in water, and its sol ution gives a fair xantho
proteic reaction.    This is not proteid, however, as it is soluble in
 alcohol.   This substance can be extracted from the fresh extract by
 dialysing it in distilled water.     On concentrating this dialysate a
 similar sticky residue is obtained.    In several cases this brown, sticky
 •riass deposited crystals of rounded  form,  much resembling in appear
 ance the well-known aggregations of leucin.          They were not leucin,
 however, as besides being solnble in cold alcohol they did not give
 the characteristic Scherer's reaction, nor did they form a compound
 with the acetates of lead or zinc. It is not improbable that this
 third undetermined substance may be allied to leucin, asparagin,
 &c, but our observations on it are as yet incomplete.

    All the new anatomical features which       I  have been able to detect

  The epistome   corresponds to the proboscis of Balanoglossus and

portions of the ccelom.

of the ccelom, divided into right and left halves by median septa,
each half communicating with the exterior by means of its own
collar canal; on the posterior face of this cavity is an ectodermal
thickening, which corresponds in position with the nerve-plate of
 Cephalodiscus and the nerve-tube of Balanoglossus.                     The collar cavi
ties are continued upwards into the tentacles, and surround the
mouth. From the pharynx a short diverticulum is given off upwards,
which is continuous with a rod-like structure, apparently half
cellular, half gelatinoid, which lies in the line along which the
median posterior septum of the collar meets the nearly vertical
septum between proboscis and collar cavities.                   It thus corresponds in
origin, structure, and position with the notochord of Cephalodiscus.
    The trunk contains the greater part of the alimentary canal.                          Its
body cavity,      as in  the  other Hemichordata, appears              to  be  completely
shut off from the paired cavity of the collar. The only part of the
intestine calling for remark is a short semicircular diverticulum,
which occurs also in Cephalodiscus.
    The points in which Rhabdopleura differs from both the other
Hemichordata are purely negative, viz., the absence of a proboscis
pore or pores, and the absence of gill-slits ; the points of agreement
are so striking that it is impossible to separate the three organisms.
    A more fully illustrated paper on the subject will shortly be
published.

I am persuaded that the ectoderm cells of the horny sponges are of
the same form and character as those in the Homoccela." By a piece of
good fortune I am now able to state that this is so.                    In a sponge
found at Naples, which appears to me to correspond fairly with
0. Schmidt's Cacospongia scalfiris, the ectodermal elements are quite
plainly to be seen even with a low power ; indeed in the specimen
examined their arrangement is more regular, invariable, and easy to
observe than in any sponge that I have yet investigated.

    In this sponge the spongoblasts of the primary fibres form a con
 tinuous tissue with the ectoderm cells and resemble them indistin-
 guisbably both in form and character ; a brief discussion of previous
 observation on this point will be found in the paper already quoted. It

the literature of the subject, except by                Polejaeff (' Keratosa,' p. 70).
As he there describes them as an exceptional structure, and as find                I
them not nearly so easily to be made out in Cacospongia as in Aplysilla*
it is possible that they have hitherto escaped notice. They are fine
black lines, having the exact appearance of the network on the surface
of an epithelium, and I regard it as beyond doubt that they mark the
lines of contact between the expanded secreting ends of the spongo
blasts.

to attempt serious comment on them until I have had the opportunity
of re-examining my preparations in the light of his conclusions. How
far his theory of a contractile ectoderm may be applicable to such an
 extreme form as that found in Cacospongia is a matter demanding
the gravest consideration.f
    The newly-established points on which we find ourselves in agree
 ment are : (1) The pores of Aseetta clathrus are composed each of a
single, nucleate, perforated cell ; these cells have by various authors
been mistaken for mesoderm cells.                  (2) The ectoderm is, in life, in a
large part composed of cells which are roughly "p-shaped in section,

     On a minor and not very novel point we are in agreement as to
 there being, at any rate commonly, at least one vacuole in the distal
part of the collar cell, frequently containing shapeless particles. As
to our differences, I am undecided whether Minchin's mesodermal

tions, the living part of the prominences contracts up the fibre like a bud. In the
axis of the fibre — at least in one specimen — I have observed a row of indubitable
cells, amoeboid in appearance ; presumably they are what Lendenfeld has described
    "

   t It  is obvious that the presence, as in this sponge, of a fairly strong cuticle, even
                 " elastic " (Schulze), renders it much more difficult to assume that the

call a Metschnikoff cell or not. I consider the natural form of active
collar cells, in this as in other sponges, as being more separated in.
their upper parts than in his figures, a large part of the surface of
the cell being washed by the water; this area behind the collar                       I
have always regarded as the ingestive surface. Mr. Minchin believes
that he has obtained evidence that the ectoderm cells really push
their way to the endoderm ; holding the views I do as to excretion,                   I
shall be very glad if re-investigation causes me to admit this correc
tion.
   Apart from our common ground, I have made the indigo-carmine
experiments with which the Society has been acquainted, and Minchin
has made his valuable observations on the changes in form of the
epithelium surrounding the oscula of Ascetta clathrus.*                     Whatever
weight     should    be   attached     to  these two factors       in  deciding the
meaning and function of the flask-shaped                   epithelium, I wish to
establish the undoubted presence of such a structure in Cacospongia,
and presumably in all Porifera.             Examining Cacospongia, and com
paring Merejkovsky's fignre of Halisarca, any one will be convinced
that this is the true explanation of the puzzling appearances seen
by various authors on the outer surface of other sponges — I would
take as examples, among very many, Schulze on Halisarca Dujardini
and Chondrosia renifurmis, Polejaeff on Janthella, Sollas on Stelletta
Normani and hops Phlegrxi, Vosmaer on Tentorium (Thecophora) and
the larva of Myxilla.         Vosmaer's figure of Myxilla (fig. 8, PI. XIV),
unites with Metschnikoff's of the young Halisarca, to show that
the flask-shaped cells appear at the earliest stages, and are probably
formed by direct metamorphosis from the columnar epithelium of the
free larva. On the other hand, the direct observations of flat epithe
lium on the outer surface are strikingly few.f
   I hold that it may take rank as an established fact that in all
groups of sponges the flask-shaped epithelium does occur.                     It must
be recognised that the structure we are to expect to find on the
exterior of any sponge is a zone of hyaline tissue traversed by necks
which unite the centre of each silver area to the nucleus and cell-
body pertaining to it. This, whatever be its physiological explana
tion, is the structure most commonly to be met with, and not a flat
epithelium, such       as clothes the canals.
   And    I believe that these cells are excretory, and identical with the
spongoblasts.
   * I should say that   I can support the figure he grres as being an accurate repre
sentation of transitions in form of epithelial cells to be met with in all the Colcarea.
I  haTe hitherto ascribed to them an entirely different significance— that where the
wall is thin, the Bpecial elongated flask-shaped form of cell is not required for
excretion.
   t The descriptions of flat epithelium — generally flagellate — by K. v. Lendenfeld
are numerous and detailed.      I attach no credit to them.

                                        (Abstract.)
   An abstract of the first part of this memoir, which dealt with the
structure and relations of the air-bladder and Weber's ossicles in the
Siluridse, was published in the Proceedings of this Society three years
ago ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 46, 1889, pp. 309—328).                        The present
contribution is a discussion of the physiology not only of this remark
able mechanism, but of the air-bladder in general.
    There is a strong a priori probability that the Weberian mechanism
is physiologically related to one of the several functions that have
been ascribed to the auditory organ or to the air-bladder, but to which
of them is a question by no means easy to answer.                          A preliminary
 difficulty  to be  encountered      is  the   complex physiological character of
 the two organs, and, apart from our imperfect knowledge of the
 physiology of the several functions assigned to each, and especially in
 the case of the auditory organ of Fishes, a further difficulty is

 140             Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.         [June 16,
afforded   by the almost total absence of any experimental evidence
directly bearing on the physiological significance of the Weberian
ossicles ; and while we desire to emphasise the danger of deducing
 function from facts of a purely anatomical nature, no other course
has yet been adopted by previous writers on this subject, and at
 present is the only one open to us ; consequently, any conclusions
based upon data so frequently unreliable and misleading must partake
rather of the nature of suggestions, and be accepted with considerable
reserve.    With the qualifications rendered necessary by these con
 siderations, some light may possibly be thrown on this difficult
problem by a careful inquiry as to how far the Weberian ossicles and
the coadapted parts of the air-bladder and auditory organ are
anatomically fitted to act as subsidiary or accessory structures in
connection with any of the several functions assigned either to the
 air-bladder or auditory organ, while unsuited for association with
others.    By this means it may at least be possible to eliminate certain
functions from any further consideration, and thereby considerably
 narrow the scope of future inquiry.
    With this object we propose to discuss (I) how far the function of
the Weberian mechanism is conditioned by the anatomical structure
 of the air-bladder and auditory organ, as well as by the character of
the mechanism itself; (II) to which of the known functions of the
 air-bladder and auditory organ the Weberian ossicles are to be re
 garded as accessory structures ; and (III) the utility of the mechanism
to the Fish possessing it.
    I. In all the Silurid® normales the air-bladder may be regarded as
consisting of two intercommunicating but physiologically distinct
portions — a posterior, represented by the two lateral compartments,
which is indistensible and inelastic, a|id always of greater internal
capacity, and an anterior, which is always more or less elastic
and expansible, but of less internal capacity than the former.
The distensibility of the anterior chamber is, however, by no
means uniform in all directions ; on the contrary, the peculiar
construction of the chamber and its , intimate relations and con
nections with neighbouring skeletal structures render it absolutely
inexpansible except laterally, that is, in a direction at right angles
to its antero-posterior axis ; and from the mode in which the
fibres forming the lateral walls of the chamber converge in the
dorsal wall, and become inserted into the crescentic processes of the
tripodes, it becomes still more obvious that it is only by inward or
outward bulgings of the lateral walls that variations in the internal
condition of the air-bladder are able to set the Weberian ossicles in
motion.     It is scarcely necessary to point out that by this restriction
of the expansion or contraction of the anterior chamber to movements
of its lateral walls, the Weberian ossicles are rendered more suscep

 1892.]          Contributions to  the Anatomy    of Fishes.           141
  tible, and therefore capable of responding to smaller variations of
 internal gaseous tension by whatever canse produced than if the
anterior chamber were equally elastic and expansible in all direc
tions.
     The increased delicacy of the Weberian mechanism in the SilnridaB
normales, as compared with other Ostariophyseae, is probably the cause
of the extensive anchylosis of the anterior vertebrae, and their rigid
articulation with the skull, for if flexibly articulated with one another
and to the skull, so as to be able to participate in the lateral flexion
of the vertebral column in ordinary locomotion, while at the same
time the vertebrae and their processes retained their intimate re
lations with the air-bladder, the anterior chamber and Weberian
ossicles could hardly fail to be affected by muscular compression.
Hence, anchylosis of the anterior vertebrae becomes almost a necessity
in the Siluridae, if the Weberian mechanism is to remain unaffected
by the more or less violent shocks produced by muscular contraction
and relaxation.     From a physiological point of view, it may be noted
in connection with the Weberian ossicles, (a) that the anterior and
crescentic processes of the tripodesare of approximately equal length,
and hence the force and amplitude of all movements imparted to one
extremity will be exactly reproduced, without augmentation, at the
other ; (5) the interposition of a lax, or at all events compressible,
ligament (interossicular ligament) in the series of ossicles ; and (e)
the rudimentary and functionless condition of the intercalarium.
     These and other facts suggest the conclusion that the Weberian
apparatus is far better adapted to register the more forcible, even if
more gradual, distensions or contractions of the anterior chamber,
rather than slight or rapidly recurring vibrations of its lateral walls.
     Finally, it may be affirmed that no differential action of the two
auditory organs can possibly take place, at all events so far as im
pulses received through the Weberian mechanism are concerned,
since the only channel through which any movement initiated in the
 fluids of the atrial cavities by the motion of the Weberian ossicles
can reach them is the median, unpaired sinus endolymphaticus (the
 "sinus impar " of Weber) ; hence it must follow that each auditory
 organ will be affected by any such disturbances to an equal extent
 and at the same moment.
     II. So far as the auditory organ is concerned, the functions of
 audition and equilibration or orientation have to be considered, and
 for the air-bladder those of phonation or sound production, respira
 tion, accessory to audition, or its function may be purely hydrostatic.
     Certain of these possible functions may be at once eliminated from
 any discussion as to the use of the Weberian mechanism.        Equilibra
 tion may be dismissed, inasmuch as there can bo no differential action
 of the two auditory organs.     The absence of intrinsic muscular fibres

 142            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. 0. Haddon.         [June  16,
 in the walls of the air-bladder, of extrinsic mnscles in all but a few
genera (Pimelodinre), and of internal vibratory diaphragms, or other
obviously vocal structures, is sufficient to prove that the air-bladder
takes little or no part in this function, at all events by any of the
ordinary methods known in other Fishes. The feeble vascularity of
the air-bladder and the absence of any inspiratory or expiratory
mechanisms are serious objections to its use as an ordinary respiratory
organ.
   In many Fishes the bladder appears to have a secondary relation
to respiration by acting as a reservoir for the superabundance         of
oxygen introduced into the blood by the gills, which can be re
absorbed when required, but Moreau's experiments prove that those
Fishes provided with a Weberian mechanism have a far less capacity
for absorbing oxygen from the air-bladder than other Teleostei     have
under precisely similar conditions, and, further, that the capacity for
oxygen absorption is always associated with the presence of retia
mirabilia or vaso-ganglia, which, as our investigations prove, are in
variably absent in all Siluridse.
    Very little is known about the physiology of hearing in Fishes, but
we are unable to see that there is any need to assume that the con
ditions of subaqueous audition are very different to those in air, ex
cept in so far as the physical differences in the conductivity of the
respective media are concerned.     Sonnd vibrations travel much more
rapidly in water than in air and to far greater distances, but they pass
with difficulty from water to air, and conversely. Those sound vibra
tions which are too feeble to produce any appreciable effect on the
external surface of the skull when they pass through air can, never
theless, strongly impress the ear when propagated in water and the
head of the observer is completely submerged (Colladon and Sturm).
Sound waves impinging on the surface of a Fish's skull would there
fore be readily conveyed to the perilymph and endolymph of the ear,
and such sounds will, in all probability, be heard with greater rapidity
and from greater distances than could possibly be the case under
similar conditions in air.
   The strongest objections to the auditory function of the air-bladder
and Weberian mechanism (Weber's theory) are to be found in the
imperfections of the apparatus. If vibrations can pass at all from the
external medium to the gases contained within the air-bladder the
transmission must be accompanied by a considerable loss of intensity,
and this must especially be the case in those Ostariophyseffl in which
the air-bladder is widely separated from the superficial skin by the
liver and other organs and tissues.      In many SiluridsB the walls of
the air-bladder are too thick to admit of their vibrating synchronously
with rapidly recurring sound waves. The inertia of the ossicles them
selves, and the interposition between them of a compressible ligament,

are insuperable objections to this theory ; and, moreover, the Fish
could have no appreciation of the direction of the sounds conveyed
through this mechanism.          Finally, it may be affirmed that, contrary
to what      might be expected if so complicated a structure as the
Weberian mechanism is an accessory to audition, there is absolutely
no evidence of the existence of exceptional powers of hearing in the
Siluridte or any other Ostariophysese.       For these reasons we conclude
that the Weberian ossicles are in no way related to the function of
 hearing, even to the subordinate and qualified extent tacitly suggested
by Hasse and Ramsay Wright.
    The only remaining view is that the ossicles under consideration
are accessory to the hydrostatic function of the air-bladder.       Moreau,
and later, Charbonnel-Salle, have completely refuted the older theory
of this function, which has usually been associated with the name of
 Borelli. Summarising the conclusions which the experimental re
 searches of these authors and certain other facts appear to warrant,
 it may be affirmed for Fishes in general : —
    (a.) The function of the air-bladder is to render the Fish, bulk for
 bulk, of the same weight as the medium in which it lives. In this
 mean condition, or plane of least effort, the Fish acquires a capacity
 for the maximum amount of locomotion with a minimum of muscular
 effort.
    (&.)   In its movements of ascent or descent the Fish becomes exposed
 to augmented or diminished pressure, which, in each case, varies in
 amount according to the variable height of the superimposed column
 of water, and this leads to an expansion or contraction of the air in
 the air-bladder, and consequently to an increase or diminution in the
 volume of the Fish itself, and thereby to a corresponding alteration
 in its specific gravity, which may temporarily remove the animal from
 its normal plane of least effort.
     (c.) The Fish has no power of varying the capacity of its air-bladder
 by direct muscular contraction, and its readjustment to a new plane
 of least effort results from a gradual increase or decrease in the
  amount and volume of the air contained within the air-bladder to an
  extent proportional to the new pressure and due to a corresponding
  modification of the processes concerned in the secretion or absorption
  of the contained gases.      Hence, by this apparently automatic method
  of adjustment, the Fish will find, sooner or later, and whatever may
  be the depth of the water and the amonnt of external hydrostatic or
  atmospheric pressure, a plane of least effort, where it will again possess
  exactly the density of the water.
     (d.) That Johannes Miiller's theory of the displacement of the centre
  of gravity upon a longitudinal axis in the case of Fishes with a two-
  chambered air-bladder has no foundation in fact.
      (e.) That, despite the obvious advantages which an air-bladder con

 144            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.            [June 16,
fere upon its possessor, there are certain attendant disadvantages,     of
 ¦which, perhaps,  the most  important   is the restriction of freedom  of
locomotion in a vertical direction, the result of the slowness with
 which the necessary secretion or absorption of gas takes place.
    The conclusions embodied in the preceding sections relate more
 particularly to the Physoclisti, by far the largest group of Teleostean
 Fishes, but it may be pointed out that in a general way they apply
also to the Physostomi, with, however, the qualification that in the
great majority of the latter group the mechanical liberation of gas
through the ductus pneumaticus takes the place of absorption as a
 means of adjustment to rednced hydrostatic pressures.
    Prom the conclusions established by Moreau and Charbonnel-Salle
 it is obvious that the varying pressures to which the gases contained
in the air-bladder are exposed constitute an important factor in the
physiology of locomotion in Fishes, and hence, in the absence of any
other tenable hypothesis as to its function, there is a strong antecedent
probability in favour of the view which Hasse was the first to saggest,
viz. : — that the object of the Weberian mechanism is to bring
directly to the consciousness of the Fish the varying tensions of the
gaseous contents of the air-bladder, due to the incidence of varying
hydrostatic pressures.    The late Dr. Sagemehl also adopted Hasse's
view, at least, so far as to regard the mechanism as a register of
pressure variations, but with this important modification, that it is
not hydrostatic but atmospheric pressure which the Fish is thereby
enabled to appreciate.    There are, however, certain grave objections
to Sagemehl's ingenious theory.
    To a Fish at a depth of, say, six feet below the surface of the water,
a variation of atmospheric pressure sufficient to raise or depress a
column of mercury in a barometer to the extent of half an inch will
only involve a variation of pressnre amounting to less than one-tenth
of the already existing hydrostatic pressure ; and even this trifling
difference will become relatively smaller as the depth at which the
Fish lives becomes greater, while the ascent or descent of the Fish in
the water to the extent of only seven inches would certainly mask any
variation of atmospheric pressure to the extent indicated, seeing that
the animal can have no power of differentiating the effects due to the
incidence of the two pressures.        A barometrical variation of even
half an inch takes place but slowly, and rarely occurs in less time
than several hours, and consequently could only be appreciated as dis
tinct from hydrostatic pressure if the Fish remained at exactly the
same depth in the water during the whole time that the barometrical
variation was in progress.    The maximum range of variation in atmo
spheric pressure, as measured by the barometer, is about two inches,
but such variations occur only at considerable intervals of time, and
then may take hours to accomplish. Even in this extreme case the

 1892.]            Contributions  to the  Anatomy   of Fishes.            145
atmospheric pressure variation might be negatived by a variation of
level in the water to extent of twenty-seven inches, or more or less
completely masked by similar movements of still less extent during
 ordinary locomotion, or by the rise or fall of the tide in the case of the
few estuarine or marine species.         It may also be urged in opposition
to the theory that there is no evidence that the Siluridee, or any other
 Ostariophysese, are in any way different from other Fishes in being
 specially susceptible to atmospheric pressure variations, or that they
 possess any special capacity for anticipating impending changes in
 the weather.       Sagemehl's theory being untenable, Hasse's view only
 remains. The general structure of the air-bladder, the mode of inter
 connection of the different Weberian ossicles, and their relations to
 the air-bladder and auditory organ, as well as the relations inter se of
 the two last-mentioned structures, are perfectly consistent with this
 theory, against which no anatomical objections can be urged, and
 equally inconsistent with any other at present suggested.
     III. That the Weberian mechanism is of great functional importance
 to  the  Fish    possessing it admits of no doubt. It is extremely im
 probable that so complicated and highly specialised a mechanism
 would have been evolved did it not confer some exceptional advantage
 upon its possessor, and that this is the case seems to be clearly de
 monstrated by the significant fact that the presence of the mechanism
 is characteristic of nearly all the dominant families of fresh-water
 Teleostei.      The precise utility of the mechanism is, nevertheless, a
 very   difficult  problem. Assuming the correctness of Hasse's theory,
 it is inconceivable that the pressure variations, which it is the func
 tion of the Weberian apparatus to register, can arise from any other
 cause than the ascent or descent of the Fish in the water during
 ordinary locomotion, and this at once suggests that the advantage of
 the mechanism is directly related to some form of pressure adjust
  ment. In dealing with this aspect of the question it becomes neces
 sary to first consider the methods of pressure adjustment in Fishes in
 general.
     Gaseous secretion and absorption are highly important factors in
 the adjustment of the volume of the gases contained iu the air-bladder
 to variations of hydrostatic pressure.        The conditions under which
 these processes take place have been experimentally investigated by
 Moreau, who has demonstrated that when the air is exhausted from
  the air-bladder (by means of an air-pump in the case of Physostomous
 Fishes, or by puncture in the Physoclisti) it takes from several hours
 to several days to restore the abstracted air by secretion and for the
  Fish to regain its normal liberty of movement.         The rate of absorp
  tion is in fairly close agreement with that of secretion.     It is obvious
  that the rapidity with which these processes take place is an impor
  tant factor in determining how far they are likely to be available as
     vol. m.                                                          L

146            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.         [June  16,
a means of pressure adjustment during ordinary locomotion, but un
fortunately, in Moreau's experiments, the amount of gas previously
abstracted from the air-bladder, or the extent of the pressure varia
tion to which the organ was exposed, was often so considerable that
from several hours to several days were required to restore the normal
equilibrium of the Fish. No attempt has yet been made to obtain
accurate measurements of the precise rate of secretion or absorption
under conditions involving relatively small variations of level and
pressure.    Three important factors appear, however, to be well estab
         —
lished : (1) that gaseous secretion and absorption are relatively slow
processes in all Fishes ; (2) that, although retia mirabilia are not in
dispensable to these processes, there can be no doubt that both take
place much more rapidly in Fishes that possess such structures than
in those in which they are wanting ; and (3) that increased hydro
static pressure accelerates the rate of secretion, while diminished
pressure exerts a similar influence on absorption.
   In the case of the Physoclisti, which very generally possess retia
mirabilia, but no pneumatic duct, gaseous secretion and absorption
must be the only means of pressure adjustment ; but how far these
methods can be employed during the more or less rapid changes of
level that occur in ordinary locomotion is doubtful, and, bearing in
mind the relatively slow rate at which these processes take place,
even in Fishes with retia mirabilia, we incline to the opinion that
they are more likely to be of advantage to the Fish during such
gradual changes of level as may occur in the course of diurnal,
seasonal, or other periodic migrations than in ordinary locomotion.
That this is the case seems to be suggested by many features in their
habits, which tend to prove that most Physoclisti have but a com
paratively restricted vertical range in so far as normal locomotion is
concerned.
   The relatively few Physostomi which possess an air-bladder and no
ductus pnenmaticus are in precisely the same position, as regards
their mode of pressure adjustment, as the majority of the Physoclisti ;
and of the remainder, we may consider, in the first place, the Ostario-
physese, which possess not only an open pneumatic duct and a
Weberian mechanism but are without retia mirabilia.
   The absence of retia mirabilia in all hitherto investigated Ostario-
physese suggests that as a means of pressure adjustment gaseous
 secretion and absorption are of minor importance. On the other
 hand, Moreau's experiments prove that those Ostariophyseaa with
 which he experimented        possess   a great advantage      over the
 Physoclisti in  that they can, during  ascent, more rapidly adjust the
 volume of gas in the air-bladder to decreased hydrostatic pressure by
 mechanically liberating a certain quantity of gas through the pneu
matic duct than by relying solely on the absorptive capacity of the

 1892.]          Contributions   to the Anatomy     of Fishes.            147
walls of the air-bladder.      Conversely, the typical Physoclisti have the
advantage    during descent.      Moreau points out that a Fish incurs
more danger by rising above the plane of least effort than by sinking
below it.   It is conceivable that a Physoclist, in the course of rapid
ascent, might so far depart from its normal plane of equilibrium as to
be forcibly carried to the surface of the water, and in that helpless
condition fall an easy and conspicuous prey to predaceous Birds or
Fishes.    No special danger or inconvenience would result from a
sudden and rapid descent, and it is at least possible that the in
creased secretion of gas which augmented pressure certainly condi
tions in the Physoclisti may not be altogether without effect in
bringing about a more speedy re-adjustment to the greater pressure of
a deeper level, even in the Ostariophysea?, in spite of the absence of
retia mirabilia.   From these considerations it follows that, as com
pared  with   the Physoclisti, the Ostariophyseaa possess a far greater
capacity for adapting themselves to rapid and extensive changes
of level, more particularly        in the direction of ascent, and many
well-known facts in connexion with their habits support this con
clusion.
    The physiological   relation of the Weberian ossicles to the hydro
static function of the air-bladder is a problem which can only be
satisfactorily solved by experimental inquiry.          The evidence seems
conclusive against assigning more than a very subordinate part to this
mechanism, if any, in the way of controlling the absorption or secre
tion of gas ; but it may, nevertheless, control or regulate the escape
of gas through the ductus pneumaticus.          A gradual distension of the
air-bladder would be accurately measured by the recording lever
 (Weberian ossicles) and the increasing intensity of the stimulus im
parted to the sensory epithelium of the auditory organ and to the
saccular branches of the auditory nerve.           The consequent reflex or
 voluntary  efferent  impulses     may  find expression in the exercise of
 Bome form of regulatory control over the liberation of gas through
 the pneumatic duct, so that only so much gas will be eliminated from
 time to time as may suffice to enable the Fish to retain its plane of
 equilibrium at all levels dnring ascent, notwithstanding the reduction
 of external hydrostatic pressure.        Unfortunately there is but little
 anatomical and absolutely no experimental evidence as to how, or in
 what way, the escape of gas is regulated in accordance with these
 congestions.    Valvular structures have been found in the ductus
 pneumaticus in some Ostariophysea? (e.g., Cyprinidae), and we have
 fonnd unstriped muscle cells in its walls.      It is probable, as suggested
 by Ramsay Wright, that the duct is not to be regarded as a mere
 channel for the escape of gas from the air-bladder, but rather as a struc
  ture which, under reflex control, actively participates in the process,
  possibly by peristaltic contractions.      The air-bladder and pneumatic

148           Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.          [June   16,
duct exhibit some structural analogies to the gall-bladder and cystic
duct of Mammalia, and bearing in mind that the absence of intrinsic
muscles in the walls of the bladder is associated with the fact that the
tension of the contained gases under the influence of reduced hydro
static pressure will supply the needful expulsive force, it is by no
means improbable that a close physiological parallelism may also
exist with regard to the escape of their respective contents.
    Whatever may be the precise nature of the controlling mechanism,
the advantage to the Fish of some method of carefully graduated
adjustment to pressure variations is sufficiently obvious.      Without
any   form of regulatory control, and with an  open  ductus  pneuuiaticus
in free communication with the exterior, it may be surmised that the
escnpe of gas would be continuous and unchecked, and might even
involve a more or less complete exhaustion of the gas in the bladder
as the pressure diminished, with the contingent disadvantage that the
normal equilibrium of the Fish in the water would be greatly dis
turbed, and a considerable demand be made on the secretive activity
of the bladder for the subsequent restoration of the gas. On the
other hand, the existence of a controlling mechanism would ensure
that only so much gas will be evolved as may suffice to maintain the
Fish in a plane of equilibrium, and, at the same time, secure the
needful economy in the liberation of the gas. A further advantage
in the speedy adjustment to alterations in pressure is that there will
be less expenditure of energy in the performance of ordinary move
 ments, inasmuch as the Fish can readily find a plane of least effort;
otherwise it would have to counteract a too feeble, or an increased
 specific gravity, by additional muscular effort.   In the light of these
considerations, but with the qualification which the absence of direct
 experimental evidence necessitates, we conclude that the Weberian
 mechanism not only confers on all Fishes that possess it an excep
 tional capacity for freedom of locomotion in the vertical direction,
 but also entails the contingent advantage that all movements will be
 effected with the maximum economy of muscular effort and tissue
metabolism.
   With   regard   to   thosePhysostomi which have no Weberian
mechanism, the evidence as to their ability to make use of the ductus
pueumaticus as a means of pressure adjustment is very conflicting,
and, moreover, it is not even certain that in all cases the duct is in
free communication with the exterior. The frequent presence of retia
mirabilia would also suggest that gaseous secretion and absorption are
important factors in pressure adjustment. In the light of such con-
tradictory evidence, no satisfactory conclusion   is,
                                                   at present, possible,
but  two  alternative suggestions may   be  made,
                                                    (a.) If the ductus
pneumaticus cannot, from any cause, be used for pressure adjustment,
gaseous secretion and absorption must be the only methods employed,

1892.]              Contributions to the Anatomy   of Fishes.            140
and,    so far  as the point is concerned, these Fishes mast resemble the
typical Physoclisti. (fe.) On the other hand, even if it be admitted that
some Pbysostomi, without the Weberian mechanism, can liberate gas
through the ductus pneumaticus, it is nevertheless not difficult to see
how it may be that the process is of little use to them for pressure
adjustment.         The completeness of the control exercised over the
liberation of the necessary amount of gas will largely depend on the
perfection of the reflex mechanism employed in the process, and in
all the Fishes now under consideration the necessary afferent impulses
must be initiated in the peripheral nervous system by the diffused
pressure exerted by a distended air-bladder on the surrounding
organs, instead of in a particular afferent nerve by a stimulus applied
to a localised sensory epithelium through the Weberian mechanism,
as is the case with the Ostariophyseae.         The indefinite character of
the stimulus in the former would certainly militate against any
 delicacy in the responsive process of pressure adjustment. The more
 perfect afferent mechanism of the Ostariophysess conditions a more
 effective control over the function of the pneumatic duct, and a
 greater capacity for regulating the processes involved in pressure
 adjustment, and, as we have suggested, this is the great advantage
 which the Weberian mechanism              confers upon all Fishes that
 possess    it.
    Certain structural adjuncts in connexion with the air-bladder of
 the Siluridse may also be considered from a physiological point of
 view. These are, (1) the lateral cutaneous areas; (2) the "elastic-
           "
 spring apparatus of Miiller ; (3) the extrinsic muscles of the Pimo-
 lodinae ; and (4), the distinctive features of the air-bladder and
 Weberian mechanism in the Siluridas as compared with other Ostario-
 physeee.
     1.  The lateral cutaneous     areas probably enable variations in the
 size   of the anterior chamber of the air-bladder, the result of pressure
 variations,      more promptly to modify the volume and therefore the
 specific gravity of the Fish, and consequently ensure a corresponding
 increase in the delicacy of the responsive processes involved in pres
 sure adjustment.
                                              "                "
     2. Miiller held the opinion that the       elastic-spring   apparatus is
  a mechanism for the condensation         and   rarefaction  of the gases in
 the air-bladder. We cannot agree with Miiller that the elastic springs
 can have any share in dilating the air-bladder or rarefying the gases
 which it contains, and it is doubtful if the apparatus can possibly
 give the Fish any power of directly compressing the bladder except
 under certain conditions, viz., when the anterior chamber becomes
  distended through the diminution of pressure which occurs during
  ascent in the water, coincidently with the forward or outward move
  ments of the two springs as the result of the voluntary reflex con

  150             Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.               [June 16,
 traction of their protractor muscles.             We do not think with Mfiller
 that condensation is of nse in facilitating descent; for a Fish in ap
 proximate equilibrium the slightest action of the ordinary locomotor
 organs is quite sufficient to produce either ascent or descent, and the
 existence of an elaborate mechanism for varying the internal capacity
 of the air-bladder and the volume of the enclosed gases with this
 object is altogether unnecessary.         Sorensen's view that the mechanism
 is related to the production of voluntary sounds by the forcible expul
 sion of air through the pneumatic duct does not seem to us well
 founded, first, because the
                                   " elastic springs " are only able to forcibly
 compress the air-bladder during ascent, and, secondly, because sounds
 could only be produced in that way at the expense of a considerable
 disturbance of the normal equilibrium of the Fish in the water and of
 its locomotor activity.        Two views may be taken as to the precise
 mode in which this singular mechanism                  is of practical utility :
 (1)   the  compression    of   the   air-bladder   may assist the action of the
ductus pneumaticus in producing a more rapid ejection of gas during
ascent ; or (2) by condensation alone may counteract the effects of a
too low specific gravity, and, at the same time, economise the con
tained gases.       The latter alternative, in our opinion, is the more
probable one.
    3. The extrinsic muscles (compressor muscles) of the Pimelodinae
in all probability have a function similar to that of the " elastic-
          "
spring apparatus.          The function of the tensor tripodis muscle is
probably     to limit  the   violent excursions of the tripus, which other
wise would certainly take place when the bladder is forcibly com
pressed by the contraction of the compressor muscles.
    4. The conclusion suggested by a comparison of the anatomical
rjlations of the air-bladder and its associated skeletal structures is —
that, physiologically considered, the most important distinctive
features of the Weberian mechanism in the Siluridce as compared
with other OstariophyseaB are mainly related to the air-bladder, which
in the former attains its maximum degree of specialisation and
delicacy as an organ adapted for the registration of varying hydro
static pressures.
        The Condition   of  the  Air-bladder in   the Siluridm Abnormales.
    The most noteworthy features in the structure of the air-bladder in
the various genera of Siluridaa abnormales are : the absence of lateral
chambers ; the partial or complete               constriction of the anterior
chamber into two diminutive laterally situated air-sacs, which may
lose all connexion not only with each other, but also with the
oesophagus ; and the occasional atrophy of the fibres by which the
lateral walls of the bladder are normally connected with the tripodes.

1S92.]           Contributions  to the A natomy of Fishes.             151
Judications of retrogressive changes are not wanting in the anditory
organ.     In some, at least, of the Silurid® abnormales the sinus endo-
ljmphaticns has completely atrophied, although the cavum sinus
imparis and atrial cavities remain and retain their normal relations
to one another and to the scaphia.          The Weberian ossicles, on the
other hand, are almost invariably complete. The few signs of degene
ration which they exhibit relate to the straightness of the posterior pro
cesses of the tripodes, the suppression of the ascending and condylar
processes of the scaphia, and, in a few instances, the absence of inter-
calaria.
    Taking into consideration the retrograde changes both in the air-
bladder and Weberian mechanism, it becomes almost impossible to
believe that any hydrostatic function can be assigned to these struc
tures, or that they do otherwise than present various states of modifi
cation towards the condition of vestigial and fuuctionless organs, and
this conclusion seems to us equally inevitable whatever may have
been their original function.
    Of the one hundred and sixteen genera mentioned in the
British Museum Catalogue no fewer than twenty-five at least are
referable to the Siluridae abnormales.         The causes that have led
to the degeneracy of the air-bladder in so many forms are in
many instances not difficult to trace, and, as in so many Physoclist
Teleostei, the assumption of a purely ground habit of life is
probably the most important one.             Not a few of the genera of
Siluridaj abnormales inhabit the comparatively shallow waters of
rapidly flowing mountain streams and torrents, often being at a con
siderable altitude, and in general habit are not unlike our common
English Loaches. Many are provided with an adhesive apparatus on
the ventral surface of the body between the pectoral fins, so that they
may be enabled to withstand the force of mountain torrents. Such
Fishes when not in motion probably rest upon or attach themselves
to the river bottom, and the uselessness and probable harmfulness of
an air-bladder as a hydrostatic organ under such conditions is no
doubt the cause of its degenerate and rudimentary condition. Various
species of CaUichthys are said to keep under plants in marshy swamps,
to be able to burrow in the mud, in which they often become dried
up, and even to be capable of migration npon land in search of water ;
similar habits characterise other forms.
    The susceptibility of the air-bladder to change of habitat or habits
on the part of its possessor is well shown by the variation that may
be met with in the same genus.              Two species of Cryptopterus
 ((7. micropus  and G.  hexaptera)   have  rudimentary  air-bladders, while
 all the remaining species of the genus which came under our notice
 have these organs unusually well developed.           In two species of
Fimelodm also (P. pulcher and P. sapo) the air-bladder is not only

152            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.           [June 16,
rudimentary but lacks even a trace of the compressor and tensor tri-
podis muscles which are so characteristic of the normal Pimelodinee.
Probably in such instances the degeneration of the air-bladder is due
to the assumption of a ground habit.
   The invariable persistence of the Weberian ossicles in an almost
structurally complete but functionless condition may be explained by
the absence of any potent cause calculated to bring about their total
suppression.
   The uniform retention of the anterior chamber in these Siluroida
while the lateral compartments have almost invariably disappeared,
in place of the entire suppression of the air-bladder which occurs in
most other Teleostei whenever that organ from similar causes has be
come useless to its possessor, is due to its connection with the persistent
Weberian ossicles.
    The encapsulation of the air-bladder by bone is difficult to explain
satisfactorily, but two alternative suggestions may be made. (1.) En
capsulation varies greatly in extent as well as in the precise methods
by which it has been brought about, but very often appears to beav
some relation to the structural completeness of the diminutive air-
bladder and the retention of its apparently functional connexion with
the Weberian ossicles.      Where the air-bladder retains much of its
structural integrity encapsulation is always more complete than when
the contrary is the case, and may then be due to the necessity of pre
venting any distension of the reduced and useless organ by varying
external pressures from imparting disturbing and useless stimuli to
the internal ear.     On the other hand, encapsulation is always less
complete    when   structural  lesions are too obvious to admit of any
possibility of pressure variations affecting the Weberian ossicles, and
the fact that it exists at all in such cases may be explained by the
 supposition that reduction in the size of the only portion of the air-
 bladder that persists, that is,  the anterior chamber, has been accom
 panied by a corresponding contraction and curvature of the modified
 transverse processes which normally invest, and are closely moulded
 to, its anterior and dorsal surfaces.     (2.) Encapsulation may be due
 in part to the tendency of   the  transverse processes to contract round
 and envelope an atrophying air-bladder, and in part also to an un
 checked development of that tendency to ossification of the walls of
 the air-bladder, or of the investing connective tissue, which to    a   re
 stricted extent  is   so characteristic a feature even in the normal
 Siluroids.
    Of the remaining families of the Ostariophyseffl, the Cyprinidaa
 exhibita   substantially similar and parallel series of modifications in
 the condition of the air-bladder, which,   it    can scarcely be doubted,
 are also correlated with the assumption of a grovelling and purely
" ground " habit of life, and, as in certain SiluridaB abnormales, the

invariable completeness of the encapsulation of the reduced air-bladder
by bone in the former may be associated with the fact that both the
bladder and the Weberian mechanism otherwise retain their normal
structural integrity.
                 Geographical  Distribution of the Ostariophysecp.
      All  the Ostariophyseae   are fresh-water forms, except a few Siluroids
 which have become accustomed to          a marine habitat.      Of the known
 2180 (approximate)        fresh-water Teleostei, there are only about 600
 in which the Weberian apparatus is absent.               Broadly speaking, it
 may be stated that the total number of species of Ostariophysete is
 nearly five times as great as all the other species of fresh-water
 Physostomi ; nearly five times greater than the species of fresh-water
  Physoclisti ; and about three times the number of the species of
  Physostomi and Physoclisti combined.            With the exception of the
  Gymnotidae and Gymnarchidse, the families of the OstariophyseaB are,
  so far as species are concerned, from two to six times as large as the
  best represented families of the remaining Physostomi or the Physo
  clisti ; and the families of the CyprinidaB and Siluridee are by far the
  richest, both in species and genera, the former including one-third
  (724), and the latter about one-fourth (572), of all the known fresh
  water species. This predominance characterises all the great zoo-
  geographical regions about which we have any information, with
  the exception of North America, where other fresh-water Fishes
  slightly outnumber the Ostariophyseae. In the Indian and Neotropical
  regions, where fresh-water Fishes attain their maximum degree of
  specific development, the Ostariophyseae outnumber all the remaining
  species in those districts in the proportions of 5"5 and 4 to 1 respec
  tively.     The great rivals to the Ostariophyseae among fresh-water
  Fishes are the Salmonidae and Cyprinodontidae. but, owing to a differ
  ence of habit, or of geographical distribution, a considerable number
  of their species do not come into direct competition with the former.
       Hence, it may be concluded that the possession of a Weberian
   mechanism is specially characteristic of the dominant families of
   fresh-water Teleostei, that is, of those families which combine to the
   greatest extent numerical strength in individuals, richness in specific
  differentiation, and wideness of geographical distribution.
       Two other possible conclusions are also suggested by these facts :
   (1) that the possession of a Weberian mechanism is directly related
  to certain peculiarities of a fresh-water habitat, and (2) that the close
   association between the presence of this mechanism and the marked
   ascendency of the Ostariophyseae over all other families of fresh-water
    Teleostei points to the possibility that the relation is one of cause and
    effect.   Both conclusions, in our opinion, are highly probable, and the

154            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.          [June 16,
demonstration of the first would almost necessarily involve the truth
of the second, but positive proof of either is extremely difficult. To
prove the correctness of the first, it must be shown that there are
certain conditions involved in a fresh-water habitat which render
the possession of a Weberian mechanism of special value to fresh
water Fishes.    If, as we have suggested, the mechanism confers upon
all Fishes which possess it an exceptional capacity for locomotion in
all directions, with a minimum of muscular effort, it seems reasonable
to anticipate that such advantages are of greater importance to fresh
water species than to their marine congeners.
   The poverty of fresh-water faunas, as compared with marine, and
the entire absence of certain groups of organisms which are abundant
in the sea, are among the most obvious facts in the geographical dis
tribution of animals. Of the special external conditions which have
combined to produce these results, the most obvious, and perhaps the
most important, are, (a) existence in a medium which, omitting
lakes, is always in motion in a definite direction ; and (6) a more
precarious and fluctuating food supply, due to climatic severity,
alternations of seasons (such as winter and summer, dry and rainy
seasons), and to the isolation and comparative smallness of fresh-water
areas.    On the other hand, the relation of Fishes to other forms of
fresh-water life is in many respects nnique.       No other groups of
equivalent taxonomic value approach Fishes in richness of specific
differentiation or individual size, and it is equally clear that the pre
dominancy of Fishes is mainly due to the numerical strength of the
Ostariophyseee, both in individuals and in genera and species.      It is,
therefore, not unreasonable to infer that, for some reason, the special
conditions of a fresh- water existence are less adverse to Fishes than
to any group of organisms, and, further, that the Ostariophysea?
apparently possess an altogether exceptional capacity for adapting
themselves to conditions which, in almost all other cases, are inimical,
both to individual and specific development.      Can it be shown that
there is any definite relation between any of the conditions of a fresh
water life and the advantages derivable from the possession of a
Weberian mechanism ?
   Of the special conditions of a fresh-water habitat, we lay most
stress on the precarious and fluctuating character of the food supply,
and a comparison of the relative positions of fresh-water and marine
Fishes from this point of view suggests a possible answer to the
question.    The food supply of marine Fishes is less precarious and
less liable to quantitative fluctuations than in the case of fresh-water
species, and, moreover, local scarcity of food maybe met by migration
to areas where, for the time being, food is more abundant.          With
fresh-water Fishes the converse holds good, and in their case the
restricted extent and comparative isolation of fresh-water areas are,

18?2.]          Contributions to tlie Anatomy   of Fishes.          155
in general, an insuperable obstacle       to migration as a means of
remedying local scarcity. The poverty of most other forms of fresh
water life absolntely conditions the existence of a relatively larger
number of herbivorous or omnivorous Fishes in fresh waters than in
the sea, where the abundance and variety of other animal organisms
are so much greater, and this necessarily involves the existence of a
 piscine fauna, which, from the nature of the food supply, is to a
 large extent peculiarly liable to the exigencies of a precarious and
 inconstant food supply. It can also be shown that marine Fishes are
 more voracious than fresh-water, and that while the latter may
 survive total abstinence from food for weeks or months, the former
 succumb within a few days. The majority of the Ostariophysere
appear to be herbivorous or omnivorous, while the capacity of many
of them for accumulating reserve food material, at the expense of
which they live during the seasons of relative scarcity, has often been
remarked.
    Not only do marine Fishes differ from the majority of fresh-water
species in the greater constancy and abundance of their food supply,
but they also differ from the latter in their method of pressure
adjustment.     Relying, as the former do, upon the relatively slow
processes of gaseous secretion and absorption, any departure from the
plane in which, for the time being, they are in equilibrium must
involve a decrease or increase of specific gravity to an extent propor
tional to the amount of pressure variation.    Hence, in ordinary rapid
locomotor movements, involving more or less extensive changes of
level and pressure, there must be an increase of muscular exertion,
which will necessarily be greater in proportion as the Fish departs
from its normal plane of equilibrium.        In the great majority of
fresh-water Fishes, that is to say, in the Ostariophysese, pressure
adjustment is more accurate and rapid, so that in all variations of
level and pressure, whether rapidly or slowly brought about, but
more especially under conditions of diminished pressure, the Fish
always retains a normal plane of least effort, with the result that its
locomotor movements will be accompanied by a minimum expenditure
of muscular effort. It may therefore be inferred that, as a general
rule, marine Fishes are exposed to greater demands upon their
muscular energy than is the case with fresh-water species — a differ
ence which must always be associated with the more favourable
nutritive conditions under which the former exist, as compared with
the more precarious food supply of the latter — while, at the same
time, it affords a reasonable explanation of the relative capacities of
marine and fresh- water Fishes for enduring prolonged abstinence
from food.
    If we do not overrate the importance of these considerations, it is
obvious that, in view of the precarious and fluctuating character of

156            Profs. T. W. Bridge and A. C. Haddon.           [June 16,
their food supply, economy in the expenditure of muscular energy
must be of primary importance to the majority of fresh-water Fishes,
and more particularly to those which, wholly or in part, derive their
food from vegetable sources.      Hence, the possession of any mechan
ism whicli will not only remove all restrictions to motion in the
vertical direction, and thereby enlarge the area within which food
may be obtained, but, at the same time, will also enable those Fishes
to execute all locomotor movements with the least possible expendi
ture of muscular effort, must prove to be a great physiological
advantage to them, inasmuch as economy of muscular effort implies
diminished tissue metabolism, and, consequently, indirectly but effec
tually aids the accumulation of the nutritive reserve, at the expense
 of which the Fish subsists during the lengthened periods when fresh
 food is relatively scarce.  It may be that this is precisely the advan
 tage which the possession of a Weberian mechanism enables all
 Ostariophysea to realise — an advantage which, as we venture to
 suggest, is one of the main causes of their marked ascendency over
 all other fresh-water species in which this mechanism is wanting, and
 with which they come into direct competition.
     As no other attempt has been made to associate the evolution of
 the Weberian mechanism with any special peculiarities of external
 environment, we would suggest the following tentative conclu
 sions  : —
     1. The special feature of a fresh-water habitat that has conditioned
 the development of the Weberian mechanism in the Ostariophyseae is
 the occurrence of seasonal or periodic quantitative variations in the
 food supply, variations to which the Ostariophyseae, from their
  herbivorous or omnivorous habits, are specially liable.
     2. In view of such unfavourable nutritive conditions, the special
  advantage which is conferred upon the Ostariophysete by the posses
  sion of the Weberian mechanism is a capacity for executing locomotor
  movements in any plane, with an almost irreducible minimum of
  muscular effort and tissue metabolism.
     3. If a variable and inconstant food supply is to be regarded as one
  of the inevitable conditions of a fresh-water existence, and necessitates
  strict economy in the expenditure of muscular energy, any mechanism
  which secures this result must be of unquestionable importance to
  the species, and hence it may be that the Ostariophysese owe their
  dominant position among fresh-water Fishes to the possession of the
  Weberian mechanism.
     4. The evolution of the Weberian mechanism has not only condi
  tioned the predominancy of the Ostariophyseae, but, indirectly, has
  favoured the existence in fresh water of a large number of purely
  carnivorous Fishes, which depend on the former for their food, and
  therefore may also be regarded as one of the primary causes of the

1892.]           Contributions    to the Anatomy    of Fishes.            157
anomalous abundance and diversity of fresh-water piscine life, as
compared with the remarkable poverty of all other groups of fresh
water organisms.
                              Concluding Remarks.
     The varied structural modifications met with in the air-bladder of
the Siluridae are not surprising, in view of the exceptionally diversi
fied conditions under which the different species and genera live.
The physical conditions under which many Siluridse are capable of
living are almost as varied as their geographical distribution or
climatic range.
     Darwin has pointed oat, in referring to the conditions favourable
to variation in animals and plants, that it is common, widely diffused,
 and widely ranging species that vary most, and that this might be
 expected from the diverse physical conditions to which they would be
 exposed, as well as from differences in the nature and quality of their
 living competitors in different regions. Further, he alludes to the
 f*ct that an organ developed in an extraordinary manner implies that
 it is of high functional importance to the species, and that it may also
 be concluded that the organ has undergone a great amount of varia
 tion since it first came into existence.       It is clear that the Siluridte
 furnish an admirable illustration of the truth of these remarks.
     Nor is it difficult to see how it is that the Weberian apparatus and
  air-bladder are more specialised in the Siluridse than in other Ostario-
  physeBB.   The only rivals to the Siluridro in the extent of their
  geographical distribution are the Cyprinidae, for the remaining
  families have but a comparatively restricted range.           But, extensive
  as is their geographical distribution,        the great majority of the
  Cyprinidaj appear to exist under fairly uniform conditions, or, at all
  events, exhibit nothing like the diversity of habitat and habits that is
  so characteristic of the Siluridffi, and hence it is that, so far as the
  structure of the air-bladder and Weberian mechanism is known in
   the former family, it presents but little variation in the direction of
   increased specialisation, although in a few genera the effects of de
   generation are sufficiently obvious.

      F.R.S. Received May 11, 1892.
                                   (Abstract.)
   During    a month's occupation of a table at the Marine Biological
Laboratory of Plymouth, in the summer of 1889, and a nine months'
occupation of the Cambridge University Table at the Zoological
Station of Naples, commencing in the October of the same year,               I
had the opportunity of studying the development of a number of
Cirripedes.     Since that time, investigations on the same group have
been   carried  on chiefly in the Morphological Laboratory at Cambridge.
   I have been wishful to take up this subject, because the embryo
logy of Cirripedia had been considerably neglected since the intro
duction of the more modern methods of investigation, and because the
development      might reasonably be expected to throw light on the
adult structure of this interesting group.          I   wished, moreover, to
compare     the development    in several species, with  the object of throw
ing some light on larval evolution in general.
   The species studied were Lepasanatifera, Linnaeus; Lepas pectinata,
Spengler ; Conchoderma virgata, Spengler ; Dichelaspis Darwinii,
Filippi ; Chthamalus stellatus, Poli, and Balanus perforatus, Bruguiere.
   Of Dichelaspis, only mounted specimens of the nauplii were
examined, but in the other forms the development from the freshly-
laid ovum to the second nauplius stage was investigated.
   1 had expected to find notable differences         in the development of
the different forms, but, although most of the genera could be dis
tinguished at an early age, by some feature or other, the general
course of development was very uniform, and the following summary
is applicable to all the members of the group : —
   The freshly-laid ovum consists of granular protoplasm, hollow
yolk granules, and oil globules.       Its size has much more relation to
 that  of the  nauplius  than  to that of the adult.
   First polar body is given off, not in the ovary, but in the mantle
 cavity, though the first directive spindle is evidently formed in the
ovary.     The polar body is formed independently of, and probably
before, or simultaneously with, fertilisation.
   Fertilisation takes place in the mantle cavity before the peri-
vitelline membrane is formed.
   The emission of the first polar body is immediately followed by the
        tion of the vitelline (or peri- vitelline) membrane, which arises

 1892.]            On  the  early Development  of Cirripedia.         159
•while   the egg is   in the mantle cavity, whether the egg has been
fertilised or not.
    If fertilisation has not taken place, no further change ensues, and
the egg does not contract ; a second polar body is probably formed,
but owing to the resistance of the peri-vitelline membrane cannot
emerge, and is not seen.
    Tf fertilisation has taken place, the egg diminishes in size, and
commences to undergo rhythmical contractions, which cease only
 when the protoplasmic and yolk portions are completely separated.
    The diminution in size is soon followed by the protrusion of clear
amoeboid processes at the anterior end of the egg, which are as often
withdrawn : from this amoeboid arises the second polar body, like
the first, by the division of the nucleus in the ordinary karyokinetic
manner.
     The protoplasm generally collects at the anterior (larger) pole, and
 the yolk at the posterior (pointed) pole, in the well-known way.
 The process does not represent a total division, as has been supposed,
 into ectoderm and endoderm, but the formation of a teleolecithal egg,
 the protoplasmic part of which will form the first blastomere, and now
rests upon a yolk portion, at first devoid of a special nucleus, but still
in communication with the protoplasmic half.
    The nucleus, at first small and peripherally situated at the anterior
 pole (invisible without special preparation), becomes visible as a clear
spot or vesicle — the segmentation nucleus — occupying the centre of
 the protoplasmic half of the egg.
     The nucleus divides, one danghter-nucleus remaining in the proto
 plasm, and the other passing into the yolk, the elements of which it
has the power of transforming into protoplasm ; this, together with
the bulk of any protoplasm left in the yolk, now emerges as a second
blastomere at the side of the first, which has in the meantime become
cut off from the yolk.
    The yolk becomes gradually covered by the successive emergence
of fresh cells, which process is accompanied by the division of the
 cells cut off from it. The nucleus of these emerging protoplasmic
 bodies or merocytes is given off either from a peripheral blastomere,
 which has not yet been cut off from the yolk, or from a merocyte
 which divides before emerging as a blastomere.           The yolk may be
regarded       as having   the  value of a single cell  (macromere), which
gives off a succession of blastomeres (micromeres) much in the same
way as in the case of the epibolic eggs of Bonellia, where, however,
there are four macromeres, each of which behaves in the same way.
     The point where the blastoderm last covers the yolk represents
  (except possibly in rare cases) the blastopore, the nucleus which
 gives rise to both endoderm and mesoderm arising at or close to the
 same spot.

160                          Mr. T. T. Groom.                   [June 16,
   After separation of the epiblast the yolk cell or macromere remains
still as a cell with a single nuclens, derived from that of the nierocyte
which formed the last or one of the last blastomeres.       This yolk cell
represents both mesoblast and hypoblast.
    The meso-hypoblast cell immediately divides into two cells, one
situated more dorsally, the other more ventrally.         Each of these
contains mesoblastic and hypoblastic elements.         The mesoblast is
formed by the cutting off in succession of segments from each of the
two meso-hypoblast cells ; these form a plug of rapidly dividing cells
just in front of the closed blastopore.    When all the mesoblastic cells
are cut off the two yolk cells left remain as the first two hypoblast
cells.
    The two cells thus formed become divided into smaller yolk
endoderm cells equivalent to the secondary yolk pyramids of Decapods
 (Reichenbach's SecunJdre Dotterpyramiden).
    Each yolk pyramid becomes later converted into an endoderm cell
hy radial contraction in a centrifugal direction, accompanied by
gradual retreat of the nucleus to the periphery; the archenteric
cavity arises by the separation thus caused of the central portions of
the pyramids from one another.
    The alimentary canal arises in three divisions, as in the Arthropoda
generally, the stomach being formed mainly from the yolk endoderm,
and . the lining of the oesophagus and intestine probably wholly as
long epiblastic ingrowths (stomodasum and proctodamm).
    The mesoblastic cells of the nauplius, arising in the way described,
 divide up rapidly and extend forward between the ectoderm and
 endoderm as a dorsal plate ; this soon grows down at the sides, but
 does not at first extend to the ventral surface.
    This plate is chiefly concerned in the formation of the muscles of
 the nauplius appendages, which arise, as is probably the case in all
 nauplius forms, with the free ends directed dorsally.
    The appendages are marked out first by two transverse fui-rows
 dividing the embryo into three segments ; these occur only across the
 dorsal surface and up the sides, not extending into the ventral
 surface.   Very soon the dorsal surface becomes traversed by a median
 longitudinal furrow, which does not extend to the ends of the body,
 but is bounded by two new transverse furrows ; these furrows
 mark out an anterior and posterior (caudal) unpaired lobe with the
 free ends of the appendages between them on the dorsal, and not, as
 has always been stated for Cirripedes, on the ventral surface.
    The antennules, antennoe, and mandibles are probably serially
 homologous, as indicated by their similarity in the free nauplius, and
 by their remarkable and similar origin j all may represent primitively
 post-oral appendages.
    There are no mesoblastic somites at any period of embryonic

development ; bat the mesoblastic layer becomes thickened locally to
form the muscles of the appendages in each of the three segments.
    The body cavity* of the nauplius arises later as a mixed blasto-
ccele and schizorcele, dne in part to the separation of ectoderm and
endoderm, and in part to an excavation of mesoblastic tissue.                    It
soon forms a cavity continuous from end to end of the body.
    The nervous system of the nauplius (arising as usual as an epi-
blastic thickening) shows from the beginning a complex structure,
especially in the Balanids, and among these it is most specialised in
the Balaninffl. It is probably from the first a syn-cerebrum, since it
includes, in addition to the representative of the archi-cerebrum, the
ganglia supplying the antennules.'            The antennae and mandibles are
in close relation with the circum-cesophageal                connectives and sub-
oesopbageal ganglion respectively.
    A comparatively sudden change is experienced by the nauplius in
passing from stage        I  to stage   II ; this necessitates     a telescoping of
the tail, caudal spine, and bristles of the appendages, the gradual
evagination of which gives rise to the peculiar appearances seen at
this stage, and which have given rise to some misconceptions.
    There is a most remarkable agreement between the nauplii of the
 various species in the general structure of the carapace, labrum, &c,
 extending to the minntest detail in the case of the appendages, and
 indicating that the features in question have been inherited from
 some stage of the common ancestor.
    There are, however, points of difference which concern chiefly the
 carapace (with its horns a,nd candal spine), labrum, and tail.
     Differences are perceptible in most cases in the new-laid ovum of
 different forms, and the genera, or even the species, can thus be
 separated even at this early stage.
     The larval differences necessitate a classification which agrees very
  closely with that deduced from the structure of the adults.
     Such differences have, however, in most cases been acquired inde
  pendently of adult structure, since they concern characters peculiar
  to the larva?, and lost by the adult.           Some indications of the preco
  cious appearance of characters originally belonging to the later stage
  are seen in Balanus ; but most of the characters cannot be so ex
  plained. The larva and adult have varied simultaneously, but in
  quite different ways, each having in this group taken its own course
  of evolution.
     The agreement in the development of such forms as Balanus and
  Lepas, stage by stage, indicates that the ancestor of the Thoracica
  underwent a metamorphosis similar to that of the present members
  of the group. The Nauplius and Oypris stage have, therefore, not
  been evolved   within the group.

   The embryonic development, though in its main lines very uniform
throughout the group of the Thoracica (Lepadidoe, Verrucidae,
Balanidse), shows considerable variation in some respects, and the
variable features are the same in all the species.
   The most conspicuous variations are those which affect the pro
cesses of cell division.   The details of the mode of growth of the
blastoderm over the yolk, from the appearance of the basal plane to
the closure of the blastopore, and the resulting cell arrangements
vary indefinitely.   After the closure of the blastopore, the yolk
endoderm cells present in their mode of division an almost equally
great diversity.
    The size, shape, and colour of the ova and embryos of a species
vary not inconsiderably.
    In size and shape the nauplii of a species vary somewhat ; but
no conspicuous variations occur in structure, the larvae always show
ing a great amount of uniformity, even in so minute a feature as the
character of each bristle belonging to an appendage.     Minute varia
tions occur in the ornamentation of the carapace, caudal spine, and
tail, and (in Chthamalus) in the number of teeth at the end of the
labrum.

however, depends to some extent on the form and dimensions of the
body, and it seemed important to experiment on the loss of heat
from bodies differing in form from the wires already used, and larger
in dimensions.
   Accordingly, two copper globes used by Mr. D. Macfarlane in 1872
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' 1872, p. 93) were employed for a new series of
experiments.
    After preliminary experiments (using the same enclosure which
Macfarlane employed, and with the surfaces of Macfarlane's globes
prepared in four different ways) new apparatus was constructed ; the
object being to experiment both with full air pressure and with
different amounts of exhaustion of the air, and Macfarlane's enclosure
being unsuitable for this purpose.
   In the arrangement adopted, the heated globes were hung at the

 1892.]     The Cerelrum    of Orui thorn ynchus paradoxus.         163
centre   of a hollow metallic sphere, which was connected with the
Sprengel pump and surrounded with cold water, and were allowed
to cool.   The temperature of the cooling globe was read off at equal
intervals of time by means of a thermo-electric junction ; and from
these readings the absolute loss of heat per unit of cooling surface,
per unit difference of temperatures of surface and surroundings, per
unit of time, is calculated.
   The details of the apparatus and method of experimenting are
given in the paper.     It is enough to say here that the globes were
used with their surfaces in two different conditions : — (1 ) Thinly
coated with lamp-black, and (2) silvered and brightly polished ; and
in both conditions the absolute loss of heat, both in air and in
vacnum, more or less complete, was determined.         The tables and
curves attached to the paper give the details of the results.
    To quote one or two examples : — With the sooted surface a total
loss of heat by convection and radiation of 3"42 x 10~* c.g.s. units
per square centimetre, per second, per 1° C. of difference of tempera
 tures of globe and surroundings, was observed with a difference of
 temperatures of 100 C, and with the surroundings at about 14° C.
 Under similar circumstances the radiation in vacuum of         (half-a-
millionth of atmospheric pressure of non-collapsible gas) was about
 1-40 x 10-«.
    Taking a silvered and brightly-polished surface under the same
circumstances, the loss in full air was 2'30x 10-' c.g.s. ; and with
the highest vacuum and brightest polish obtained, it was reduced
 l'80x 10_* with in this case a difference of temperatures of 180° C.
 The loss with 100° C. difference would be considerably less, but is not
 known experimentally at present.
    The author returns thanks to Mr. James H. Gray, M.A., B.Sc.,
 for excellent assistance given ; and expresses himself most deeply
 indebted, both for assistance in experimenting and calculating of the
results," and for most valuable and ingenious aid of various kinds
during the course of this work, to his friend Mr. A. Tanakadate, now
 Professor in Tokio, Japan.

                                (Abstract.)
    The brain of Ornithorhynchns paradoxus is by no means Avian in
 type. All its characters are Mammalian, but it presents certain
 peculiar features which have been overlooked or misunderstood by
 the anatomists who have hitherto examined it with the naked eye.
 The most obvious and noteworthy departures from the form of brain

 found in nil other Mammals concern          the rhinenceplialon, the hippo
 campus, and the cerebral commissures.
    The olfactory bulb is quite free from the frontal         portion of the
 hemisphere.     Its stalk is exceedingly thin, and connected with the
 under surface of the hemisphere near the median line. The portion
 of the mantle which receives it is separated from the general surface
 by a deep incision (ectorhinal fissure), which extends in depth almost
 to the mesial surface.    The pyriform lobe thus formed merges with
 the general surface far back on the mesial aspect of the hemisphere,
at the spot at which the hippocampal fold commences.
    The hippocampus is very extensive ; it lies entirely dorsal to the
 velum    interpositum, and is continued forwards to the extreme
anterior end of the brain. With the rhinencephalon it forms there
fore a loop, open in front.
   No commissural fibres cross the incisura pallii longitudinalis
dorsally to the hippocampus. For reasons stated in his paper, the
writer considers that fibres which cross from one hemisphere to the
other on the peduncular (portal) side of the fascia dentata cannot be
homologous with the corpus callosum.and he therefore concludes that
this structure is completely absent from the brain of Omithorhynchws.
A strong commissure or decussation lies within the concavity of the
rhinencephalic loop, but its fibres are restricted in their distribution
to the hippocampal fold, as shown in sections stained after Weigert's
method.     The convex portions of the mantle are entirely dependent
upon the anterior commissure for mutual connexion.
   Exception being made to the incisura rhinalis and dentary fossa as
not belonging to the category of fissures, the cortex is completely
destitute of convolution.
   Each hemisphere of the brain was cnt into a series of sections, the
anatomical features of which were described in detail.

176           Lord Armstrong.       On a Multiple Induction
   " On a Multiple Induction Machine for producing High
       Tension Electricity, and on some remarkable Results
       obtained with it."       By Lord Armstrong, C.B., F.R.S.
       Received May 18— Read June 16, 1892.
                               [Plates  2—18.]
    It is now nearly half a century since I undertook to design, for the
Polytechnic Institution then existing in London, a large hydro
electric machine, on the plan of the smaller one I had previously
designed for myself.      It was a very short time in my hands after its
completion, and I had scarcely any opportunity of afterwards using
it in the lecture room of the Instit ution. My experience with it was,
however, sufficient to show me that its great power was very much
less when used in a room than in the outside atmosphere when dry.
I have ever since entertained the idea of constructing a similar
machine of equal or greater power for my private use ; but, until
lately, the exigencies of business pursuits precluded my giving atten
tion to the subject.
    On recommencing my experiments on this branch of electrical
science, my immediate object was to improve the frictional apparatus
of the steam jet, so as to obtain the greatest effect from a given
expenditure of steam, while my ultimate intention was to construct
a large machine with such a number of jets as would afford me a more
copious supply of frictional electricity than could be obtained by any
other convenient means. I soon found, however, that the difficulty
of obtaining effectual insulation in the open air, except under the
 most favourable conditions of weather, would involve great interrup
 tion and disturbing effect, and I therefore turned my thoughts to the
 induction coil as a source of high tension electricity, that would not
 only be independent of the caprice of the weather, but would also
 save me from atmospheric inclemency, which, however harmless it
 might have been in the youthful days of my hydro-electric expe
 riences, could not be safely endured at my present advanced period
 of life.
     I did not flatter myself that 1 could make any important improve
 ment upon the Ruhmkorff coil. That remarkable instrument had
  been so long in use, and had undergone so much development, that
 its career of progress might well be considered as nearly, if not
 quite, played out.      But although Ruhmkorff coils had been con
 structed capable of yielding sparks of unprecedented length, yet it
 was obvious that the output of electric energy, when estimated in
 ampere as well as in volt measurement,          must be relatively very
  inferior to that of smaller coils, in which each convolution of the

            Machine   for producing High Tension Electricity.          177
secondary wire is effected with much less length of wire.         In other
words, a given weight of material utilised in a number of small coils
ought to yield a greater output of energy than the same weight used
in the construction of one large coil, the best proportions of length to
diameter being in each case adhered to. Moreover, it is well known
that, with induction coils of exceptional magnitude, the ordinary
vibrating contact breaker cannot be efficiently employed on account
of the rapid destruction of the platinum points ; and the method of
obviating this difficulty by breaking contact under a cover of alcohol
is only compatible with slow action.          But by dividing the work
amongst several coils, each with a separate vibrating contact breaker,
this difficulty is avoided, and the frequency of the spark is multiplied
in proportion to the number of coils and contact breakers.           With
these views, I obtained from Mr. Apps six induction coils, each
capable of yielding a maximum spark of 10J inches.           I had also a
six-fold contact breaker constructed of the usual automatic vibrating
type, and in which each vibrator was acted upon by an independent
electro- magnet of the horse-shoe description. In experimenting with
a single contact breaker used with a single coil, I found much
advantage in augmenting the power of the working magnet, and in
stiffening and shortening the spring greatly beyond the limits of
ordinary practice. By so doing I was enabled to reduce the range of
vibration, and thus to obtain with a heavy-headed vibrator many times
the usual speed of oscillation without reducing the length of spark in
nearly the same proportion. With an extremely high speed of inter
ruption, I could obtain sparks 4 inches long in great profusion,
thongh not with rapidity equal to the rate of vibration. To accom
 plish that degree of rapidity the sparking distance had to be reduced
 to about one-half ; but, considering that a spark of 2 inches is sup
 posed to represent nearly 95,000 volts when delivered between knobs,
 and would probably give two-thirds of that amount when delivered
 between points,    I  saw no sufficient inducement to strive after longer
 sparks, which can only be obtained by great sacrifice of frequency,
 involving a general reduction of amperage far exceeding the gain
 iu voltage.
    By using two coils in series with an alcohol contact breaker worked
 slowly,  I could get sparks 15 inches long ; but I found so many diffi
 culties and inconveniences in a serial arrangement, and so little to be
 gained by it, that I abandoned the pursuit of it, and confined my
 attention to a combination in parallel. In the first instance I em
 ployed a secondary battery of seven large cells to supply the current
 for exciting my six coils, and I fully expected that their united
 output would be proportionate to their number, but iu this          I  was
 disappointed.     I found that two coils gave me only about one and
 a-hulf the effect of one, and that every additional coil gave a dimin
                                                                n 2

178           Lord Armstrong.         On a Multiple Induction
ished increment of output.       In fact, -when all the six were in action,
I                                             I
  only got about three times the output obtained from one. It was
some time before     I  discovered the cause of this apparent anomaly ;
but at last    I traced it to the recoil currents from the condensers,
which at each interruption of the primary current had to pass through
the battery in the reverse direction of the battery current.           Thus a
conflict of currents was produced in the primary circnit, which
checked the acquisition of magnetism by the coils.          I saw no remedy
for this interference, except the application of a separate battery to
each coil, and I accordingly exchanged my single battery of seven
large cells for six independent batteries composed of the same number
of cells proportionately reduced in size, and when this was done I
obtained the full measure of effect.
   Side by side with the multiple contact breaker       I  have a mechanical
contact breaker, in which the interruptions are effected by insulated
cam wheels fixed on a revolving shaft, which is fitted with spur gear
for high velocities.   This mode of breaking contact has the advantage
of c ausing the sparks to be delivered in regular sequence, with equal
intervals between them.        It also enables the exact number of dis
charges per   second   to be  ascertained  ; but the automatic interrupter
gives a larger output, owing,      I  suppose, to the fact that each break
of contact takes place exactly at the moment when the magnetisation
of the coil is matured, whereas with the mechanical break the same
degree of coincidence cannot be attained.           The six coils are placed
vertically beneath an ebonite table, through which the connecting
wires are conveyed in strong glass tubes, which also serve as pillars
for supporting the sparking points. These points are adjustable for
any required length of spark, and they operate in a radial direction
against a metallic conductor surrounding an ebonite disc, which, by
means of an india-rubber band and multiplying gear, can be very
rapidly rotated ; and, whether it be at rest or in motion, it serves as
a collector, from which the united output of the coils can be drawn
off. By rotating the wheel and conveying the current through a
series of Geissler tubes fixed upon it in various positions, extremely
brilliant symmetrical figures can be produced, but for all other
purposes rotation is dispensed with, except to the extent of slight
movements to regulate the length of spark without altering the
adjustment of the points. A switch-board is provided for the purpose
of regulating the number of coils to be thrown into action, so that
they can be used singly or in any required number.
   The power of this apparatus as indicated by the voltameter is much
greater than that of the large hydro-electric machine made for the
Polytechnic Institution, but it is very inferior to it in regard to length
of spark, to which, however, I attach but little importance.         I  find it
well adapted for experimental investigation, and       I  have obtained with

           Machine  for producing High     Tension Electricity.         179
 it some very  interesting results.    A drawing of it accompanies      this
 paper  (Plate 2).
    My attention   was at first directed to the heating effect of the
 secondary  current  at an air gap on its circuit.   The amount of heat
 developed at this point when all the coils were in operation proved
 unexpectedly large, and I was surprised to find it almost entirely con
 fined to the negative side of the gap.     I  found, also, that when the
 current passed in sparks very little heat was exhibited.      It was only
 when the passage of the current assumed the appearance and condi
 tion of an arc that the heat came into prominence.      Taking platinum
 wires of No. 27 B.W. gauge for the positive and negative terminals,
 which I shall call electrodes, to distinguish them from the sparking
 points at the collector, I found that the ends could be drawn asunder
 to a distance of fully an inch before a decided stream of crackling
 sparks was elicited, and even then the sparks presented a hazy
 appearance.    On re-advancing the ends to each other the sparks
 diminished, while the haze increased and gradually assumed the con
 dition of a pale blue arc.     At a distance of 0'6 inch a well-defined
 arc could be maintained, though not without a slight admixture of
 faint sparks, which followed the curvature of the arc.        At this dis
 tance the heat was sufficient to fuse the end of the platinum wire
 forming the negative electrode, but the heat did not reach its maximum
 until the separating distance was reduced to a few hundredths of an
inch.    At that small distance the negative platinum melted with
great rapidity, and ran back in a globule until it got out of melting
range of the arc.     By following up the melted globule by steadily ad
vancing the positive wire, the negative wire fused at the rate of
nearly 3 inches per minute ; but, however long this process was con
tinued, the positive wire remained to all appearance perfectly cool.
Retaining the positive wire unaltered, I increased by successive steps
the thickness of the negative wire, to determine the point at which it
became too thick to melt and run back in a globule, and it was not
until I increased the thickness up to 16 gauge, which corresponds to
a diameter of 0-065 inch, that I reached this limit.        With that wire
the end melted into a rounded form, but no longer receded in a
gathering globule, as thinner wires did. Iridioplatinum wire of 21
gauge, containing 70 per cent, of iridium, readily melted and receded,
though not rapidly, uutil the globule fell by its weight.           In this
instance the light emitted from the globule was so intolerably bright
as to require darkened      spectacles to view it with impunity.      I next
proceeded to ascertain how far      it was necessary  to  reduce the  thick
ness of the positive wire before it exhibited an equal degree of heat
with the thickest wire opposed to it on the negative side, and      I  found
that I had to diminish its diameter to 31 gauge before this equality
 was reached.     Now, the sectional area of No. 16 gauge is 42 times

  180           Lord Armstrong.       On a Multiple Induction
  the area of No. 31 gange, and from these figures an estimate may be
  formed of the difference in the development of heat on the negative
  and positive sides.    When I employed two carbon electrodes of equal
  thickness   the  greater development of heat on the negative side was
  still very decided, though the difference was not so conspicuous as in
  the case of the platinum electrodes.      In the arc lamp the superiority
  of heat is largely on the positive carbon, and    it is difficult to account
 for the contrary result obtained in my experiments.
     T further varied these experiments by taking the positive discharge
 from the surface of acidulated water, in which case the negative
 electrode was melted by the arc flame springing from the water.             I
 also used for the positive electrode a lump of ice sprinkled with salt
 to make it conduct, and obtained the same result.         A reversal of the
 current made the water boil at the surface and melted a hole in the
 ice, while the positivo platinum remained unheated as usual. In
 another experiment I enclosed the two platinum electrodes in glass
 tubes sealed at the outer end, leaving about ^ inch of the platinum
 wire (No. 27) projecting beyond the glass.        These sealed ends I im-
 mei'sed in distilled water, and succeeded in melting the exposed por
 tion of the negative wire while submerged in the water.
    In another case I used an iron wire (No. 20 gauge) on the negative
 side, retaining the platinum wire for the positive electrode.         In this
 instance the melted globule ran back very quickly to a distance of
 about \ inch, then stopped and burst into intensely brilliant flame,
 which showed a strong disposition to cross over to the opposite side,
but appeared to be beaten back by the blue flame of the arc. Part,
 however, did reach the positive electrode, and condensed upon it in
 the state of an oxide.     My attention having been thus directed to an
appearance      of conflict in the arc, I discarded the iron wire and sub
stituted a platinum wire dipped in a brine of common salt, so as to
impart a distinguishing yellow colour to any Same that might issue
from the negative side in opposition to the flame emanating from the
positive side. This caused the arc to be exhibited under two colours
— a very decided yellow on the negative side, and the same pale hazy-
blue as before on the positive side, but the yellow flame was beaten
back by the blue flame.       Flecks of yellow could, however, be seen to
get across occasionally.      It was not so easy to produce yellow flame
from the positive electrode, because there was not sufficient heat in
the positive wire to volatilise the salt ; but by using a separate wire
encrusted with salt, and holding it alternately immediately in front
of each electrode, I could produce yellow flame on either side and
observe the difference of its behaviour in the two cases. When held
on the positive side a dense unbroken stream of yellow flame sup
planted the previous blue, and passed over bodily to the opposite
wire ; but when hold on the negative side the yellow flame struggled

           Machine    for producing High   Tension Electricity.         181
with comparative feebleness to cross over, and only reached the
positive wire in scanty fragmentary portions.         These appearances
were strongly suggestive of a dominating force emanating from the
positive side and opposed by a weaker force of the same nature in the
opposite direction. The oscillations which are known to attend every
disruptive discharge necessarily involve passages from the negative
as well as the positive side.    In fact the spark must be regarded as
consisting of a dying out alternating current of prodigious frequency
in which the positive alternations have ,the ascendency over the so-
called negative ones ; the excess constituting the available current.
    Although the arc flame presented no appearance of flowing motion,
I  thought it necessary to test the question of any movement in the
longitudinal direction by bringing the arc in contact with light
powdered substances.        For this purpose I placed a small heap of
chalk dust upon a plate of mica, and caused the arc flame to pass
through it, but none of the dust was moved lengthways. The dis
placement was entirely lateral, the material being neatly heaped up
on each side in a ridge, which curved inwards towards the points of
the electrodes, beyond which no displacement was visible. The action
appeared to be that of a gentle push, rather than that of a sudden
impulse ; but when sparks passed instead of flame, a scattering force
was exerted, which operated sideways, and not in the track of the
spark.    In this case I observed that the scattered dust showed a
tendency to settle upon the plate in curved lines and symmetrical
 figures.   I followed up this hint by sifting fine black dust upon
white cardboard and passing sparks over the surface, and I thus
obtained most unmistakable proof of symmetrical arrangement.
This, however, was only a crude method of procedure, and it required
a great deal of perseverance and innumerable trials before I suc
ceeded in producing the effect in a satisfactory manner.         At length,
however,   I  was enabled to produce perfect dust figures which pre
sented pictures of the disruptive discharge revealing the existence of
forces of which the eye could otherwise take no cognizance.         Many of
these figures I got photographed on the spot, and a selection of them
accompanies this paper.        They represent the effect not of a single
discharge but of a succession of sparks, generally beginning with a
light one and gradually increasing the power as the dispersion pro
gressed. To put all the power into one discharge had too much
 dispersive effect and produced great irregularity in the figure.         A
perfectly  even   sifting of the dust was also essential  to a  good  result,
and this could only be effected by the entire exclusion of air draughts
 and a regulated action of the sieve. The best kind of dust to be
 used and its proper degree of fineness were also matters requiring
 many experiments to determine. The dust which           I  ultimately used
 consisted of calcined magnesia worked up in a mortar with a sufli

1&2            Lord Armstrong.       On a Multiple Induction
cient quantity of pure carbon to give a dark slate colour to the com
bined mass. The carbon was in the form of an impalpable powder,
and,   I believe, consisted of purified lamp black.    I tried every variety
of discharge I could think of sometimes weak and sometimes strong
                                 —
— sometimes from a single coil and sometimes from several in com
bination. The most powerfnl sparks were obtained by using all the
six coils in parallel and discharging them simultaneously by the
action of a single alcoholic contact breaker common to the whole.          I
also used a Leyden battery, consisting of four ^-gallon jars, which
 I joined up in various ways both in parallel and in series, and in
some cases introduced a wet string to soften the discharge.
   The circular lines which surround the main discharge, both hori
zontally and transversely, first demand attention. They appear to
represent sections of concentric layers or shells, of which the spark is
the nucleus.     Their great similitude to the lines of force represented
by iron filings under the influence of a magnet is suggestive of similar
causation, but I could not find any proof of their identity. The dis
tance to which this circular action extended was far beyond the limit
exhibited by the photographs. By laying patches of extremely light
dust on paper at various outside distances, I distinctly traced these
lines at a distance of 18 inches from the centre of dispersion, and
there can be little question of the action existing in a lessened degree
at a still greater distance.   It can hardly be doubted that the particles
of dust are linked together by polar attraction, and they probably
represent similar conditions of the air jerked out by the discharge,
but whether it be possible to regard them as indications of tracks of
diffused discharge of a different character from that of disruption is
more than I dare venture to say.          I am satisfied that they are not
mere ripples resulting from pulsatory vibrations of air, for I find
that radial pulsations produced by mechanical means merely clear a
circle without the least tendency to form similar rings.         I made the
experiment by stretching a membrane over a tin cylindrical box,
with a small air tube leading from the bottom to near the surface of
a dusted card.     The membrane was then set in motion by a rapid
succession of light taps, which dispersed the dust in the same manner
as the spark did, but not the least indication of circular lines could
lie seen, and yet air puffs play an important part in the process,
for the effects are greatly modified by screens, as will presently
appear.
   The figures also show in the most unmistakable manner that the
wires, as well as the spark, exercise a dispersive force.      I am inclined
to think that the dispersive action of the wire differs only in degree
from that of the spark. We see in the lines emanating from the
wires evidence of a molecular disturbance in the material which
shoots off the molecules of air in contact with the wire.          When the

             Machine   for producing High       Tension Electricity.           183
action is very strong, as it is near the sparking terminals, the
external molecules of the metal are themselves shot off, as is evident
from the fact that the positive wire becomes reduced to a neck a little
in rear of the sparking end when subjected to a prolonged succession
of Leyden battery discharges.          It is also well known that if a dis
charge from a powerful Leyden battery is sent through a very fine
wire, the whole wire is exploded.             Under ordinary conditions the
cohesion of the molecules restrains their movement                  within very
narrow limits, and confines their action to mere impulse on the sur
rounding air. Now, it appears to me that we may regard the track
of the spark as a line of conducting air, which, having no cohesion
to keep its molecules together, is exploded at every discharge, and,
consequently, produces a far greater amount of dispersion than the
wire. The force* of the lateral discharge at short distance is very
great. In all cases the dust beneath the conducting wires was struck
into the card, so as to leave a permanent delineation of the wire.
The dust also over all parts of the figure, where the action was
strong, was forced into the card, so as to leave a stain after the loose
dust was shaken off, and thus a stained picture of remarkable
accuracy, embracing the greater part of the figure, was in some cases
preserved.
     In all the figures the emanations from the positive and negative
wires are of the same character, but present a great superiority of power
on the positive side. This superiority is, however, much greater in
the case of coil discharges than in battery discharges. This may be
attributed to the oscillations between the inside and outside coatings
of the Leyden jars suffering far less degradation than those between
the terminals of the coils.       If there were no degradation, the forces
exerted on the positive and negative side would be equal and ever
lasting.     The application of wet string to the battery lessens the
 difference between these opposite forces, but it augments the lateral
displacement of dust from both wires while it diminishes the explo
sive force of the spark.
     Diagrams of the dust figures are annexed (Plates 2 — 13), but,
though admirably drawn, they necessarily fall short of the photo
graphs in showing the delicate lines and shadings of the actual

 figures. To suit the pages of the Proceedings,' the diagrams are
reduced to about half the size of the originals, but the exact scale is
 marked on each. The following is a descriptive list of the figures : —
    No. 1 was produced by a succession of sparks from six combined
coils discharged simultaneously.          The tracks of the sparks, the sur

184            Lord Armstrong.       On a Multiple Induction
wires, the strong emanations from the positive wire and the feeble
ones from the negative, are shown in this figure, as well as in most of
those which are to follow.
    No. 2 may be regarded as a transverse section of No. 1, being pro
duced by similar sparks delivered vertically through a hole in the
dust plate when fixed horizontally midway between the sparking
points.     It shows that the discharge is surrounded by circular lines
in the transverse as well as in the longitudinal direction.
    No. 3 is a similar transverse section taken a little in front of the
positive point.
    No. 4 is the same thing taken immediately in front of the negative
point.
    No. 5 is taken transversely immediately behind the positive point,
and shows the radiations issuing from that part of the wire.
    No. 5a shows similar radiations from the positive wire at a distance
of about 12 feet in rear of the sparking point.
    No. 6 was produced by a succession of discharges from four
^-gallon Leyden jars joined up in pairs, two in parallel and two in
series.    It will be observed that the circular lines are much more
strongly developed than in the preceding fignres, but that the radi
ations from the wires are less so.
    No. 7 was produced in the same manner, and shows the circnlar
lines still more highly developed.
    No. 8 is the transverse section of No. 7 taken in the same manner
as No. 2.
    No. 9 is the same as No. 7, except that the conducting wires are
brought down upon the card at a steep angle.
    No. 10 was produced with battery discharges in the same manner
as No. 6, but with a short wet string introduced to soften the dis
charge.      This had the effect of greatly increasing the radiations both
from the positive and negative wires, while it reduced the develop
ment of the circular lines.
    No. 11 was produced under the same conditions as in the preceding
case, except that the wet string was considerably lengthened.
    No. 12 was similarly produced, but with a still further increase in
the length of the wet string.
    No. 13 was produced without any visible discharge across the dust
plate.    The same battery was used as in the last and several pre
ceding cases, but the Leyden jars were allowed to leak sufficiently to
 prevent their reaching the sparking point.       The same effect may be
 produced by taking the discharge at a by-pass with a shorter spark
 ing gap than that on the dust plate.
    No. 14. In this case the battery was discarded and sparks only
 from the combined coils were used, the same as in No. 1. It shows
  the effect of splitting the positive current by the use of a double wire

            Machine  for producing IJiyh    Tension   Electricity.      185
 re-nnited at the sparking point. The double wire is bent into oppo
 sing bends and angles to show the repellent action of the radial
 emanations from the wires.      The resting places of the dust are very
 beautifully shown by the darkened spaces in this figure.
    No. 15 was produced in the same manner as the preceding, but on
 glass instead of card. As the dust is so very easily moved on glass,
 only one coil was used, and it is remarkable that the dispersive effect
 exhibited by the double positive wires is actually greater than that
of the spark itself. It will be seen that tlie dark impress of the wire
 is more marked upon the glass than upon t he card.          It will be ob
 served also that there is a very peculiar dark band lying outside of
each wire and. running parallel with it, and that each of these bands
merges in a dark patch lying on each side of the sparking point.
 These bands and patches may be assumed to represent places wbere
the dispersive force is considerably subdued.
    No. 16 is a transverse section of battery discharges showing the de
 flections of the circular lines produced by the interference of six
glass tubes 2£ inches long and § inch in diameter, erected on the
dust plate at equal distances from the centre and from each other.
It will be observed that the lines are not obliterated behind the tubes
and that curious new curves are developed.
    No. 17 shows similar effects produced by heavier discharges on a
more thickly covered dust plate.       In this case it will be seen that
the circular outline of the figure is changed by the operation from
a circular to a twelve-sided form.        A blunted angle is thrown out
opposite each glass tube and another midway between every two.
    No. 18 shows another dust plate similarly treated, but more lightly
covered and without the glass tubes, instead of which two flat screens
of cardboard, 3 inches high and 2 inches wide, were fixed perpen
dicularly on opposite sides of the centre.      In this case, although the
lines curve inwards behind the screens, they gradually die out
towards the centre and leave the middle portion undisturbed, but by
reducing the height of the screens to the level of the sparking point
the whole sheltered space became wholly filled up with lines as in the
two previous cases.
    No. 19 shows the effect of inverting two wine glasses upon the
dust plate so as to cover two circular patches of the dust and protect
them from the action of the air. In this case no lines were found
 within the glasses.
    No. 20 shows a stained figure remaining on the card after the dust
was shaken off. Although there are some small portions where the
stain has failed to take effect, the figure is, upon the whole, preserved
with remarkable accuracy.
    No. 21 is another example of a stained figure in which some of the
circular lines are discernible.

186           Lord Armstrong.        On a   Multiple Induction
   [No. 22 shows a circular barrier of six wooden hemispheres, each
    inches diameter, and touching one another, formed round the centre
of the dust plate, and the dust was swept off the inner space before
making the experiment.        The positive sparking point was level with
the top of the hemispheres, and the discharges were delivered from a
Leyden battery of two ^-gallon jars in 'series. It will be seen that
the whole of the dust outside the barrier is thrown into lines which
form arches over each touching point of the hemispheres, and that the
spandrils are filled up with inverted curves.       Although it is not easy
to see how these arches and curves can be attributed to eddies, yet
appearances favour the view that the lines are due to the combined
effect of obstructed air drift and electric polarity.     A barrier formed
by  a continuous   perpendicular  screen   of the same  height as the hemi
spheres almost entirely prevents the formation of lines. — June 9.]
   Reverting to the subject of the development of heat at the nega
tive side of the arc, the question arises, from what source is the beat
derived ? It cannot be acquired by conduction from the flame, for
mere conduction would heat both wires alike, nor can it be the result
of convection, for the arc is stagnant in the longitudinal direction.
The only explanation       I  can see is that the negative wire requires
time to take up the sudden gushes of current that come over from
the opposite side, and which, not being instantly carried onward, pro
duce a tumnltnous agitation of molecules at the receiving end of the
wire, resulting in the manifestation of heat. The thicker the wire
the greater the facility of passing on the current, and hence less heat
is evolved in a thick than in a thin wire.         On the other hand, the
positive  wire  receives  comparatively    small  returns, and therefore a
relatively thin wire suffices to pass on the pulsations without its being
heated to ignition.    But the question remains, why is it that so much
less heat is produced by the spark discharge than by the arc dis
charge P    Probably the chief reason is that the spark represents less
quantity of current, though higher in potential. Another reason may
be thnt the spark expends more energy in mechanical disturbance
than the arc.    Then, again, there is the question, what is the relation
between the spark and the arc ?          I cannot find that the spark is
possessed  of  mechanical    impulse  in  the direction of its length any
more than the arc.      Both produce lateral but not longitudinal dis
persion.    I have  discharged a quick succession of powerful sparks in
a downward direction so as to pierce a piece of thick cardboard sus
pended from a delicate halance-beam, but without effecting any de
cided disturbance of the balance.         Every spark left a burr on each
side of tho card apparently equal in size, which alone is sufficient
to show that the spark does not pierce like a needle.              Probably
 the arc and the spark are of much the same nature, the spark

            Machine   for producing High   Tension Electricity,       187
being a single act of discharge and the arc a multitudinous succes
sion of minutely divided sparks, of which none are sufficiently
strong to prodnce any violent disturbance of the adjacent air. The
hissing sound emitted by the arc seems to favour this view.
   I now come to another set of experiments, which will only require
a brief notice.     They were designed to show the effect of passing
both the arc and the spark through an intervening combustion
flame.
   Speaking generally, the intervention of flame has much the same
effect in increasing the length of the disruptive discharge, whether
in the shape of arc or spark, that is effected by rarefaction of air ;
but  I  will here only particularise some curious effects I obtained with
the flame of paraffin candles.       The annexed series of illustrations
exhibit the effects observed in each case.
                    «s  *                        Fig. b.
   Fig.  1   shows  the positive wire immersed in the flame and the
negative wire clear of it, both wires being of platinum and of 22

188             Lord Armstrong.       On a Multiple Induction
gauge.       A brilliant jet of pale-yellow flame was projected from the
positive wire as shown, but did not go beyond the candle flame.
Nothing was to be seen in the interval between the flame and the
negative wire, which, nevertheless,         heated as usual.    It is quite
possible, however, that there might be an arc communication
rendered invisible by the intense brilliancy of the jet within the
candle.
    Fig.   2 shows    tho negative wire immersed in the flame and the
positive clear of it.       Here the direction of the jet was reversed,
and the negative wire, instead of heating, became covered with a
clot of carbon ; bnt with a thinner wire the negative did heat, and no
clot of carbon was formed.
    Fig. 3 shows the effect when both wires were clear of the flame.
In this case two jets of brilliant light appeared in the flame with a
slight separation and an appearance of conflict between them.
    Fig. -1 shows two candles brooght together so as to form one broad
flame in which both wires were immersed.           In this case a large clot
of carbon accumulated on both wires, and neither of them heated.
An examination of the carbon showed it to be deposited in very
beautiful florescent and fern-like forms.           It would have quickly
filled up the whole interior of the flame had flakes not fallen off as
the mass grew in size.
    Fig. 5 shows the two candles drawn asunder so as to leave a small
vacant space between them. Nothing could be seen to pass this
dividing space, but the results remained the same as in the previous
case.
    The repellent action which is exhibited in all these cases is not easy
to explain, seeing that the discharge on both sides seems bounded        by
the exterior of the candle flame.
    I am at present continuing my experiments, but under the altered
conditions of discharge in rarefied air. As these experiments are far
from complete,      I  must reserve them for a future communication.
    I must not, however, close this present paper without referring to
an experiment of quite a different type from any of the preceding, and
which was made long ago with my large hydro-electric machine.
In that instance two wine glasses, filled to the brim with specially-
distilled water, were placed in juxtaposition, leaving only a space of
about    \  inch between them.     A long cotton thread was then coiled
up in one glass and the upper end of the thread dipped into the
water of the other glass.       When the steam was turned on the thread
was drawn out of the glass in which it was coiled and conveyed with
great rapidity into the other glass, and for a few moments a rope of
water remained suspended between the lips of the two glasses.             It
was only when the machine was          at its maximum power that I could
do this, and it never reached its highest power when used within the

            Machine for producing High   Tension Electricity.      189
London building ; but with my multiple machine I have succeeded in
reproducing the experiment in a modified form. Taking two glasses
of the form shown in fig. 6, placed near to each other as in the
original experiment, I inserted in one of them a block tin cup in the
manner shown in the figure. Into this cup I coiled a string composed
     <U+2666>

 of ten strands of tine lamp cotton, which, when laid together, were
 cf a sufficient section to make an easy fit for a hole of | inch in
 diameter. The negative wire was put in contact with the tin cup
 and the positive wire was inserted in the other glass. The upper
 end of the cotton string was then laid over the edges of the two
 glasses, and the tin cup and the positive glass were then each filled
 with chemically pure water up to the same level. When the current
 was turned on the cotton string commenced to crawl over the edges of
 the two glasses, and never ceased to travel until it was bodily trans
 ferred from the negative cup into the positive glass. It was natural to
 expect that the water with which the cotton was loaded would travel
 with the cotton and raise the level of the water in the positive glass
 above the level of that in the tin cup, but the contrary was the case.
 The water lowered in the positive glass and overflowed in the tin cup,
 the surplus descending into the empty space beneath the cup, where
 its quantity could be seen and estimated.         In short, the cotton
 travelled one way and the water the   other, notwithstanding that the
 flow of the water was in opposition to the motion of the cotton.    No
 spark passed between the glasses nntil the tail of the cotton ceased
 to touch the water in the cup, and then sparks passed in profusion.
  When the cotton was restrained from travelling, the water came over
 from the positive side in greater abundance, but when the cotton was
  dispensed  with, and the gap between the vessels was bridged by      a

siphon glass tube, the water entirely ceased to pass.      I am therefore
led to believe that the intervention of capillarity is essential to the
production of the effect.
    The tin cup is not essential to this experiment, and was merely
used to afford a separate lodgment for the water brought over from
the opposite side, and at the same time make the best possible contact
with the water it contained.
     Fig. 7 shows this experiment in a still more striking form. In
this case the positive glass was dispensed with, and the upper end of
the cotton coil was passed into a glass bulb through a nozzle, the
aperture in which was just sufficient for the cotton to fill without
appreciable friction in moving.       A knot was made at the end of the
cotton to prevent its dropping back through the aperture, and water
 was then poured into the bulb until nearly full, and a cork, with the
 conducting wire through it, was inserted.        The bulb was held over
 the metallic cup with the nozzle dipping into the water.      When the
 current was turned on the cotton climbed up vertically, and continued
 to pass until it filled the bulb.   Even when the nozzle was lifted a
 quarter   of an inch  clear of the water the cotton continued to travel.
 The smallest particle of salt added to the water, or a minnte quantity
 of anything that increased its conducting power, destroyed the effect
 and caused gas to appear at the electrodes.
     The only experiment that I know of that presents any analogy to
 the effect thus obtained is that which appears to depend upon what
 is called electrical endosmose, in which case a porous diaphragm has
 the power of transmitting water from a cell containing a positive
  electrode into an adjoining one containing a negative electrode.       If
  we may assume the capillarity of the cotton to represent the porosity
 of the diaphragm, it is reasonable to suppose it capable of transporting
 the water.     Then as to the cotton travelling in the reverse direction,
 that may possibly be due to the reaction attending the transmission
 of the fluid. At all events it would appear that capillarity is con
 trollable by electrioity, and the question arises, what is the relation
  ship between the one and the other ?
     The difference in the action of the current in this experiment and
  in that which I made with the hydro-electric machine consists in
  this : — That in the early experiment one thin cotton thread was
  moved with a high velocity, while in the latter experiment a mass of
  cotton equal to more than 100 similar threads was moved with a
  low velocity. This difference is probably due to the current being
  continuous in the one case and pulsatory in the other, also to its
  being of higher potential and smaller volume in the hydro-electric
  than in the multiple machine.        When   I attempted to use a single
  fine thread with my present machine the water upon it immediately
   boiled, and the thread was destroyed by sparks.

   Simultaneity     of Magnetic Variations at different Places,          SfC.   191
    My acquaintance      with the literature of electricity is very limited.
Others vocations have for many years diverted my thoughts and my
reading from electrical science, and if I have in any case advanced as
a novelty what has been done before           I hope it will be attributed to
ignorance and not to intention. It was only within the last few days,
                                                           I
and after the foregoing paper was printed, that was made aware of
the fact that I am not the first to use dust figures in electrical
research, but     I  am still unaware that the experiments             I  have de
scribed have, in their results, any substantial coincidence with
the recorded results of other investigations.*
  " On the
                 Simultaneity of Magnetic Variations at different
      places    on   occasions of Magnetic Disturbance, and on the
      Relation between Magnetic and Earth Current Pheno
      mena."       By William Ellis, F.R.A.S., Superintendent of
      the    Magnetical and Meteorological Department, Royal
      Observatory, Greenwich.               Communicated by W. H. M.
      Christie, F.R.S. Received April 7,— Read May 5, 1892.
   The observations made in a magnetic observatory usually include
absolute measures of magnetic declination, horizontal force, and dip
(inclination) ; with photographic registration of the variations of
declination, horizontal force, and vertical force ; to which is added, at
Greenwich, a photographic registration of earth currents.
   As regards magnetic variations, the observations made at the Royal
Observatory indicate, for all magnetic elements : — 1. A progressive
change of value which, when limited periods of time only are con
sidered, is nearly constant from year to year. 2. A solar diurnal
variation, the amplitude of which is greater in summer and smaller
in winter, and which has also a period sympathetic with the sun spot
period, being greater throughout the year when sun spots are numer
ous, and smaller when sun spots are few. There is also a small lunar
diurnal variation.       3. The occurrence of days and periods of irregular
magnetic disturbance or magnetic storm, which are more frequent
and of greater magnitude when sun spots are numerous than when
sun spots are few, being comparatively rare as well as insignificant in
character near to the times of minima of sun spots.                  Disturbances
are also in general more numerous in spring and autumn, than at
   [• The actual operation of producing dust figures by the discharges of  an induc
tion coil was exhibited by the author at the conclusion of the reading of  his paper.

 192             Mr. W. Ellis.     On the Simultaneity    of
other parts of the year.      4. Earth currents, which, usually feeble,
are active and strong at the times of magnetic disturbance, remain
 ing active only so long as disturbance continues. In the absence of
magnetic disturbance there exists practically earth current calm.
    These are the broad features of magnetic variations as experienced
 at Greenwich, and which there is reason to believe are generally
similar at other places.
    Having premised thus much, we will now proceed with the special
 inquiry to which this paper is directed.
    When magnetic disturbance is experienced at Greenwich, the
 photographic registers show that, after a period of magnetic calm,
 disturbance commences sometimes very suddenly, and at other times
 with a premonitory sign or signs.      In the latter case the first indica
 tion will not unfrequently be a sudden and sharp movement occurring
 simultaneously in all elements, moderate it may be in amount and of
 isolated character, followed after a shorter or longer period by
 general magnetic disturbance ; at other times the first sharp move
 ment ushers in at once the disturbance.      In other cases disturbance
 will arise gradually without any special premonitory indication,
 appearing in one element before showing, in any marKed degree, in
 the others.   But when there is sudden initial movement, whether
 great or small, it is very definite in character, and appears at Green
wich withont exception simultaneously in the registers of declination,
horizontal force, vertical force, and earth currents. The instantaneous
 movement is the really remarkable point.       Much larger motions will
occnr during the course of a magnetic disturbance, but not usually
 movements    similarly sudden.       They are such as will be quite
 familiar to  all  those who   may be acquainted with photographic
 registers of magnetic variations, and we shall see that similar
characteristics are observed at other places.
    Now it is known that any considerable magnetic disturbance or
magnetic storm is felt over wide areas of the earth's surface, com
mencing and terminating at different places at about the same
absolute time.    But how nearly such commencement is really simul
taneous at different places, whether or not in a much closer degree
than has before been supposed, does not appear to have hitherto been
so carefully studied as seems possible.       For the initial movements
are so definite and so suddenly manifested that it is evident, from the
character of the photographic traces at Greenwich, that at such times a
very perceptible, sometimes the whole, movement has occurred in a very
few seconds, the fineness and exceeding delicacy of the photographic
trace, as compared with that of the ordinary register, showing how
rapidly the spot of light has moved across the paper.        The accidental
comparison    of  the  Greenwich   motions  with  those  at other places in
one or two instances of the kind seemed to show that the corro

               Magnetic Variations at different Places,   (J-c.          193
 sponding phenomena at other places were in these cases similarly
 definite. It thus appeared that a systematic comparison of the times
 of these initial movements at different places might afford the means
of determining how nearly the movements at such places are really
 coincident.
    It is practically impossible to catch these first movements by eye
observation of the magnets, from the uncertainty as to the time at
 which they may occur, so that it becomes necessary to rely on the
photographic register.      Unfortunately, however, the scale of time
 employed on such registers is necessarily small, one minute of time
corresponding usually to about (V01 inch. This renders difficult any
very accnrate measurement of time in individual cases.                But it
appeared   to  me that by selecting a considerable  number     of  instances
of sudden initial movement, and comparing together the times as
 measured from the photographic registers of magnetic observatories
 situated in widely different regions of the earth, we might expect in
 the general average to eliminate any accidental error of measure
 ment due to contracted time scale or other cause, and, supposing no
systematic error to exist, so obtain some reliable information as to
the degree in which, on the whole, such movements, at different
places, are or are not simultaneous.
    With this object in view, a selection from the Greenwich registers
 was made of seventeen cases of sudden distinctive movement, pre
ceding or commencing magnetic disturbance, and occurring during
 the years 1882 to 1889. The list might have been extended, but the
cases selected are typical, and seemed sufficient for the purpose of a
 preliminary inquiry.    Giving the day and approximate hour only of
 the occurrence     of the respective movements at Greenwich, the
 directors of various magnetic observatories were asked to examine
 their registers for the corresponding times, and see whether there
 existed any instance of sndden movement, and, if so, to measure out
 and supply on each day, and for each magnetic register, the exact
local time of commencement of movement to the nearest minute of
time, and also the direction and approximate amount of change in
each magnetic element.      The observatories selected, including Green
wich, nine in number, were, counting from west to east, those of
Toronto, Greenwich, Pola, Pawlowsk, Mauritius, Bombay, Batavin,
Zi-ka-wei, and Melbourne.       This request was complied with in the
most obliging manner, and my best thanks are due to the directors
of the various establishments for the very kind way in which they
 endeavoured to supply all necessary information, as well as to the
Astronomer Royal for permission to make use of the Greenwich
records. In two cases, indeed, Toronto and Zi-ka-wei, copies of the
registers were also famished ; the Toronto report, however, included
movements of the declination magnet only.         Unfortunately at Pola
                                                                  o 2

194              Mr. W. Ellis.      On the Simultaneity    of
photographic registration was not commenced until the year 1885,
and it thus became necessary to omit Pola in the comparision.             It
might    be supposed  that, in giving  the   Greenwich  time of movement  to
the nearest hour only, it would be possible in some cases to find on the
registers at other observatories several movements sufficiently near,
any one of which might be taken, and thus not be a corresponding
movement in the sense meant.         But the movements in question, so
abrupt in character, are neither numerous nor easily mistaken.
Their character is well illustrated in the annexed reduced copy of
the Greenwich registers for 1884, October 1 (one of the selected
days), in which it will be perceived how in all elements, declination,
horizontal force, vertical force, and earth currents, a definite and
rapid movement occurs just before 22h., and simultaneously in all ;
that in horizontal force corresponding indeed to an increase in the
earth's horizontal force of about l/200th part. It will be thus under
stood that the really corresponding movements would be readily
identified at other places ; indeed the returns received show that no
difficulty was experienced, the suddenness of movement being a
matter of common remark. For instance, at Toronto it is said that
" the initial movement was always very sudden," at Mauritius the
                                    " remarkable
movements are spoken of as                          jumps," at Bombay as
" abrupt and unmistakeable at the beginning," and at Batavia the
commencement       was "in all cases               very abrupt."     In the
Zi-ka-wei curves, so kindly furnished, the same characteristics
are to be observed, and the same simultaneous commencement
of movement       in all elements       is shown as in the Greenwich
specimen register    of 1884,  October    1.  The certainty with which the
selection was made further appears by the circumstance that the
stations in addition to Greenwich being seven, and there being
seventeen days, 119 identifications had to be made.            Not counting
six instances  in which the corresponding record was not available on
account of failure or want of register, it was found that, of the re
maining 113 cases, there were only four iu which there was dis
cordance, and a re-examination of the registers in two of these cases
immediately showed that a wrong movement had been taken. Had
there been opportunity for further examination in the two remaining
cases, there is little doubt but that the source of the discordance
would have been in these also ascertained.           All this assures us of
the real correspondence of the movements discussed.
    It has been mentioned, in regard to Greenwich and Zi-ka-wei, that
the three magnets, declination, horizontal force, and vertical force,
 were on all occasions simultaneously affected.        The reports received
 from other observatories show that, at places for which the times for
 the different magnets are separately given, the magnets were
similarly simulti ueously affected. This cirrumstance is peculiar to

                Magnetic     Variations at different Places,     fyc.          195
Royal Observatory, Greenwich. — Copies of the Photographic Records of Magnetic      •
   Elements and Earth Currents from 1884, Oct. 1, 16h, to Oct. 2, 4h, Greenwich
   Civil Time.
   It will be seen how the rapid movement just before 22'1 occurs simultaneously in
all elements, after a calm state. Downward motion on the p:iper indicates increase
of west declination, and of horizontal and vertical force, and in earth currents
corresponds to the passage of a current similar to that from the copper polo of a
battery in the direction Angerstein Wharf — Lady Well in the one case, and in the

     196               Mr.   W. Ellis.    On tlie Simultaneity      of
     direction Blaekheath — North Kent East Junction in the other. The azimuth of
    the former line, reckoning from magnetic north to east, is 50°, and of the latter,
    reckoning from magnetic north to west, is 46".     The direction of strongest earth
     current at Greenwich is not much different from that of the line joining the
    A. W.— L. W. earth plates. The current in the A. W. — L. W. circuit is always
     much stronger than that in the B. — N. K. E. J. circuit, and a current that causes
    the A. W. —L. W. trace to move in one direction on the paper causes the
    B. — N. K. E. J. trace to move in the opposite direction.
    these sudden      movements, which, although abrupt in character, are
    sometimes      of no great magnitude. There is not the same simul
    taneity of movement in the different elements when disturbance
    commences, as it were, gradually, or in general during the course
    of a magnetic storm ; the really simultaneous movements                        are
    exceptional.
        The annexed Table        I contains the times of commencement of
    movement on the seventeen selected days at each of the eight sta-
 • tions.     The second column gives the year, day, and hour of disturbance,
    Greenwich civil time (counting from midnight to midnight), and in
 I following columns are added the times to tenths of a minute for the
    eight stations, arranged in order of longitude, reckoning from west
 '
    to east, and reduced to Greenwich time by the application of the
    differences of longitude given in Table II. From accidental causes, as
 . before mentioned,       times were wanting in six cases, and in addition for
    two in which there were unresolved discordances.                  These were at
    Batavia, on 1882, April 16 ; at Pawlowsk and Mauritius, on April 20 ;
    at Melbourne, on August 4 ; at Toronto, on September 12 ; at Batavia,
    on 1883, February 24 ; at Zi-ka-wei, on September 16 ; and at Toronto
   on 1884, July 2.        To maintain a proper balance in the table, times in
    these cases have been adopted by estimation, paying proper regard
    to the average deviation of tlie times at each particular station from
    the general average of all the stations.
        The times as received were given usually to the nearest minute ; the
    fractions of a minute that appear in the table are partly due to the time
    being in most cases the means of those for three magnetic elements,
    and partly to the fractional value of the longitude used.            Id a follow-
i ing column is given for each day the mean                   of the times at the
   eight stations, and in succeeding columns the deviation of the time at
   each station from this daily mean.
       Every instance of magnetic motion included in the table was
   accompanied at Greenwich by active earth current.                    It is known
   that in some cases earth currents were similarly active at other
   place3, and presumably they were active at all places.
       From an inspection of the table it will be seen how nearly these
   sudden and characteristic magnetic impulses occur at the same
   absolute time at places geographically widely separated.                 At some

  193              Mr. W. Ellis.   On the Simultaneity of
 stations the times are distinctly greater and at others distinctly less
  than the average of times for all stations. Either the magnetic im
 pulse is really retarded at some stations and accelerated at others,
 as referred to the mean, or there exists at individual stations some
 systematic error, mechanical or otherwise, which affects the times in
one particular way.        That such error should exist is not unlikely
 since it is difficult to make accurate, beyond a certain point, a time
 scale so contracted, and difficult also to measure correctly the photo
 graphic trace, besides which the desirability of securing such extreme
accuracy has not been before made apparent.
    It happens that on five of the selected days, Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10,
corresponding records were found in the magnetic section of the
 'Mission Scientifique du Cap Horn,' 1882 — 1883. Here No. 6 is
said to be " une diminution brusque," No. 7 " un mouvement tres
rapide," and No. 9 is said to commence
                                            " brusquement." Engraved
copies of the registers on a small scale are given for Nos. 8, 9, and 10,
showing the movements to have been of the character described.
This affords five comparisons. The times are given only to the
nearest five minutes, and the mean of the five resulting deviations,
which range from +7'lm. to — 8-6m., is +l-lm. There were in
addition six other instances of sudden movement contained in the
Cape Horn series, not included in our selected list, for which corre
sponding movements were readily found in the Greenwich records.
These movements are spoken of as having at Cape Horn the same
abrupt character as those already mentioned. The separate values
of deviation referred (by comparison through Greenwich) to the
general mean of Table I range from +9 2 m. to — 10'8 m., the mean
being — 2"1 m. Or, combining the two sets, we have from eleven com
parisons a mean deviation of — 0-7 m.
    The mean deviation of time at each station from the general mean
for all stations (the means of the columns of differences in Table I)
and the difference between the greatest and least values at each
station, adding the result for Cape Horn for eleven days just found,
are as follows : —

  At    Cape Horn and Melbourne the times were given only to the
nearest 5 minutes ; at the other stations they were given to the
nearest minute.     This may explain the greater differences for Cape
Horn and Melbourne in the last column of the table.
   The question that now arises       What
                                      is,       the explanation of the
                                                      is
small differences between the values of deviation at different places                           ?
As already suggested, they must be due either to real difference in
the time of the magnetic impulse, depending on geographical posi
tion, or to the existence at individual stations of some systematic
error.
   In regard to the possible variation of the values of deviation with
geographical position, there may be variation with latitude or with
longitude.    It will be observed that in Table              II
                                                       the stations are
already arranged in order of longitude,   and  the run of the numbers
would appear to indicate a tendency to negative values at westerly
stations, and to positive values, on the whole, at easterly stations,
but yet the differences are such (remembering how easily some of
these differences   might arise, with existing apparatus) as would
hardly warrant the assumption that such variation really exists                                 ;
neither does a   change with longitude seem to be one for which there
would appear to be any ready physical explanation. The variation
in the values of deviation with latitude     better seen by arranging
                                                 is
the numbers of Table     II in order of latitude, and, considering the
divergence of the magnetic equator from the astronomical equator,                             it
seems better to group them according to the values of magnetic dip
at the various stations, which has been done as follows, adding also                            a

    There would seem to be here a tendency to negative values with
 northerly dip, and to positive values with southerly dip. Remarking
 how five stations (two with extreme northerly dip, two with extreme
 southerly dip, and one intermediate) hang together, this apparent
tendency may be accidental, and yet there is an undoubted drift to
the left in the upper part of the diagram, and to the right in the
lower part     A variation with latitude certainly appears to be one
better admitting of physical explanation than does a variation with
longitude.   Can anything depend on the distribution of land and
water ? Whether the observed deviations represent a real inequality,

                    Magnetic Variations at different Places,      fyc.           201
or whether the irregularities are wholly accidental, and that the
magnetic impulse in these motions is everywhere simultaneous, we can
not say. The data are not sufficient to permit of the formation of
any definite conclusion.
    But whatever may be the explanation of the irregularities of
deviation, it would seem that over a certain portion of the earth's
snrface the magnetic action in these initial impulses is practically
simultaneous. The values of mean deviation for Greenwich, Paw-
lowsk, Mauritius, and Bombay are — 01 m., — 0'2 m., +0'5m., and
 — O'l m., respectively, an agreement which is certainly striking, and
which can hardly be explained on any supposition but that of
simultaneous action. For if we divide the series for these places
(Table I) into two groups, say of 8 and 9 values each respectively,
and take their means, we have as follows : —

    In the first set the Greenwich and Bombay values agree, so also in
the second set (within O'l m.). Greenwich and Bombay are thus in
close accord, and in a remarkable degree, the agreement amounting
almost to a confirmation of the adopted difference of longitude. The
extreme difference between the four values at the different stations is
seen to be, in the first set l-8m., and in the second set 0'7m.                  And
the differences between the separate values at each station are
severally 0-4 m., 1*2 m., TO m., and 0'3 m. Now the latter differences,
which may be taken to indicate the amount of accidental irregularity
in the values, bear a considerable proportion to the differences
between the values at the separate stations (1"8 m. and 0'7 m.), so that
these differences are probably wholly accidental. Again, the mean of
the first four values is + 0'1 m., and of the last four 0 0 m., showing
on the whole no real difference. All this indicates that at Greenwich,
Pawlowsk, Mauritius, and Bombay the magnetic impulse would appear
to be really simultaneous, or at any rate that the variations between
the observed deviations at these places afford no trustworthy evi
dence against snch conclusion.
    We come thus to an interesting result. The magnetic impulse
over that portion of the earth's surface covered by the places last
mentioned would evidently appear to be, on the whole, simultaneous ;
 although whether, in like manner, simultaneous over the whole earth

 202              Mr. W. Ellis.     On  the Simultaneity oj
 we   cannot say.     But, considering the inadequacy of our present
 registering apparatus to ensure in all cases the necessary accuracy
 of time indication, it becomes a question whether the coincidence may
 not be generally closer than present means will enable us to measure.
 To determine this with precision would, however, require some modi
 fication of the apparatus now in general use.
     The circumstance that the sudden magnetic movements of the
 character here discussed appear to be so nearly, if not absolutely,
 simultaneous over the whole earth becomes, if established, a striking
 physical fact.   In numerous cases the disturbance, commencing sud
 denly,  and continuing for many hours, follows on a state of compara
 tive magnetic calm.     How is the sudden change to a state of activity
 brought   about,  and  what is the influence that so instantaneously
 disturbs the magnetic condition of our globe ? The magnetic move
 ments at Greenwich at such times are always accompanied by corre
sponding earth currents, which, similarly following a state of calm,
become at once active, precisely at the commencement of the magnetic
disturbance. It is believed that a similar effect is produced at other
 places, and that this is so is, in some cases, specially mentioned.
 Some sudden action, apparently from without, sets up, as it seems,
 both earth current and magnetic activity simultaneously, or nearly so,
over the whole earth.       It is to be noted that magnetic and earth
current disturbance at Greenwich is, on the whole, more frequent in
spring and autumn, when, in its diurnal revolution, the whole surface,
or nearly the whole surface, of the earth becomes, during each twenty-
four hours, exposed to the sun, as though the earth in some way con
tributed to the production of the phenomena observed, a given ex
ternal influence appearing to cause at these times a greater activity
than at other parts of the year.         For magnetic disturbance rises
and falls generally with the existence of more or fewer sun spots,
in which variation we do not expect to find an annual period.
Without, however, discussing further the production of, or relation
between, magnetic disturbances and earth currents, on which some
thing will be said in a later part of this paper, we will proceed
to offer some particulars more nearly concerning what has gone
before.
    In asking for corresponding times of magnetic movement at the
places    mentioned in Table I, request was also in each case made
for   information   on  the   direction   and  character of the magnetic
movement,     and many interesting particulars were thus supplied.    It
is not proposed on the present occasion to treat these details nu
merically, but rather to group them in such a wray as to show, in a
simple and ready manner, the direction of the magnetic movements
at each place on the Beveral days.        The results are given in Table
III, in which the sign + indicates that the north end of the declina

              Magnetic Variations at different Places,    fyc.       203
tion magnet was drawn towards the west, the north end of the hori
zontal force magnet to'wards the north, and the north end of the
 vertical force magnet downwards ; the sign — indicating in each
case the opposite movement.      At Mauritius, Batavia, and Melbourne,
at which places the south end of the needle dips, the sign + indicates
that the south end of the vertical force magnet was drawn down
 wards. In the absence of definite information, this is presumed to
apply also to Cape Horn, at which the south end also dips. The
movement in horizontal force appears to have been in general the
most significant.    At the stations in tropical regions the movements
in declination and vertical force were usually small.
    The table gives an interesting synopsis of the direction of magnetic
movement in the several cases, and the general similarity of movement
at each station on different days.     Thus the movements in the three
magnetic elements on different days at Cape Horn, Bombay, Batavia,
and Zi-ka-wei were, so far as information is available, in each case
similar throughout, and, with one or two exceptions, also at Greenwich,
 Pawlowsk, and Mauritius ; at Melbourne there were variations, and
at Toronto, for which place information in regard to the declination
change only was received, there were also variations.       At Greenwich
the increase in all elements was always accompanied by earth current
of one character as respects direction of current, the instances of
decrease in the magnetic elements being accompanied by earth cur
rent of opposite character.
    The general, indeed remarkable, similarity in the character of the
initial magnetic impulse on different days at the several places, con
sidered in connexion with the coincidence in time, indicates the advent
in these cases of some powerful disturbance or sudden shock influencing
the magnetism of the whole earth nearly always in the same way, an
influence in which the earth becomes, as it were, at once involved, a
state of general magnetic calm being at all places immediately con
verted into a state of magnetic activity.       Whether these magnetic
movements occur more frequently when any particular region of the
earth is turned towards the sun is a question that the selected cases
of Table I, with the additional instances to be found in Table IV, are
too few to determine ; but this point may receive elucidation from a
more extended inquiry which the many years of Greenwich records
will readily afford, and with which object some tabulation thereof
has been already made.
   Our inquiry has been confined to a consideration of the initial mag
netic movements preceding disturbance. As pointed out, these move
ments occur simultaneously, both for the different magnetic elements
 and for all places.   The character of the magnetic change is mostly
 similar at any one place on different days, but is not necessarily the
 same for ail places ; that is to say, the initial phenomena become, on

  the different occasions, repeated at each station in a generally similar
  manner, but with the individual difference peculiar to the station.
  Disturbance having, however, once set in, it is found that, although
  the magnetic irregularity will be practically similar for places not
  geographically distant, as Greenwich and Kew, there is not the same
 complete similarity in the movements at places widely separated.
  The magnetic impulse at any moment during disturbance may, of
 course, be simultaneously propagated through the earth, as in the case
  of the initial movements ; but it is not usually possible to fix on any
  phase of movement, and say to what phase it corresponds at another
  distant station, unless the movement is sudden, when the initial type
 again recurs, and such recurrence, occurring during disturbance at
  Greenwich, has been found to correspond with recurrence at other
 places.    Generally it is only these cases of sudden, not necessarily
 large, movement, occurring at the beginning or during a magnetic
 disturbance, that we can readily identify as being really simultaneous
 and corresponding movements.
     Reference has been made to the earth currents always so active
 during magnetic disturbance. Mr. C. V. Walker, formerly telegraph
 superintendent of the South Eastern Railway, in a paper read before
 the Royal Society in the year 1861, came to the conclusion, from
 observations made on the telegraph lines under his control, that earth
 currents, at least at times of great magnetic disturbance, exercised a
 direct action upon magnetomoters, just as artificial currents confined
 to a wire exercise a direct action upon a magnet. Two insulated lines
 of wire were afterwaixls established in connexion with the Royal
 Observatory, one passing from the Observatory to Dartford, the other
 from the Observatory to Croydon, expressly for the study of earth
 currents. The distance between the earth plates in the Dartford circuit
 was 10 miles, and in the Croydon circuit 8 miles.          Sir George Airy,
discussing   the  earth  currents  observed  in these lines during the years
 1865 to 1867 (' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 158, p. 471), confirmed generally Mr.
Walker's result, considering that " it is impossible to avoid the conclu
sion that the magnetic disturbances are produced by terrestrial galvanic
currents below the magnets ;" but there were some anomalies, the earth
current appearing, in some cases, distinctly to follow the magnetic
motion, instead of being coincident with, or preceding, it, as, on the
supposition mentioned, should always happen, and in other cases pre
ceding it by a longer interval of time than the conditions seemed to
require.                           •
    In the year 1868 the earth current lines to Dartford and Croydon
were replaced by two others running, one from near Morden College,
lilaekheath, to the North Kent East Junction of the South Eastern
Railway (distance between earth plates 2£ miles), and the other from
Angerstein Wharf (on the bank of the River Thames, near Charlton)

to Lady Well, Lewisham (distance between earth plates        miles)                                                              3                             :
these positions being selected in order that the recording apparatus
at the Royal Observatory, through which the wires passed, should be
nearly in the middle of the straight lines joining the respective earth
plates. Now has been mentioned that the instances of sharply-defined
                         it
magnetic impulses contained in Table      were all accompanied (in thoI
just-described newer earth current lines) by active earth currents, in
themselves just as sharply defined.     The distinctive character and
generally isolated position of these magnetic and earth current move
ments thus afford a peculiarly favourable opportunity for investigat
ing any relation that may exist between them, much more so than

                Magnetic Variations at different Places,   fyc.           207
  would any attempt to discuss movements of a mixed or involved
  nature, and it is found that motions of the declination and horizontal
  force magnets for the instances contained in Table         I  are, without
  exception, in direction such as would be produced by the action of a
  current passing through a wire under the magnet, similar to that of
  the actual accompanying earth cnrrent.
     But then comes a further question : — Do earth current and mag
  netic times really agree ? For in the discussion of the Dartford and
  Croydon earth current records, the earth current on some occasions,
 iiccording to the instrumental time scales, seemed undoubtedly to
 follow the magnetic movement, instead of being coincident with, or
 preceding, it. But the system on which the time scales were in those
 days laid down was not arranged with a view to the accurate measure
 ment of small intervals of time, and in this respect did not permit of
 an accuracy equal to that to be obtained from later registers, on
 which a time indication is made at every individual hour. Thus
 we are now able to effect a much more certain comparison of the
 times of magnetic and earth current movement than was before
 possible.   This has been done for a considerable number of instances
 of sudden initial movement, including all those of Table I (excepting
 1882, April 16, on which day the earth current register was defective),
and also a number of others, the whole particulars being given in
 Table IV.
    When it is considered that each separate difference in this table
includes the sum of the errors of two time measures from photo
graphs having a time scale in which one minute corresponds to about
O'Ol inch, the agreement of results, it will be seen, is very good.
Every case selected for measurement is given ; nothing has been
rejected.     The variation between individual differences does not
exceed in amount that which may well be expected, with a time scale
so contracted, and would appear to be simply due to unavoidable
errors of measurement.      The mean of the 31 differences is — 0-14 m.,
equivalent to 8 sec, or, dividing the 31 differences into three groups
of 11, 10, and 10 values respectively, the means of these groups are
found to be —0*19 m., — 0-12 m., and — 0-10 m., equivalent to 11 sec,
7 sec, and 6 sec. respectively, thus persistently showing          the earth
current to precede by a few seconds the magnetic movement.               Not
that these   results should be taken too strictly, but simply   as  showing,
when definite comparison can be made, that the coincidence of time
is really very close, possibly more so than present existing means
will permit us to determine. This so far removes the before-men
tioned time anomaly, the observed facts being now seen to be alto
gether consistent with the supposition that earth currents may pro
duce the magnetic movements, whether or not, as regards cause and
effect, this be the true relation.  For it has to be remembered that in

                Magnetic Variations at different Places, cjr.            200
   magnetic disturbances the variations of vertical force, which are some
  times very great, have also to be considered, as well as those of
  declination and horizontal force. Bat even admitting the supposition
  to be correct, there remains for consideration the question as to how
  the diurnal magnetic variations are produced.
     Magnetic disturbances and irregular magnetic motions of every
  kind are always accompanied at Greenwich by earth currents more
  or less powerful, the correspondence being most complete, as may be
  seen in the engraved copies of magnetic and earth current movements
  given since the year 1882 in the annual Greenwich volume.             The
  diurnal magnetic variation of declination or horizontal force, on the
  other hand, which (when there is no accidental magnetic irregularity)
  consists principally of one bold daily sweep, has no corresponding
  earth current, being accompanied principally by alternating currents,
  weak in character, and generally of short period. That is to say, a
  sudden magnetic movement of an amplitude no greater than that of
 the undisturbed diurnal curve (comparing one part of the day with
 another) will be accompanied by active earth current, whilst the bold
 sweep of the undisturbed dinrnal curve has no marked earth current
 counterpart, but only fluctuations of feeble character. The ampli
 tude of the diurnal magnetic variation may be greater than the
 motion in many of the cases of movement included in Table 1, but
 the earth current in the former case would be insignificant, whilst in
 the latter it is most marked. Irregularity in magnetic action and
 activity of earth current are correlative phenomena, rising and falling
together in intensity, earth current activity indicating irregularity of
 magnetic movement or magnetic storm, superposed on, and, indeed,
frequently masking, the ordinary diurnal curve.
    The assumption that the magnetic movements in a magnetic storm
are due to action of the accompanying earth currents thus appears
not to be one that will explain the ordinary diurnal magnetic varia
tion, as, indeed, Sir George Airy had previously found ('Phil.
 Trans.,' vol. 160, p. 226) from discussion of the earth currents
observed in the old Dartford and Croydon earth current lines.          The
phenomena have, indeed,     different  characteristics. The  period of  the
 diurnal magnetic variation is the solar day, and the principal sweep
in the curve occurs whilst the sun is above the horizon. Magnetic
irregularities, on the other hand, and their accompanying earth
currents, appear at any moment.         Although both probably solar in
origin, they  are not produced  in the  same way. The diurnal variation
progresses gradually, the principal phase occurring successively at
different places, as they become turned towards the sun, but magnetic
irregularities arise suddenly and simultaneously at all places.        The
special characteristics of the two classes of phenomena     may be stated
as follows : —

   However bold the diurnal variation may be, so long as it progresses
uniformly, the earth currents remain fluctuating and feeble, and
apparently cannot produce the long sweep of the diurnal curve.             But
if any magnetic irregularity arises, a corresponding earth current at
once appears.      It was pointed out with respect to the magnetic move
ments on the selected days (Tables I and III), that the earth
currents observed at Greenwich in connexion therewith always had
a definite relation with the motions in declination and horizontal force.
This, taken in connexion with the coincidence in time (Table IV),
certainly suggests mutual relation. But, in view of the circumstance
that the diurnal magnetic variation does not appear to depend on
earth current, can we suppose that it may be otherwise with the
irregular magnetic motions, and that they are produced by earth
currents ? When a magnetic storm arises the earth would appear
to become as a whole instantaneously affected, necessarily, it would
seem, from without.       Is it that both classes of phenomena, irregular
magnetic    variations  and earth currents, are produced by independent
action, and that any mutual relation, if existing, is of secondary cha
racter. In the Greenwich registers the variations of horizontal force,
during periods of magnetic disturbance, follow with surprising close
ness the accompanying earth current variations, the turning points
being in a very remarkable degree simultaneous. But, after the initial
movement, there is not a similar resemblance as regards declination
changes.     And how are the variations of vertical force produced ?
Can there be here any relation with earth currents ?
   The general direction of strongest earth current at Greenwich at
the present time is one not very different from that of the line
joining the Angerstein Wharf — Lady Well earth plates.                Does this
direction of strongest earth current depend on geological formation,,
or is it slowly variable, as are the magnetic elements P If not variable,
the earth current influence on the declination and horizontal force
magnets, if such influence exists, would be different when the direc
tion of the magnetic meridian has greatly changed.             This is a point
the study of    which  might   in  the  course  of time  throw    considerable
light on the relation between magnetic and earth current irregulari

                 Magnetic Variations at different Places,  Sfc.        211
   ties, in regard to which there is yet much to learn. It would tend to
   help this, as well as other inquiries concerning earth current phe
   nomena, if at some of the magnetic observatories in different parts of
  the world, the magnetic registers were supplemented by a registra
   tion of earth currents, as a regular part of the daily work.
      The comparison of the times of magnetic impulses with those of
  the corresponding earth currents, Table IV, gave, as a mean result,
  that, at Greenwich, the magnetic impulse, on the whole, followed the
  earth current by some few seconds.       To determine more exactly and
  with greater certainty, and especially in individual cases, what may
  really be the interval, if appreciable, between the phenomena would
  require apparatus designed to indicate simultaneously and measure
  accurately much smaller intervals of time than is at present possible.
 This leads us to mention a difficulty that affects the registration of
 magnetical and meteorological phenomena of all kinds, and one not
 readily overcome.       To obtain continuous registration of any element
 a contracted time scale is necessary,        otherwise the accumulated
 registers would become overwhelming, neither is an extended time
 scale, under ordinary circumstances, required.        But on occasions of
 disturbance or storm, whether magnetic or atmospheric, it becomes
 desirable to possess the power of greatly increasing the extent of the
 time scale, in order to obtain, not only a more accurate timn indica
 tion, but also a better record of the details of phenomena.           The
 difficulty becomes increased because of the uncertainty of the advent
 of any special phenomenon of which fuller particulars would be
 desirable.      Still, if it were possible to provide means ot easily
 changing the speed of movement of a register, much valuable infor
mation might be gained.
     In recapitulation of the results which may be considered to have
been arrived at in this paper, we may remark that, though it was
known that magnetic storms were felt generally at the same time
over wide areas of the earth's surface, it had not been ascertained
that any magnetic movements were so entirely coincident at different
places as now appears, at any rate so far as concerns the initial
magnetic impulses that precede disturbance, and which, it would
seem, really occur at the same instant of time, or nearly so, over
the whole earth.        It appears also, in addition, that the change that
takes place at such times in the earth's magnetic condition is, on all
occasions, in great measure of like character. A definite magnetic
effect is produced suddenly and simultaneously, in which the varia
tions of the magnetic elements, whilst different at different places,
are, on different occasions, locally similar, forming thus a type of
the magnetic phenomena that, repeating itself usually in the same
way, generally presages or introduces a magnetic disturbance or
storm.

   212     Simultaneity  of Magnetic Variations at different Places,   S(c.
      It has been further shown that at Greenwich the sudden magnetic
   impulses immediately preceding or commencing disturbance are con
   current in time with the sudden appearance in each case of an earth
  current, in advance by a few seconds of the magnetic impulse, and
   having always the same relation with the magnetic movements,
  increase of magnetic declination, horizontal force, and vertical force,
  being accompanied by a current in one and the same direction, and
  decrease of these elements by a current in the opposite direction.        A
  like concurrence in time between such magnetic movements and
 earth currents is presumably true also for other places.
     If the near time relation thus established between initial magnetic
 and earth current movements at Greenwich applies generally during
 the course of a magnetic storm, any difficulty as respects the assump
 tion that the irregular changes of magnetic declination and horizontal
 force may be produced by the accompanying earth currents seems
 removed.      But though the changes of horizontal force during a mag
 netic   disturbance   closely follow the earth current changes, those of
 declination do not show the same correspondence, and the variations
of vertical force have also to be explained, in addition to which it
 would conclusively seem that the diurnal magnetic variation does
not depend on earth current, since the bold sweep of this curve
 (when undisturbed) is accompanied by comparative earth current
calm.
    With reference to the comparison of times of magnetic impulses at
different places, it does not seem probable that with existing appa
ratus any better result would be obtained by making comparison for
an increased number of days.         But it would be interesting, even with
the present apparatus,     to  obtain corresponding times, if possible, for
a greater number of places, in order more conclusively to determine
whether the constant difference of time that appears to exist between
some stations (Table II) is really a physical fact, or whether it may
not be due to small systematic error in the individual registering
apparatus.      Registers on an extended scale, on the system mentioned
in a preceding paragraph, would, however, be much more likely to
give definite information on this point.
    If this paper has added anything to the knowledge of a difficult
 subject, it will be felt that some labour has not been expended in
vain.

          Interchange  of Pulmonary    Gases   in Respiration of Man. 213
     " Contribution to the History of the Interchange of Pul
         monary Gases in the Respiration of Man." By William
         MARCET, M.D., F.R.S.        Received June 9, — Read June 16,
         1892
               *
      I had the honour of communicating a paper to the Royal Society
   in June, 1891, embodying the results obtained from a first series of
   inquiries on the interchange of pulmonary gases. The investigation
   has been continued, and I have had the benefit of the assistance of
  Mr. G. P. Darnell Smith, B.Sc, in the present work. I am greatly
  indebted to Mr. Smith for many useful suggestions ; while our dis
  cussions have been fraitful on many occasions.
      The apparatus used for the estimation of carbonic acid and oxygen
  has been fully described in my former paper, but, as the drawing of
  the eudiometer employed could not be inserted in that communica
  tion, it is appended to this paper together with an explanation of
  the construction of the instrument.
      The key to a method of investigation calculated to give correct
  information on the interchange of the respiratory gases is to be found
  in the means adopted for the determination of the volumes of air
  inspired and expired. C. Speck in his experiments, inspired a
  measured volume of air from a bell-jar, carefully balanced over a
  water trough, and expired it into another, the volumes of air in
 spired and expired being thus determined by direct measurement.
 Messrs. Hanriod and Richet used gas meters instead of bell-jars.      In
 my former inquiry, after trying how closely experiments with bell-
 jars agreed with each other, it was found that' the results obtained
 were not sufficiently reliable to be used except in the form of means ;
 on that account, the object was attained by calculation, assuming that
the volume of nitrogen in the air expired was exactly the same as
 the volume of nitrogen in- the air inspired ; consequently the volume
of nitrogen expired was proportional to the volume of air inspired.
     It has occurred to me that an objection to this means of deter
mining the volume of air inspired might be raised on the ground
that it is unscientific to adopt a method of inquiry based on an
assumption, although the investigations of Regnault and Reiset have
apparently placed what I call an assumption on the footing of an
acknowledged fact. There was consequently a gap to fill up, as it
was necessary to ascertain whether nitrogen is either absorbed in the
blood or given out, or whether it takes no appreciable part in the
respiratory process ; with this object, an experiment was made by
re-breathing a known volume of air in a bell-jar, and determining
afterwards the volume of nitrogen present in this air, but the
                            * Rcrised August, 1892.

214          Dr. W. Marcet.       History of the Intercliange of
method    proved   unsatisfactory.     Another experiment was made with
three bell-jars — a small one, of a capacity of 10 litres, being placed
between two others which held, when full, 40 litres each ; the three
bell-jars were connected with each other by india-rubber tubing
in the course of which an apparatus was disposed for the absorp
tion of carbonic acid. The person under experiment breathed out
of and into the middle and smaller bell-jar, which held at the time
5 or 6 litres of air, while a known volume of air was driven from one
of the large bell- jars into the other, through the smaller receiver and
back again.      The carbonic acid absorbed was replaced by oxygen
gas.    The principle of the method was indeed the same as that
adopted .by Regnault and Reiset, and more recently by Messrs. Jolyot,
Bergonie, and Sigalas.* Great difficulty, however, was met with in this
experiment, especially from the tension of gases in the bell- jars, and
it was ultimately given up.
    At last the simplest method was resorted to ; although, the results
of the experiments varying somewhat widely from each other, this
process necessitated the adoption of means.
    The experiments were conducted much on the same principle as
those made by C. Speck, every precaution being taken to carry them
out as correctly as possible.        For this purpose, 40 litres of atmo
spheric air were introduced into one of my bell-jars, the air being
saturated by passing it slowly through a glass vessel holding cotton
wool wetted with tepid water.          Air was inspired from this bell-jar
through the nose, with nose-pieces fitting closely into the nostrils,
and expired from the mouth into another bell-jar, also holding
40 litres ; corrections were made for slight differences between the
bell-jars and for temperatures.        In some of the experiments a valve
was placed in the tract of the air inspired, and in others no valve
was used, but the inspiratory and expiratory india-rubber tubes were
pinched alternately with the fingers to prevent any regurgitation.
Notwithstanding every care to breathe as naturally as possible, the
relations between the volumes of air inspired and expired were
occasionally found to differ widely from each other.          On this account
it has been found necessary to reject a certain number of these experi
ments, which yielded figures clearly far distant from those they should
have given ; and I have finally a series of ten experiments to record,
in which it will be observed that, although there is a very marked
difference between the figures obtained, still the means show that
nitrogen takes no appreciable part in the phenomenon of respimtion,
 if concerned at all in this function.
    The following are the results obtained, placed in a tabular form —
         References to Hicbc papers were given in my former communication.

   In this table the first column of figures, on the left, shows the
volumes of air inspired, as measured in the bell- jar from which the
air was breathed ; the second column shows the corresponding
volumes of air expired as determined in the Becond receiver. The
third column gives the volumes of air inspired, calculated from the
assumption that the whole of the nitrogen exhaled is also inhaled.
    It will be observed that the mean of the volumes in the third
column is all but exactly the same as the mean of the volumes in the
first column, the difference being only by 3 c.c. ; hence the obvious
conclusion that nitrogen takes no appreciable part, or no part at all
in the interchange of the pulmonary gases.
   It follows from the harmony found to exist between the mean
volumes of air actually inspired and the mean volumes of air in
spired determined by calculation, that the corresponding volumes of
nitrogen, of oxygen consumed, and oxygen absorbed and retained in
the blood, whether found or calculated, will also be practically the
same ; this is set forth clearly in the next table.
    These experiments show most satisfactorily that the method
adopted to obtain the volumes of air inspired by calculatio7i can be
trusted as correct ; and, therefore, that not only the means obtained
by that method, but also every single experiment, may be accepted as
giving a reliable result. A certain amount of training was, however,
required before the results could be considered as fit for recording.
    The next point for consideration refers to the influence of changes
of temperature on the consumption of oxygen per minute, or, in other
words, on the carbonic acid produced and oxygen absorbed.                   These
experiments have been made on myself and Mr. Smith while under
the influence of food, and an additional number were made on

   have been, of course, more satisfactory to eliminate the influence of
   food while inquiring into the action of differences of temperature on
   the interchange of the pulmonary gases.                The results obtained show
   the effects of a change of temperature on the chemical phenomena of
   respiration to vary somewhat with different persons, some being more
   disposed than others to react against an accession of cold by an
   increased production of carbonic acid.             In my case, the effect is very
   obvious, as seen in the following table (p. 218).
       First of all, if the means of the oxygen consumed per minute, the
  carbonic acid produced, and the oxygen absorbed, also per minute, be
  compared with the corresponding figures obtained under the influence
  of food in my former inquiry,* they will be found to harmonise with
  them in a marked degree ; they are as follows : —

       The oxygen consumed is nearly exactly the same in both cases,
  varying by only 1 c.c. The carbonic acid produced is a little lower
  in the recent experiments, and the oxygen absorbed somewhat
  higher.
      The slight difference between the carbonic acid produced in each
  set of experiments, and also the difference, which is rather greater,
  between the figures found for oxygen absorbed in the two series of
  experiments, 30'2 and 3.V7, are probably owing to the precaution taken
  in the recent inquiry of allowing half an hour's perfect rest, in the
  recumbent posture, before commencing the experiment. Formerly
  the time of rest had been limited to from five minutes to a quarter of
  an hour, "when the pulse and breathing had become perfectly regular ;
  but it was subsequently found that half an hour at least should be
  allowed before collecting the air expired for analysis, in order to
  ensure the body being in a perfect state of rest.
      The table has been disposed in a graphic form, the curves showing,
 at a glance, the influence of temperature on the interchange of
 pulmonary gases in my case ; this influencef may be summarised as
 follows : —

   1st. The oxygon consumed falls as the temperatures rise.
   2nd. The carbonic acid produced falls at a similar rate, under the
             same  conditions   of temperature, or        as  the temperatures
             rise.
   3rd. The oxygen absorbed increases as the temperatures rise.
   4th. The ratio of oxygen consumed to carbonic acid produced falls
            as the temperatures increase.      This is a natural consequence
            of the corresponding variation of the oxygen consumed and
             carbonic acid produced.
    This chart is made by grouping the temperatures as follows, and
classing the figures for oxygen consumed, carbonic acid produced,
winter temperatures, when an  accession of cold is to be met by an increased oxida
tion  in tho body.  Summer temperatures may act altogether in a different way.

    Of coarse it cannot be expected, in a work of this kind, that tracings
 will be perfectly regular; hence in the tracing for oxygen consumed
we observe a slight abnormal rise between 14°'4 and 160,3.                  This is
probably owing to the weather being cold outside ; the experiment was
done on the 24th of February ; the maximum temperature of that day
in the open air was      9° C.  (Wimbledon Park), and the body was partly
under this cooling influence, although the temperature of the labora
tory, at University College, heated with hot-water pipes, was 160,3.
The tracing for carbonic acid produced also exhibits irregularities,
but the curves show distinctly that, at all events in my case, changes
of temperature exert a very positive influence on the interchange of
the pulmonary gases.
   If the temperatures of the atmosphere in which the experiments
are made be divided into two groups, one group including the lowest
and another the highest, and a table constructed, into which the
carbonic acid produced and oxygen absorbed are entered together
with their corresponding temperatures,                 this table will be as

   The mean ratio of C02 produced to 0 absorbed is, therefore, very
different according to temperatures ; it is much lower in relatively
cold than in warmer temperatures ; hence the interesting fact that
the absorption into the blood of that proportion of oxygen consumed
which is not transformed into carbonic acid is not concerned in the
production of heat towards resisting external cold. This is clearly
the case, as the colder the atmosphere the less the proportion of
oxygen consumed as absorbed in opposition to the proportion con
sumed towards the production of carbonic acid, which is markedly
increased.   A similar effect of temperature is met with in the experi
ments reported in my former paper.       Out of six experiments made
on myself under the influence of food, two were carried out 2 hrs.
25 mins. and 1 hr. and 40 mins. respectively after a meal, when
the laboratory in winter was much below its usual temperature,
the readings being 10°-4 C. and 12° C. ; on these occasions the
oxygen absorbed per minute was 27 c.c. and 24"8 c.c. respectively,
and the mean ratio between the COa produced and O absorbed was
25-9
22g
      = 0"114; while when the laboratory was comfortably warm, at
a mean temperature of 16°'8    C,  the mean volume of oxygen absorbed
                              324
was 32"4 c.c, and the ratio tjjg-" = 0,152.   Hence, again, the ratios
were lower in low than in high temperatures, which means that
in my case in low temperatures less oxygen is absorbed, relatively
to the carbonic acid produced, than in high temperatures.    The expe
riments while fasting reported in my former paper were all made when
the laboratory was comfortably warm, and cannot be utilised towards
showing the influence of temperature.

                Pulmonary Gases in    the Respiration of Man.         223
      In Mr. Smith's  case there are actually seven pairs of experiments
   (fourteen altogether) made under the influence of food.       Each ex
  periment was repeated at the time, and the means of the pairs were
  taken and recorded.
      Grouping these pairs of experiments two-by-two, as shown in this
  last table, the volumes of oxygen consumed will be found to exhibit
  a slight decrease as the temperatures rise, the carbonic acid pro
 duced also shows a slight tendency to fall with the increase of tem
 perature. The oxygen absorbed, which in my case is unmistakably
 increased with a rise in temperature, is not found to undergo a similar
 change, but remains nearly the same throughout ; there being a slight
 fall at the two highest temperatures.
      With reference to the influence of food on the interchange of the
 pulmonary gases, the experiments made on Mr. Smith fasting, or
 when a desire for food was felt about five hours after breakfast,
 showed a considerable falling off in the oxygen consumed, carbonic
 acid produced, and oxygen absorbed.         Corresponding experiments
 have been reported in my former paper. Mr. Russell, who assisted me
 at the time, a young gentleman twenty-one years of age, also exhi
 bited a decrease, though but slight, of oxygen absorbed while fasting,
 the figures being 33-3 c.c. while fasting, and 37-5 at a mean period of
 2 hrs. 16 min. after a full meal.   In my case the figures were 35"3 c.c.
 while fasting and 30"2 under food, which show a slight influence in
 the opposite direction.     It appears, therefore, that the influence of
food upon the absorption of oxygen varies with different persons,
but that in young and strong people the absorption of oxygen has a
 decided tendency to increase after a meal.
     The results obtained from the present inquiry may be summarised
as follows : —
     1. Nitrogen acts a part inappreciable, if concerned at all, in the
interchange of pulmonary gases.
     2. The influence of changes of the atmospheric temperature on the
oxygen consumed, carbonic acid produced, and oxygen absorbed, al
though in the present experiments this influence is more or less inter
fered with by the phenomena of digestion, is distinct in my case ; the
oxygen consumed and carbonic acid produced increasing with falling
temperatures, while the oxygen absorbed is lessened ; and a similar
result is obtained from the consideration of the figures given in my
former communication. This fact is interesting, perhaps, mainly as
showing that the oxygen absorbed is not concerned in the formation
of heat in the body towards resisting cold — a function which appears
to be limited entirely to the oxidation of carbon into carbonic acid.
If, as usually admitted, the blood is limited in its power of taking up
oxygen, although this power may apparently vary according to tempe
ratures, then it is obvious that an increased formation of carbonic acid

   224        Dr. W. Marcet.       History of    the Interchange of
  must necessarily be attended with a falling off in the oxygen absorbed.
  Cold wonld thus rob the body of a portion of its oxygen and inter
  fere with those functions of nutrition with which the absorbed oxygen
  is concerned.     This would explain the hibernation of animals —
  their functions are arrested because the whole of the oxygen they
  consume in winter is used up towards the formation of carbonic acid,
 and there is none left to carry on the phenomena of nutrition.             It
 would also account for the sleepiness or stupor well known to be
 produced by intense cold.
     When Mr. Smith was nnder experiment the influence of temperature
 on the oxygen consumed and carbonic acid produced was in the same
 direction, though much less marked than in my case. The oxygen
 absorbed does not, however, show the same tendency to decrease with
 a falling temperature.       This does not,      I  consider, invalidate the
 result as obtained on myBelf, the temperature of the air being higher
 when the experiments were made on Mr. Smith than when they were
 undertaken on myself, and the body being nnder the influence of an
early spring season in March ; while the experiments on myself were
made in winter, when the laboratory at times was very cold.
    3. The influence of food on the interchange of respiratory gases,
although being attended with a rise in the oxygen consumed and
carbonic acid expired, apparently varies with reference to the oxygen
absorbed.     Young and strong persons, requiring a full allowance
of food, appear to absorb more oxygen while under the influence
of a meal than while fasting, but late in life the oxygen absorbed
appears to show little or no tendency to increase after a meal.
According to Hanriot and Richet, tbe carbonic acid produced increases
considerably nnder tbe influence of food, while the increased absorp
tion of oxygen is but slight.*
                     I
    In conclusion, wish to allude shortly to a result embodied in my
former communication, and relating to the respiration of air contain
ing an increased proportion of carbonic acid.           Five experiments had
been made    —  three on myself and two on my assistant, Mr. Russell.
The proportions of C02 in the air inspired were respectively 2-13,
3"14, 4-06, 3-79, and 3"91 per cent.       It was fonnd that the amount of
carbonic acid produced in a given time was lower than when pure air
was breathed, and that the oxygen absorbed was greatly increased.
    The following table gives the figures obtained for the oxygen
absorbed   : —

   It 'will be seen that the oxygen absorbed per minute when carbonic
acid was breathed greatly exceeded the oxygen absorbed when pure
air was inspired. The figures given in the table for O absorbed
under normal conditions, are taken, with one exception, from experi
ments made at the same sitting as those in which C02 was breathed,
and therefore compare with them.           The excessive volume of oxygen
absorbed when air mixed with C02 was inhaled must have been owing
to the fact that a portion of the oxygen consumed, which under usual
circumstances would have been given out as carbonic acid, remained
in the blood, obviously as carbonic acid, because of the impeded
diffusion in the lungs on account of the C02 contained in the air
breathed. The actual amount of carbonic acid being thus retained
                                                    I
in the blood can be calculated, with what think a near degree of
approximation, by subtracting the oxygen which would have been
absorbed in the respiration of pure air from the oxygen actually found
to have been absorbed under the influence of the COj inspired.
   These figures, varying from 44 c.c. to 133 c.c, are entered in the
last column of the table, and show how large a volume of C02 may be
retained in the blood when air contaminated with C02 is used for
respiration. This carbonic acid goes on accumulating in the body inter
fering with the normal phenomena of oxidation. It is very difficult
to consider this effect otherwise than poisonous ; although under cir
cumstances which admit of the introduction of C02 in the blood
through another channel than respiration, the gas appears innocuous.
CI. Bernard has shown this to be the case by the injection of CO» into
the circulation of animals, when the gas found its way ont of the body
through the lungs without producing any morbid action.

226        Dr. W. Marcet.    History of   the Interchange of
   The eudiometer has the form of a (J -tube, drawn into an open neck
at its bend, where the opening is controlled with a stopcock.  One of
the limbs of the instrument, which is graduated, is surrounded by a
water jacket, and has an iron cap cemented to it, in which there is a

                Pulmonary Gases in    the  Respiration  of Man.           227
  three-way iron stopcock.   A  scale is fixed at the back of the open limb,
 the   divisions corresponding exactly to those engraved on the other
 limb.
     The flask C, open at both ends, is   fnll of water, and communicates
 by india-rubber tubing with the cylinder D, which contains the air for
 analysis.
     The process of analysis is as follows : — The eudiometer is entirely
 filled with mercury.      Next, the hydrogen being placed under a
 pressure     of 1 or 2 inches of water by depressing the receiver,
the    gas is driven through the three-way cock, while at the same
time it is aspired by a compressed india-rubber syringe, which is
suddenly released ; this washes out all the atmospheric air from the
tube connecting the snpply of hydrogen with the eudiometer.              The
three-way cock being turned so as to connect the hydrogen-receiver
with the eudiometer, mercury is let out at the bend of the instru
ment, when hydrogen is drawn into it, and the volume of the gas
recorded.       Air from the flask D is admitted into the eudiometer
through the india-rubber tube, pressnre being exerted by the water
held in the flask D, while aspiration is produced by letting out
mercury from the eudiometer.         The gases are brought under atmo
spheric pressure by adding     or taking out mercury.
     The gases are mixed in the eudiometer by means of an india-
rubber syringe fitting to the open end of the instrument, where the
funnel is shown in the drawing; the syringe is compressed and
released repeatedly, thus driving the mercury up and down.               The
little movable spirit level is convenient, though not indispensable,

such an instrument has been proposed, or used, for similar purposes

   The following results were obtained at King's College, Strand, for
a specimen of very pure iron. The experiments were made under the
direction of Dr. Hopkinson.          The sample was supplied to him by Sir
Frederick Abel, K.C.B., F.R.S. , to whom it was sent by Colonel
Dyer, of the Elswick Works. It is of almost pure iron, and the sub
stances other than iron are stated to be : —
         Carbon.         Silicon.      Phosphorus.     Sulphur.      Manganese.

remarkably with the temperature, but just the reverse for a force of,

   During the heating of the specimen, the critical point, when the
iron suddenly became non-magnetic, was reached at 874° C. (875°),
and on cooling it became magnetic at 835° C. (838°).
   Comparing these results with those obtained with the more
ordinary specimens of iron mentioned in Dr. Hopkinson's paper, we
have here 874° C. as against 786° C, while in an experiment on some
soft iron wiro the critical temperature was 880° C, and for hard piano
forte wire it was 838° C.

 234            Mr. J. W. Hulke.      On the Sfwulder Girdle
 me     the task of re-examining the facts and the considerations on
 which were based those statements made nine years ago, and now
 questioned.     The ontcome of this enquiry     I now offer to the judg
 ment of the Royal Society.
     In his recent paper, in addition to the known elements recognised
 by all comparative anatomists (viz., two scapulae, two coracoids, two
 clavicles, and an interclavicle), Professor H. G. Seeley (a) assigns
 to the Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle a precoracoid, cartilaginous ;
 (b) he regards as non-proven my interpretation of the anterior of
 the two ventral rays present in the Plesiosaurian girdle, as a pre
 coracoid ; (c) he considers that the process ascending from the body
 of the scapula in Plesiosauria is not homologous with the analogous
 vertical ray in the Testudinate shoulder girdle ; and (<2) he contends
 that certain osseous components of the Plesiosaurian girdle are
 clavicles and interclavicle, and not omostemalia.
     It will be convenient to notice these matters serially.
     (a) The value of the evidence on which a precoracoid
                                                           — cartilaginous
— has been assigned to the Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle.
    Professor H. G. Seeley conceives the presence of a precoracoid —
cartilaginous — in this girdle which " articulated with the part of the
scapula anterior to the external articulation of the coracoid, and also
 with the anterior interior processes of the coracoids, so as to complete
the precoracoid foramen anteriorly."
    He founds this conception mainly on the supposition that the
ventral end of the scapula comprises three several portions : — (1) a
posterior portion which contributes to form the fossa glenoidalis ;
                                      " with the anterior, articular edge
 (2) a middle portion articulating
of the coracoid ; " and (3) an anterior which does not differ in its
cartilaginous, articular aspect or thickness from the middle portion,
but which looks inwards without any other bony element of the
shoulder girdle to articulate with it.
    The conception of a distinct anterior portion of the ventral end of
the scapula in front of that part of this end of the scapula which
articulates with the coracoid, therefore which is in front of the scapulo-
coracoid articulation, is, then, a principal reason for Professor
H. G. Seeley's conception of a precoracoid —cartilaginous — in the
Ichthyosaurian girdle.
    A careful study of many Ichthyosaurian scapulas disposes me to
regard as fallacious the appearance of a tripartite division of
the ventral end of the bone ; such a division does not appear
to me to be supported by the best preserved and most perfect
examples.
    In a scapula, now before me, obtained by   A. Leeds, Esq., from the
olay pits (Oxford clay) near Peterborough, which retains its normal
figure, texture, and surface markings, as perfectly as a newly mace-
 v

                     mi  Ichihyosauria  and Sauropterygia.              2'65
  rated bone,   I find the ventral end to comprise a stout, posterior part
 of an approximately semi- ellipsoidal figure, having its major axis,
  10*5 cm. long, much nearer the inner border, which does not greatly
 vary from a straight line. The minor axis, 4*3 cm. long, is distant
 4"6 cm. from the posterior vortex of the ellipsoid, towards which the
 thickness of the bone rapidly diminishes.         The reduction of thick
 ness forwards is less rapid, the width across the end, between the
 inner and the outer surface, being 1*8 cm., at the anterior vertex of
 the ellipsoid.      From this point forwards the thickness of the bone
 continues to decrease to the anterior border of the bone, with which
 this part of the ventral end makes an angle. At its anterior termi
 nation here the thickness of the ventral end is only 0"8 cm. The
 surface texture of this end has a granular character suggestive of a
 former cartilaginous crust.           This granulation is coarser in the
 narrower anterior part.
     When this scapula is stood on its ventral end on a flat horizontal
 surface, as on a table, and viewed perpendicularly to one of its
 surfaces (preferably the inner surface), the profile of this end of the
 bone comprises a middle, horizontal segment, from both ends of
 which the contour rises angularly ; its posterior branch includes
 with the horizontal direction of the middle part (produced) an angle
 of about 35° ; and its anterior branch includes with the same hori
zontal line an angle of 65°.
     This different direction of the parts of the profile apparently has
 suggested to Professor H. G. Seeley a threefold division, in which
 each part had a distinct separate office.        A critical examination of
 the snrface of the end shows, I think, that the idea of a tripartite
 division of this end is illusory, and that this end comprises only two
 parts, one posterior, glenoid, diarthrodial segment ; the other, an
 anterior     synchondrosial     segment,    which    articulated with the
 coracoid.
    The outer surface of the scapula near its ventral end is sinuous ;
convex in its posterior third, where the bone is stoutest ; and con
cave in its anterior two thirds, where the bone becomes thin, the
concavity here being chiefly due to the outward trend of the surface
 towards the anterior border which gives to this part a thin, lip-like,
angularly projecting figure where the ventral and anterior borders
meet.
    In conformity with      the ventral end of the scapula, the correspond
ing   outer   border    of  the roughly quadrilateral coracoid exhibits a
stout posterior part, its complement of the fossa glenoidalis ; and
a thinner anterior part which encroaches on the anterior border by
truncation of the antero-external angle, for synchondrosial union
with the scapula.
    Bearing in mind that the bones composing the Ichthyosaurian

236              Mr. J.  W. Hulke.       On  the  Shoulder Girdle
shoulder      girdle  are,  normally, never synostosed,*          but that the
scapulae and coracoids preserve their separate individuality even in
skeletons bearing the stamp of maturity, the inference is warrantable
that they were in life knit together by a persistent remnant of the
cartilaginous
                  " continuum," which in Amphibia and upwards is the
foundation of these two bones, and also of the precoracoid where
this exists.
   Further, analogy warrants the inference that the quantity of such
persistent cartilage remaining at the ventral end of the scapula, and
at the corresponding tract of the coracoid, varied with the age of the
individual, and in dependence on this, with the extent to which ossi
fication had advanced ; also that the quantity of this remaining
cartilage was not throughout its area a bond of uniform width, but
it was narrower where the bones it united approached, and wider
where they receded from one another. But the recess between the
truncated antero-external corner of the coracoid and the adjacent
antero-inferior angle of the scapula, both which parts bear, as Pro
fessor H. G. Seeley says, the mark of having had cartilage attached
to them, is just the situation where a wider band of synchondrosial
cartilage might be expected than was present posteriorly where the
scapnla and coracoid were nearer together.
   In support of his conception of a precoracoid — cartilaginous — in
Ichthyosauria, Professor H. G. Seeley cites the opinion held by Sir
E. Home, Bnckland, and Cuvier respecting the position and the rela
tions of the scapula.       These opinions are to be gathered chiefly from
their figures, since their text gives us little information of their
thoughts on the matter.
    Sir E. Home, in his third paper on Ichthyosaurian Remains,f says,
of the scapula in Mr. Bullock's specimen engraved in his first
          " it was then mistaken for a portion of a rib
paper,                                                               accidentally
brought there, but it is now found to have been nearly in its
natural situation. It bears a resemblance to the clavicular bone in
Birds."
    Sir E. Home's "reconstruction" of the Ichthyosaurian                 shoulder
girdle (fig. 1) was manifestly based on certain resemblances its com
ponent parts showed to those of the "sternum "of Ornithorhynehus
paradoxus, which latter was brought to his attention by Mr. W. Clift,
 Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.                    Sir
E. Home unfortunately misread the Monotreme's pectoral girdle ; ho
mistook its coracoid for a descending process of its scapula, and he
identified its epicoracoid with the Ichthyosaurian coracoid.
   *  I have noticed synostosis of scapula and coracoid in Ichthyosauria as a sequel
of inflammation, marked by much irregular hyperostosis.

   The unnatural proportions of the several bones shown in his recon
struction (fig. 1, PI. 2, 'Phil. Trans.,' Part I, 1818), place it beyond
doubt that he derived his ideas from the dissociated bones of more
than one individual, and also that he had not at that time seen in a
single skeleton all the component elements of this arch in their
normal, or in but slightly disordered relation.
   Cuvier treats of the scapula very briefly ; he says,* " L'omoplate,

 tions of the Ichthyosanrian shoulder girdle differ greatly, notably so
 in the positions and the relations of the scapula. As, however, Cnvier
 copies both, and abstains from expressing his own views on the sub
 ject, obviously little weight attaches to his authority in regard to it.
    The passage quoted above from the " Ossemens Fossiles," certainly
 mentions a " proeminence" on the anterior border of the scapula for
 affording support to the end of clavicle; bnt the passage is not quite
 free from ambiguity.           It does not, however, appear to me to fix
 the position of the scapula shown in Sir B. Home's reconstruction,
 and adopted by Professor H. G. Seeley, which represents a non-
 articular part of the ventral end of this bone in advance of the
 coraco-scapular articulation ; for the reconstruction shows the mesial
ends of the clavicles resting on the anterior aspect of the cross-bar
of the interclavicle, as we know by numerous examples they certainly
 do in many Ichthyosauria, and not on the antero-ventral angle of the
 scapula ; so that the end of the clavicle here referred to by Cuvier
 would seem not to be the inner but the outer end. Where this rests
on the anterior border of the scapula, I have noticed in some examples
a rough, low elevation, as if for a ligamentous attachment, a circum
stance confirmatory of the idea that the outer and not the inner end
of the clavicle is here intended.
    Buckland, another authority cited by Professor H. Gr. Seeley in
support of his view respecting the ventral end of the scapula, repro
duces Cuvier'a reduction of Sir E. Home's reconstruction given in
                 '
fig. 1, PI. 2, Phil. Trans.,' 1818 ; and since in his text he omits all
detailed description of the several parts composing the shoulder
girdle, he leaves us in ignorance whether he had himself formed a
distinct opinion respecting the normal position and relations of the
Ichthyosaurian scapula.*
   • Buckland,     W., ' Geology    and Mineralogy considered       with  Reference     to
Natural Theology,'    p. 181, toL 1, 1836, and PI. 12.

     Obviously, then, there is small claim to quote Buckland as an
 authority upon the anatomical details of the pectoral arch.
    Amongst other reasons for suggesting the presence of a precora-
 coid — cartilaginous — in Ichthyosaurus assigned by Professor H. G.
 Seeley, are the following, viz. : —
     1. " That it accounts for the structure of the shoulder girdle, and
explains its homology."
    If by " the structure of the shoulder girdle " the author means, as
 I imagine, the alleged tripartite division of the ventral end of the
scapula, and the marks of attachment of cartilage apparent in the
 foremost of the supposed three divisions, and also on the antero-
internal angle of the coracoid, both are naturally explained in the
suggestion I have offered above, and this without the introduction of
another skeletal element of which no objective trace remains.                         As
regards the homologies of          all the known parts of the Ichthyosaurian
shoulder girdle, I had supposed that all comparative anatomists had
long been in perfect accord.
    2.  "It    brings the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus into harmony
with Nothosaurus, in wrhich there is a similarly incomplete coracoid
foramen, and similar cartilaginous surfaces of coracoid and scapula
 in close juxtaposition."
    The Nothosaurian (osseous) shoulder girdle, for the knovvledgo of
which we are indebted to H. v. Meyer,* comprises three pairs and
an azygos piece, viz., two coracoids. two scapulae, two clavicles, and
an interclavicle.
    These are precisely the same osseous parts as are present in the
Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle.
    Now, Professor H. G. Seeley inferring the existence of a precora-
coid in Ichthyosaurus, supports this hypothesis by the argument that
its presence would bring the Ichthyosaurian girdle into harmony with
that of Nothosaurus, in which its presence is equally hypothetical.
    The form and the relations of its osseous parts are well seen in
the annexed figure from Zittel's ' Palseontologie,' which is a reduction
of one-fourth of H. v. Meyer's large figure of the shoulder girdle of
Nothos.     mirabilis.\
    H.   v. Meyer regarded the two angulated long bones composing the
principal part of the anterior ventral ray as clavicles, and the small
middle piece embraced by their inner ends as " sternum " (inter
clavicle in the nomenclature of to-day).                 I formerly thought these
precoracoids,      but    better  knowledge     of   the   relation of their inner
ends to the interclavicle, and of their outer ends to the scapula, has

      H. v. Meyer's, Fig. 1, Taf. 34, ' .Saurier des Musehelkalks.')
long appeared to me conclusive of the correctness of H. v. Meyer's
interpretation of their homology ; and I am confirmed in this rectifi
cation of my earlier view by instances of a similar behaviour of the
inner ends of the clavicles and interclavicle in certain Ichthyosauria
from the Oxford clay obligingly brought under my notico by A. Leeds.
Esq., of Peterborough.           Such relations obtain in Ophthalmosaunts
icenicus (Seeley, H. G.) (' Geol. Soc. Quart. Jour.,' p. 396, et seq., vol.
30, 1874).
   Whilst in certain Ichthyosauria the relations of the inner ends of
the clavicles and interclavicle are in close accord with those obtaining
in Nothosaurus,       the relation     of the outer ends of the clavicles to
the scapula) is different.
    In Ichthyosauria the clavicle tapers laterally, not widening, and its
 outer end creeps up along the anterior border of the blade of the
 scapula, splint- wise, nearly or quite to the full extent of the latter,
 with which, as already mentioned, it seems to have been only lign-
 mentously connected.          In Nothosaurus, however, the outer end of the
 clavicle is united sutnrally* to the body of the scapula, and at the
 root of its ascending process, which most comparative anatomists,                      I
 suppose, identify with the blade of the scapula.
   * The firmness of the suture (serr.ited) is shown   by the fact that von Meyer found
 several  specimens in which tl e clavicle had broken off near the suture which still
 held a fragment of (he clavicle firmly knit to the ftOirula.

    Unless I have greatly failed to grasp his meaning, Professor H. G.
 Seeley grounds his idea of the presence of a cartilaginous precoracoid
 in Nothosawvs on the characters of the terminal border of the process
 marked x, and on that of the part of the scapula marked       (fig. 3), and       as'
also in the presence of the notch n, at the outer side of the process x,
which he identifies with the notch in the anterior border of the Ichthyo-
saurian coracoid, and so with the precoracoid foramen {cor. for. of most
authors) in Reptilia squamata.      Were the notch n converted into a
foramen by a cartilaginous band joining x and x, such cartilaginous
bar with the bony process x would constitute the precoracoid element
conceived by Professor H. G. Seeley.       This hypothesis         not free              is
from difficulty.   In both the primary divisions of Amphibia the car
tilaginous precoracoid      more in line with the scapula, forming, as
                                     is
it  were, a ventral extension of this, than         with the precoracoid,
                                                               it   is
and when the precoracoid ossifies (Urodela) in common with either
of the other components of the girdle, ossification appears to overrun
it from the scapula rather than to extend into          from the coracoid.
                                                                         it
But in Nothosaurus, on the supposition that the process x            part of              is
the precoracoid, obviously, ossification has spread into this from the
coracoid and not from the scapula, with which also           has no com       it
munity of direction. Next, as regards the supposed identity of the
notch n, at the outer side of the process x, with the foramen of nerve-
passage in the Lacertilian coracoid. This in all lizards have examined        I
with particular reference to its position   situated behind and usually
                                                          is
slightly towards the mesial side of the precoracoid tract or process, so
that the homologous notch in the Nothosaurian girdle         to be sought     is
at x", and not at the outer side of x.

of its shoulder girdle as regards this element fails to support the
hypothesis of a precoracoid in lchthyosaaria.
   G. Baur has " no doubt that the Ichthyosauria possessed                     smalla
cartilaginous sternum."        He     adds    "the    whole    morphology     of  the

find myself in accord with him on this matter, for have long recog       I
nised the great probability of the presence of a cartilaginous sternal
plate behind the coracoids.             also have no doubt that the Ichthyo

            Zittel, op. cif., S. 488, fig. 462. d.pr., dorsal process of scapula.
the relations of the anterior ventral ray and scapula are in principle
identically the same as in N. mirabilit ; the anterior ray articulating
with the scapula, and not contributing to form the fossa glenoidalis.
The coracoid, however, repeats the simpler form seen in Lariosaurus
Balsami and in Anarosaurus pumilio.
   Thus if Macromerosaurus be only a young example of Lariosaurus,
and if Pachypleura is Neusticosaurus, as C. Zittel, W. Dames, and
some others suppose, we have the fact that none of the family of
Tsothosauridre, unless N. mirabilis, lend any support to the idea of the
existence of a precoracoid, but rather the contrary ; and those points
in AT. mirabilis which have been cited in support of the presence of a
precoracoid in this, and so in Ichthyosaurus, are, as I have- suggested,
capable of other and simpler explanation.
    Another reason assigned by Professor H. G. Seeley for introducing
a cartilaginous precoracoid into the Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle is
" it brings the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus into harmony with
that of the Anomodontia, because they correspond in the form of the
scapula?, tho position and forms of the clavicles, interclavicles, and
coracoids ; so that if the Anomodont precoracoid were unossified the
differences from Ichthyosaurus would be small, except that the Anom-
odonts develop an epiclavicle of Labyrinthodont type."
    The principal Anomodont remains available for the comparison
 are, I   take it for granted, those preserved in the British Museum,
 chiefly from African sources.               They include several dissociated more
 or less imperfect scapula! and coracoids, of which the more important
 pieces were figured by R. Owen in his ' Catalogue of S. African
 Reptilia,' 1876, PI. 69, figs.          5, 6, 8, 9, and PI. 70, fig. 1.      They com
 prise   also   the  remains      of  Pareiasaurus,     described   by   Professor H. G.

author, ' Phil. Trans.,' B. 1889, p. 255, PI. 9, fig. 9.
    Now, the most notable character in the best preserved scapula
figured by ft. Owen (fig. 1, PI. 70, op. s. a), is the large process at the
ventral termination of its anterior border separated by a deep notch from
the coracoid articular margin of the bone (fig. 6). This process, though
termed acromioii by K. Owen and hy Professor H. G. Seeley , can hardly
 be regarded as homologous with the acromion in higher Vertebrata,
 since in Dicynodon it articulates with the precoracoid and not with the
 clavicle (fig. 7). A similar form of the ventral end of the scapula is not
 infrequent in Anourous Amphibia, but I am not aware that such has
yet been demonstrated in the scapula of any Ichthyosanrian.                  In
 Dicynodon the clavicles are not known.               R. Owen figures (PI. 49,
fig. 8, op. cit.) a bone associated with a scapula which he considers
 interclavicle of Kiftecephahia.         This Professor H. G. Seeley inter
 prets as  clavicle.    It is dissociated,  and the other ventral constituents
of the shoulder girdle are missing.               I submit, therefore, that no
certain information of the clavicle is derivable from this specimen.
In 1'areiasaurtis, the interclavicle and the clavicles are known, but
not the other ventral elements of the girdle, or, at best, most imper
fectly ; nor is the form of the scapula known.             In Procolophon, the
interclavicle    is well   shown   in  the specimen figured by H. G. Seeley

(figured by   Professor   H.   G. Seeley,   Phil. Trans.,' B, 1890, PI. 75),
the clavicles are represented         by small discontinuous fragments
of donbtful interpretation.         The bone, with much probability in
terpreted as interclavicle, is imperfect ; its relation to the coracoids,
precoracoids, and sternum are unusual. The coracoids and precora-
coids are represented only by impressions in the matrix to which but
vestiges of bony tissue remain attached : and the scapula is also ex
tremely imperfect.
    I submit, then, that our present knowledge of the Anomodont
shoulder girdle is too incomplete to serve for any other than a very
general comparison with that of Ichthyosaurus ; and I venture to
think that at present it is insufficient to warrant the conclusions of a
 close agreement in their structural details.
    I pass on to the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle. Since the quali
fying prefix inter- in interclavicle, and epi- in episternum, primarily
 denote a relation of position and not of genesis, it does not appear
 to me a matter of great moment which of these names is employed,

 and   I  do not find any fault with those authors who use these names
 indifferently as synonyms of a certain piece in the secondary
 shoulder girdle. 1 prefer, myself, the term interclavicle, since Gotte's
 embryological investigations hare appeared to demonstrate that the
 piece thus denoted is a derivative of the mesial ends of the clavicles.
 For the analogous part in the Amphibian girdle, since W. K. Parker
 apparently demonstrated its origin from the epicoracoids (and, if so,
 it is not the morphological equivalent of the Lacertilian interclavicle),
 I  prefer his name omosternum, which has the convenience of imply
 ing its essential difference from the interclavicle.
    In Plesiosauria the (primary) shoulder girdle, as is well known,
consists of a dorsal and of two ventral rays, the fossa glenoidalis being
 seated (approximately) at the spot whence the three l'ays diverge.                 In
 addition to these component parts there are others which, for reasons
 to be presently stated, I have suggested are omosternalia ; if such
they are also parts of the primary girdle.

    Professor H. G. Seeley, however, finds, in these parts, clavicles and
interclavicle, a view which, if established,                    places them in the
secondary      girdle.*
    Concerning the posterior ventral ray, the suggestion that it may
include the coracoid and also the precoracoid element has, I think,
never been seriously argued, and I believe that all comparative
anatomists now agree in regarding it in its entirety solely as coracoid.
    After the recognition of " the large flat bone," by Buckland, as
       " sternum " in
the                       Ichthyosaurus, and after its correspondence to the
coracoid in Crocodilia had been shown by Conybeare, the latter'a
identification of the Plesiosaurian coracoid, when soon afterwards
this Sauropterygian was discovered by him and De la Beche, almost
necessarily followed. f

   The significance of the anterior ventral ray has ever been, and it
still is, a "vexed question."    I regard it as a precoracoid preserving
permanently its original union with the scapula, together with which
it shares in forming the fossa glenoidalis.
   Professor H. G. Seeley considers it part of the scapula.       This is
plainly shown by    the   following   extracts  from  his  paper: — "The
                                         " In Elasmosaurus the scapular
scapula is a stout triradiate bone."
arch has the well-known form with the scapulre meeting in the median
line and continuous posteriorly with the coracoids." "The measure
ment of the scapula in the median line is               inches."   " The
                                                                    " The
scapulre meet in the usual usual way by a median suture."
interclavicle was found in situ resting in a depression between the
                                       " The interclavicle is
anterior margins of the scapula?."                            wedged in
between the scapulre."
  The above passages prove, I submit, that their author rejects the
actually dual composition of the bone termed by him, in its entirety,
scapula : nor is the significance of these passages weakened by others,
as the following, in which the bone is given a compound name, so : —
" The
         scapulo-precoracoid appears to form about two-thirds of the
wall of the glenoid cavity."     " It is these precoracoid
                                                            portions of the
scapul'.e which alone meet each other in the median line."      That these
last quoted passages may not be understood as implying a shade of
doubt in the author's mind respecting the genetic oneness of the ray
he calls, in its entirety, scapula, appears to be clear from the follow
ing passage, on the shoulder girdle in certain Plesiosauroids : — In
                                                                       "
Elasmosaurus, Gohjmbosaurus, Muranosaurvs, and their allies, the parts
of the bone which meet in the median line, and are in contact with
the clavicular arch, are theoretically precoracoid* elements which con

   It will now be my endeavour to demonstrate that the anterior
ventral ray is not only theoretically (whatever precise significance
attaches to this term), but that it has an extremely strong claim
to be regarded as actually, a precoracoid.
   I shall show that in its position in the girdle, in its relations, and
presumably in its genesis, it corresponds essentially to the bone that
bears the name precoracoid in extant       Amphibia and Reptilia.
  In discussing the homology of         the several
                                                 parts composing the
shoulder girdle, we should ever keep before us the elementary fact
that the primitive shoulder girdle is originally one cartilaginous
"continuum," emitting one dorsal ray and one or two ventral rays.
The dorsal ray   is,by universal consent, known as the scapula where
                                                                 ;

sidered precoracoid by C. Gegenbaur, Fiirbringer, Huxley, W. K.
Parker, and others, including myself ; and is named clavicle by
Gotte, Hoffmann, and others, their followers.
   The chief argument used in my address, from which Professor H.
G. Seeley quotes, that this piece in the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle
is really a precoracoid, is the very close agreement noticeable between
the Plesiosaurian and Testudinate girdles, a correspondence not merely
general, but also of their respective parts; so that, if the anterior
ventral ray in Testudinata is a precoracoid, this affords a very strong
presumption that the corresponding ray in Plesiosauria is also pre
coracoid.     This presumption appears to me to amount as nearly to
proof as the nature of the comparison of these parts admits ; but since
Professor H. G. Seeley considers " the evidence insufficient to sustain
the interpretation," and since, on re-examination, my former conclu
sion is confirmed,    I shall amplify and re-state it.
    In comparing skeletons of fossil with those of extant animals,
absolutely complete proof of the essential identity of their several
parts is, in particular instances, unattainable, and we have to accept
for it presumption so strong as not to allow reasonable doubt. As
regards living animals, wc have the great aid of embryology to
illumine the facts of the mature skeleton ; but this valuable aid is, if
we except a few very rare instances (e.g., larval, concurrent with
adult forms, as in the Batrachial fauna of the Braun-Kohlen formation
of Rhenish Prussia), wanting in regard to fossil animal remains,
which are so often fragmentary and otherwise imperfect and incom
plete.
    In Testudinata it is      a matter of common     elementary knowledge
that the primary shoulder girdle (primitively a three-rayed cartilage,
 having at its centre a hollow for the reception of the caput humeri,
 the fossa glenoidalis) appears, when ossification is completed, to com
 prise two bones only. Of these, one, the posterior ventral ray,
 contributes the posterior part of the fossa glenoidalis, and sends an
 expansion inwards towards the mesial line of the body.           It is by
 common consent coracoid, and it requires no further notice.
     The other bone has an angulated form, of which one branch ascends
 to be attached ligamentously at the under surface of the carapace;
 whilst the other branch bends ventrally inwards, in front of the
 posterior ray, approaching closely that of the other side, and is
 mostly attached by its mesial end ligamentously to the entoplastron.
     It is respecting the homology of this (anterior) ventral branch that
 there remains any difference of opinion, since all agree that the
 dorsally-directed branch is scapula.
    As already mentioned, these two branches appear to constitute one
 bone, which meets the coracoid in the glenoid mass, and with the
 coracoid forms the glenoid fossa.        Of this hollow the apparently

single, angulated bone forms the upper or the anterior part, the
coracoid furnishing the posterior part.
    Professor H. G. Seeley says, in his recent paper, " There is no
conclusive evidence of the mutual relations of the scapulo-precoracoid
to the glenoid cavity in Chelonia." ' If by this he means that no
evidence exists to show whether one only or both of the components
of the apparently single bone he thus designates enter into the com
position of the glenoid fossa, this statement is, I venture to submit,
scarcely justifiable, in view of the embryological investigations of
 that extremely careful, painstaking observer, H. Rathke, who,
 writing of the Testudinate shoulder girdle, says : " In the anterior
 piece (i.e., the united scapula and coracoid), however, I found in the
 embryo of Chelonia, and in the young of Chelonia imlricata, Trionyx
 Gangeticus, and Ten-ujiene tricarinalus, that each limb had a particular
 bony sheath, and that the two sheaths were nowhere confluent, but
only at one side of the angle which the two limbs composed they had
 very closely approached one another; whereas at the outer side of
this angle they were still distant from each other, and the entire
process projecting from the latter (the angle), and which contained
the joint-hollow consisted only of cartilage." " In the young Sphargis
the two bony sheaths had reached one another at the inner side of
the angle formed by the two limbs of the anterior shoulder piece, and
had here coalesced, leaving, however, still uncovered the outer side of
the angle and the articular process."*
   From these observations of H. Rathke, made in different families
of Testudinata, which are in accord with an observation long pre
viously made by Cuvier in a very young Chelonia, it may very fairly
be assumed that in this order generally ossification begins separately
          * Bnthke, H.,  '
                           Ueber die Kntwickelung der Schildkroten,' p. 137.

 250             Mr.   J.  W. Hulke.        On the  Shoulder Girdle
in each of the two branches composing the apparently single bone in
the mature girdle, and the apparent oneness of the bone when ossifi
cation is complete is due to the coalescence of the two bony masses.
Further, as a result of his investigation, H. Rathke knew that the
anterior ventral ray enters into the constitution of the glenoid fossa,
for, in his discussion of its homology, he says : " Certainly it would
be a very peculiar circumstance for Testudinata in connection with
this view (viz., that this ray is acromion) that in them the acromion
also takes a share in the formation of the hollow of the shoulder
joint."*
    This places it beyond doubt that H. Rathke found each of the two
rays of the " anterior bone
                                      " of the Testudinate shoulder
                                                                             girdle
entering into the composition of the glenoid fossa.
    Now, the separate ossification of each of the branches of the
 " anterior bone," and the contribution
                                                  by each to the glenoid fossa,
constitutes,    I  submit, a sufficient warrant for assigning to each equal
morphological value, so that if one branch (the dorsal) is scapula,
the claim of the other to be precoracoid (clavicular, Gotte) cannot be
contested.
    I  repeat, between the Plesiosanrian and the Testudinate girdle
there is an extremely close correspondence : each is three-rayed, each
 has a dorsal      ray, each a posterior ventral ray, and each an anterior
 ventral ray. In Testudinata, each of these three rays contributes to
 the glenoid fossa ; and in the Plesiosaurian girdle no evidence has,
 so far as I know, been adduced to disprove a similar composition of
this fossa.
    Without embryological study we had not certainly known whether
 either, to the exclusion of the other, or both together, of the two
                                          "
branches of the " anterior bone in Testudinata helped to form the
 glenoid fossa, since, when ossification is complete, synostosis is so
perfect that no trace of earlier separateness remains.
    Stannius, indeed, mentions a skeleton of Emys in the Berlin
Anatomical Museum, in which, on the left side, the anterior ventral
limb is suturally united with the ascending limb (scapula).                    This,
however, has been most obligingly re-examined for me by Professor
 Dr. W. Dames, with the result that he finds the appearance of a
 suture ambiguous and suggestive rather of an accidental crack,
 so that this specimen has not the importance previously attached
to   it.f
    In each of the two girdles under consideration the homology of the
 posterior ventral ray is universally acknowledged to be identic — each
 is coracoid    ;  and    that of the anterior ventral ray cannot,         I  think,

reasonably be doubted — each is precoracoid (clavicula, Gotte).                 In
Testudinata all accept the dorsal ray as representing the blade of the
scapula in other Reptilia ; but in Plesiosauria the analogous dorsal
ray, Professor H. G. Seeley contends, is not an homologous structure.
Were it so, then, obviously,[the agreement of the two girdle3 in regard
to this element would be seriously compromised.
    The ground on which Professor H. G. Seeley rejects the idea that
the dorsal process in the Plesiosaurian girdle is homologous with the
dorsal ray'in the Testudinate girdle, is stated by him in the following
passage: — "In Chelonians the ascending process of the scapula
extends dor.sally towards the vertebrae, while in Sauropterygia it
extends backwards above the glenoid articulation for the humerus,
and there is no evidence that these structures are homologous" (cf.
'
  Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 51, 1892, p. 122).
    It is manifest from this that the backward slant of the Plesiosaurian
dorsal scapular process is ProfessorH. G. Seeley's chief (and only stated)
reason for rejecting its homology with the Chelonian shoulder blade.
Can this reason be accepted as a sufficient warrant for such rejection ?
In Birds, does not the long, sword-like shoulder blade slant yet more,
bending backwards above and behind the glenoid fossa, in a direction
roughly parallel with that of the vertebral column ? In his restora
tion of the Anomodont Keirognat hus cordylus, has not Professor H. G.
 Seeley given the shoulder blade a forward inclination so great as to
carry its free end so far in advance of the glenoid fossa as to bring
it against the centrum of the second vertebra, while a plane laid
through the glenoid fossa passes between the seventh and eighth
 vertebrae ?    Yet, notwithstanding this excessive forward slant, Pro
fessor   H. G. Seeley names it scapula.         Between these extremes, every
degree of slope is observable, so that if the main fact of general dorsal
direction above the glenoid fossa be present, this seems to me enough
to justify its identification as shoulder blade, and therefore to warrant
it and the Chelonian shoulder blade being considered homologous
structures.
    Should any one still find difficulty in accepting the dorsal
Plesiosaurian process as shoulder blade, by reason of the somewhat
singular position whence it ascends, as homologous with the ascending
part of the Testudinate scapula, he will find an intermediate step in
 the Notho saurian scapula where the corresponding dorsal process*
ascends directly from above the glenoid fossa.
    In other Nothosauridas, e.g., in Lariosaurits, Cuvier, Neusticosawiis,
 Seeley, to which reference has been already made, the position of the
 root of the dorsal scapular process corresponds to that in X. mirabilis.

 precoracoid, actually scapula, as Professor H. G. Seeley deems it to
 be, it must be either acromion, or prescapula.             The former was
  Conybeare's idea ; but Cuvier pointed out this involved an extension
 of a scapular process mesially inwards towards its fellow of the other
 side, a construction not known in any Vertebrate ; and the same
 objection lies against a prescapular interpretation.
     An objection that might be advanced against homologising the dorsal
 process in the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle with the Testudinate
 shoulder blade, is that it does not ascend so immediately from above
 the glenoid fossa as does the latter.        This is true, but I offer the
 suggestion (for what it may be worth) that the clue to this difference
 lies in the dwarfing of this process in Plesiosaurus ; whilst the growth
 of the precoracoid has been relatively rapid, with the effect of carrying
 forward with it the free process of the scapula, which gives to that
                              "
 part of the "anterior bone somewhat the semblance of a third process.
 In connection with this it should not be overlooked that in Testudi-
 nata before ossification of the shoulder girdle is complete that
 part of the glenoid mass of cartilage which belongs to the scapula
 and precoracoid       stands off, process-like, from the angle which
 marks the junction of the two components of the " anterior bone,"
 thus presenting a slight resemblance to that which obtains perma
 nently in Plesiosauria.
     There remains for discussion the homology of the bony piece or
pieces which I have suggested          may be omosternal,        but which
 Professor    H.  G.   Seeley contends  are    clavicles   and interelavicle.
 They lie upon the upper or visceral aspect of the precoracoids
 (Professor Seeley), therefore within the outer bony frame of the
chest; and only to an extent varying in different genera in a
ventral view are they visible between the anterior mesial ends of
  hese bones (precoracoids mihi), in advance of the coracoids, above
and behind the antero-intornal angles of which they are produced
backwards to an extent hidden in most skeletons.
     In Plesiosaurus (type) they form a plate which is more exposed,
in a ventral view, than in Pliosaurus (ft. Owen) in which only a
very small part of the omosternum is apparent in the vacuity between
the antero-internal angles of the coracoids ; whilst in Colymbosaurus
(H. G. Seeley), the omosternnm, if it exist, is completely hidden by tht-
                                                         '
precoracoids (Professor Seeley). Fig. 12, p. 447, Geol. Soc. Quart.
Jonrn.,' 1874.
    It was this undisputedly deep position of the elements in question,
unknown as regards interelavicle and clavicles in any other Verte-
brata, that weighed with me against accepting the interclavicular
hypothesis held by several previous writers : for I then knew, and 1
still know, no Vertebrate skeleton in which an interelavicle is thus
deeply situated under cover of the other bones of the pectoral frame.

                      in Ichthyosauria and Sauropterygia.                             253
  Professor    H. G. Seeley certainly has since represented the inter-
  clavicle as in part covered by the sternum in Keirognathus cordybis*
  but I venture to suggest that in the specimen the appearance is not
  wholly free from ambiguity, and that its damaged condition makes
 confirmation of so singular a deviation from the usual relation of in-
  terclavicle and sternum very desirable.
     Tt was its deep position, together             with evidence suggestive         of a
 composite     origin, which led me to suggest that this part or parts
 might be omosternal, since in certain Anoura Professor W. K.
 Parker had found an omosternum (formed by the fusion of two
symmetric halves, each segmented off from the epicoracoid) produced
above and behind the anterior border of the precoracoids, and thus
occupying a precisely similar position to that occupied by the bone
or hones in Plesiosauria.            Professor H. G. Seeley's statement that I
regarded this bone as indivisible is a misconception, if it is intended
to convey that I denied it a dual origin, since in my address                      I  dis
tinctly say,
                 " Some examples show traces of a primitive composition
of two similar halves. "f           I have now before me a drawing of such a
Plesiosaurian omosternum (dated June 19, 1869) which I made of
a specimen in the Cambridge                Museum. In its present form — the
postero-externnl angles are missing — it is an oblong plate, measuring
transversely 4-ll ins., and 3 ins. in its antero-posterior extent along
the mesial line where are distinct indications of a sutiire showing its
formation by the junction of two halves.                  That which I regard as
the anterior border has the mesial notch seen in some Plesiosauria.
The sweep of the posterior border is broken by a projection formed by
the backward extension of the postero-internal angle of each of the
two halves.
    The form of the omosternalia evidently varied in different genera,
and it is the opinion of A. Leeds, Esq., who has an excellent know

in 1883, was a moderately thin plate, having the outlines of an
isosceles triangle, the base of which measured                     116 cm., and the
height 11 -3 cm.         Its apex was rounded off, and its base slightly in
curved. In the direction of a perpendicular from the apex on the
 base, and also transversely to this direction the figure was slightly
 curved, which gave a gentle concavity to that surface which I con
 jectured to be upper.
    Two omosternalia, a pair, belonging to another skeleton, had the
 form of scalene        triangles. Of the more perfect of the two the base

  was 6'7 cm. and the height 9 cm.       I have not yet found conclusive
  evidence of the coexistence   of such a pair and of an azygos piece in
  any of the Plesiosaurian remains in the British Museum, and I have
  thought it probable that the azygos condition was a later stage
  reached by the fusion of the paired elements as happens in the an
  alogous case of the Anourous omosternum.
     Mr. A. Leeds, however, assures me that he possesses one instance
 of such association of two lateral and a median piece, which he had
 placed for examination in Professor H. G. Seeley's hands.            Such
 association, if established, would not, however, prove the three pieces
 to be not omosternalia but clavicular.
     Gotte has shown that in Reptilia the interclavicle arises by the
 coalescence of a piece segmented off from the mesial ends of each
 clavicle. In Anoura, Parker has shown that the omosternum is formed
 by the fusion of two pieces segmented off from the anterior extremi
 ties of the epicoracoids ; in this instance, if a remnant of each lateral
 segment retained its distinctness, there would be a perfect accord in
 the principle of the construction of the omosternal and clavicular
 parts.
     By Professor H. G. Seeley the thinness and the surface texture of
 those pieces is considered decisive of their being originated by the
 ossification of membrane (not of cartilage), an origin which he re
 gards as decisive of their being clavicular and interclavicular, and as
                                       " visceral position." It is possible
 outweighing the anomaly of their
 that they are membrane bones, but this is not yet absolutely certain ;
 whilst their deep position, unknown, if clavicular pieces, in any other
Vertebrate skeleton, is not disputed. I submit, then, that the weight
of evidence is still in favour of an omosternal homology.
    Professor H. G. Seeley argues that theso bones cannot be omoster
nalia, because in every existing animal which has au omosternum a
sternum also is present, but in no Sauropterygia is there even any
trace of a sternum. The usual association of omosternum and
sternum may be perfectly true, but since the genesis of these two
parts is perfectly distinct, one being a derivative of the epicoracoids,
the other a derivative of the costif, the preseuce of a sternum is not a
necessary antecedent of that of an omosternum. Moreover, though
no objective evidence of a sternum in Plesiosauridsr has been pre
served, the whole homology of the pectoral girdle, and the high
degree of development of the abdominal ribs makes the existence of
a cartilaginous sternum a very probable circumstance Such sternnm
might not imprint any trace of cartilaginous attachment or other
mark of articulation on the postero-internal parts of the coracoids,
since their articulation with it might be simply diarthrodial, much
as in Lacertilia, in which the border of the coracoid is simply received
in a corresponding groove in the sternum.

   Professor H. G. Seeley's objection to the importation of the Amphi
bian plan in explanation of a part of the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle,
of which other parts have been explained by reference to the Chelonian
plan of construction, has not, I venture to think, great weight, since,
of the early Reptilia, from the time when their remains first began
to be studied, it has been a frequent remark that their skeletons
comprise structural arrangements which, in existing animals, are now
found separately.      Moreover, it is thought by some of the ablest
comparative anatomists that the Chelonian skeleton shows closer
approach to the Amphibian than is to be found elsewhere.

   1.  The object of the present paper is to show how to determine
expressions for the current in circuits having iron cores, similar to
the well-known equations

pre-determined by calculation and plotted independently of experi

E.M.F. is sinusoidal, on account of difficulties of integration.       But
both cases can be treated in another way : — Take a series of points

slow, being 6 cycles per second, and the true periodic curve is seen
to appear before the end of the first half period.                Curve A is calcu
lated with the preliminary supposition that i                =  0 when t = 0, and
Curve B on the assumption that i = 0 when pt = 0, neither of which
is strictly correct.

of the curves of the primary and secondary currents in transformers
and of the cnrve of magnetic induction with regard to time.
   [For, when there is supposed to            be no  magnetic leakage in the core,
the expressions for the primary and secondary currents are —

    The paper deals with the results of an investigation of the struc
ture and functions of the wandering (migrating)* cells of the Frog.
Certain preliminary observations on Mammals and Crustacea are also
included.
    The results may be summarised as follows : —
    The histology of the wandering cells of the Frog is almost identical
 with that of the wandering cells of Astacus. The different cells are
 very clearly marked off from one another when seen alive or when in
preparations. Excluding red blood corpuscles and platelets, which
 stand on a different footing from all the rest, the following forms are
found : —

    The hyaline cell is less resistant than the eosinophile cell. Rongh
 manipulation causes a rapid bursting up of the cell, thus recalling
 the hyaline explosive corpuscles of Astacus.
    We have studied the functions of these cells in relation to their
 anti-bacillary action (1) by taking samples of lymph from a Frog at
 varying intervals after the injection of bacilli, Ac; (2) by inocu
 lating hanging drops suspended in moist chambers and kept at
 different temperatures, the chambers being sufficiently large to afford
 plenty of oxygen.         By the second method we have been able to
 observe the conflict between cells and bacilli for continuous periods
 of eight to nine hours.        The same cells and bacilli have been watched
 for the whole period.
    In the same manner we have also examined the effect of the injec
 tion of finely-divided coagulated proteid (boiled white of egg solu
 tion). Indian ink, vermilion, egg albumen, and anthrax spores. At
 first we used curarised Frogs to obtain lymph, and this led to the
 discovery that curare produces a profound alteration in the wandering
 cells.

   The phenomena of leucocytosis have also been examined, and we
find the following : —
   1. Corresponding with the three different kinds of wandering cells
found in the blood and lymph, three kinds of leucocytosis may be
distinguished, each characterised by the relatively greater increase in
number of one particular kind of cell. This may be illustrated by
citing the effect of the injection of finely-divided coagulated proteid,
which produces a great increase in the number of the hyaline
(phagocytic) cells without a correspondingly large increase in the
numbers of the other wandering cell forms. Eosinophile leucocytosis,
that is, increase in the numbers of the eosinophile cells, occurs with
wonderful rapidity after injection of anthrax bacilli or other micro
organisms, and it is then followed by a leucocytosis of the hyaline
cells.
   2. The leucocytosis, or increase in the number of the cells, is
largely due to the proliferation of the cells themselves.     Thus eosino
phile leucocytosis,  followed  by hyaline leucocytosis,  occurs  out of the
body in a hanging drop of lymph. Also we have witnessed the divi
sion of the cells in a hanging drop.      The phenomena classed under
the head of chemiotaxis are undoubtedly to be partly explained by the
very rapid power of proliferation by fission of the wandering cells.
    The behaviour of the cells towards micro-organisms differs according
to the nature of the latter. In this abstract we will confine ourselves-
to the conflict with Bacillus anthracis.
   The Frog at ordinary temperatures is absolutely immune against
anthrax.     When lymph is treated with anthrax bacilli the following
phenomena are seen, and may be grouped as successive stages : —
    Stage I. — -The eosinophile cells are strongly attracted to the
anthrax.     They apply themselves to the chains of bacilli. When
contact is absolutely or nearly effected their cell substance shows the
following phenomena : —
    1. It is profoundly stimulated, and exhibits quick streaming move
ments.     Ordinarily the eosinophile cell is very sluggish.
   2. The eosinophile spherules are discharged : those nearest the
bacillus fading and dissolving first.
   3. If the eosinophile cells are present in sufficient       numbers to
match the anthrax, in other words, if they are nnharmed by the
bacilli, they bud off daughter cells, which are at first free from
granules. These creep a short way from the point of conflict, and in
a short time spherules appear at one end.          Later, these daughter
cells seek the same or another focus of conflict. Several eosinophile
cells will, towards the close of Stage I, and when their numbers have
increased, be massed round one chain, and they ultimately fuse,
 though the endosarc, with its granules, remains distinct.          In this
 way an eosinophile plasmodium is formed, though the fusion is con
                                                                 T 2

fined   to the more mobile peripheral cell substance.        Whether the
eosinophile cells or the bacilli win the fight depends largely on their
relative numbers.       The bacillus is only injured near the eosinophile
cell ; there the contents become rapidly curdled and irregular in
appearance, and may be completely dissolved (it should be noted
that Leber has shown that pus dissolves copper, and even platinnm,
and Kanthack has shown that the pus oell is the eosinophile cell).
If the bacillary chains are in great number, then there may not be
eosinophile cells enough to attack them all, although the eosinophile
cell will extend itself to most attenuated lengths in order to be able
to attack as great a length of chain as possible.         Even where the
chain is not directly attacked, the near presence of eosinophile cells
profoundly arrests its development.
    If the cells win they early recharge themselves with spherules; but
  hese are no longer eosinophile — they are amphophile ; that is, they stain
with both eosine and methylene-blue, and rather more readily with
the latter.

    During the later portion of Stage the eosinophile cells are aggre
gating and fusing round the chains of bacilli.
    This fusion, and the later and more complete fusion of the hyaline
cells is a kind of conjugation, the cells ultimately separating.
    During Stage I the hyaline cells, the phagocytes, remain quiescent,
 and are not attracted towards the bacilli, though they may take up
indifferent matter such as Indian ink.        In the neighbourhood of a
healthy bacillus they appear to be paralysed
    Stage II. — Hyaline cells have now increased in numbers, and come
to the eosinophile cell masses surrouudiug a bacillus and fuse with
 them.    The eosinophile cells probably lie extended along a chain ;
the hyaline cells work with one object, namely, to draw the long-
drawn-out mass into a balL To this end a hyaline cell will attach
itself by a broad attachment, and then, by means of long filiform
 pseudopodia stretched towards more distant parts, it will bend the
 chain up into a close \J, rolling the eosinophile cells round itself,
and fusing superficially with them.            The superficial fusion of
 eosinophile cells with the hyaline cell produces violent streaming
 movements.      Other hyaline cells come and fuse with the now lobate
 spherical and opaque mass. The impact of each successive cell acta
 as a stimulus, causing streaming and pseudopodial movements, which
 fade away, to be re-awakened by the arrival of a fresh cell.
    VVre have now a lobed mass, curiously opaque, and — to take one
 particular instance — formed by the fusion of seven eosinophile cells
 and four hyaline cells.      Three eosinophile cells originally attacked
 the chain.     (It will  be noted  that we retain the term eosinophile
 cells, thongh the second formed spherules are at first amphophile.)
 This fusion may persist for one to two hours.

   Stage  III. — The   cells of the mass commerce to regain their indi
viduality and slowly separate.         The separation is in two very dis
tinct stages, and when the individual cells are again to be seen the
mass is found to consist of a central giant hyaline plasmodium,
formed by the very complete fusion of the four hyaline cells, and
enclosed by a crust of eosinophile cells.     The first stage in the disso
lution of the mass is the separation and wandering away of the
eosinophile cells, fully charged with the second set of spherules,
which have now become truly eosinophile. A. very curions appear
ance is presented as they shred themselves off the central hyaline
mass.    This plasmodium or giant cell is now seen to be an amoeboid
body,   with   several food vacuoles containing ingesta in the form of
the remnants of the chain of bacilli.         It pushes out on one side
long filiform psendopodia, which resemble those of the Heliozoa in
their sluggish, streaming movements, while from the other side pro
ject short round pseudopodia.
   The hanging drop contains, at this stage, multitudes of these
phagocytic plasmodia, with free eosinophile cells and free hyaline
and rose-staining cells.
   Stage IV. — This is the second stage of the disintegration of the
cell masses. The food vacuoles of the plasmodium close up, and the
whole structure becomes lobed, taking on the appearance of a heap
of hyaline cells, which subsequently separate into the original four
cells.
   While these stages are in progress the rose-colouring cells are
increasing in size and number. They are at first small and spherical,
with not very abundant cell substance.          Later they become large,
angnlar, and sometimes vacuolate, and their cell substance becomes
completely filled with basophile, rose-staining granules.
   The activities of the rose-staining cells are, we believe, directed
towards the removal of foreign noxious substance in solution in the
plasma.     We find that if the bacterial poisons accumulate beyond a
certain point they paralyse the eosinophile cells, and destroy the
hyaline cells.     This is prevented, in part at any rate, by the action
of the rose-staining cells. We correlate the increase in the granula
tion of these cells, or, in other words, the increase in the amount of
rose-staining substance, with the removal of the bacterial products.
   The conflict thus consists of, first, the maiming of the bacilli by the
eosinophile cells ; gecontlly, the removal of the remains of the bacilli
by means of the ingestive and digestive activity of the hyaline cells ;
and, thirdly, the removal of dissolved foreign substances by the rose-
Btaining cells.     We do not propose to deal at present with the further
 processes of repair.

                                    (Abstract.)
    The principal object of this paper is to endeavour to obtain a
theoretical explanation of the instability of viscous liquids, which was
experimentally studied by Professor Osborne Reynolds.*
    The experiment, which perhaps most strikingly illustrates this
branch of hydrodynamics, consisted in causing water to flow from a
cistern through a long circular tube, and by means of suitable appli
ances a fine stream of coloured liquid was made to flow down the
centre of the tube along with the water.                When the velocity was
sufficiently small, the coloured stream showed no tendency to mix
with the water ; but when the velocity was increased, it was found
that as soon as it had attained a certain critical value, the coloured
stream broke off at a certain point of the tube and began to mix with
the water, thus showing that the motion was unstable.                It was also
found that as the velocity was still further increased the point at
which instability commenced gradually moved up the tube towards
the end at which the water was flowing in.
    Professor Reynolds concluded that the critical velocity W was
determined by the equation
                                    Wapj/i < n,
where a is the radius of the tube, p the density, and fi the viscosity of
the liquid, and n a number; but the results of this paper show that
this formula is incomplete, inasmuch as it does not take any account
of the friction of the liquid against the sides of the tube.
    In the first place, if the surface friction is supposed to be zero, so
that perfect slipping takes place, the motion is stable for all veloci-

      The remainder of the paper is occupied with the discussion of a
  variety of problems relating to jets and wave motion.
     I find that when a cylindrical jet is moving' through the atmosphere,
  the tendency of the viscosity of the jet is always in the direction of
  stability.   The velocity of the jet does not affect the stability unless
  the influence of the surrounding air is taken into account ;             how                                if,
  ever, this  is done,    will be found that
                                 it                gives rise to a term propor
                                                                    it
  tional to the product of the density of the air and the square of the
  velocity of the jet, whose tendency         to render the motion unstable.

  The tendency of surface tension (as has been previously shown by
 Lord Rayleigh)         in the direction of stability or instability accord
                             is
 ing as the wave-length of the disturbance less or greater than the       is
 circumference of the jet.
     If, in addition, the jet supposed to be electrified, the condition of
                                           is
 stability contains a term proportional to the square of the charge
 multiplied by a certain number, n. When the ratio of the circum
 ference of the jet to the wave-length           less than        nis  positive,           0   6,       is
 and the electrical term tends to produce stability but when this                          ;
 ratio   is greater than 0'6, n     negative, and the electrical term tends
                                                is
 to produce instability.       It must, however, be recollected that when
 the above ratio       greater than unity the tendency of surface tension
                            is
 is to produce stability but         the influencing body

 ducing a sufficiently large charge, the electrical term (when 2wa >                                                 X)
 will neutralize the                  effect    of surface         tension and viscosity, and the
 motion will be unstable.

   In order to explain    the fact that during     the electrolysis of a salt

electrodes, the intervening solution being unaltered, we must suppose
that the ions travel in opposite directions through the liquid.        Kohl-

solutions with a definite speed when urged forward by a definite
potential gradient, independently of the other ion present, and intro
duced the idea of specific ionic velocity.      He calculated the value
of this velocity for many substances, using his own conductivity
measurements      to give the arithmetical sum of the opposite ionic
velocities, and Hittorf's " migration
                                       " data to
                                                 give their ratio. From
these values of the velocities he worked out the conductivity of many
salt solutions, and the agreement with observation of the results so
obtained furnished the first confirmation of the theory.
   Dr. Oliver Lodge actually observed the velocity of the hydrogen
ion as it travelled along a tube containing sodium chloride dissolved
in a weak jelly, decolorising phenol-phthalein as it went.            He
obtained the numbers 0"0029, 0-0026, and 0-0024 cm. per sec. as the
velocity of the hydrogen ion under a potential gradient of 1 volt per
cm., while Kohlrausch gives 0'0030.
   This close agreement led me to undertake a series of experiments
in order to find a method of determining ionic velocities which
would work under more reliable conditions.       Consider the boundary
                                  Fig. 1.
                                   BC
 of two salt solutions of slightly different density which have one ion
 in common, but are of different colours (fig. 1).     Let us denote the
 salts by AC and BC.       When a current passes across the boundary

  there  will be a transference of C ions in one direction and of A and
  B ions    in the other.    If A and B are the kations, the colour
  boundary will move with the current, and its velocity will, in any
  case, indicate the velocity of the ion causing the change in colour.
     The apparatus used (fig. 2) consisted of two vertical glass tubes
                                   Fig. 2.

about 2 cm.     in diameter, joined by a third considerably narrower,
which     was bent parallel to the others for the greater part of its
length.      The longer tube was filled with the denser solution to about
the level A, and then the lighter solution was run into the other
tube from a burette till it just began to trickle over the shoulder and
run down to A.        The proper solutions were then run into the two
limbs at rates just sufficient to keep the junction at rest.         The
current was passed from platinum electrodes which could be con
nected with a battery of twenty-six accumulators by means of
platinum wires.       The corks fitted loosely to allow any gas which
might be evolved to escape.
   The junction tube had an effective length of 13-8 cm., which,
divided into the total difference of potential, gave the potential
gradient.      The correction due to changes of density produced by the
passage of the current can be shown to be quite negligible.

    When the solutions are of different specific resistance, there will
be a discontinuity        of potential gradient at the boundary and a conse
quent electrification.        This can be got rid of entirely by using solu
tions of the     same    specific resistance, and in all cases the effect on the
velocity of the boundary is non-reversible, and can be approximately
eliminated by reversing the current and taking the mean value of
the velocity.       If the velocity is found to be the same in opposite
directions when the current is reversed, the effect must be neg
ligible.
     The first solutions used were those of copper and ammonium
chlorides dissolved in aqueous ammonia.              The copper solution is a
deep blue ; the other colourless.            Their strength was 0-18 gram-
equivalent per        litre.    The   mean   velocity when the current was
passing upward came out O0406 cm. per minute, and when passing
downwards 0'0441 cm. per minute. In each case the junction moved
with the current.          The potential gradient was 2'73 volts per cm.,
which gives as the specific ionic velocity
                                0"00026 cm. a second.
     Kohlrausch gives for infinite dilution
                                O00031 cm. a second.
     Solutions of potassium permanganate and potassium chloride were
 taken to show the motion of the acid radicles, and, as it should, the
junction moved against the current. If we assume thatthe disappearance
 of the red colour can only occur where permanganate is replaced by
 chloride, the motion of the junction can be taken as an indication of the
 velocity of chlorine. The result for solutions of O046 gram-equiva
 lent per litre was 0'00057 cm. per sec, and for solutions of about
 one-tenth this strength 0'00059 cm. per sec.                Kohlrausch gives
 0 00053 cm. per sec. as the specific ionic velocity of chlorine.
     The success of these preliminary experiments led me to attempt to
  improve the method. I investigated one pair of salts with exactly the
 same specific resistance for the same strength, though in cases where
 this condition is nearly fulfilled (such as that of copper and
 ammonium chlorides), the error thus introduced can be shown to be
  negligible.
     The direct estimation of the potential gradient is unsatisfactory,
  but if we measure the specific resistance of the solution (r), the area
  of the junction tube (A), and the current (7), we can calculate the
 specific ionic velocity («,) from the observed velocity of the boundary
  (t>), for it is easy to show that

   This method was used to repeat the copper determination, using
solutions whose strength was 0-l gram-equivalent per litre.             The
specific resistances of the copper and ammonium chlorides were
measnred     by Mtzpatrick's method, and came out 157 X 10' and
117 x 109 in C.G.S. units respectively.        The current was measured by
 passing it through a previously graduated galvanometer.                The
velocity of the junction was determined by reading its position at
different times by means of a kathetometer.                       .
   When the current was passing upwards, the upward velocity was
      r70, 1"60, l-53,  1*43 cm.    per hour; mean, T57 cm. per hour,
and when it was passing downwards, the downward velocity was
        l-45, l-65, 1'70 cm. per hour; mean, T60 cm. per hour.
This gives a specific ionic velocity in solutions of    0"1 gram-equivalent
of
                            0-000309 cm. per sec.

dilution,
                            0-00031 cm. per sec.
   Solutions of potassium bichromate and potassium carbonate have
specific resistances which are very nearly indeed (within 3 per cent.)
the same for the same strengths, and a solution of carbonate was
adjusted in strength till even this small difference between it and a
U-l solution of bichromate was much reduced.
   The first point  I investigated with these solutions was the influence
of change of potential gradient on the velocity. These should, on
Kohlrausch's theory, obviously be proportional to each other.
   At first, all the cells available were used. The velocity of the
junction when the current passed downwards was
     3*63, 3*39, 3'65, 3-24 cm.    per hour  ; mean, 3-48 cm. per hour
in an upward direction.
   When the current was sent upward the velocity was downwards
and came out
        3-28, 3*55, 3-45 cm. per hour      ; mean, 3*43 cm. per hour.
                   This gives   Vi = 0-00048 cm. per sec.

a fair approximation to that obtained when solutions of identical
conductivity are used.
   With solutions of different resistances, the junction      often ob             is
served to become sharp when travelling in one direction, and vague
when travelling in the other. This       owing to the fact that any ion
                                                   is
which gets separated from the main body finds itself in a region
where the potential gradient       different. Its velocity
                                    it is                      therefore           is
altered, and in the first case   rejoins the ranks, and in the second
it gets further and further separated from them.
   The investigation was also extended to the case of alcoholic solu
tions. These possess a very much less conductivity than the corre
sponding aqueous ones, and the question whether Kohlrausch's theory
still held good seemed of great interest. No data for the migration
constants are known hence a modification of the method was applied-
                          ;
An experimental measurement of the velocities of both ions of some

salt was made, and their sum compared with the value deduced from
tbe conductivity.
   The first salt used was cobalt chloride, the alcoholic solution of
which is of a deep blue colour. The velocity of the chlorine ion was
measured by setting up the cobalt chloride with cobalt nitrate, the
colour of which is red, and that of the cobalt by a cobalt chloride and
calcium chloride pair, the latter salt being colourless.
   Some little difficulty was encountered in getting solutions of con
venient strength. If very weak, the colours were not easily seen,
 while, if the strength approached 01 gram-equivalent per litre,
irregularities of behaviour appeared.     Finally, solutions of 005 gram-
equivalent were used, but even here the effects of too great concentra
tion were still appreciable.

                  The sum is              TJ = 0-000048

comes out
                              U =   0-000060.
   Cobalt nitrate was then investigated.       Its conductivity is greater
than that of the chloride (3-80 X 10-13), which leads us to expect that
its behaviour will be normal at concentrations greater than those
at which the chloride becomes irregular.        Such was found to be the
case.   We should also suppose that its agreement with theory will
be closer.    The pairs used were cobalt nitrate — cobalt chloride and
cobalt nitrate —calcium nitrate.

   The sum of these is
                              U =   0-000079.
   The value calculated from the conductivity ia
                              U =   0-000079.
   The explanation of the irregularities observed in strong solutions
is most easily found by the supposition that complex ions are
formed as the strength increases.       The further discussion of this
point is postponed till some more experiments          I  am making are
ready for publication.

   In  the theory of the partitions of numbers the order of occurrence
of  the parts is immaterial.          Compositions of numbers are merely
partitions in which the order of the parts is essential.               In the nomen
clature  I  have followed   H.   J.  S.  Smith    and  J.  W.  L.   Glaisher.     What
are called "unipartite"         numbers are such as may be taken to
enumerate undistinguished objects.              " Multipartite " numbers enu
merate objects which are distinguished from one another to any
given extent ; and the objects are appropriately enumerated by an
ordered assemblage of integers, each integer being a unipartite
number which specifies the number of objects of a particular kind ;

Section treats of the compositions of unipartite numbers both analyti
cally and graphically.     The subject is of great simplicity, and is
only given  as  a suitable  introduction to the more difficult theory,
connected with multipartite numbers, which is developed in the
succeeding sections.
  The investigation arose in an interesting manner. In the theory
of the partitions of integers, certain partitions came under view
which may be defined as possessing the property of involving a
partition of every lower integer in a unique manner. These have
been termed "perfect partitions," and it was curious that their
enumeration proved to be identical with that of certain expressions
                                     "
which were obviously " compositions of multipartite numbers.
  The 2nd Section gives a purely analytical theory of multipartite
numbers.

      Section    3  is taken up with the graphical representation of bipartite
   numbers.       A reticulation is formed which consists of a series of
   points through each of which straight lines pass in two definite
   directions, the boundary of the whole being a parallelogram.
         A
      The figure AB is the graph of the number 54. A composition of
   this number is defined by fixing nodes at certain points which possess
   the property that no point is at once above and to the left of any
   other point ; the parallelogram between adjacent nodes is the graph
   of a certain number, and in passing through the nodes in succession
   from A to B an ordered assemblage of numbers is found which con
   stitutes a composition of the number which is represented by the
   whole graph.
      This conception leads to theorems of a new kind which are general
   ised in Section 4 to include tripartite and multipartite numbers.
   This section is the most important part of the investigation. It is
   established that

  permutations of the letters in the product

    During the past year, in the mathematical and physical section of
      '
 the    Philosophical Transactions,' eighteen papers have been published,
 and in the biological section, eleven; the two sections together con
taining a total of 1235 pages of letterpress, and 50 plates.            Of the
 '
   Proceedings,'   fourteen  numbers   have  been   issued,   containing 1223
 pages, and 20 plates.     This unusually large bulk is partly accounted
 for by the publication in the ' Proceedings ' of certain extra matters
which the Council deemed likely to interest the Fellows.             One part
 (No. 307), which forms an Appendix to Volume L, contains results of
the Revision of the Statutes, to which I alluded in my Anniversary
Address last year. It consists of a summary of the Second and Third
 Charters, and a copy of the Statutes as now revised, followed by an
interesting note on the History of the Statutes, which has been
drawn up by our Senior Secretary, Professor Michael Foster. In addi
tion to these matters, the same number contains a complete List of the
 Portraits and Busts at present in the apartments of the Society, com
piled by order of the Library Committee, a work which was much
needed, as no such list had been made since Weld's Catalogue, printed
thirty-two years ago. The new " list is nrft a descriptive catalogue,
                                           "
but the names of the painters and donors, and the dates of the gifts,
so far as a thorough and somewhat laborious examination of the
Council minutes and Journal books has revealed them, are furnished.
The List of Portraits is followed by a full descriptive Catalogue of
the Medals at present in the possession of the Society, which has been
carefully made by our clerk, Mr. James, under the supervision of the
Treasurer.

    Another extra number of the ' Proceedings (No. 310) is devoted
to a First Report of the Water Research Committee on the Present
 State of our Knowledge concerning the Bacteriology of Water, by
Professors Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward. It contains 96 pages,
full of most valuable information regarding the vitality of micro
organisms in drinking water, to which in a large measure the spread
 of Asiatic cholera, typhoid fever, and other zymotic diseases is now
•known to be due.
    In   my Presidential Address of last year,    I    referred to this Water
 Committee as haviug been appointed by the Royal Society, in allianne
 with the London County Council ; and this first instalment of its
 work seems amply to justify its originators in their expectations of
 results, most valuable for the public health, from the investigation
 which has been commenced.
    A third extra number (No. 311) contains the Report of the Com
 mittee on Colour Vision.       This Committee, from the time of iM
 appointment in March, 18 '0, held over thirty meetings, in course of
 which it examined more than 500 persons as to their colour vision,
and tried various methods and many kinds of apparatus for colour

large mass of most interesting matter, and the Committee's work ends
in a set of practical recommendations, from which we may hope that
much benefit will come, in the prevention of inconvenience and
disaster liable to be produced by mistake of colour signals, both at
sea and on railways.
   Mr. Ellis's communication* to the Royal Society of last May, and
Professor Grylls Adams' communicationf of June, 1891, both on the
subject of simultaneous magnetic disturbances found by observations
at magnetic observatories in different parts of the world ; the award
of a Royal medal two years ago to Hertz, for his splendid experi
mental work on electro-magnetic waves and vibrations ; and Professor
Schuster's communicationj to the Royal Society, of June, 1889, on the
" Diurnal Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism ;" justify me in saying
a few words on the present occasion regarding terrestrial magnetic
storms, and the hypothesis that they are due to magnetic waves
 emanating from the sun.
   Guided by Maxwell's " electro-magnetic theory of light," and the
 undulatory theory of propagation of magnetic force which it includes,
 we might hope to perfectly overcome a fifty years outstanding diffi
culty in the way of believing the sun to be the direct cause of mag
netic storms in theearth, though hitherto every effort in this direction
has been disappointing.    This difficulty is clearly stated by Professor
W. G. Adams, in the following sentences, which                     I
                                                          quote from his
         to      British Association  of 1881 (p. 469),

 Disturbances and Earth Currents : — " Thus we see that the magnetic
changes which take place at various points of the earth's surface at
the same instant are so large as to be quite comparable with the
earth's total magnetic force ; and in order that any cause may be a
true and sufficient one, it must be capable of producing these changes
rapidly."
   The primary difficulty, in fact, is to imagine the sun a variable
magnet or electro-magnet, powerful enough to produce at the earth's
distance changes of magnetic force amounting, in extreme cases, to
as much as 1/20 or 1/30, and frequently, in ordinary magnetic storms,
to as much as 1/400 of the undisturbed terrestrial magnetic force.
   The earth's distance from the sun is 228 times the sun's radius,
and the cube of this number is about 12,000,000.     Hence, if the snn
were, as   Gilbert found the earth to  a globular magnet, and if it

any direction, would be only a twelve-millionth of the actual force of
terrestrial magnetisation at any point of the earth's surface in a
corresponding position relatively to the magnetic axis.    Hence the
sun must be a magnet* of not much short of 12,000 times the average
intensity of the terrestrial magnet (a not absolutely inconceivable
supposition, as we shall presently see) to produce, by direct action
simply as a magnet, any disturbance of terrestrial magnetic force
sensible to the instruments of our magnetic observatories.
  Considering probabilities and possibilities as to the history of the
earth from its beginning to the present time, I find it unimaginable
but that terrestrial magnetism is due to the greatness and the rota
tion of the earth. If it is true that terrestrial magnetism is a neces
sary consequence of the magnitude and the rotation of the earth,
other bodies comparable in these qualities with the earth, and com-
parable also with the earth in respect to material and temperature,
such as Venus and Mars, must be magnets comparable in strength with
the terrestrial magnet, and they must have poles similar to the earth's
north and south poles on the north and south sides of their equators,
because their directions of rotation, as seen from the north side of the
ecliptic, are the same as that of the earth. It seems probable, also,
that the sun, because of its great mass and its rotation in the same
direction as the earth's rotation, is a magnet with polarities on the
north and south sides of its equator, similar to the terrestrial northern
and southern magnetic polarities.       As the sun's equatorial surface-
velocity is nearly four and a half times the earth's, it seems probable
that the average solar magnetic moment exceeds the terrestrial con
siderably more than according to the proportion of bulk. Absolutely
ignorant as we are regarding the effect of cold solid rotating bodies
such as the earth, or Mars, or Venus, or of hot fluid rotating bodies
such as the sun, in straining the circumambient ether, we cannot
say that the sun might not be 1000, or 10,000, or 100,000 times as
intense a magnet as the earth.       It    therefore, a perfectly proper
                                              is,
object for investigation to find whether there is, or        not, any dis
                                                                 is
turbance of terrestrial magnetism, such as might be produced by a
constant magnet in the sun's place with its magnetic axis coincident
with the sun's axis of rotation. Neglecting for the present the seven
degrees of obliquity of the sun's equator, and supposing the axis to
be exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic, we have an exceedingly simple
case of magnetic action to be considered       a magnetic force perpen
                                                    :

statements of the last four sentences are applicable to the moon as well as to the
sun, and are important in connection with speculation as to the cause of the lunar
disturbance of terrestrial magnetism, discovered nearly fifty years ago by Ereil and
Sabine.

inversely as the cube of the earth's distance from the snn. The com
ponents of this force parallel and perpendicular to the earth's axis
are, respectively, 0"92 and 0'4 of the whole ; of which the former could
only be perceived in virtue of the varying distance of the earth from
the sun in the course of a year ; while the latter would give rise to
n daily variation, the same as would be observed if the red ends of
terrestrial magnetic needles were attracted towards an ideal star of
declination 0° and right ascension 270°. Hence, to discover the disturb
ances of terrestrial magnetism, if any there are, which are due to
direct action of the sun as a magnet, the photographic curves of the
three magnetic elements given by each observatory should be
analysed for the simple harmonic constituent of annual period and
the simple harmonic constituent of period equal to the sidereal day.
We thus have two very simple problems, each of which may be
treated with great ease separately by a much simplified application of
the principles on which Schuster has treated his much more complex
subject, according to Gauss' theory as to the external or internal
origin of the disturbance, and Professor Horace Lamb's investigation
of electric currents induced in the interior of a globe by a varying
external magnet.      The sidereal diurnal constituent which forms the
subject of the second of these simplified problems is smaller, but not
much smaller, than the solar diurnal term which, with the solar
semi-diurnal, the solar ter-dinrual, and solar quarter-diurnal con
 stituents, form the subjects of Schuster's paper. The conclusion at
 which he has arrived, that the soui-ce of the disturbance is external,
is surely an ample reward for the great labour he has bestowed on
the investigation hitherto ; and I hope he may be induced to under
take the comparatively slight extension of his work which will be
required for the separate treatment of the two problems of the
sidereal diurnal and the solar annual constituents, and to answer for
each the question : — Is the source external or internal ?
    But even though external be the answer found in each case, we must
not from this alone assume that the cause is direct action of the sun
as a magnet.      The largeness of the solar semi-diurnal, ter-diurnal,
and quarter-diurnal constituents found by the harmonic analysis,
none of which could be explained by the direct action of the sun as a
magnet, demonstrate relatively large action of some other external
influence, possibly the electric currents in our atmosphere, which
Schuster suggested as a probable cause. The cause, whatever it may
be, for the semidiurnal and higher constituents would also probably
have a variation in the solar diurnal period on account of the
difference of temperature of night and day, and a sidereal and annual
period on account of the difference of temperature between winter
and summer.
    Even if, what does not seem very probable, we are to    be led by the

analysis to believe that magnetic force of the sun is directly percep
tible here on the earth, we are quite certain that this steady force is
vastly less in amount than the abruptly varying force which, from
the time of my ancestor in the Presidential Chair, Sir Edward Sabine's,
discovery,* forty years ago, of an apparent connexion between sun-
spots and terrestrial magnetic storms, we have been almost compelled
to attribute to disturbing action of some kind at the sun's surface.
    As one of the first evidences of this belief, I may quote the follow
ing remarkable sentences from Lord Armstrong's                      Presidential
Address to the British Association at Newcastle, in 1863 : —
    " The
           sympathy also which appears to exist between forces operat
ing in the sun and magnetic forces belonging to the earth merits a
continuance of that close attention which it has already received from
the British Association, and of labours such as General Sabine has,
with so much ability and effect, devoted to the elucidation of the
subject.    I may here notice that most remarkable phenomenon which
was seen by independent observers at two different places, on the 1st
of September, 1859. A sudden outburst of light, far exceeding the
brightness of the sun's surface, was seen to take place, and sweep
like a drifting cloud over a portion of the solar face. This was
attended with magnetic disturbances of unusual intensity, and with
exhibitions of aurora of extraordinary brilliancy.                The identical
instant at which the effusion of light was observed was recorded by
an abrupt and strongly marked deflection in the self-registering
instruments at Kew.         The phenomenon as seen was probably only
part    of what   actually took place, for the magnetic storm in the
midst of which it occurred commenced before, and continued after,
the event.    If conjectnre be allowable in such a case, we may suppose
that this remarkable event had some connexion with the means by
which the sun's heat is renovated.          It is a reasonable supposition
that the sun was at that time in the act of receiving a more than
usual accession of new energy ; and the theory which assigns the
maintenance of its power to cosmical matter, plunging into it with
that prodigious velocity which gravitation would impress upon it as
it approached to actual contact with the solar orb, would afford an
explanation of this sudden exhibition of intensified light, in harmony
with the knowledge we have now attained, that arrested motion is
represented by equivalent heat."
    It has certainly been a very tempting hypothesis, that quantities of
meteoric matter suddenly falling into the sun is the cause, or one of
the causes, of those disturbances to which magnetic storms on the
earth are due.     We may, indeed, knowing that meteorites do fall into
the earth, assume without doubt that much more of them fall, in

the same time, into the sun.       Astronomical reasons, however, led me
long ago to conclude that their quantity annually, or per century, or
per thousand years, is much too small to supply the energy given
out by the sun in heat and light radiated through space, and led me
to adopt unqualifiedly Helmhohz's theory, that work done by gravita
tion on the shrinking mass is the true source of the sun's heat, as
given out at present, and has been so for several hundred thousand
years, or several million years.      It is just possible, however, that the
outburst of brightness described by Lord Armstrong may have been
due to an extraordinarily great and sudden falling in of meteoric
matter, whether direct from extra-planetary space, or from orbital
circulation round the sun. But it seems to me much more probable
that it was due to a refreshed brightness produced over a larger area
of the surface than usual by brilliantly incandescent fluid rushing
 up from below, to take the place of matter falling down from the
 surface, in consequence of being cooled in the regular regime of solar
radiation. It seems, indeed, very improbable that meteors fall in at
 any time to the sun in sufficient quantity to produce dynamical dis
turbances at his surface at all comparable with the gigantic storms
 actually produced by hot fluid rushing up from below, and spreading
out over the sun's surface.
    But now let us consider for a moment the work which must be
 done at the sun to produce a terrestrial magnetic storm.          Take, for
 example, the magnetic storm of June 25, 1885, of which Adams
 gives particulars in his paper of June, 1891 (' Phil. Trans.,' p. 139
 and PI. 9). We find at eleven places, St. Petersburg, Stonyhurst,
 Wilhelmshaven, Utrecht, Kew, Vienna, Lisbon, San Fernando, Colaba,
 Batavia, and Melbourne, the horizontal force increased largely from
 2 to 2.10 p.m., and fell at all the places from 2.10 to 3 p.m., with
 some rough ups and downs in the interval.             The storm lasted alto
 gether from about noon to 8       p.m.    At St. Petersburg, Stonyhurst,
and Wilhelmshaven, the horizontal force was above par by 0-00075,
 0-00088, and 0-00090 (C.G.S. in each case) at 2.10 p.m. ; and below
 par by 0-0007, 0 00066, 0-00075 at 3 o'clock.          The mean value for all
 the eleven places was nearly 0'0005 above par at 2h. 10m., and 0-0005
 below par at 3h.      The photographic curves show changes of some
 what similar amounts following one another very irregularly, but
with perfectly simultaneous correspondence at the eleven different
stations, through the whole eight hours of the storm.            To produce
such changes as these by any possible dynamical action within the
sun, or in his atmosphere, the agent must have worked at something
like 160 million million million million horse-power* (12 x 10s* ergs
 per sec), which is about 364 times the total horse-power (3*3 x 10°
 ergs per sec.) of the solar radiation.       Thus, in this eight hours of a
                 • 1 horse power = 7'46 x 10' ergs per second.

308                        Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
not very severe magnetic storm, as mnch work must have been done
 by the sun in sending magnetic waves out in all directions through
space as he actually does in four months of his regular heat and
light.   This result, it seems to me, is absolutely conclusive against
 the supposition that terrestrial magnetic storms are due to magnetic
action of the sun ; or to any kind of dynamical action taking place
within the sun, or in connexion with hurricanes in his atmosphere,
or anywhere near the sun outside.
   It seems as if we may also be forced to conclude that the supposed
connexion between magnetic storms and sun-spots is unreal, and that
the seeming agreement between the periods has been a mere coinci
dence.
   "We are  certainly far from having any reasonable explanation of any
of the magnetic phenomena of the earth ; whether the fact that the
earth is a magnet ; that its magnetism changes vastly, as it does from
century to century ; that it has somewhat regular and periodic annual,
solar diurnal, lunar diurnal, and sidereal diurnal variations ; and (as
marvellous as the secular variation) that it is subject to magnetic
storms.    The more marvellous, and, for the present inexplicable, all
these subjects are, th& more exciting becomes the pursuit of investi
gations which must, sooner or later, reward those who persevere in
the work.     We have at present two good and sure connexions be
tween magnetic storms and other phenomena : the aurora above, and
the earth currents below, are certainly in full working sympathy with
magnetic storms.      In this respect the latter part of Mr. Ellis's paper
is of special interest, and it is to be hoped that the Greenwich obser
vations of earth currents will be brought thoroughly into relation
with the theory of Schuster and Lamb, extended, as indeed Professor
Schuster promised to extend it, to include not merely the periodic
 diurnal variations, but the irregular sudden changes of magnetic
force taking place within any short time of a magnetic storm.
   In my Presidential Address of last year I referred to the action of
the International Geodetic Union, on the motion of Professor Foerster,
of Berlin, to send an astronomical expedition to Honolulu for the
purpose of making a twelve months' series of observations on latitude,
corresponding to twelve mouths' simultaneous observations to be
made in European observatories ; and I was enabled, through the
kindness of Professor Foerster, to announce as a preliminary result,
derived from the first three months of the observations, that the
latitude had increased during that time by ^ sec. at Berlin, and had
decreased at Honolulu by almost exactly the same amount.              The
proposed year's observations, begun in Honolulu on the . 1st of June,
1891, were completed by Dr. Marcuse, and an elaborate reduction of
them by the permanent Committee of the International Geodetic
Union was published a month ago at Berlin.            The results are in

   splendid   agreement    with those of the European observatories :
   Berlin, Prag, and Strasbourg.       They prove beyond all question that
   between May, 1891, and June, 1892, the latitude of each of the three
   European observatories was a maximum, and of Honolulu a mini
  mum,    in the beginning of October, 1891: that the latitude of the
  European observatories was a minimum, and of Honolulu a maximum,
  near the beginning of May, 1892 : and that the variations during the
  year followed somewhat approximately, simple harmonic law as if for
  a period of 385 days, with range of about       \  sec. above and below the
  mean latitude in each case.         This is just what would result from
  motion of the north and south polar ends of the earth's instantaneous
  axis of rotation, in ciroles on the earth's surface of 7'5 metres radius,
  at the rate of once round in 385 days.
     Sometime previously it had been found by Mr. S. C. Chandler that
  the irregular variations of latitude which had been discovered in
  different observatories during the last 15 years seemed to follow a
 period of about 427 days, instead of the 306 days given by Peters' and
 Maxwell's dynamical theory, on the supposition of the earth being
 wholly a rigid body. And now, the German observations, although
 not giving so long a period as Chandler's, quite confirm the result
 that, whatever approximation to following a period there is, in the
 variations of latitude, it is a period largely exceeding the old estimate
of 306 days.
     Nevvcomb, in a letter which     I  received from him last December,
 gave,   what  seems  to  me   to be, undoubtedly, the true explanation of
 this apparent discrepance from dynamical theory, attributing it to
 elastic yielding of the earth as a whole. He added a suggestion,
 specially interesting to myself, that investigation of periodic varia
 tions of latitude may prove to be the best means of determining ap
proximately the rigidity of the earth.         As it is, we have now, for the
first time, what seems to be a quite decisive demonstration of elastic
yielding in the earth as a whole, under the influence of a deforming
force, whether of centrifugal force round a varying axis, as in the
present case, or of tide-generating influences of the sun and moon
                             I
with reference to which first raised the question of elastic yielding
of the earth's material many years ago.
    The present year's great advance in geological dynamics forms the
                                                      '
subject of a contribution by Newcomb to the Monthly Notices of the
Royal Astronomical Society,' of last March. In a later paper, pub
lished in the 1 Astronomisohe Nachrichten,' he examines records
of many observatories, both of Europe and America, from 1865 to the
present time, and finds decisive evidence that from 1865 to 1890 the
variations of latitude were much less than they have been during
the past year, and seeming to show that an augmentation took place,
somewhat suddenly, about the year 1890.

   When we consider how much water falls on Europe and Asia
daring a month or two of rainy season, and how many weeks or
months must pass before it gets to the sea, and where it has been in
the interval, and what has become of the air from which it fell, we
need not wonder that the distance of the earth's axis of equilibrium
of centrifngal force from the instantaneous axis of rotation should
often vary* by 5 or 10 metres in the course of a few weeks or
months.     We can scarcely expect, indeed, that the variation found
by   the International  Geodetic Union during the year beginning
June, 1891, should recur periodically for even as much as one or two
or three times of the seeming period of 385 days.
   One of the most important scientific events of the past year has
been Barnard's discovery, on the 9th of September, of a new satellite
to Jupiter.    On account of the extreme faiotness of the object, it
has not been observed anywhere except at the Lick Observatory in
California.   There, at an elevation of 4500 ft., with an atmosphere
of great purity, and with a superb refractor of 36" aperture, they
have advantages not obtainable elsewhere.        The new satellite is
about 112,000 miles distant from Jupiter, and its periodic time is
about 11 h. 50 m. Mr. Barnard concludes a short statement of his
                                             "
discovery with the following sentences : — It will thus be seen that
this new satellite makes two revolutions in one day, and that its
periodic time about the planet is less than two hours longer than the
axial rotation of Jupiter.   Excepting the inner satellite of Mars, it is
the most rapidly revolving satellite known.     When sufficient obser
vations have been obtained, it will afford a new and independent
determination of the mass of Jupiter. Of course, from what I have
said in reference to the difficulty of seeing the new satellite, it will
be apparent that the most powerful telescopes of the world only will
show it" (dated Mount Hamilton, September 21, 1892).
   Sir Robert Ball, in calling my attention to     remarks that "
                                                              it,                        it   is
by far the most striking addition to the solar system since the dis
covery of the satellites to Mars in 1877."     To all of us        most        it   is
interesting that during this year, when we are all sympathising
with the University of Padua in its celebration of the third cen
tenary of its acquisition of Galileo a9 a Professor, we have first
gained the knowledge of a fifth satellite in addition to the four
discovered       by Galileo.

                               Budolph Virchow.
   Professor Virchow'B eminent services to science are known
throughout the world, and they are far too varied and numerous for
enumeration.
   He survives Schwann, Henle, and the other pioneers in several
branches of natural history who came from the school of Johannes
Miiller, and at the present time occupies a position of influence and
honour equal to that of his great contemporaries Helmholtz, Ludwig,
and Du Bois-Beymond.
   His contributions to the stndy of morbid anatomy have thrown
light upon the diseases of every part of the body,* but the broad and
philosophical view he has taken of the processes of pathology has
done more than his most brilliant observations to make the science
of disease.
   In histology he has the chief merit of the classification into epi
thelial organs, connective tissues, and the higher and more specialised
muscle and nerve.        He also demonstrated the presence of neuroglia
in the brain and spinal cord, and discovered crystalline hsematoidine,
and the true structure of the umbilical cord.
   In pathology, strictly so called, his two great achievements — the
detection of the cellular activity which lies at the bottom of all
morbid as well as normal physiological processes, and the classifica
tion of the important group of new growths on a natural histological
 basis — have each of them not only made an epoch in medicine, but
have been the occasion of fresh extension of science by other
labourers.
   In ethnological      and archaeological     science Professor Virchow has
made observations which only the greatness of his other work has
thrown into the shade ; and, so far from confining himself to technical
labours, he has been known since he migrated to Wiirzburg and
returned to Berlin as a public-spirited, far-seeing, and enlightened
politician.f
    Universally honoured and personally esteemed by most of the
 leading pathologists in this country, as well as on the Continent and
in America, who had the good fortune to be his pupils, Professor
Virchow is a worthy successor of the many illustrious men of science
to whom the Copley Medal has been awarded.
   * Among    these may be mentioned his discovery of leucaemia, of lardaceous
degeneration,   and glioma ; his reconstruction of the kind of tumour known as
sarcoma, and his establishment of the important group of granulomata.
   t A short pamphlet, " Ueber die Nationale Bedeutung der Naturwissenschaften,"
may be mentioned as characteristic of the patriotism, the fairness, and the broad
judgment of the author.

            Nils C. Dune'r,  Director of the Observatory of Lund.
   Dr. Duner has been continuously at work, since 1871, at astro
nomical observations (see 'R.S. Catalogue').
   He began to turn his attention to spectroscopic subjects in 1878,
and commenced the publication of his systematic work on Stellar
Spectra in 1882.
   In 1884 he brought to a conclusion his wonderful observations of
stars of Vogel's   III Class. His memoir contains a detailed stndy of
the spectra of nearly 400 stars, all which are the most difficult objects
to observe.     This volume is one of the foundations on which aDj
future work in this direction must be based.
   In 1891 he published another series of researches on the rotation
of the sun, comparing true solar with telluric lines for regions up to
75° of solar latitude.      The result showed a diminution of angular
velocity with increasing latitude, thus spectroscopically confirming
Carrington's results.
                                 Royal Medal.
Professor   Charles   Pritchard,   D.D., F.R.S.,   Director   of the   Oxford
                             University Observatory.
    Professor Pritchard began his publications on astronomical subjects
in 1852. His first paper and several others which have followed,
 have dealt with the construction of object glasses and telescope
 adjustments.
    He was President of the Royal    '   Astronomical Society in the years
 1867 and 1868.
    He was appointed first Director of the newly-founded observatory
 at Oxford in 1874. It is now the most active University observatory
 in the kingdom, as many as fifteen students receiving instruction in ob
 servatory work at times.       The services he has rendered to astronomy
 in devising, and keeping at a high standard, the work of the ob
 servatory in many directions, including its use as a school, are very
 noteworthy.
    Immediately on the establishment of the observatory he saw the
 beneficial effects of photographic investigation, and first applied the
 method, with the old wet-plate photography, to the problem of the
 physical libration of the moon.          He saw that this problem was
 encumbered in heliometric work by the fact that a set of the ob
 servations must take a considerable time, and therefore they were
 made on a constantly changing disc, necessitating great labour in
 reduction. By the observations being made in two or three seconds,
 the picture of the moon did not alter in the time.         The result was to

show important variations from Bonvard's work, which variations in
their important particulars were confirmed by Dr. Hartwig.
    Next (1885) the relative motions of the Pleiades were taken up
with a view of tracing gravitational effects in the various members
of the group. This question is not ripe for solving, but it induced
heliometer observers to take up the question, and important progress
is now being made.
    The photometric work detailed in the ' Uranometria Nova Oxon.
iensi8,' also published in 1885, consisted in measuring the light
received from all stars visible to the naked eye, to 10° south de
clination, by means of a wedge photometer devised by Professor
Pritchard — a form of photometer now in the hands of many astrono
 mers.    In the course of this work Professor Pritchard, at his own
 expense, took an assistant to Egypt to determine the effects of atmo
spheric absorption in a more constant climate than that of Oxford.
 This photometric work has been recognised by the award of the Gold
 Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.
    Having fully determined the capacity of photography for accurate
 measurement, Professor Pritchard next applied it to parallax deter
 minations of stars of the second magnitude.          Some thirty stars
 altogether have been investigated, and this work is now in the press.
 Thirty is a greater number than any other astronomer has attempted.
    Professor Pritchard is bow working on the International Chart of
 the Heavens, and taking part in researches to ensure an accurate
 photometric scale.

                      John Newport Langley, F.B.S.
     Some of the most important of Mr. Langley's researches have been
 upon the Physiology and Histology of Secreting Glands.       Extending
 the observations of Kiihne and Lea on the pancreas, Mr. Langley
  showed in an elaborate series of researches, extending over the sali
  vary and most of the important secreting glands of the body, that
  the formation, as a morphological element within the secreting cell,
  at the expense of its protoplasm, of the material to be used in the
  secretion is a general function of secreting cells.  The dependence of
  this function upon the activity of nerves, and upon other forms of
  excitation, such as the action of drugs, has been greatly elucidated in
  the course of these researches.   Concurrently with the morphological
  changes within the cells, the chemical changes which occur within
  the secretion as the result of nerve activity or inactivity have been
  investigated, and many important facts brought to light regarding
  the nature of the action or modifications of the action which may be
   brcuglit to bear upon the secreting cell through the nervous system.

   These researches are published partly in the ' Philosophical Transac
  tions,' and partly in a long series of articles in the ' Journal of Physio
   logy,' which have extended over several years. It is not too much
  to say that these researches of Mr. Langley upon secreting glands
  give him a claim to occupy the highest rank as a physiological
  investigator.
     The other most important researches which Mr. Langley has pub
  lished have been — (1.) Upon the central nervons system, including
  especially an investigation into the anatomical changes which result
 from central lesions ; (2.) Upon the sympathetic nervous system,
  and particularly a number of researches, based upon physiological
  methods, into its peripheral distribution to involuntary muscle and
  glands.    Mr. Langley's eminence in those branches of physiology to
  which he has mainly devoted his attention is universally admitted,
 and has been publicly recognised by his having been requested more
 than once by international assemblies of physiologists to investigate
 and report on difficult cases submitted to them (vide ' Transactions of
 the International Medical Congress,' 1881, and ' Proceedings of the
 Physiological Congress at Basel,' 1890).

    Franfois Marie Baoult, of Grenoble, Correspondent of the Academy of

     The accounts of Professor Raoult's researches on the freezing points
 of solutions, and on the vapour pressures of solutions, form a long
 series of papers which have appeared from time to time in the ' Coraptes
           '
 Rendus and ' Annales de Chimie,' from 1871 down to the present time.
 Our previous knowledge of these subjects was only fragmentary and
disjointed, but he has placed it on a new footing, and established
general laws relating to the depression of the freezing points and
lowering of the vapour pressures of liquids holding other substances
in solution. These laws are of great importance, both to chemistry
and physics.      Their validity is not disputed, and, while theories of
solution are much discussed, it is acknowledged that no theory can
stand which does not satisfy the conditions which Raoult, by an
induction from a very large number of observations on a great variety
of substances, has shown to be the order of nature.

  I. " On the Photographic Spectra of some of the Brighter
       Stars." By J. NoRMAN LOCKYER, F.R.S. Received Novem
       ber 3, 1892.
                                (Abstract.)
   The present communication consists of a discussion of 443 photo
graphs of the spectra of 171 stars, which have been obtained at
Kensington and Westgate-on-Sea during the last two years.
   The chief instrument employed in this work has been a 6-inch re
fracting telescope in conjunction with — at different times —objective
               '
prisms of 1\ and 45° respectively.
   By this method the time of exposure is short, and good definition,
with large dispersion, is easily secured.       The spectra thus obtained
will bear enlargement up to thirty times without much sacrifice of
definition.
   The 30-inch reflector and slit-spectroscope at Westgate-on-Sea have
also been used in the inquiry.
   My object has not been so much to obtain photographs of the spec
tra of a large number of stars as to study in detail the spectra ot
comparatively few.
   In the classifications of stars adopted by others from a considera
tion of the visual observations, only the broader differences in the
spectra have been taken into account.       Professor Pickering has more
recently employed     a provisional classification  in connexion with the
Henry Draper Memorial photographs of stellar spectra, but this
chiefly relates to photogr.iphs taken with small dispersion. With

1892.]              Spectra  of some of the  Brighter Stars.             327
larger' dispersion it becomes necessary to deal with the presence or
absence of individual lines.                                 ,
    In the first instance, the various stars of which the spectra liavo
been photographed at Kensington have been arranged in tables,
without reference to any of the existing classifications, and taking
into account the finer details.     The basis on which the main tabular
divisions of the spectra are founded is the amount of continuous ab
sorption at the blue end. This distinction was not possible in the
case of the eye observations.
    The stars included in the first table are characterised by the ab
sence of any remarkable continuous absorption at the blue end, and by
the presence in their spectra of broad lines of hydrogen.        These have
been further classified in four sub-divisions, depending on the presence
 or absence of other lines.
    In the stars of the second table there is a considerable amount of
 continuous absorption in the ultra-violet, and the spectra beyond K
 are very difficult to photograph as compared with the stars of the
 first table. In these stars the thickness of the hydrogen lines is about
 the same as in the solar spectrum.       These also are arranged in two
 sub-divisions.
     In all the stars included in the third table there is a very con
 siderable amount of continuous absorption in the violet, extending
 to about G, and it is a matter of great difficulty to photograph these
 spectra, as most of the stars of this class are below the 3rd magnitude.
 The hydrogen lines are very thin.          One sub-division includes the
 spectra    which   show   flutings shading away towards the less re
 frangible end of the spectrum. The other comprises stars without
 flutings in their spectra.     The brightest star in this table, a. Orionis,
 is discussed in detail, the result tending to show that the tempera
 ture of the absorbing iron vapours is not much greater than that of
 the oxy-hydrogen flame.
     The relations of the various sub-divisions to which reference has
 been made are then traced.
     One important fact comes out very clearly, namely, that whether
 we take the varying thicknesses of the hydrogen lines or of the lines
 of other substances as the basis for the arrangement of the spectra,
 it is not possible to place all the stars in one line of temperature.
 Thus, there are stars in which the hydrogen lines are of the same
 average thickness, while the remaining lines are almost entirely dif
 ferent. These spectra cannot, therefore, be placed in juxta-position,
 and it is necessary to arrange the stars in two series.
     The next part of the paper consists of a discussion of the photo
 graphic results in relation to the meteoritic hypothesis.            In the
 Bakerian Lecture for 1888,       I brought together the various observa
 tions of the spectra of stars, comets, and nebulas, and the discussion
                                                                  z 2

328            Prof.  J.  N. Lockyer.       On  the Photographic      [Dec. 8,
 suggested the hypothesis that nil celestial bodies are, or have been,
 swarms of meteorites, the difference          between them being due to
 different stages of condensation.          The new classification rendered
 necessary by this hypothesis differed from previous ones, inasmuch as
 the line of evolution followed, instead of locating the highest tem
 perature at its commencement, as demanded by Laplace's hypothesis,
 placed it much later.      Hence bodies of increasing temperature were
 demanded as well      as bodies  of decreasing temperature.
    The question how far this condition is satisfied by the new facts
 revealed by the photographs is next discussed.
    This involves the consideration of some points in connexion with
 the hypothesis to which brief reference alone has been made in pre
 vious communications.          The phenomena to be expected on the
 hypothesis,   aud the actual facts, are given side by side below.

  II. "  On the Velocity of Crooken' Cathode Stream." By Lord
            Kelvin, P.R.S. Received December 3, 1892.
    In  connection   with his splendid discovery of the cathode stream
 (stream from the cathode in exhausted glass vessels subjected to
 electric force), Crookes found that when the whole of the stream, or
 a large part of the whole, is so directed as to fall on 2 or 3 sq. cm. of
 the containing vessel, this part of the glass becomes rapidly heated
 up to many degrees, as much as 200° or 300° sometimes, above the
 temperature of the surroundings.
    Let v be the velocity, in centimetres per second, of the cathode
 stream, and p the quantity of matter of all the molecules in 1 c.c. of
 it. Supposing what Crookes' experiments seem to prove to be not
 far from the truth, that their impact on the glass is like that of in
 elastic bodies, and that it spends all their translational energy in
 heating the glass.      The eneryv thus spent, per square centimetre

                                   E     42,000,000                            W
 where       E denotes the sum of the emissivities of the two surfaces of the
 glass     in the actual circumstances.
      It is probable that p differs considerably from the average density
 of the residual air in the enclosure.            Let us take, however, for a con
 ceivably possible example, p = 10"*, which is what the mean density
 of the enclosed air would be if the vessel were exhausted to 8 x 10~*
 of the ordinary atmospheric         density.
      To complete the example, take
                              v =  100,000 cm.     per sec.
 (being about twice the average velocity of the molecules of ordinary
 air at ordiuary temperature)        ; and take
                                      <ra =   | cm.,
 as   it might be for an ordinary glass vacuum bulb; and take
                                      E =    TBoTS l
 which may not be very far from the truth.
     With these assumptions, we find, by (1) and (2) approximately, 1"
 per second for the initial rise, and 375° for the final temperature,
 which are not very unlike the results found in some of Crookes'
experiments.
     The pressure of the cathode stream of the velocity and density
 which we have assumed by way of example is pv1, or 100 dynes per
square centimetre, or about 100 milligrams heaviness per square centi
metre, which is ample for Crookes' wonderful mechanical results.
     The very moderate velocity of 1 kilom. per second which we have
assumed is much too small to show itself by the optical colour test.
The fact that this test has been applied, and that no indication of
velocity of the luminous molecules has been found, has, therefore, no
validity as an objection against Crookes' doctrine of the cathode
stream.

           Nerves." By C. S. Sherrington, M.A., M.D., Lecturer on

                                        (Abstract.)
      After reference to the experimental researches of Eckhard, Peyer,
  Krause, Koschewnikoff, Meyer, and Tiirck, and to the anatomical of
  Herringham and Paterson, mention is made of clinical observations
  by Thorbnrn, Starr, Mackenzie, Head, and others.                   The methods
  employed by the      author    in  experiments    on the Frog, Cat, and Monkey
  are then detailed.      In the two latter animals the effect of consecutive
  sections in ascending or descending series upon the reflex movement
  elici table by electrical excitation of the central end of a peripheral
 nerve was observed, and followed as a guide to the central connexions
 of the nerve.       In the first- and last-mentioned animals mechanical
 excitation of the cutaneous surface, after previous section of a number
 of posterior roots above and below the root to be examined, was em
 ployed to detect the peripheral distribution of the nerve-root in
 the skin.       The various experiments performed are individually
 described, and the results of each series are collated. The cutaneous
 fields of the thoracic and post-thoracic afferent spinal roots are shown
 in photographs, and in sketches made at the time in the laboratory.
 The photographs illustrate also the chief outlines of the segmental
 skin- fields of the cervical sensory roots ; -but description and discus
 sion of the roots, above the 1st thoracic, are reserved for a future
 communication.
     The author finally proceeds to draw conclusions of the following
 nature : —
     The field of skin belonging to each sensory spinal root may be
called the segmental skin-field. In each segmental field reflex reaction
is less easily elicitable near the edge of the field than from the field
elsewhere.       The segmental fields do not present the same configura
tion as do the fields of the peripheral nerves.
    Although in a plexus each posterior spinal root gives separate con
tributions to many several nerve-trunks, the cutaneous distribution of
the root is composed not of patches which are disjoined, but of patches
which are so joined that the distribution of the entire root forms
one continuous field. Similarity of the root composition of neigh

 bouriug nerve-twigs, that are near their destination, is a necessity of
this arrangement. Thus, the dorsal collateral digital nerve, on the
tibial side of a digit, will resemble, in composition, the plantar
 collateral digital on the tibial side of the same digit, although they
 are derived from separate parent trunks.        This is comparable to the
similarity of root composition exhibited by the several motor twigs
entering one and the same muscle.            Thus, the tibialis anticus fre
quently receives fibres from three motor spinal roots, and receives
those fibres by at least three several nerve-branches entering it ; the
root composition of each of the nerve-branches is approximately the
same.    The dorsal digital supplying the cleft between the 1st and
2nd digits is interpolated in the series of digitals from the musculo
cutaneous nerve, although it comes itself from the anterior tibial.
Yet   it,by its root composition, falls into perfect series with the other
digital nerves.
   Bach segmental skin-field spreads, to      acertain extent, across neigh
bouring segmental        skin-fields.    It has a fore-lay extending into
segmental fields immediately anterior to           and an after-lap extend

into the corresponding fields on the other lateral half of the body,
both at the mid-dorsal line (the dorsal cross-lap) and the mid-ventral
line (the ventral cross-lap).         The fore-lap and the after-lap are,
throughout    the  body, very great, and each region of skin appears to
be supplied by at least two sensory spinal roots.        The over-lap of the
bkin-fields of the individual filaments of a posterior root         is
                                                                  great.

half of the body ;   it has fairly parallel edges, bat    somewhat broader

near its ventral than at its dorsal end.        In the limb the segmental
skin-fields are distorted from the simple band-like type.        The distor
tion of each segmental field in the hind-limb, and of some in the fore-
limb, is, in the full paper, analysed, and for each the true anterior
border, the true posterior border, and the true dorsal and ventra
borders are found.       This analysis  is  only possible after     has been
                                                                        it
recognised that in the limb the cutaneous segments are not only dis
torted but are seemingly dislocated from their attachments to the
mid-dorsal and mid-ventral lines of the trunk.
   The mid-dorsal line of the body may bo said to, in the region of the
limb, extend outwards as a side branch,           secondary axis, almost at
                                                  a
right angles to itself. The same      is   done in the same region by the
mid- ventral line. Upon these dorsal and ventral side lines as upon
secondary dorsal and ventral axes, the cutaneous segments of the
limb are ranged, as though upon folded portions of the axial lines of
the trunk itself.
   The axial lines for the hind-limb slant outward from the trunk

 1892.]        the Posterior Roots   of some Spinal Nerves.          335
axis in a somewhat backward as well as lateral direction ; those for
 the forc-limb conversely slope somewhat forward as well as outward.
 The dorsal axial line in the hind-limb runs from the mid-dorsum
 over the sacrum, past the back of the hip-joint, and along the outer
 face of the thigh nearly to the knee.       Of the dorsal axial line of
 the  fore limb  only the  most  proximal  part is described by the pre
 sent experiments ; that part runs from the mid-dorsum outwards
 and forwards over the infra-spinous fossa of the seaptila. The ventral
 axial line of the hind-limb runs from the front of the body of the
pubes to the inner border of the thigh, and descends along the
junction of the extensor and adductor groups of muscles nearly
to the knee. The ventral axial line of the fore-limb is in the present
experiments only followed for its proximal part ; that part lies on
the chest close below the clavicle.
    The position of these secondary axes having once been found (by
methods described in the paper) in the limb, it is not difficult to
examine the degree of apparent dislocation of each segmental field
and the nature of its distortion.     In the segmentally anterior aspect
of the limb each segmental field has been curved so as to present a
very convex posterior edge, and the after-lap of the field is very large.
Iu the segmentally posterior aspect of the limb each segmental field
has been curved so as to present a very convex anterior edge, and the
fore-lap of the field is very large.   The dorsal and ventral borders of
the fields are, in the limb, not much increased in length.     Owing to
their serial arrangement along the secondary mid-dorsum and mid-
venter of the limb there is a secondary cross-lap of the fields there of
 such a kind that a segmental field may there cross-lap with a seg
 mental field far distant from it in the segmental series ; thus the 9th
post-thoracic field may cross-lap with the 4th post-thoracic field.
    This dislocation of some of the segmental fields in the limb from
the mid-dorsum and mid-venter is apparent rather than real, and is not
a fundamental character of the limb segmentation, for it does not
occur in primitive types, e.g., is absent from the pelvic limb of the
Frog.
    Using the cutaneous field  as a  guide to the morphological position
of various points in the body, it is seen that the edges of the foot and
hand are, in the segmental fields of the limb, about midway between
the mid-dorsal and mid-ventral lines, and therefore must correspond
about with the lateral line of the trunk.       The digits are therefore
buds from the region of the lateral line.
   The vulva and the anus are not at the posterior pole of the body,
but, like the umbilicus, are placed in the mid- ventral line.
   From the motor roots it is not easy to get evidence that the 1st
digit of the foot or hand is segmentally anterior to the 5th digit ; the
root supply of the intrinsic musculature of each is so similar. But

336             Dr. C. S. Sherrington.     On  the Fibres of      [Dec. 8,
from the sensory roots it is easy to show that the skin of the 1st digit
is segmentally anterior to that of the 2nd digit, that of 2nd to that of
3rd, and so on.      The skin of the dorsum of the foot is shown to be
segmentally     anterior to the sole.
    The nipple lies in the middle of the 4th thoracic field, trat is also
included in the fields of the 3rd and 5th thoracic. The umbilicus is
in the 11th thoracic root field.
    The number of segments entering into the composition of the skin
of the limb is seen to be greater than the number of segments con
tributing to its musculature. To the skin of the anterior aspect of
the fore-limb, six segments contribute (3rd, 4th, 5.th, 6th* 7th, 8th
cervical) ; to that of the hind-limb six segments also (1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th, 5th, 6th post-thoracic).      To the posterior part of the fore-limb
four segments contribute (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th thoracic) ; to that of the
hind-limb four segments also (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th post-thoracic).
    In each limb the anterior aspect is segmentally more extensive than
the posterior.     I have shown that this last fact is exemplified even
more strikingly in the musculature of each limb.
    The qnadrifid or quinquifid digital partition at the free end of the
limb gives no indication of the number of segmental skin fields in it.
    Joints such as knee and ankle, which might perhaps seem natural
boundaries marking fundamentally distinct portions of the limb, are
 not regarded as such in the segmentation of the cord, as evidenced
by posterior roots.
    The absolute segmental level of a point of surface is subject to in
dividual variation, as was shown to be the case with muscular points
in the substance of the body wall and viscera. This individual varia
 tion affecting the skin corresponds with variation in the constitution,
 of the efferent roots ; the limb plexus may be postjixed or prefixed
 by its sensory spinal roots, just as it may be by its motor spinal
 roots.   A mixed nerve may be postfixed by its motor roots and by its
 sensory in the same individual, or may be prefixed by both.           But
 there is some evidence (Frog) that a plexus may be prefixed by its
 motor roots when it is not so by its sensory roots, and vice versa.
    The distribution of the fibres of the sensory spinal root in the limb,
 as elsewhere, indicates a segmental significance in their constitution
 rather than a functional based upon coordination. Without denying
 the existence of functional factors in the progressive development of
 the limb, it must be admitted that there is little evidence that the
 collection of fibres in each sensory root has resulted from an assort
 ment of the fibres with a view towards assisting in functional co
 ordination.
     Peyer's statement of the correspondence of locality of the muscular
 and cutaneous distributions of a spinal nerve does not apply in the
 Monkey.       The 9th post-thoracic nerve innervates the intrinsic

 1892.]        the  Posterior Roots     of some Spinal      ATerves.          337
muscles of the foot, but its skin-field is on the buttock.           In the lower
half  of the trunk and in the pelvic limb the skin at any point will be
supplied by sensory spinal roots segmentally anterior to (higher than)
the spinal motor root supplying the subjacent muscle.              A partial ex
ception to this will be in the skin of the back of the thigh, where, for
reasons explained, the supply of both may be from the same segmental
level.
   The cutaneous fields of the posterior spinal roots do not correspond
with the fields of cutaneous distribution of the motor roots,           as judged
by the pilomotor fibres of those roots.         The pilomotor fields and the
cutaneous sensory fields do not correspond.
   As to cutaneous vasomotor fields and the cutaneous sensory fields,
there does in Macacus rhesus seem to be a curions correspondence of

       by Professor W. F. R. Weldon, F.R.S.                  Received Novem
       ber 17, 1892.
   The researches of which the present communication contains a
brief summary, were carried on during the summer of the present
year, at the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association in
Plymouth, where I occupied a table by appointment of the British
Association Committee.          The observations were made chiefly on larvae
of Palcemonetes variant, but other species have also been included,
and will be mentioned in particular instances.
                                I.   The Nephridia.
   During the greater part of the larval life two pairs of nephridia are
present   : the green glands, which open at the bases of the second
antennte, and the shell glands, which open at the bases of the second
maxillae.
   The Green Gland. — In a larva of Palcemonetes            which is     a few days
old, the green gland has a form similar to that described by Weldon*
and Marchalf for the adult of Virbius, Pandalus, and Crangon, except
ing that the remarkable enlargements of the bladder, which the
former author has termed " nephroperitoneal sacs," are not as yet
developed.      The gland consists of an end sac, which communicates
by  means    of a JJ-8haPed tube with a very short ureter opening at, the
base of the antenna.          The distal portion of the tube is slightly
enlarged, and may      be  called   the bladder.    At the time of hatching of
the larva, the whole gland consists of a solid mass of cells, in which
no cavity has appeared, although the portions which afterwards form
the end sac and the tube can be distinguished, and the ureter and
external opening are already present.              Shortly after the larva lias
become free the cells separate, and give rise to the lumen of the
gland.
   The later development of the green gland consists chiefly in the
enlargement of the bladder, which grows at first inwards, towards
the middle ventral line of the body, then upwards, within the oeso

dorsal line, where     it meets its fellow of the opposite side. The two
bladders    grow backwards over the stomach, subsequently fusing in
the middle line to form the unpaired nephroperitoneal sac.                    This
mode of development confirms the view as to the nature of the latter
sac already arrived at by Weldon and Marchal from a comparative
study of the renal organs of Decapods.
   The Shell Gland. — In a figure of a Callianassa larva in the My sis
stage, Claus* inserts and names the shell gland, opening at the base
of the second maxilla.        This is, I believe, the only recorded instance
of the gland having been recognised in a Decapod, unless, indeed, the
"                      " described
  segmental organ                      by Lebedinskif as opening at the base
of the first maxillipede of the larva of Eriphya spinifrons, and com-
municating with the body cavity, be the same organ.
   In late embryos, and at the time of hatching of the larva, the shell
glands are the functional kidneys of Palaemonetes and Palcemon, the
green gland being still without a lumen.                The shell gland of Pulm-
monetes consists     of  a comparatively       short renal  tube, with a consider
able lumen, which communicates internally with an end sac, and
opens externally at the base of the second maxilla. The general form
of the tube may be expressed by saying that it is Y"8^aPe^> *ne *wo
arms of the    Y   being in a horizontal plane, with the end sac attached
to the internal one, whilst the leg of the             Y  i8 curved in a vertical
plane, the concavity looking downwards and backwards. The histo
logical structure of both end sac and renal tube is similar to that
described by GrobbenJ for the green gland of Mysis.                  The entrance
from the end sac to the tube is guarded, however, by a valve, formed
of elongated cells of the end sac, which does not appear to have been
found in other forms.
   I have detected no trace of the shell gland in young adults.

the region of the second maxilla) of a Palmmonetes larva, which is a
few days old, shows that the cavity enclosed by the external chitin
and ectoderm may be divided into four regions : a dorsal sac, sur
rounded by a definite layer of epithelium, and within which the
cephalic aorta lies, but which does not itself contain blood ; a central
cavity, in which the liver, intestine, and nerve cord, are found ; two

lateral cavities, separated from the central cavities by masses of muscle
and bands of connective tissue, and which, in the region under con
sideration, contain the proximal ends of the shell glands ; and, fourthly,
 the cavities nf the limbs, which contain the distal ends of the same
 organs.    The cavities of the limbs communicate with the lateral
 cavities, and the latter frequently communicate           with the central
 cavity by the disappearance of the connective tissue bands.             The
 central cavity, the lateral cavities, and the cavities of the limbs, all
 contain blood.
                        I
    The Dorsal Sac. — have found the dorsal sac in Palcemon serratut,
 Palcemonete8 varians, and Crangon vulgaris, and in the adult it attains
 a considerable size.    If a dissection be made of an adult Palcemon, the
 sac is readily seen.   Anteriorly it appears as an elongated, cylindrical
 tube, lying upon the nephroperitoneal sac, and containing within it
 the cephalic aorta.      Posteriorly it is very much enlarged, covering
the front part of the ovaries, and running downwards on either side
into the cavity which surrounds the intestine and liver. A similar
condition of things is found in the adult Palcemonetes.
    The dorsal sac does not contain blood. I have been led to this con
clusion for the following reasons : — (1.) In a large number of series
of sections, both of larvae and adults, I have never seen a blood
corpuscle within the sac.          (2.) The sac is completely closed, and
has    no communication     with   the  blood sinuses of the body.  In pre
served specimens it contains a clot, which can generally be dis
tinguished from the surrounding blood clot.           (3.) I have observed
carefully, and for a long time, living larva, and the space occupied
by the sac has always been perfectly free from blood corpuscles.
    At its anterior end the dorsal sac is surrounded by a mass of tissue,
from the external surface of which blood corpuscles appear to be
budding off. Before commencing this research, Professor Weldon,
to whom the existence of this tissue was known, and who has in
dicated it in his figures, suggested to me this view of its nature, and
it is fully supported by my preparations.
    Development of the Dorsal Sac. — In embryos of Palcemonetes in which
the cephalic aorta is already formed, the cells surrounding the latter
are arranged in two layers, an internal and an external. Before the time
of hatching arrives, the cells of the external layer enlarge consider
ably, and give rise to the appearance of a solid mass of cells upon
either side of the aorta.      The dorsal sac is formed by the hollowing
out of these    masses  of  cells.   Two lateral cavities are thus formed,
whioh are separated by the aorta.         The protoplasm of the cells lining
these cavities, which is at first gathered into masses around the
nuclei, then spreads out into a thin sheet, drawing away from the
lower portion of the aorta, and causing the two lateral cavities to
unite ventrally, and so form a single sac. In the region of the first

 1892.]        Cavity    of the Larva of Palaemonetes varians.                 341
 and second maxillae, all the stages of the process just described may
 be seen. In the region anterior to this I have never actually observed
 the stage with two lateral cavities, the two having always united
                    I
 ventrally, but do not doubt that the process is here the same as in
 the posterior region.
    In one series of sections of a larva, preserved very soon after it had
 left the egg, the cavity was formed upon either side of and below the
aorta, as far back as the anterior end of the segment of the first
 maxillae, where for one section it was almost completely closed.
 Behind this the condition with two lateral cavities was found, and
 persisted through the region of the first maxillce, whilst in the region
 of the second maxillae no cavity had yet opened, and solid masses of
 cells still lay upon either side of the aorta.
    The further development of the dorsal sac consists mainly of an
 increase in its size.        At its posterior end it grows backwards in a
 pair of lobes, which extend as far as the front end of the pericardium.
     The Posterior Region of the Thorax. — The central and lateral
 cavities are here similar to those of the anterior region, whilst dorsal
to them the pericardial chamber lies.                  This chamber is separated
from the central body cavity, as is already well known, by the peri
 cardial septum, and it contains the heart.               The genital organs are
 situated at the front end of the pericardium, immediately below the
pericardial septum.          In the just-hatched larva these consist of two
masses of cells with large nuclei, each mass being enclosed in a sheath
of mesoderm.         I  have not detected any trace of the genital ducts at
 this stage.
    The Abdomen. — With regard to the abdomen, my sections confirm
the accounts given by Milne Edwards* and Claus.t There are two
main sinuses, which run along its length : a dorsal sinus, in which
the intestine lies, and a ventral one, which contains the nerve cord.
These two sinuses are generally separated by masses of muscle, but
they communicate at intervals by means of lateral sinuses.
                               Theoretical   Considerations.
    The state of the body cavity in the anterior region of the thorax
of Pahemonetes may be compared with that of Peripatus, as described
by Sedgwick,f at the time when the dorsal portions of the meso-
blastic somites have attained their maximum development.                  Bearing
in mind that the dorsal sac of Palcemonetes has been formed by the

342     Nephridia,   §c, of Larva of   Palsemonetes varians.      [Dec.  8,
union of two lateral cavities, which lay on either side of the aorta,
the differences between the two forms are very slight.          The dorsal
sac represents the two dorsal portions of the mesoblastic somites,
whilst the central cavity, the lateral cavities, and the nephridia
agree, with the one exception that the two lateral portions of the
nerve cord of Peripatus have united in the middle line in Palcemnwtet,
and in the process have passed out of the lateral cavities.     The agree
ment is so close that it appears to me to be fully justifiable to horao-
logise the various parts.     If this be so, it follows that the dorsal sac
of PalcBmonetes is homologous with the dorsal portions of the meso
blastic somites of Peripatus, and that its cavity is a true ccelom. The
central and lateral cavities, together with the cavities of the legs, will
represent the pseudoccele, and beiDg filled with blood may be termed,
with Lankester, hcemocoele.
    Passing now to the posterior part of the thorax, the region of the
heart, we find that the   differeut^cavities  correspond with those which
persist in the adult Peripatus.       Heart, pericardium, and pericardial
septum of Palcemonetes present exactly the same relations as in Peri
patus, ar.d are clearly homologous structures in the two animals. The
central and lateral cavities only differ on account of the relative
position of the nervous system, and this difference has already been
accounted for.      It must be noted, however, that in this region no
 nephridia are found in the cavities of the limbs. Beneath the
 anterior end of the pericardial septum are found, as has been already
 stated, the genital organs, and here also the comparison with Peripatus
 may be instituted. We find a similar agreement to that which existed
 in the other regions compared, and we may, with a considerable
 degree of probability, again homologise corresponding parts. The
 genital organs of Palcemonetes must then be regarded as the repre
 sentatives, in this region, of the coelom.
    If the homologies here suggested are valid, the body cavity rela
tions of the Crustaceans under consideration may be stated briefly
 thus : both enteroccele (true ccelom) and pseudoccele are present, the
 enterocoele consisting of the dorsal sac, the green gland, and shell
 gland, or the end sacs of these organs, together with the genital
organs and their ducts, whilst the pericardial septum may be regarded
 as equivalent to portions of the walls of another part of the same
structure.
    The pseudoccele consists of the heart and arteries, the pericardial
 cavity, the central cavity of the thorax, with the lateral cavities and
 the cavities of the limbs, and the various sinuses of the abdomen.
 The pseudoccele is filled with blood, and hence can be termed a
hremoecele.
    I hope, shortly, to publish a more detailed account,      with figures,
di  the relations described in this communication.

      November 12, 1892.
                              § L  Introduction.
   The tidal oscillation of the ocean may be represented as the sum of
a number of simple harmonic waves which go through their periods
approximately once, twice, thrice, four times in a mean solar day.
But these simple harmonic waves may be regarded as being rigoronsly
diurnal, semi-diurnal, ter-diurnal, and so forth, if the length of the
day referred to be adapted to suit the particular wave under con
sideration. The idea of a series of special scales of time is thus in
troduced, each time-scale being appropriate to a special tide.        For
example,    the  mean  interval  between,  successive culminations of  the
moon is 24h 50m, and this interval may be described as the mean
lunar day. Now there is a series of. tides, bearing the initials M,,
M2, M3, M4, &c, which go through their periods rigorously once,
twice, thrice, four times, &o., in a mean lunar day. The solar tides,
 S, proceed according to mean solar time j but, besides mean lunar
and mean solar times, there are special time scales. appropriate to the
larger (N) and smaller (L) lnnar elliptic tides, to the evectional (v),
to the diurnal (K^ and semi-diurnal (K2) luni-solar tides, to the
lunar diurnal (0), &c.
    The process of reduction consists of the determination of the mean
height of the water at each of 24 special hours, and subsequent har
monic analysis. The means are taken over such periods of time that
 the influence of all the tides governed by other special times is
 eliminated.                                                              ,

    The process by which the special hourly heights have hitherto
been obtained is the entry of the heights observed at the mean solar
hours in a schedule so arranged that each entry falls into a column
Appropriate to the nearest special hour. Schedules of this kind were
prepared by Mr. Roberts for the Indian Government.* The suc
cessive rearrangements for each sort of special time were made by
recopying the whole of the observations time after time into a series
of appropriate schedules.           The mere clerical labour of this work is
enormous, and great care is required to avoid mistakes.
    All this copying might be avoided if the observed heights were
written on movable pieces. But a year of observation gives 8,760
hourly heights, and the orderly sorting and re-sorting of nearly 9,000
pieces of paper or tablets might prove more laborious and more
treacherous than recopying the figures.
    It occurred to me, however, that the marshalling of movable
pieces might be reduced to manageable limits if all the 24 observa
tions pertaining to a single mean solar day were moved together, for
the movable pieces would be at once reduced to 365, and each piece
might be of a size convenient to handle.
    The realisation of this plan affords the subject of this paper, and it
will appear that not only is all desirable accuracy attainable, but that
the other requisite of such a scheme is satisfied, namely, that the
whole computing apparatus shall serve any number of times and for
any number of places.
    The first idea which naturally ocenrred was to have narrow sliding
tablets which should be thrown into their places by a number of
templates.       It is unnecessary to recount all my trials and failures,
but it will suffice to say that the slides and templates require the
precision of a mathematical instrument if they are to work satis
factorily, and that the manufacture would be so expensive as to make
the price of the instrument prohibitive.
    The idea of making the tablets or strips to slide into their places
was then abandoned, and the strips are now made with short pins on
their under sides, so that they can be stuck on to a drawing board in
any desired position. The templates, which were also troublesome to
make, are replaced by large sheets of paper with numbered marks on
    • An edition of these computation formB was reprinted by aid of a grant from
the Royal Society, and is sold by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company,
but only about a dozen copies now remain.        In the course of the preparation of
the " guide sheets

                       of the method proposed in this paper, found that there are
manv small mistakes in these Indian forms , but they are fortunately not of such a
 kind as to produce a sensible vitiation of results.  I leam that the mistakes arose
 from a misunderstanding on the part of a computer employed to draw up the forms.
    The accuracy of my guide sheets was controlled by aid of Mr. Roberts's forms,
 and  it was the occasional diseiepancy between my results and the forms which led
to the detection of the errors referred to.

them to show how the strips are to be set. The guide sheet is laid on
a drawing hoard, and the pins on the strips pierce the paper and fix
them in their proper positions.
   The shifting of the strips from one arrangement to the next is cer
tainly slower than when they slid into their planes automatically,
but   I find that even without practice it only takes about 7 or 8
minutes to shift 74 of them from any one arrangement to a new
one.
   The strip belonging to each mean solar day is divided by black
lines into 24 equal spaces, intended for the entry of the hourly
heights of water.       The strip is 9 in. long by   \  in. wide and the
divisions (f by \) are of convenient size for the entries.      There was
much difficulty     in  discovering  a good  material,   but after various
trials artificial ivory, or xylonite, was found to serve the purpose.
Xylonite is white, will take writing with Indian ink or pencil, and
can easily be cleaned with a damp cloth. It is just as easy to write
with liquid Indian ink as with ordinary ink, which must not be used,
because   it stains the surface.
   The strips have a great tendency to warp, and I have two methods
of overcoming this. A veneer of xylonite on hard wood serves well,
or solid xylonite may be stiffened by sheet brass let into a slot on the
under side.      In the first plan the pins are fixed in the wood, and in
the second the brass is filed to a spike at each end. Whichever plan is
adopted, the strips are expensive, costing about £7 for a set, and I do
not at present see any way of making them cheaper.
   The observations are to be treated in groups of two and a half
lunations or 74 days. A set of strips, therefore, consists of 74, num
bered from 0 to 73 in small figures on their flat ends.
   If a set be pinne.d horizontally on a drawing board in vertical
column, we have a form consisting of rows for each mean solar day
and columns for each hour. The observed heights of the water are
then written on the strips.
   When the 24 columns are summed and divided by the number of
entries we obtain the mean solar hourly mean heights. The har
monic analysis of these means gives the mean solar tides.          But for
evaluating the other tides the strips must be rearranged, and to this
point we turn our attention.
   Let us consider a special case, that of mean lunar time. A mean
lunar hour is about lh 2m m.s. time ; hence the 12h of each m.s. day
must lie within 31"1 m.s. time of a mean lunar hour. The following
sample gives the incidence to the nearest lunar hour of the first few
days in a year : — ¦

   The successive 12h of m.s. time will march retrogressi vely through
all the 24 hours of m. lunar time.
   Now, if starting from strip 0, we push strip 1 one division to the
left, strip 2 two divisions to the left, and so on, the entries on the
strips will be arranged in columns of approximately lunar time.
    The rule for this arrangement is given by marks on a sheet of
paper 18 in. broad ; these marks consist of parallel numbered steps
or zigzags showing where the ends of each strip are to be placed so
as to bring the hourly values into their proper places.
    At the end of a lunation mean solar time has gained a whole day
over mean lunar time and the 12* solar again agrees with the 12h
lnnar. On the guide sheet we see that the zigzag which takes its
origin at the left end of strip 0 has desoended diagonally from right
to left until it has reached the left margin of the paper, and a new
 zigzag then begins on the right margin.
    When the strips are pinned out following the zigzags on the sheet
 marked M, the entries are arranged in 48 columns, but the number of
 entries in each column is different.           The 48- columns are to he
 regarded as appertaining to 0", lh, . . . ., 22", 23\ 0h, 1"     22h, 23".
 Thus, the number of entries in the left-hand column of any hour
 added to the number of entries in the right-hand column of the same
 hour is, in each case, 74. The 48 incomplete columns may, in fact,
 be regnrded as 24 complete ones.
    The 24 complete columns are then summed; the 24 sums would,          if
 divided by the total number of strips, give the 24 mean lunar hourly,
 heights. The harmonic analysis of these sums gives certain constants,
 which, when divided by the number of strips, are the required tidal
 constants.    It must be remarked, however, that, as the incidence of
 the entries is not exact in lunar time, investigation must be made of
 the corrections arising out of this inexactness.
    The explanation of the guide sheet for lunar time will serve, mutatis
 mutandis, for all the others.
     The zigzags have to be placed so as to bring the columns into exact
 alignment, and T>rinters' types provide all the accuracy requisite.

Accordingly, the computing strips are made to suit a chosen type.
The standard length for one of the 24 divisions on the strips was
chosen as that of a " 2-em English quadrate "; 24 of these come to
9 inches, which is the length of a strip.    I found the English quadrate
a little too narrow, and accordingly between each line of quadrates
there is a " blind rule," of 42 to the inch. The depth of the guide sheet
is that of 74 quadrates and 74 rules, making 15^ in. The computing
strips are   \  in. broad, and 74 of them occupy 14*- in. The excess
of 15 \ above .14$, or -fe in., is necessary to permit the easy arrange
ment of the strips.
   To guard against the risk of the computer accidentally using the
¦wrong sheet, the sheets are printed on coloured paper, the sequence of
colours being that of the rainbow. The sheets for days 0 to 73 are all
red; those for days 74 to 74 + 73, or 147, are all yellow; those for
days 148 to 148 + 73, or 221, are green; those for days 222 to
222 + 73, or 295, are blue ; and those for days 296 to 296 + 73, or 369,
are violet.
   Thus, when the observations for the first 74 days of the year are
written on the strips all the sheets will be red ; the strips will then
be cleaned, and the observations for the second 74 days written in,
when all the guide sheets will be yellow, and so on.
   I must now refer to another considerable abridgment of the process
of harmonic analysis. It is independent of the method of arrange
ment just sketched.
   In the Indian computation forms the mean solar hourly heights
have been found for the whole year, and the observations have been
rearranged for the evaluation of certain other tides governed by a
time scale which differs but little from the mean solar scale. I now
propose to break the mean solar heights into sets of 30 days, and to
analyse them, and next to harmonically analyse the 12 sets of har
monic constituents for annual and semi-annual inequalities. By this
plan the harmonic constants for 11 different tides are obtained by
one set of additions.      In fact, we now get the annual, semi-annual,
and solar elliptic tides, which formerly demanded much troublesome
extra computation.       A great saving is secured by this alone, and
the results are in close agreement with those derived from the old
method.
   The guide sheets marked S and the computation forms are
arranged so that the observations are broken np into the proper
groups of 30 days, and they show the computer how to make the sub
sequent calculations.
   I have also devised an abridged method of evaluating the tides of
long period MSf, Mf, Mm. The method is less accurate than that
followed hitherto, but it appears to give fairly good results, and
reduces the work to very small dimensions.

   Before entering on the details of raj plan it is proper to mention
that Dr. Borgen has devised and nsed a method for attaining the
same end.    He has prepared sheets of tracing paper with diagonal
lines on them, so arranged that when any sheet is laid on the copy of
the observations written in daily rows and honrly columns, the
numbers to be summed are found written between a pair of lines.
This plan is excellent, but I fear that the difficulty of adding correctly
in diagonal lines is considerable, and the comparative faintness of
figures seen through tracing paper may be fatiguing to the eyes.       Dr.
Borgen's plan is simple and inexpensive, and had I not thought that
the plan now proposed has considerable advantages I should not have
brought it forward.
   In the investigations which follow the notation of the Report of
1883 to the British Association on harmonic analysis is used without
further explanation.

   The 24 mean solar hourly heights of water are entered in a
schedule of 24 columns, with one row for each day, extending to n
days ; the 24 columns are summed, and the sums divided by n ; the
24 means are harmonically analysed ; it is required to find from the
results the values of the harmonic constituents.
   The speed of any one of the tides differs from a multiple of 15° per
hour by a small angle ; thus, any one of the tides is expressible in the
form   ifcos [(15°g— ft)t— f ], where q is 0, 1, 2, 3, &c, and /3 is small.
   When t lies between 0h and 24h this formula expresses the oscilla
tion of level due to this tide on the day 0 of the series of days.
   If multiples of 24h from 1 to n— 1 be added to t, the expression gives
the height at the same hour, /, of mean solar time on each of the suc
cession of days.
   Then if ^ denotes the mean height of water, as due to this tide
alone, at the hour t, we have
            l=^ffco8 [(15°2 -0) t-Z + (16°3- p) (n- 1)]

When t is put successively equal to 0h, lh, . . . . , 23h we get the 24
values of b, which are to be submitted to harmonic analysis.
   The mean valae of b, say A„ (not to be confused with A0 as written
at the head of this section, where is denoted the mean sea level above
datum) is found by taking the mean of the 24 values of               f).

   The tidal constants of the several tides enumerated at the head of
this section are determinable from these equations.
   Our rule  is  accordingly to analyse in twelve groups of 30 days,
and then to analyse the resulting harmonic constituents for annual
and semi-annual inequalities, combining the final results according to
the formula just found.
   The edition of " guide sheets " and computation forms which     have         I
drawn up are so arranged as to facilitate the whole process and to
render  it quite straightforward.   By this single set of additions it is
thus possible to evaluate eleven tides and mean water.

   The method of the last section was designed to render all the tides
insensible excepting those enumerated.     But M8      so much larger

                                            is
ought to be corrected.

   Suppose that, when time t is counted from 0d O11 of month t, the
M2 tide is expressed by M cos [(30°— ft)t— £], where ft = 1°-0158958.
   When means taken over 30 days are harmonically analysed the
formula (6) gives the contributions to gu,       As it is now required
to obliterate these contributions, the signs must be changed, and the

   Tlie method of the last section apparently depends on the com
pleteness of the year, yet, with certain modifications, it may be
rendered available for shorter periods.
   We suppose that so much of the year as is available is broken into
sets  of 30 days by the rules of the last section, and that the means
are harmonically analysed.          The results of such harmonic analysis
for month (t) are given in (11) of § 3, but for the purpose in hand
they now admit of some simplification.               It is clear that it is not
worth while to evaluate the very small solar elliptic tides T and R
from a short period of observation. If, then, we denote by P<T> the
ratio of the cube of the sun's parallax to its mean parallax at the
middle of the month (t), the first three terms of the third of (11)
may be included in the expression           PMH",            The last term of this
equation really does involve the solar parallax to. some extent, and
we may, with sufficient approximation, write the third pair of equa

   Let us now consider the value of PW.             The longitude of the solar
perigee is 281° or —79°, and the ratio of the sun's parallax to its
mean parallax is approximately 1 + e, cos (h + 79°), and the cube
of that ratio is 1 + 3 e, cos (h + 79°) or 1 + 0-0504 cos (h +- 79°).
Now h, the sun's longitude at the middle of month (t), is
h, + 15° + 30°t; hence
                     PW = 1+0-0504 cos (^, + 30ot + 94°)
and                  ~    = 1 -  0 0504 cos   (K + 30°t + 94°).
   Thus it is easy to compute the values of 1/PW for the successive
months, when we know Ao the sun's mean longitude at 0* 0h of the
month 0.
   The semi-annual tide, being usually small, may be neglected in
these incomplete observations, and the equations (11) now become

  plete series just given.
       Complete the reduction as        in § 3.
       These rules for reduction do not include the case of 11 months,
  nor the case where any month in the series is incomplete (e.g., if a
   fortnight's observation were wanting in one of the months), because
  these cases may be treated thus : — the ^,'s and $'s return to the same
  value at the end of a year, and therefore the case of eleven months
  is the same as that of a missing month at any other part of the year.
  In both these cases we may interpolate the missing Q's and gj's and
  treat the year as complete.
       If three or more weeks of observation were missing they might fall
 so as to spoil two months, and in this case we should have an in
 complete series.           It is then to be recommended that the equations of
 least squares be formed and the equations solved.                       So many similar
 cases may arise that it does not seem worth while to solve the equations
until the case arises.

      If the available tidal observations only extend over a few months,
it is useless to attempt the independent evaluation of those tides
which we have hitherto found by means of annual and semi-annual in
equalities in the monthly harmonic constants. We will suppose that
30 days of observations are available. Then when we neglect the
annual tide, and the solar (meteorological) tide Si, we have from (11)

30 days be treated quite independently, so that from each group of
days we shall get IT, «' and H„               Then the mean value of
H' cos k is to be taken as the final value of that function, and ZT sin k
is to be treated similarly ; finally H', k are to be fonnd. The several
values of H„ k, may be treated in the same way.             Of course we
assume throughout that itp = k, Hp — ^ff, k" = k„ H" = -ytHi, as
sumptions which are usually nearly correct.
   The mean value of ^ must be taken as giving Ao, but at places
with a considerable annual tide it is impossible to obtain a good
value of mean water mark from a short series of observations.

  Let    abscissas    (fig. 1) measured                     from           0 along A'OA represent
magnitude of a.
 Since a lies between + 4, the limit of the figure is given by
OA = OA' = 4.
  If magnitude    of error (i.e. m.s. — special hour), measured in special
time, be represented by ordinates, a line BOB' at 45° to AOA' re
presents all the errors which can arise in the incidence of the m.s.
12h in the schedule of special time.
   If a line 66' be drawn parallel to and above BB1 by a distance                                    /3,
we have a representation of all the errors of incidence of the m.s. llh.
If a series of equidistant parallel lines be drawn above and below
BB' until there are 12 above and 11 below, then the errors of all the
m.s. hours are represented, the top one showing the errors of the
m.s. 0h and the bottom one the errors of the m.s. 23h.
   Any special hour corresponds with equal frequency with each solar
hour, and hence each mode of error occurs with equal frequency.
   Itis   now necessary to consider in how many ways an error of
given magnitude can occur.        If in the figure AM represents an error
of given magnitude, then wherever MN cuts .a diagonal line,         shows                     it

      As it does not appear worth while to evaluate the tides written
   below the line, no use will be made of the last six results given in

    §  7. On Me periods over which the means are to    be taken in evaluating
                               the tidal constants.
      We have considered in previous sections the treatment of the group
   of tides which are associated with solar time, when the period of ob
   servation is less than a year, and we have now to consider the other
  tides.
      It is important that the means be taken over such a number of
  days that the perturbation arising from other tides shall be mini
  mised.
      The perturbation between semi-diurnal and diurnal tides is always
  negligible. Tt is therefore only necessary to consider the action of the
V tides M* S» in the case of semi-diurnal tides, and that of Ki and 0 for
    :nrnal tides.

  1892.]       facilitating the Reduction of Tidal Observations.          373
      It is easy to see that the influence of a disturbing tide is evanescent
  when the means are taken over a period such that the excess of the
  argument      of the disturbed over that of the disturbing tide has in
  creased    through a multiple of 360°. As, however, we are working
  with integral numbers of days, and as the speeds of tides are incom
  mensurable, this condition cannot be exactly satisfied.
     From this consideration it appears that to minimise the perturbation
  of S2) 2SM, n by M2 (and vice versa) we must stop at an exact multiple
 of a semi-lunation.       To minimise the effect of M2 on N and L, and of
           J
  Kj on and Q, we must stop at an exact multiple of a lunar anom
 alistic period. To minimise the effect of Ma on v, we must stop at a
 multiple of the period 2ir/(a+w — 2i/). To minimise the effect of
 Kj on O, we must stop at an exact multiple of a semi-lunar period.
     For the quater-diurnal tide, MS, it is immaterial where we stop,
 and so it may as well be taken at a multiple of a semi-lunation.
     The following table (p. 374) gives the rules derived from these
 considerations.
                          § 8. On the tides of long period.
     The annual (Sa) and semi-annual (Ssa) tides are evaluated in the
 course of the work by which other important tides are found.           These
 are the only two tides of long period which have a practical import
 ance in respect to tidal prediction, but the luni-solar fortnightly
 (MSf), the lunar fortnightly (Mf), and the lunar monthly (Mm) tides
 have a theoretical interest.
    It will therefore be well to show how they may be found. The
 process is short, and, although it is less accurate than the laborious
 plan followed in the Indian reductions, it appears to give fairly good
results.
    For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the tide MSf. Its
period is about 14 days, and therefore a day does not differ very
largely from a twelfth part of the period.              Accordingly, if about
two days in a fortnight are rejected by proper rales, the mean heights
of water on the remaining days may be taken as representatives of
twelve equidistant values of water height.
    I   therefore go through the whole year and reject, according to
proper rules, the daily sums of the 24 hourly heights corresponding
to certain 69 of the days out of 369.         The remaining 300 values are
written consecutively into a schedule of 12 columns and 25 rows, of
which each corresponds to a half lunation. The 12 columns are
summed, and the sums are harmonically analysed for the first pair of
harmonic components.           These components have to be divided by 24
times 25, or by 600, because the daily mean water height is                of
the daily sum, and there are 25 semi-lunations.
    In the same way the semi-lunar period is about 13^ days, and if

     In this way we             evaluate       the luni-solar          fortnightly and lunar fort
nightly inequalities in the height of the water.
  The period of the moon is between 27 and 28 days, and if we erase
appropriately about one day in eight we are left with sets of 24 values
which may be taken as 24 equidistant values of the daily sums.
Accordingly we erase 46 daily sums ont of 358, and write the 312
which remain consecutively into a schedule of 24 columns and 13
rows, of which each corresponds to a lunar anomalistic period.
  The 24 columns are summed and the sums analysed for the first com
ponents.   Finally, the components are to be divided by 24 times 13, or
by 312. In this way the lunar monthly tide is evaluated.
  But the result obtained in tbis way is, as far as concerns the tide
MSf, to some, and it may be to a large, extent fictitious. It repre
sents, in fact, a residunm of the principal lunar tide Ms.  That this is
the case will now be proved.
   Suppose that t0 is an integral number of days since epoch, being
the time of noon on a certain day ; then the principal lunar tide M2 on
that day may be written HmcoB [2 (7— »)(<b+T)— £„], where t is less
than 24 hours. Then the daily sum for that day will be
                H"                             C°S [2 (7_<7) '0+23         (7_<r)- W"
   Now since to is an integral number of days 2 (7— a)ta only differs
from — 2 —    (it  by an exact multiple of 360° hence the argument
                     17)   to                                              ;

   But the true luni-solar fortnightly tide, which we may denote
iff cos (a1— i/X'o                t)-
                         ?]i varies so slowly in tho course of a day

It thus appears that the residual effect of M2 of exactly the same         is
form as that of MSf. It becomes, therefore, necessary to clear the
harmonic components, determined as described above, from the effects
ofMa.

by the treatment of a series of daily sums, and that 5Ai, £Bt are the

   In the  set of computation forms which       I  have prepared for use on
the present plan, it is shown what days are to be erased for each of
the three analyses, and how they are to be entered              in schedules,
summed, and analysed.
                  § 9. On abridgment  in  the computations.
   It seemed probable that one decimal of a foot would suffice to
express the hourly tide heights.                                 I
                                     In order to test this, Lave taken
several individual days of observation at Port Blair, and have found,
by harmonic analysis, the time and amplitude of the diurnal and
semi-diurnal H.W., first, when the hourly heights are expressed to
two decimal places of a foot, and secondly, when they are only
entered to the nearest tenth of a foot.     I  find that the times of H.W.
agree within less than a minute of time, and that the amplitudes
agree within a fraction of an inch.       If this much be true of indi
vidual days, the difference of results arising from two or one place of
decimals will clearly entirely disappear when a series of days is con
sidered.   Hence, by taking as unit the tenth of a foot, or the inch, or
even two inches at places with large tides, we may always express all,
or nearly all, the heights on which we are to operate by two signifi
cant figures. The adoption of this rule not only saves the writing of
a large number of figures, but also enormously diminishes the labour
of the additions which have to be made.
   It also seemed probable that substantial accuracy might be attained
from the harmonic analysis of only 12 hourly values instead of 24.
In order to test this      I took the tidal reductions for Port Blair,
Andaman Islands (kindly lent me by the Survey of India), and have
compared the results which would have been derived from 12 values
with those actually obtained from 24 values by the computers of the
Indian Survey.      The following tables give the results : —

   The mean discrepancy in the case of the semi-diurnal tides is
0-0022 ft., and the greatest is +0,0068; in the case of the diurnal
tides the mean discrepancy is 0-0026 ft., and the greatest is 0'0089.
   In tidal work results derived from different years of observation
differ far more than do these two sets of results, and hence the ana
lysis of 12 two-hourly values for diurnal and semi-diurnal tides gives
adeqnate results.
   I find  that this abbreviation does not give satisfactory results for
quater-diurnal tides, and the sixth harmonic is not derivable from 12
values.    Therefore, when these tides are to be evaluated the 24
hourly values must be used.
   It will still be necessary to write all the 24 hourly heights on each
computing strip, but when the strips are put into any one of the
arrangements, except where quater-diurnal               tides are required, wc
need only add up the columns 0, 2, 4,             .... , 22, and   may omit the
columns    1, 3, . . . . , 23.

(beginning April 19, 1880) for Port Blair, Andaman Islands.                 I am
thus able to make a comparison between the results of the old method
and of the new. The computation was, in large part, done for me by
Mr. Wright.
    It appeared sufficient to evaluate the tides of the S series and
 those allied with them, the tides of the M series, and the tide Q ; also
 the tides of long period MSf, Mf, Mm.
    The S series test the new process of harmonic analysis of monthly
 harmonic components for annual and semi-annual inequalities.                    I
 chose   M because it is the most important tide, and Q because it puts
 the proposed method of grouping to a severe test, and is very small in
 amplitude.
    In the Q time scale the day is 26h 52m of mean solar time, from
 which it follows that one of the 24 mean solar hourly observations
 may fall as much as 2h 0m away from the exact Q hour to which it is
 reputed to belong.          Thus the hourly observations are arranged in
 wide groups round the Q hours, and the hypothesis involved in the
 method is put to a severe strain.
    Lastly, the results for tides of long period test my proposed
 abridgment.
    It will be seen in the table on p. 379 that the two methods give
 results in close agreement.          There is, however, a sensible discrepancy
                                         I
 in the K2 tide, but in this case am inclined to accept the new value
 as better than the old one.           This tide is governed by sidereal time,
  which differs but little from mean solar time.           Hence, in the Indian

 method of grouping, considerable errors of incidence of the S hours
 in the  K time scale prevail for many days together, and the method
 seems of doubtful propriety.         The same is true of the      P  tide, and here
 also the two methods give somewhat different results.
     The accuracy with which the very small Q tide comes out, whether
 from 24 valnes or only from 12, is surprising, and may perhaps be, to
 some extent, due to accident.           It shows, however, that the present
method may be safely applied, even when the special time scale
 differs considerably from mean solar time.
    The results for the tides of long period are quite as close to the old
values as could be expected.
 § 11.   A  comparison of the work involved         in the new  and old methods of
                                      reduction.
    It has been usual     in the Indian reductions to use three digits in
expressing the height of water, and there have been 15 series, or even
more.     Now 3 x 24 x 365 x 15 is 394000 ; hence the computer has had
to write that number of figures in reducing a year of observation.
This does not include the evaluation of the annual and semi-annual
tides, so that we may say that there have been about 400,000 figures
to write.
    I propose to express the heights by two digits, and they only have
to be written once.       Thus, in the present plan, the number of figures
to write is 2x24x365, or 17,500.                 Thus the writing of 382,000
figures is saved.
    In the old method the computer had to add together                 all the digits
written, say, 394,000 additions of digit to digit.
    I propose to use 24 hourly values in three series, viz., S, M, and
MS, and 12 two-hourly values in eight others. Therefore, the number
of additions will be 3 x 2 x 24 x 365+8 x 2 x 12 x 365 or 123,000. Thus
270,000 additions are saved.

  1892.]     facilitating the Redaction of Tidal Observations.             381
    We may say that formerly there were about 800,000 operations
  (writing and addition), and that in the present method there will be
 abont 140,000.       This estimate does not include a saving of several
 thousands of operations in obtaining the tides of long period.           I am
 therefore within the mark when I claim that the work formerly be
 stowed on one year of observation will now reduce at least five
 years.
    It has been found that the manufacture of my computing strips of
 xylonite is rather expensive, but as it formerly cost in England
 rather more than £20 to reduce a year of observation, the cost of the
 apparatus will be covered by the saving in the reduction of a single
 year, and it will serve for any length of time.
    § 12. On the completion of the record     for short gaps and long  gaps.
    In any long     series of tidal observations there are usually some
 breaks in the record in consequence of the stoppage of the clock of
 the tide gauge, or from some other cause.        Now the process of elimi
 nation by grouping depends essentially on the completeness of the
 record, and it is therefore necessary to fill in blanks by interpo
 lation.
    Such interpolation has not been usual in the operations of the
 Indian Survey, and it might be thought that the complete omission of
 the missing entries is the proper course to take ; but it is easily shown
 that this treatment is exactly equivalent to the assumption that the
 water remained stagnant at mean sea level during the whole time of
 stoppage of the gauge.       It is obvious, therefore, that any conjectural
 values are better than none.
    The process by which it is proposed to interpolate is best shown
 by an example.
    At Port Blair (beginning April 19, 1880) the column of 6h from
days 99 to 112 gives the heights shown in the first column of the
table below.      I suppose that -the tide gauge broke down on day 103,
and only came into action again on day 110.*            There was really no
break down, and the actuality during the supposed hiatus is shown
in the last column but one.
   Now if we look back about a month we find that the water stood
about the same height at the same hour of the day (viz., 6h). Then
the " previous record " (which is complete) beginning at 69d is en
tered in the next column. Similarly a " subsequent record " is found
about a month later, and is entered in a third column. The mean of
the previous and subsequent records is then taken as giving the
values to be interpolated.
   * The  days are here numbered from 1, instead of from 0.  This has been  tho
usage in India hitherto.

382             Prof. G. H. Darwin.         On an Apparatus    for   [Dec. 15,
   The last two columns contain a comparison between the interpo
lation and what in the present case we know to have been actuality.
There is a mean error of 0-20 ft. Thus it is clear that a fair record
may be interpolated even with so long a break as a week.
   In this example I have only shown the interpolation for one
column, but of course all the other twenty-three colnmns would really
have to be treated similarly.
   I find by trial that the result would be a little improved by a
graphical method, but that process is slightly more troublesome than
the numerical one.

   It   may happen that the hiatus is too long for treatment in this
way.    I  do not think it would be safe to treat much more than a fort
night by interpolation.
   It has been shown in § 4 how the tides associated with S are to be
treated where the record is deficient, and it remains to consider the
other tides.
   In § 7 are given the days with which we must stop in the analysis
of an incomplete year, and this table affords us the means of treating
a long hiatus in the observation.
   We may in fact omit all the entries between any two of the
 numbers given in the table without seriously affecting the result.
   Let us suppose, as an example, that the tide gauge broke down on
day 210 and was only repaired and in operation again on day 226.
 Now 210 is 148 + 62, and 225 is 222 + 3.
   Then we see by the table in § 7 that in finding the means for

  M, 2SM, MS, when the computing strips are written for the third
 time, we must remove strips 59, 60, 61 (which have numbers written
 on them) and may leave the remaining strips of that writing which
 are blank.     When the strips are written for the fourth time strips
 0, 1, 2, 3 will be blank, but we must remove strips 4 to 13 inclusive.
  When all the strips are used in a complete year there are 369, and
 this is the divisor nsed in obtaining the harmonic constants, but
 when there is this supposed hiatus we do not use 15 strips of the
 third writing and 14 strips of the fourth writing, so that the divisor
 will  be 340.
    Again, when we are evaluating 0 in the third writing, strips 57,
 58,   59, 60, 61 must be removed, and in the fonrth writing strips
 4 to 9 inclusive.     In a complete year the divisor is 369, but we now
 do not use 17 strips of the third writing and 10 of the fonrth writing,
 so that the divisor becomes 342.
    Again, in evaluating N, L, J, Q, in the third writing we remove
 strips 45 to 61 inclusive, and in the fourth writing strips 4 to 25
 inclusive.    The divisor is reduced from 358 to 303.
    Lastly in evaluating v, in the third writing strips 43 to 61 inclu
 sive are removed, and in the fonrth writing strips 4 to 31 inclusive.
 The divisor is reduced from 350 to 287.
    Any hiatus, be it long or short, may be treated in this way, but it is
clear that if it be short enough to treat by interpolation, it is best to
adopt that method.
        INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE COMPUTING
                                 APPARATUS.
    The apparatus for the reduction of tidal observations, together with
computation forms, can be purchased from the Cambridge Scientific
Instrument Company at a price (as far as can be now foreseen) of
about £8.
    In case of any insufficiency in the following instructions recourse
must be taken to the preceding paper.
           On the degree of accuracy requisite  in the hourly heights.
    It  will usually  be  sufficient if the heights be measured to within
one-tenth of a foot, and the decimal point may, of course, be omitted
in computation.
    This gives amply sufficient accuracy at a place where the semi-
range of the principal lunar tide is 2 ft., and where spring range is
from 6 ft. to 7 ft.
   At some places with small tides a smaller unit might be necessary,
and at others with very large tides a unit of 2 in., or of a fifth of a
foot, might suffice.

384           Prof. G. H. Darwin.       On an Apparatus    for   [Dec. 15,
    Whatever unit of length be taken it is important, for the saving of
 work, and it is sufficient, that all or nearly all the heights should be
 expressed by two digits.
                            Completion   of record.
   If  there is an accidental break in the record, it is very important
that it shonld be completed according to the method shown in § 12,
or by some other equivalent plan.
   The computation forms are drawn up on the supposition that the
 year of observation is complete, but with proper alterations, which
 will now be indicated, they may be used in other cases.
   In § 4 it is shown how to treat the tides of the S group when the
observations have been subject to a long stoppage in the course of the
year, and also when the observations extend over any period from six
months to a year.
   In § 5 it is shown how to treat the S group for a short period of
observation.
   If the stoppage be a long one, the method explained in § 12 must
be adopted for all the other tides.       The same section also shows the
treatment for observations extending over any period, long or short,
less than a year.
                         Entries and summations.
   The computing strips are intended to take writing in pencil or
liquid Indian ink, but not in common ink.
   They are to be cleaned with a damp cloth, and a little soda may be
put in the water if they become greasy.
   Lay the red S sheet on one drawing board and set up the strips
with their ends abutting against the corresponding numbers. The
strip nnmbered 60 is also to be put on the board.
   Write the hourly heights for each day on the strip bearing the
corresponding number, strip 0 for day 0, strip 1 for day 1, and so on
up to strip 73 for day 73. The 24 hourly heights are to be written in
the 24 divisions of each strip, beginning on the left with 0h and end
ing on the right with 23h.
   Remove strip 60.
   Sum the 24 columns formed by the divisional marks on consecutive
sets of 30 strips.   Thus, days 0 to 29 afford 24 sums ; days 30 to 59
afford the second set of 24 sums ; days 61 to 73 afford 24 sums, which
are the beginning of a third 30, to be completed when the second set
of 74 days shall have been written on the strips.
   The numbers 0, 1, 2         , 23, 0, 1,       23 at the head and foot of
the guide sheet indicate the hours corresponding to the columns.
   The sums of the columns on the board are to be entered in the

  1892.]      facilitating the Reduction of Tidal Observations.          385
 corresponding columns of the form " Hourly sums of S series in
 twelve months."
    Lay the red M guide sheet on the other drawing hoard, and
 transfer the strips from the first board to the new arrangement shown
 by the zigzag lines, strip 60 being now reintroduced.
    There will now be 48 columns (more exactly 47, since one of the
 columns will be found to have nothing in it), numbered at top and
 bottom 0, 1, . . . ., 23, 0, 1, . . . ., 23. Each of the 48 columns is to be
 summed from bottom to top (not as for S in groups of 30), and the
sums are to be entered in the form " Sums of series M." The 24
 sums which come from the left half of the board will be entered in
the row marked " red left," those from the right in the row marked
" red right."
    Lay the red N sheet on the other board, and transfer the strips.
    In accordance with § 9, it will now usually suffice to sum only the
columns appertaining to the even hours 0, 2, 4, . . . ., 22 ; as these
hours are repeated twice, there will now be 24 columns to sum.
    The sums are then to be entered on the form " Sums of series N,"
in the alternate columns. The complete form is provided, so that all
the 24 honrly values may be used if it be thought desirable, but this
labour seems unnecessary, at least in a long series of observations.
    Lay the successive red sheets on the vacant board, transfer, sum, and
enter, until all the red sheets are exhausted.
    In the case of S, M, MS the sums of all the columns are necessary,
but in the other eight arrangements only the sums of the alternate
columns, those of the even hours, are usually necessary.         For a short
series of observations it may be best to use all the columns, but in this
case it will certainly not be worth while to attempt the evaluation of
 v, J, Q, fi, 2SM, which are all small in amount.
    If the tides of long period MSf, Mf, Mm are required, the 24
numbers written on each strip must be added together, and the sum
entered in the form
                         "
                           Long period tides —daily sums."
    Clean the strips.
    In exactly the same way work through the next 74 days, from 74d
to 74d + 73d, with yellow guide sheets. Then clean the strips, and
 take another 74 days with green guide sheets, and so on with the
blue and violet.
    In the last (violet) set attention must be paid to the rules as to the
places where the analysis is to Btop in each arrangement.
    If the year of observation is so incomplete that the hiatns cannot
be made good by interpolation, or if the series does not run over the
complete year, the series must stop with one of the days specified in
the table at the end of § 7, and a note must be made of the number of
days used in each series.
    The strips marked for omission on the violet sheets, or those

380              Prof. G. H. Darwin.                  On an     Apparatus for             [Dec. 15,
selected for omission under the rules of § 7, may be hidden by a sheet
of paper when the summations are being made.
   The additions of S, M, MS may be verified by proving that the
grand total of all the numbers (inclusive of omitted strips in S)
written in each of the sets of 74 days is the same in whatever way
they are arranged. Thus, the sum of the 48 columns should be equal
to the sum of the daily sums. An incomplete verification in the other
arrangements, when only half the columns are summed, is found by
showing that the sum of all the hourly sums of each 74 days is nearly
equal to half the grand total of all the numbers written in that period
of 74 days.
    When the guide sheets become worn with many pin pricks they
may easily be patched with adhesive paper.                             There seems no reason
why this patching should not go on almost indefinitely.*
   * It is possible  that   it may be desired     to evaluate the tides 00 and 2~S, for which no
guide sheets are provided.         I  therefore, give instructions for the preparation of guide
sheets  for these    cases.    Thej will be understood by any one who has the set of
guide sheets before     him.     With the instructions given below, the computer might
indeed set up the strips       without a guide-sheet.
   I describe the staircase as descending from left to right or from right to left, and
1 define a short step as being one space down and one space to the left or right, as
the case may be, and a long step as one space down and two to the left or right, as
the case may be. When I say, for example, that a short follows 2, I mean that
2 to 3 is a short step.       The first mark on each sheet is specified by its incidence            in

                             Hourly sums and harmonic analysis.
    Complete the summations in the forms for hourly sums, and copy
into the forms for harmonic analysis. In this copying it will gene
rally suffice if the last figure in the hourly sums be omitted ; for
example, if the observations are entered to the nearest tenth of a foot
the hourly sums will be given in the same nnit, and it will suffice if
tlie hourly sums analysed be written to the nearest foot.
    There are 12 analyses (one for each month of 30 days) for the
hourly sums in S, and one analysis for each of the other 10 arrange
ments. All the forms are provided with spaces for 24 hourly sums, but
in the eight series N, L, v, O, Q, J, /i, 2SM, where only 12 values will
commonly be used, the entries will only be made on the alternate
rows of 0h, 2h, . . . ., 22h. In these cases the divisor 12, which occurs
in the penultimate stage of finding the A's and B's, must be replaced
by 6.
   The large divisors (viz., 369 for M, ft, 2SM, MS ; 369 for 0 ; 358
for N, L, J, Q ; and 350 for v) represent the number of days under
reduction, and must be altered appropriately (see table, § 7) if there
be long gaps in the observations, or if the year be incomplete, or if
the series be a short one.
   If some one of the monthly analyses of S is deficient the missing
^l's and $'s are to be made good by interpolation.'
   It is then necessary to analyse the monthly values of the                  and

  390     On some new Reptiles from     the Elgin  Sandstone.   [Dec. 15,
 narrow.     There is a large pineal fossa in the middle of a spindle-
 shaped area, which area is formed by a pair of parietals posteriorly
 and a single intercalary bone anteriorly.
    The palate is continuous with the base of the skull ; the pterygoids
 on each side send off a distinct process to the quadrate region.
  Towards the front the median part of the united pterygoids arches
 upwards, and the outer sides descend, forming a deep groove;
 from the evidence of other specimens it is clear that the palatines,
 extending inwards, converted this groove into a tube, and thus formed
 the posterior nares. The ramus of the lower jaw is deep, with a
 large lateral vacuity, and the two rami are completely united at the
 symphysis. The back of this skull is not seen; but two other spe
 cimens, referable to this same genus, show that the occiput had two
 post-temporal fossae on each side.
    This specimen is distinguished from Dicynodon by the presence of
two post-temporal fossae on each side of the occiput, by the small size
 of the maxillary tusk ; and probably by the elongated spindle-shaped
 area enclosing the pineal fossa, and also by the slight ossification of
 the vertebral centra.
    A second and much smaller specimen, provisionally referred to G.
 Traquairi, has, besides the skull, a fore-limb well preserved. The
 humerus of this shows the usual Anomodont expansion of its extremi
ties ; its large deltoid crest is angular, and set obliquely to the distal
end.
    Three other species are referred to the same genus, namely : —
    Oordonia Huxleyana, which is distinguished from G. Traquairi by
its proportionately wider and more depressed skull, and by the absence
of the concavity between the orbits which is present in the latter
species.    The humerus has the distal extremity oblique to the deltoid
crest, which was probably rounded and not angular.
    G. Dujjiana has the skull even wider than in G. Huxleyana, and the
portion of a humerus found with this skeleton has the two extremi
ties set nearly at right angles to each other.
    G. Juddiana has an elongated skull resembling that of G. Traquairi,
but the parietal crests are less developed, the bones of the nasal
region are much thickened and overlap the nasal apertures, the small
tusk is placed a little further back and points more directly down
wards, and the pineal fossa is smaller than in either of the other
species.
   A second generic form is named Geikia Elginensis.      This is a skull
nearly allied to Ptychognathus, Owen, but is distinguished by its
shorter muzzle and the entire absence of teeth ; the upper part of the
skull, between the orbits, is also peculiar, forming a deep valley open
anteriorly, with a ridge on each side, the anterior end of which forms
a large prominence above and in front of the orbit.      The occiput has

1892.]     Electromotive Properties    of the  Skin of tlie Eel.        391
only one (the lower) post-temporal fossa open on each side. The
maxilla is produced into a tooth-like prominence, which occupies a
similar position to the tusks of Gordonia ; but the bone is too thin to
have supported a tooth, and in all probability it was covered by a
horny beak. The lower jaw has a strong symphysis, a distinct lateral
vacuity, and the oral margin, at the front of each ramus, bears a
rugose prominence.
   Elginia mirabilis is the name proposed for the skull of a Reptile,
which, on account of the extreme development' of horns and spines,
reminds one of the living Lizards Moloch and Phrynosoma.            The ex
terior of this skull is covered in by bony plates, the only apertures
being the pair of nostrils, the orbits, and the pineal fossa.           The
surfaces of the bones are deeply pitted, as      in Crocodiles   and  Laby-
rinthodonts. The horns and spines, which vary from £ in. to nearly
3 in. in length, are found upon nearly every bone of the exterior.
The development of the epiotics and the arrangement of the external
bones resemble more the Labyrinthodont than the Reptilian type of
structure, while the palate, on the other hand, conforms more nearly
to the Lacertilian type, and, with the exception that the pterygoids are
united in front of the pterygoid vacuity, agrees with the palate of
Iguana and Splienodon.     There are four longitudinal ridges along the
palate, some  of which   seem to have carried teeth.      The oral margin
                                              '
was armed with a pleuroclont dentition, there being on each side
about twelve teeth with spatulate crowns, laterally compressed and
serrated.   With the exception of the smaller number of the teeth, we
have here, on a large scale, a repetition of the dentition of Iguana.
This peculiar skull seems to show affinities with both Labyrinthodonts
and Lacertilians, and is unlike any living or fossil form ; its nearest,
though distant, ally apparently being the Pareiasaurus from the Karoo
Beds of South Africa.
III.  " The Electromotive Properties of the Skin of the Common
      Eel." By E. Waymouth Reid, Professor of Physiology in
      University College, Dundee.         Communicated by Professor
      M. Foster, Sec.R.S. Received November 19, 1892.
                                (Abstract.)
   1.  The assumption that the E.M.F. of the current of rest of the
skin of the Fish is entirely due to mucin-metamorphosis, and that it is
not possible to attribute it to the presence of glandular elements is
negatived, in the case of the Eel, bv the absence of any such mucinous
change in the superficial epidermic cells and by the presence of abund
ance of secretory cells throughout the structure.
                                                              2   D 2

 392      On the  Ungual Corium and    the Ungual Phalanx.     [Dec. 15,
    2. The existence of considerable differences of potential between
 two contacts upon the onter surface of the skin, and the fact that
 such E.M.F. is capable of excitatory augmentation upon mechanical
 stimulation, coincides with the assumption that the E.M.F. of the
current of rest is the outcome of glandular processes of variable
activity and is not compatible with the theory of origin of the E.M.F.
in inucin-metamorphosis.
    3. The reductions in the E.M.F. of the normal rest current follow
ing exposure of the skin to carbonic acid gas and to the vapour of
chloroform, and the subsequent recovery upon admission of air, are
strong evidence that the origin of the E.M.F. is in some active vital
processes taking place in the skin, and it is reasonable to assume that
these occur in its secretory elements.
    4. The demonstration that the E.M.F. of the skin of the Eel under
goes an excitatory variation as a result of electrical, thermic, and
mechanical stimulation, is in accordance with what is known to occur
in other glandular structures, and the fact that such excitatory change
manifests itself as a positive variation of the current of rest agrees in
the main with the phenomena observed in other cases.
    5. The fact that chloroform narcosis excludes the possibility of the
excitatory variation upon stimulation, at the same time as it reduces
the E.M.F. of the normal, rest current to zero, supports the assump
tion that the E.M.F. of the current of rest and that of the current of
action originate in one and the same source.
    6. Finally, the reduction of the E.M.F. of the normally directed cur
rent of rest by atropinisation and the complete absence of any excita
tory variation under such conditions, are facts strongly in favour of
the hypothesis that both the E.M.F. of the current of rest and that of

    The corium underlying the epithelium of the developing nail in the
human embryo is at an early age distinguishable from the cutis vera
of the remainder of the digit by its greater thickness and density.
 Opposite the groove across the dorsal surface of the digit, which re
presents the anterior border of the growing nail, the thick firm con
nective tissue layer constituting the ungual corium does not thin out
or pass into the general corium ; but, still preserving its original
thickness, it sinks deeply into the substance of the digit, and travers

band, with the convexity generally directed forwards, it reaches and
 becomes continuous with the periosteum surrounding the distal ex

corium and the periosteum of the ungual phalanx, which are histo
 logically very similar to one another, and distinct from the connective
tissue forming the bulk of the terminal segment of the digit, are thus
placed in complete continuity by means of the carved band of dense
connective tissue above described.
V. " Experiments on the Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis."
      By H. Marshall Ward, F.R.S., Professor of Botany, Royal
      Indian Engineering College. Received December 15, 1892.
    It  is abundantly        evinced      by experiments that direct insolation
in some way leads to the destruction of spores of Bacillus anthracis,
and in so far the results merely confirm what had already been dis
covered by Downes and Blunt in 1877 and 1878.*
    From the fact that an apparent retardation of the development of
the colonies on plates exposed to light was observed several times
under circumstances which suggested a direct inhibitory action of even
ordinary day-light, the author went further into this particular question
with results as startling as they are important, for if the explanation
given of the phenomena observed in the following experiments turns
out to be the correct one, we stand face to face with the fact that by
far the most potent factor in the purification of the air and rivers of
bacteria is the sun-light.           The fact that direct sun-light is efficacious
as a bactericide has been long suspected, but put forward very vaguely
in most    cases.
    Starting from the observation that a test-tube, or small flask, con
taining a few ex. of Thames water with many hundreds of thousands
of anthrax spores in it may be entirely rid of living spores by con
tinued exposure daily for a few days to the light of the sun, and tiiafc
even a few weeks of bright summer day-light — not direct insolation
— reduces the number of spores capable of development on gelatine,
it seemed worth while to try the effect of direct insolation on pluto-
cultures, to see if the results could be got more quickly and
definitely .f

 for typhoid, and finds the direct rays of the summer Bun quite effective.

394           Prof. Marshall Ward.       Experiments on    the   [Dec.   1 5,
summer soon showed that precautions of several kinds were necessary.
 The direct exposure of an ordinary plate-culture to the full light of even
 a September or October sun, especially in the afternoon, usually leads
 at once to the ranning and liquefaction of the gelatine, and although
 the exposed plates eventually showed fewer anthrax colonies than
 similar plates not exposed, the matter was too complicated to give
satisfactory results.     Obviously one objection was that the spores
might   have  begun   to germinate, and the young colonies killed by the
high temperatures.
    Experiments made in October with gelatine plates wrapped in
black paper, in which a figure — a square, cross, or letter — was cut,
also led to results too indefinite for satisfaction, although it was clear
in some cases that if the plates lay quite flat, the illuminated area
was on the whole clear of colonies, while that part of the plate
covered by the paper was full of colonies.
    But another source of vexation arose. After the plates had been
exposed to the sunlight for, say, six hours, it was necessary to put
them in the incubator (20 — 22° C. was the temperature used) for
two days or so, to develop the colonies, and in many cases it was
observed that by the time the colonies were sufficiently far advanced
to show up clearly, liquefaction had extended so far as to render the
figure blurred and doubtful.
    Stencil plates of zinc were employed with, at first, equally un
certain results. The stencil plate was fixed to the bottom of the plate
culture, outside, and every other part covered with blackened paper :
the plate was then placed on a level surface, the stencil-covered face
upward, and exposed to the direct sunlight.        As before, the gelatine
softened and in many cases ran, and the results were uncertain,
 though not altogether discouraging.
    In November it was found that more definite results could be
obtained, and the problem was at last solved.
    Meanwhile it had already been found possible to obtain sun prints
 in the following way with agar plates. Ordinary agar was heated
and allowed to cool to between 50° and 60° C, and was then richly in
 fected with anthrax spores, and made into plates as usual. Such
 plates were then covered with a stencil plate on the lower face — the
 stencil plate being therefore separated from the infected agar only
by the glass of the plate — and wrapped elsewhere closely in dull
 black paper, so that, on exposure to the sun, only the cut-out figure
or letter allowed the solar rays to reach the agar.
    Such plates were then exposed to the direct rays of the October
sun for from two to six hours ; or they were placed on the ring of a
retort-stand, stencil downwards, and the sun-light reflected upwards
from a plane mirror below.
    After the insolation, these plates were incubated for at least forty

 1892.]          Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis.              395
 eight hours at 20° C, and on removing the wrappers the colonies of
 anthrax were found densely covering all parts of the plate except the
 area — a letter or cross, &c. — exposed to the sun-light.  There, how
ever, the spores were killed, and the agar remained perfectly clear,
 showing the form of a sharp transparent letter, cross, &c, in a ground
 work rendered cloudy and opaque by the innumerable colonies of
anthrax.
    Experiments proved that this was not due to high temperature, for
a thermometer with its bulb next the insolated glass rarely rose
beyond 14° to 16° C, and never beyond 18D C, and even if the
thermometer did not record the temperature inside the plate, this
can scarcely have been much higher.
   As long as this latter point remained uncertain, however, the
experiments could not be regarded as satisfactory; whence it was
necessary to again have recourse to gelatine cultures.     The gelatine
employed began to run at 29° C, and in November it was found that
such plates exposed outside, either to directly incident sunshine, or
to directly reflected rays, showed a temperature of 12° to 13° C. at the
insolated glass surface, and even five to six hours' exposure caused no
running of the gelatine.

 39(5          Prof. Marshall Ward.        Experiments on  the   [Dec. 15,
    The following experiment may be selected as a type of the rest : —
 A (fig. 1) is the upright of an ordinary retort-stand ; on the ring B
 rested a gelatine plate-cultnre of anthrax spores, covered with black
 paper everywhere except the cut-out letter E, seen on its lower face.
 C was an ordinary plane microscope-mirror, with its arm fitted to a
 cork on A.
    The whole was placed in the middle of a field at Cooper's Hill at
 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 30, and exposed to the clear,
 but low, sunshine which prevailed that day, the mirror being so
 arranged (from time to time as necessary) as to reflect the light on
 the E the whole period, until 3.30 p.m., when the plate was removed
 and placed in the dark incubator at 20° C.       On the following Friday
— i.e., after less than forty-eight hours' incubation — the letter E stood
 out sharp and clearly transparent from the faint grey of the rest of
 the plate of gelatine.    Not a trace of anthrax could be fonnd in the
 clear area, even with the microscope, while the grey and almost
 opaque appearance of the rest of the plate was due to innumerable
 colonies of that organism which had developed in the interval.
                                   Fig. 2.
   It was impossible to incubate the plate longer for fear of liquefac
tion, whence the sceptical may reply that the anthrax exposed to
light was only retarded ; the experiments with agar show that such

  1892.]          Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis.              397
  is not the case, however, and that if the insolation is complete the
  spores are rendered incapable of germinating at all, as proved by-
 removing pieces of the clear agar or gelatine and attempting to
  make tube cultures from them : in all cases where insolation is com
 plete they remain sterile.
     The chief value of these gelatine plate exposures in November,
  however, is that they prove conclusively (1) that the rays of a winter
  sun are capable, even if reflected, of killing the spores, and (2) that
 it is really the solar rays which do this directly, and not any effect of
 a higher temperature, since the gelatine remains solid throughout.
     Experience has shown, however, that some precautions are neces
 sary in selecting the anthrax cultnres employed for these experiments
 with gelatine. The light certainly retards or kills (according to its
 intensity or the length of exposure) virulent spores, but if one takes
 the spores, mixed with vegetative bacilli, direct from a thoroughly
 liquefied gelatine culture, or from a bouillon culture, the plates are
 apt to be liquefied too rapidly for the proper development of the light,
print, evidently because so much of the liquefying enzyme is carried
 in when inoculating the plates. The same danger is run when active
bacilli alone are employed.
    The best method of avoiding these disadvantages has been found
to be the following, and it has the additional merit of enabling us to
prove, beyond all doubt, that the ripe spores of Bacillus anthracis are
really inhibited or killed by sunlight.
    A few c.c. of sterile distilled water in a tube are thoroughly
saturated with the anthrax spores taken from an old culture which
has never been exposed to light, and the tube placed for twenty-four
hours at 56° C. ; this kills all immature spores, bacilli, and enzymes,
and leaves us with a crop of the most resistant and fully matured
virulent spores.
     Experiments with such spores have been made to determine the
relative power of the different rays of the spectrum to destroy the
anthrax.
    It is necessary to note first, however, that in experimenting with
the electric light, although but few exposures have been made as yet,
it is evident that its effects are feebler than those of the winter sun.
    At present it has only been possible to observe that the inhibiting
effects are stronger at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red,
and exposures to sunlight passing through coloured glasses confirm
this result ; but the observations are being continued in the hope of
getting a perfectly sharp record of the effects of each set of rays.
    The following series of experiments are quoted in detail, because
they teach several details of importance, in addition to proving the
main fact.
    On December 7 three gelatine plates and five agar plates were

398           Prof. Marshall Ward.       Experiments on   the  [Dec. 15,
prepared with, spores from a very vigorous and virulent agar tube of
anthrax. The spores, ¦which were quite mature, were not subjected
to heat, but simply shaken in sterile water to wash and separate them
thoroughly.
   The three gelatine plates were made at 35° C, the agar plates at
60° C, neither of which temperatures could injure the ripe spores.
   The three gelatine plates were labelled pi, p2, and p 3, and the
agar plates p 4 to p 8 in order.
   Immediately after making the plates, all were exposed to the
December sun, except plates p 4, p 5, and p 6, and this was done as
follows : — In each case the plate had a stencil plate with a cut-out-
letter on its lower face, and arranged as described above (p. 396).
   p 1, a gelatine plate with a large letter M, was exposed, face down,
to the light reflected from a mirror (see fig. 1) for three hours on
December 7, and for four hours on December 8, the interval being
passed in a cold room (t about 8 — 9° C), and then incubated at 20°
in the dark.
   p 8 was treated in exactly the same manner. But this was an
agar plate with a large W.
   p 2, a gelatine plate with a large H, was exposed and heated in the
same way, except that no mirror was used, the latter being upwards
towards the sun.
   p 3, a gelatine plate with a large B, was similarly exposed, face up,
but a plane mirror arranged to reflect light down upon it.
   p 7, an agar plate with a large E, was treated exactly as the last.
   There now remain the three agar plates, p 4, p 5, and p 6, to
account for.
   p 4 was placed forthwith in the dark incubator at 20° C.
   p 5 and p 6 were kept for eighteen hours in a drawer, the average
temperature of which is almost 16° C, and were not exposed till next
day (December 8), when they lay for five hours, face upwards, and
with a mirror above them, p 5 had a small E, and p 6 a broad but
small I, to let the light in.
   After exposure, these also were put in the same incubator with the
others.
   Nothing was visible to the unaided eye on these plates (except p 4)
 until the llth instant, though the microscope showed that germina
tion was proceeding on the 10th.         The plate _p4, however, had a
distinct veil of colonies all over it on the 9th, and this had developed
to a dense typical growth by the llth.
   On December 11, at 10 a.m., the state of affairs, as regards the
exposed plates, was as follows : —
   p 5 and p 6 showed each a sharp transparent letter — E and           I
respectively — of clear agar in a dull grey matrix of strong anthrax
colonies, which covered all the unexposed parts of the plate.

1892.]           Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis.              399
    pl,p2, and p 3 showed in each case a perfectly clear central patch,
about 1£ inches diameter, with anthrax colonies in the gelatine
around.     These anthrax colonies were the larger and more vigorous the
more distant they were from the clear centre.       In other words, the'
anthrax spores had begun to germinate, and the colonies were
growing more vigorously, in centripetal order.
    On p 7 and p 8 germination was beginning, but the colonies were as
yet too young to enable one to judge of the results.
    The first point of interest is to account for the pronounced results
in the plates p 5 andp6, and the want of sharp outlines inpl,p2,
and p 3, and the explanation seems to be that, owing to the plates 5
and 6 having laid over night at 16° O, the spores began slowly to
germinate out, and were consequently in their most tender condition when
exposed to the sunlight next day.
    The peculiar centripetal order of development of the colonies on
plates pi, p2, and p 3 gave rise to the following attempt at explana
tion.    After observing that the clear space in the middle was not due
to the centre of the plate being raised, and the infected gelatine
having run down to the periphery — a possible event with some batches
of Petrie's dishes — it was surmised that the large letters employed
might give the clue.
    This was found to be the case. The solar rays on entering the
plate were largely reflected from the glass lid of the plates, and so
 produced feebler insolation effects on parts of the plate around the
 letter : these effects were naturally feebler and feebler towards the
 margin, and so the inhibitory action became less pronounced at dis
tances further and further removed from the centre.        Those spores,
 therefore, which were nearest the periphery germinated oat first,
and those nearer the centre were retarded more and more in propor
 tion to their proximity to the insolated letter.
    That this is the correct interpretation of the facts follows clearly
from the further behaviour of the above plates.
    At 10 p.m. on the 11th — i.e., twelve hours after the morning ex
amination — the plates pi, p2, and p3 exhibited their respective
letters M, H, and B quite clearly, in the grey matrix of anthrax
 which had rapidly developed in the interval, and excepting a slight
 want of sharpness in the H of p 2, the results could hardly have been
 more satisfactory.
    In p 7 and p 8 the very faint outlines of the letters were also
 showing.
    On the 12th, at 8.30 a.m., the gelatine plates had begun to run, and
although the M of p 1 was still intact, and very well marked, p 2 had
liquefied completely, so that the H was a clear patch with blurred
outlines in the centre, p 3 still showed the outlines of the B, but it
was impossible to keep it longer.

   The main point was definitely established, however, and the treat
ment of the plates proves conclusively that the spores are not killed
by high or low temperatures, but by the direct solar rays.
   These experiments are being continued in order to answer some
other questions in this connexion.
   The gelatine and agar after such exposures as have been described
are still capable of supporting a growth of B. anthracis if fresh spores
are sown on them, whence the effects described are not merely due to
the sub-strata being spoilt as food material.

    "On the Method of Examination of Photographic Lenses at
         the Kew Observatory."         By Leonard Darwin, Major, late
         Royal Engineers. Communicated by Captain Abney, C.B.,
         F.R.S. Received April 13,—Read June 2, 1892.
      The Kew Committee of the Royal Society decided, about a year
   ago, to undertake the examination of photographic             lenses, thus
   adding  one  more  to the already numerous   list of tests and  certificates
   issued by the Kew Observatory.       Captain Abney was the member of
   the Committee who originated the idea, and he was requested to
   organise the system in detail. This he undertook to do, but unfor
   tunately it proved that official duties and his work in connexion with
   colour vision, &c, made it impossible for him to give the necessary time
  to the enquiry. In consequence of this, I was asked by the Kew Com
  mittee, with the full acquiescence of Captain Abney, to give my
  assistance in the matter, which    I gladly consented to do ; eventually
  the arrangements devolved almost entirely upon myself, acting in co
  operation with Mr. Whipple, the Superintendent of the Observatory,
  and aided by consultations with Captain Abney ; but          I  should add
  that as to the arguments and discussion in this paper           I  alone am
  responsible.    A very considerable amount of time and energy was
  expended by Mr. Whipple and myself before the final recommenda
 tions could be made, but now, since ,the whole of the proposals have
 received the provisional approval of the Kew Committee, it is open to
 anyone to get a photographic lens examined at Kew on payment of a
 small fee.
     It is important first to state clearly the general idea which the
 Kew Committee had in view when they undertook this new work,
 for, if the methods adopted are judged from any other standpoint,
 they will, no doubt, be found open to criticism.         The object of the
 Committee was to organise a system by which any one could obtain,
on payment, an impartial and authoritative statement of the quality
of a lens to be used for ordinary photographic purposes, and that the
fee, which had to cover the cost of the examination, should be
moderate.       This latter consideration acted as a serious restriction,
and it was consequently necessary that all the tests should give
results of undoubted practical value to the practical photographer ;
the certificate of examination must be recorded in the way most

404               Major L. Darwin.          On tlie Method         of
generally useful, and in language which could not fail to be under
 stood.  A complete scientific investigation of a lens from every point
 of view would occupy so long a time as to make the necessary fee
quite prohibitive, and, moreover, the results would contain much infor
mation which would be quite useless to the ordinary user of the lens.
    There are undoubted advantages in testing a lens by the examina
tion of negatives made by       it,
                               but     may be here stated, once for all,
                                       it
that the question of expense rendered        impossible, for the present,
                                                it
to adopt any photographic method      eye observations alone have to be
                                        ;
relied on.
    The form of entry      ismade to state for what special purposes the
 lens is  intended, whether for portrait work, for landscape views,
¦or for copying plans,      &c.    Every lens for photographic purposes
                                                                                 in is
 more or less of a compromise. Great rapidity, great perfection
 definition, and power of covering very wide angles are incompatible
qualities, and one or other of them must be sacrificed.            It therefore
                                                                            is
 evidently  unfair   to  expect different types      of  lenses  to  give equally
 good results under the same test for  ;        ifwe select a lens excelling
greatly in one of these qualifications, we must deliberately abandon
the expectation of its attaining the highest standards in the others.
For example, in a portrait lens great rapidity             required, but, on the
                                                              is
other hand, a less high standard of definition near the edges of the
plate can be tolerated than with a landscape lens. No opinion could
possibly be expressed at Kew as to the wisdom of demanding extra
perfection or powers in any respect, and        it     therefore necessary that
                                                         is
the lenses    should   be, to   a  certain extent,   classified   by the parties
sending them in for examination.
    The smaller the aperture of a lens, the larger will be the field             of
sharp definition covered by      it,  and    complete study of         lens would
                                                                        a
                                        is a  properly covered when each of
tell us the size of the plate which
the different stops   is   used.    Considering the restrictions necessarily
imposed on the work, such       a    lengthy examination could not possibly
be thought     of.  Hence,    when    discussing the programme of teste to
be applied at Kew,     it  was soon evident that the time devoted to the
examination      of each   lens   had to be limited by making the person
entering   it  state either the number of the largest stop by which              it
should be judged, or the size of the plate for which             would be used
                                                                   it            ;
on the first supposition the Kew certificate would have given the
size of the plate which the lens covered satisfactorily with the named
stop,; and, on the second supposition,          it would have indicated the
size of the largest stop that could be used to give results up to                a
 certain standard, or the rapidity of the lens in normal cases when
used for the plate of the named size.                The latter of these two
alternatives has been adopted, because         it   considered that the owner
                                                    is
or intending purchaser of the lens will, in most cases, have already

  decided on the size of the plate he intends to use, and that what he
  wants to know is whether it is suitable for that plate or not. When
  further information is desired, the lens may be entered for examina
  tion for two or more sizes of plates.

     In considering        and   in recording the results of examinations, it-
has been found convenient to give more exact meanings to certain
 expressions than have as yet been assigned to them.                        The following
 definitions have therefore been adopted at Kew :                 —
    A narrow angle lens means one covering effectively not more than 35J.
    A medium angle lens means one covering between 35° and 55°.
    A wide angle lens means one covering between 55° and 75°.
    An extra wide angle lens means one covering more than 75°.
    With regard to the wording of the " General Remarks " in the
certificate, it should be remembered that the lens is judged entirely
with reference to a plate of named size ; the lens is therefore classed
as above by the angle of field which is given as the last item but one
in test No. 10. If the same lens is examined for plates of different
sizes, the certificate would be worded differently in each case.

   The  G.I. No. of a stop means the number which indicates the
intensity of illumination produced by it on the plate according to
the system proposed at the International      Photographic Congress of
1889 (see p. 413).
   The largest normal stop means the largest stop that can be used
with the lens so as to produce definition up to a selected standard of
excellence all over a plate of given size, the objects whose images are
seen being all equally distant.
   A slow lens means one of which the largest normal stop has a less
diameter than has C.I. No. 6.
   A moderately rapid lens is one of which the largest normal stop is
C.I. No. 6, or larger than that size and less than C.I. No. 2.
   A rapid lens is one of which the largest normal stop is C.I. No. 2,
or larger than that size and less than C.I. No. 2/3.
   An extra rapid lens is one of which the largest normal stop is C.I.
 No. 2/3, or larger than that size.
   For convenience of reference, these definitions will in future ac
company the certificate, probably in the form of additional notes.
   No doubt most lenses are supplied with stops larger than the ones
here called the largest normal stops, even if it is not intended to use
smaller plates than those under consideration ; this is, of course, very
right, for in many cases the photographer will be willing to sacrifice
the definition near the edge of the plate for the sake of increased
rapidity.
   It now remains to be shown in what way the above certificate of
examination would be useful to the practical photographer, who has
sent his lens to Kew for the purpose of being tested.        It may, we
think, be assumed that he wants answers to the three following           ,
questions  : — 1st. Is the lens a good one P    2ndly. Does it properly
cover the plate of the named size ?         And 3rdly. What exposure
must be given when using the different stops ?
   With regard to the two first questions, the result of the examina
tion is recorded in such a way that he may either rely on the
 " General Remarks," or he may form an independent judgment from
 the results of the tests.
   In order to decide himself, from the records in the certificate,
whether the lens is generally speaking a good one, he should first
look to test No. 13 to see if the definition in the centre of the plate
with the largest stop, is " excellent," as should always be the case ;
he should then consider test No. 15, by which he will see what are
the faults introduced by the lens not being properly corrected for
chromatic aberration. With regard to the second question, that is
to say, when considering whether the plate he intends to use is
properly covered or not, he should chiefly look to the results recorded
 under test No. 13, where is given the size of stop or the rapidity of
                                                           2 b 2

408               Major L. Darwin.       On the Method   of
the lens for a given standard of definition up to the edge of the plate ;
if the definition at the centre is " excellent," then any want of defini
tion at the margin will be chiefly due to curvature of the focal surface,
or to astigmatism, and therefore the results of tests Nos. 12 and 16
should be considered at the same time as test No. 13. He must also
look carefully to the result of test No. 14, which shows the maximum
distortion produced in the image ; it will depend for what class
of work the lens is to be used whether he should consider the
amount of curvature in the image of a straight line near the edge of
the plate, which will be there indicated, is objectionable or not.
    The " General Remarks
                                " are recorded as the result of
                                                                    exactly
similar considerations to those discussed above, the experience gained
by the examination of lenses of undoubted quality giving an idea of
what standard of excellence should be required.
    With regard to the third question, as to the exposure to be given
with the different stops, it may be hoped before long that the C.I.
numbering will be generally adopted by all practical photographers,
in which case the results of test No. 9 will give the information
required.
    In many works on photography the view is expressed that the
practical photographer also wishes to know from what point on his
lens he should measure or adjust the distance of any object so that
by reference to tables, he can obtain definite enlargements or reduc
 tions ; this is, in fact, urging that the position of the principal planes
 should be marked on the mounting of all lenses. According to our
 experience this is a want in reality very seldom felt in practice.
 The tables are, no doubt, sometimes used to get approximate results,
 the fine adjustment of scale being afterwards done by measurements
 on the ground glass ; bat- if the slot between the two lenses of a
 doublet is used as the point from which the measurements of distance
 are made, the results will be quite near enough to the truth to serve
 as a first adjustment, and for this purpose nothing will be gained by
 marking the exact position of the principal planes ; it should,
 however, be stated that the omission to mark them is merely made in
 consequence of the necessity felt of minimising in every possible
 direction the time spent in the examination.
    Each test to which the lens is subjected will now be described in
 detail, together with such discussion as to the reason for its adoption
 as may appear necessary.
    The first four headings of the certificate deal with the numbering
 of the lens, the maker's name, the size of plate for which the lens is
 to be examined, Ac. ; and, as these do not form part of the results of
 the examination, no remarks arc necessary with regard to them.

                      5.   Number of Reflecting Surfaces.
   In most cases the number of reflecting surfaces of glass is known
at once from the type of lens, but, if in doubt, a simple experiment
will settle the point ; the room is darkened, and the reflection of a
lamp is observed in the lenses ; each of the surfaces of the lenses
will give one direct reflected image, and the number can thus easily
be counted.    The amount of light which reaches the photographic
plate  decreases with an increased number of lenses, because of this
reflection, and this circumstance should not be forgotten in estimating
the suitability of a lens for any special purpose.     Surfaces merely
separated by Canada balsam reflect little light, and need not be con
sidered from this point of view.
                             6.   Centering   in Mount.
   Two different errors might be described under this heading : either
(1) the optical axis of a perfect lens may not coincide with the axis
of the mounting, or (2) the axes of the different lenses of a doublet
or triplet may not all be in the same straight line. As to the first of
these errors, we believe it would never be sufficient to have any
appreciable effect on the practical value of a lens, and therefore no
test for it is considered necessary.  With regard to the second error,
Wollaston's test is the only one applied ; this consists of looking at
the flame of a lamp or candle through a compound lens, and noting if
all the different images of the light as seen by successive reflections
from the surfaces of the glass can be brought into line by a suitable
movement of the whole lens, which should be the case if the com
ponent lenses are arranged about a common axis.
   It may be remarked that the nodal points may be shifted away from
the mechanical axis of the lens in consequence of either of the above-
mentioned errors, and also, on the other hand, that the second error
may exist — that the axes of the component lenses of a doublet may
not be coincident — and yet one or both of the nodal points may
conceivably be found on the mechanical axis of the mounting; it
follows, therefore, that to estimate the distance between the nodal
points and the mechanical axis, which has been suggested as a means
of detecting any want of centering, does not answer that purpose very
well.

   Under this heading any faults detected by a careful inspection are
given.
                                   8.   Flare Spot.
   The defect known as flare spot consists of a bright spot or patch of
light being formed in the centre of the field. To detect     the lensit,     is

 placed in an ordinary camera, which should be pointed at the sky ;
 if the ground glass is brought to the principal focus, the flare spot
 is then readily visible.
    For tests Nos. 9 to 16 an apparatus designed by myself, and which
 I   have called the "testing camera," is used.          It is neither an ex
 pensive nor an elaborate contrivance, and there can be no doubt that
 if more money had been expended a more perfect machine could have
 been made.      Until a system of this sort has been in regular use for
 some time, and   until it has stood the fire of criticism, experience shows,
 we think, that the apparatus employed is apt to be little more than a
 good working model of what it will become by future developments ;
 but improvements would in this instance probably tend to increased
 rapidity rather than to increased accuracy, for the results obtained
 are now quite accurate enough for all practical purposes.          Even non-
 alterations are under consideration, such as the substitution of a
 sliding eye-piece on a graduated bar for the long sheet of ground
glass.    For the above-mentioned reasons, and because much expen
diture could not be justified until it was certain that lenses would
be sent for examination in considerable numbers, the Kew Committee
raised no objection to the somewhat make-shift appearance of the
apparatus.
    The general idea of the testing camera is extremely simple, but the
name perhaps is hardly a happy one, as there is no " camera
                                                                          "
                                                                            or
chamber about it. Except for the absence of bellows, it may be said
to consist of the essentials of an ordinary camera, which is capable of
being revolved horizontally about a vertical axis passing through the
lens ; though it must be confessed that this description gives no idea
of its appearance.      The three-legged stool or bench, seen in fig. 1,
represents   the  legs of  the camera, and fig. 2 shows the apparatus
that takes the place of the body ; G is the lens-holder, and LM the
ground glass, both of which are capable of independent movement
backwards and forwards on the hollow wooden beam DE, called the
" swinging beam." There is a conical brass cap or pivot, not shown
in the sketch, under the upper plank of the swinging beam, under
neath where the lens-holder G is shown in the sketch.              The whole
of the apparatus shown in fig. 2 is placed on the top of the
three-legged stool, the round-headed iron pin A passing loosely
through a hole in the lower plank of the swinging beam, and fitting'
into the conical brass cap or pivot.            The swinging beam, being
thus supported by the pin A and by the long arm BC of the stool, is
capable of being revolved round A as a centre.           On the ground glass
is engraved a   horizontal  line, which  is accurately divided into fiftieths
of an inch ; this line passes through the centre of the ground glass
(or through the point where the perpendicular from the lens-holder
cuts the glass), and is also parallel to BC, the top of the stool on

approximately into focus by means of the already-mentioned move
ment to and fro on the swinging beam, but for accurate adjustment a
 slow motion arrangement is attached to the movable part itBelf ;
the handle H gives the required motion, and there is a scale S, called
the
     " focus scale," by means of which these small movements can be
accurately measured.        On the lens-holder there is a movement, corre
sponding to the swingback of an ordinary camera, by which the lens
can be made to revolve vertically round a horizontal axis, without, of
course, any corresponding movement of the ground glass ; there is a
vertical arc, V, by means of which we can read off the vertical angles
through which the lens is rotated. An arrangement is also suppled
by means of which the lens can be moved backwards and forwards on
the movable stand, thus allowing the position of the lens to be so
adjusted that the horizontal axis can be made to pass through any
point in its axis.

    The effective aperture of one or more of the various stops supplied
with the lens is found by a well-known method. The image of a
very distant object is first brought into focus on the ground glass
of the testing camera ; a collimator, which has itself been pre
viously focussed on a distant object, may be used instead of the
distant object ; the ground glass is then taken out and exactly re
placed by a tin plate with a small hole at the centre; this hole,
which should be very small, will, therefore, be at the principal
focus of the lens.         The room being darkened, a gas burner is
placed   behind    the  small   hole, and thus parallel rays, in the form
of a cylinder, are made to issue from the lens towards the front.
A piece of ground glass, with a graduated scale engraved on it, is
now held in front of the lens, and the diameter of the illuminated
disc, or section of the cylinder as seen on the glass, is directly
measured off as any stop is inserted in its place.           Thns is found the

              Examination of Photographic Lenses at Ken:                 413
effective aperture of the largest stop, as recorded in the Kew Certi
ficate of Examination.       The ratio of the effective aperture to the
diameter is the same for all stops of the same lens, and the effective
aperture of the other stops is either measured as above, or calculated
from the ratio thus found. As the rays are parallel when emerging
from the lens, it is evident that, if the stop is in front of all the lenses,
the effective aperture will be the same as the diameter of the stop
itself.
    By imagining the path of the rays in the above experiment as
being reversed, in which case the rays forming the cylinder are all
brought to a focus on the plate, it is evident that the intensity of
illumination of the plate at the centre, when focussed for distant
objects, varies directly as the sectional area of the cylinder, and
therefore as the square of the effective aperture as above measured.
The intensity of illumination of the plate also varies inversely as the
 square of the distance from the point in the lens from which all the
 light may be supposed to emanate, that is, from the nodal point of
emergence.       If we adopt as our definition of the principal focal
length (/) of the lens the length between the principal focus and
the nodal point of emergence, it is then evident that the square of the
effective aperture divided by/2 will be a measure of the illumination
of the plate. In consequence of this fact, it has for a long time been
customary to speak of the diameter of stops in terms of the ratio of
their effective apertures to the focal length of the lens ; for example,
 a lens having a stop with an effective aperture equal to one-tenth of
its principal focal length is commonly spoken of as working with an
intensity of //10. But it has recently been found by photographers that
it is practically useful to adopt a definite standard or unit of intensity
of illumination in order that the different stops may be numbered in
such a way as to readily indicate the different exposures required
with each ; many systems of this kind have been considered : //100,
//10, //4, and//v/10, each having been at various times proposed as
the basis of enumeration, the numbering of the stops sometimes
increasing and sometimes diminishing as the necessary exposure
 increases.    Each of these systems has met with considerable oppo
 sition from different quarters ; but this is not the place to discuss
 their relative merits, more especially as in selecting one of them for
 the Kew certificates, we have been chiefly influenced by considering
which has received the sanction of the most authoritative body, and
which, therefore, stands the best chance of universal adoption. Judged
by this standard, there can be no doubt that the recomendations of
the International Photographic Congress of Paris of 1889, as endorsed
 by the Congress at Brussels, should be adhered to as far as possible.
    The' following system, which we have called the C.I. system, has
 therefore been adopted at Kew.       The stop//10, the effective aperture

 414               Major L. Darwin.           On  the  Method   of
 of which    is one-tenth of the principal focal length of the lens, is
 called stop No. 1 ; and the exposure necessary for any subject
 with that stop is the unit of exposure for that subject.                        The
 other stops are numbered in the inverse ratio of the area of their
 effective apertures to the area of the effective aperture of stop
 No. 1.     Thus stop No. 2 gives half the intensity of illumination of
 stop No. 1 ; and, in any case, to find the time of exposure necessary
 to produce the same result as with the unit of exposure with stop
 No. 1, we multiply that unit by the number of the stop in use.
 The practical rule to find the C.I. number of a stop is to divide
 the square of the principal focal length by 100 times the square of
 the diameter of the effective aperture of the stop.                The principal
 focal length, which we require to know in order to calculate the
 numbering of the stops, is found by test No. 11.
    The difficulty of introducing the C.I. numbering of stops will
 perhaps be greater in England than on the Continent, partly because,
 previous to the Paris Congress, the Photographic Society of Great
 Britain had given provisional support to another system based on/:                 i
as a unit.      The Photographic Society has been waiting for the
recently published reports of the Brussels Congress to reconsider
this matter, and it may be hoped that they will join in the effort to
get the C.I. system universally adopted, notwithstanding the incon
 venience that must be severely felt at first by those who are there
 fore obliged to change their methods.

      Stop C.I. No.          is the Largest Stop the whole of the Opening
         in which can   be seen from the whole of the Plate.
    If a stop, or thin metal diaphragm with a circular aperture, is
revolved round any axis passing through its plane, and if it is
regarded from a little distance, the whole aperture, foreshortened of
course, can be seen except in one position in each half revolution ; if
in a similar way a piece of tubing is revolved about an axis at
right angles to its own axis, there is only one position in which
the whole of the aperture can be seen, and any movement from
this one position will cause the opening to begin to be eclipsed,
thus giving it a lozenge-shaped appearance ; as the movement goes
on, this opening will get smaller and smaller till it is quite obli
terated.     In looking through a lens as it is revolved about an

                 Examination  of Pliotographic. Lenses  at Kew.          415
    axis perpendicular to its own axis, it mil bo seen that, as a rule,
    something between these two extremes occurs ; commencing from
    a  position when we are looking directly along the axis, no other
   result than foreshortening the opening is at first produced by the
   revolution of the lens ; then comes an angle at which the aperture
   in the stop begins to be eclipsed, either by the mounting of the
   lenses, or by fixed diaphragms, &c. ; lastly, we come to an angle
   at which the lozenge-shaped     opening appears to vanish, and no light
   is seen to come from the lens.       It is obvious that the intensity of
   illumination of different parts of the photographic plate varies with
   the size of the aperture visible from each point ; and, neglecting other
  considerations for the present, there is thus an inner cone, forming a
  disc where it cuts the plate, in which the illumination          decreases
  regularly from the centre outwards according to a known law : and
  there is an outer cone, forming an annulus between where it and the
  inner cone cut the plate, in which the illumination decreases more
  rapidly than according to the above-mentioned law ; very rapidly,
  therefore, probably irregularly, ^n account of the aperture of the
  stop being successively eclipsed by different parts of the mounting,
  and certainly according to no law that can be readily stated or ascer
  tained.     The test now under consideration gives the angles of these
  two cones.
      The outer cone, which we have called the " cone of illumination,"
 gives the extreme angle of the field of the lens without regard to
 definition, and is what is known to French authors as the champ de
 visibility.    To find the angle of the cone of illumination, the lens is
 placed in the testing camera, and the observer looks through the
 small hole in a sheet of tin plate with which the ground glass has been
 replaced, as in the last test ; the lens-holder is made to revolve about
 its horizontal axis, and as the axis of the lens moves away from zero,
first in one direction and then in the other, the positions at which all
 light appears to be cut off are noted ; the angle between these two
positions as read on the vertical arc, V, gives the angle of the cone
of illumination.
      In order to ensure correct results it is necessary that the axis of
rotation should pass through the nodal point of emergence. If in fig. 3
AN2Nio. and BNaNi& represent the extreme rays forming the cone, Na
and     Ni being the nodal points, it is evident that in order to measure
the angle fcNia of the cone the lens must be revolved about Ni, the
nodal point of emergence, as a centre.        The necessary adjustment is
made in the following manner:       —  The image of a distant object having
been thrown on the ground glass, the lens is turned through a small
angle about the horizontal axis, the glass remaining stationary.          If
the movement of the lens gives rise to any movement in the image,
then the axis does not pass through the nodal point of emergence

and an adjustment is necessary ; this is done by moving the lens-
holder in or oat, thus making the axis of rotation pass through different
parts of the axis of the lens, until the image ceases to show any
movement ; and this can only be the case when the axis of rotation
does pass through the nodal point of emergence.         As far as the above
considerations are concerned, it is immaterial how far off the small hole
 in the tin plate is from the lens, but if the horizontal axis has not been
 made to pass accurately through the nodal point of emergence, this want
of adjustment will have much the same effect as a small vertical move
ment between the two readings of the vertical arc. It is evident that
the angular error thus produced will diminish as the distance of the
 point of observation increases ; moreover, any distortion at the edge
 of the plate will make the above theoretical considerations no longer
 strictly applicable, and will have the same effect as the axis of rota
 tion not accurately passing through the nodal point. In order, there
 fore, to minimise these sources of error, the tin plate with the hole in
 it is removed as far as practicable from the leus before the observa
 tion is made.
     The angle of the inner cone, that is, of the cone outside which the
 opening of the stop is partially eclipsed by the mounting of the lens,
 &c., is measured in the same way as above described for the outer
 cone, and with the same precautions.          When looking through the
 small hole, the positions on each side of zero at which the aperture
 begins to be shut off, and beyond which it no longer appears as a per
 fect ellipse, are easily seen, and the angle between these two positions
  as measured on the vertical arc gives the angle required.      The angles
  of these two cones are generally given when the observation is made
  with the largest stop supplied with the lens.
     The results of these measurements should be considered in connex
  ion with test No. 17, under which heading the general question of
  the illumination of the field will be discussed.     In order to facilitate
  the consideration of the covering power of the lens, the
                                                                diameters of

 the circles which these cones make by cutting the photographic plate,
 when the focus is adjusted for distant objects, are given in the Certifi
 cate of Examination.     Having found tho principal focal length in the
 manner     to be described   immediately, the size of these circles can
 readily be ascertained by a simple graphical method, which is hardly
 worth describing in detail.
    In connexion with this     test it may be convenient to adopt the use
 of the term angle of field under examination, (denoted in this paper by
 20,) to signify the angle subtended at the nodal point of emergence
 by a diagonal of the plate,- or the greatest angular distance which
 could be included in the photograph, supposing the focus to be taken
 on a distant object.    This angle is found by the graphical method
 mentioned above for determining the diameter of the circles on the
 plate, and the result is entered on the Certificate of Examination.
    If  the illumination of the field is not to fall off rapidly towards the
 edges of the plate, for the normal use of the lens we should employ
 a stop which covers (or nearly covers) the plate of the given size
 with its inner cone ; that is to say, we should use a stop not larger
 than the largest stop the whole of the opening in which can be seen
 from the whole of the plate. In order to find the largest stop which
 fulfils the above conditions, the lens is revolved about the horizontal
 axis until the vertical arc reads half the angle of field under exami
 nation, and then the different stops are put in one by one until the
 largest one is found which is seen not to be eclipsed when the observ
 ation is made through the hole in the tin plate. The number of this
stop is recorded in the certificate.
    The readings taken when measuring the angles of these cones are
also utilised for the purpose of adjusting the position of the lens in a
 manner necessary to ensure accuracy in several of the following tests.
The vertical arc is so arranged that it reads zero when the axis of
the lens is horizontal, that is to say, when the axis passes through the
small hole in the tin plate from which the observation is made ;
hence the two readings on the arc when the lens is revolved about
the vertical axis, first one way and then the other, so as just to cut
off all the transmitted light, should be exactly the same ; if they are
not identical the lens-holder is placed in such a position that the
reading on the vertical arc is equal to half the difference between
them ; then it is evident that the mechanical axis of the objective
passes through the small hole, or at all events, cuts the tin plate on
the same level as the hole. Now this small hole in the tin plate is
in the same position as the centre of the engraved line when the
ground glass is in position. Hence, this adjustment being made, in
future tests we may consider that the mechanical axis of the lens cuts
the line on the ground glass near its centre.

  11.  Principal focal length =          ins.
      Back focus, or length from the principal focus         to the nearest pm,it
         on the surface of the lenses =          ins.
     The following is the method of finding the principal focal length
 with the testing camera.       By means of the mark 0 (see fig. 1), on the
 three-legged    stool, the swinging beam can be brought approximately
 to a central position ; there are also two iron stops, T and T", remov
 able when not wanted, which, when in position, prevent the swinging
 beam from passing beyond these points. These stops (or, more accu
 rately, the iron plates on the swinging beam with which they come
 in contact) are capable of adjustment, andthns a means is obtained of
 allowing the beam to be revolved about A as a centre, through a
 known angle, with great ease and accuracy. After the focus has
 been very carefully adjusted for a distant object, and after the beam
 has been brought approximately to the central position by means of
the mark 0 on the stool, the image either of some well-defined object
seen through a hole in the window-shutters, or of a mark in the
collimating telescope, is made to appear on the centre of the engraved
line on the ground glass ; this can be done by raising or lowering one
or more of the legs of the stool or by moving it laterally ; this
adjustment being accurately made, the line joining F, the centre
of the ground glass, and the centre of the lens, if prolonged,
will pass through the distant mark; when once made, this adjust
ment will hold good, with sufficient accuracy, for all lenses which
may subsequently be placed in the testing camera.                Now, when the
swinging     beam   is  moved  from   side  to side,  the image appears to rnn
along the engraved line on the ground glass ; the position of the
image is first noted when the beam is in contact with the stop T, and
afterwards when in contact with the stop T' ; twice the distance, as
measured on the scale, between these two points gives the principal
focal length of the lens under examination.
    In order to ensure accuracy, certain precautions must be taken.
The object must be so far off that the distance between its focus and
the focus of a point in the same direction at an infinite distance is
considerably less than the probable error of observation. The chief
difficulty of finding the principal focal length, in the Kew method,
and, indeed, in all methods, consists in obtaining an accurate adjust
ment for focus ; and since, for a given error in focus, the greater the
aperture the more diffusion there is in the image, the largest stop
should always be used when focussing ; but there is no objection to
slipping in a smaller stop after the focus is taken so as to obtain as
sharp an image as possible, and thus make it easier to read the posi-
                     with accuracy.
                      that the result above obtained is, in fact, the prin

 cipal focal length of the lens, it may be as well to give a rigid defini
 tion of what is here meant by that expression, as it has often been
 used in somewhat different significations. The definition here adopted
 of the principal focal length is the distance between the principal
 focus for visual rays (or the image as seen by the eye of an infinitely
 distant point on the axis of the lens) and the nodal point of emergence.
 The use of the term nodal point is, perhaps, open to criticism ; under
 the ordinary circumstances of a photographic lens the nodal points
 and the principal points occupy the same positions, and therefore
 either of these expressions might have been used in the definition ;
 but if we take into consideration any imaginary circumstances when
 these two points would not be identical, as, for instance, if one end of
 the lens was immersed in water, it will be observed that the Kew
 method of determining the principal focal length would find the dis
 tance between the nodal point and the ground glass, and not that
 from the principal point ; moreover, under these imaginary condi
 tions, it would be the distance of the nodal point from the plate which
 would chiefly be of value to the aquatic photographer, for the in
 tensity of illumination of his plate would vary as the square of that
 distance and not of the distance from the principal point.        But it
 must be confessed that the term was, in reality, adopted because it is
 that best known in the photographic world, and not on account of
 such  hair-splitting reasons as these.
    It now remains to be seen if the Kew method does give the true
 principal focal length according to the above definition. In fig. 4, let

it; let Ni and N3 be the nodal points ; let C, F, and B' be the images

 of these three points on the ground glass, when, if the distance N5A.
 is great enough, F will not be further from the principal focus than
 the error of observation, and may, therefore, be confounded with it.
  The angle, BN2C, subtended by the points B and C at the lens, can
 easily be measured, and, since the incident and emergent rays passing
 through the nodal points are parallel to each other, the angle C'N,B'
 is thus obtained ; the distance, C'B', that is, the distance between the
 images of the two outside points, can be also measured on the ground
 glass : C'B' and C'N,B' being given, FN\ can therefore be found ; for
 since, by supposition, the line AN2 bisects the angle BNSC, FSi is
 equal to C'B'/2 cot C'NiB'/2.       This, therefore, is a method by which
 the principal focal length, as defined above, can be measured.           But
if,  instead of having objects at known angles, only one object                              is
 observed, and the camera        isrevolved round the point ~SU through
 the angle C'NiB' between           the observations, exactly the same
 result can be obtained this ;         the method adopted at Kew.
                                      is                                  The

 neglected.   The   advantage   of   this method      that   collimating tele

 scope can be used as the object, and thus, during dull weather, the
 work can be carried on indoors. In working with the testing camera,
 the angle C'N\B' represents the angle through which the swinging
beam  is  revolved about the vertical pivot; the stops are arranged so
that C'N^F = tan-1        that is, so that C'B' =       FN",  and, therefore,
                                                                 2       ;
twice the distance C'B' measured on the ground glass gives FNj,
the principal focal length of the lens. The Kew method, therefore,
gives the result required.
    It might at first sight appear that considerable error would be
                                                 a
due to the fact that the adjustment to the central position            merely      is
made by a rough mark, and that              is only the total angle C'N^B'

stops) which    is  accurately known.       It     true that it can only be

less than 90°, and     the line N,F does not differ in direction from the
true central position by more than 1°, then the principal focal length
obtained in this manner does not differ from the truth, for this reason,
by more than l/17th per cent. As             it  considered that this would
                                                  is
represent   an  extreme case,     it   istherefore evident that this                    is   a
negligible source of error.
   In order that the Kew method of finding the principal focal length
should not be open to any criticism on theoretical grounds, three
conditions must be fulfilled:     it    obvious that these conditions need
                                       is
not hold good further from the axis of the lens than the points at
which the observations were made.          1st. The principal focal surface,
or the locus of the focus for very distant objects, must be a plane.
2nd. The image must not be distorted.             3rd. The nodal point of

               Examination of Photographic Lenses at Kew.             421
emergence for visual rays should be the same as the nodal point for
 actinic rays.
     In no lens are these conditions perfectly fulfilled, but before dis
 cussing the nature of the errors thus introduced it may be as well to
 consider shortly for what purposes and with what degree of accuracy
 the practical photographer wants to know the focal length of his
 lens. Two uses to which this knowledge would or could be put have
 already been mentioned, and we know of no others.           In the first
 place, it has been shown how the numbering of the stops depends on
 the focal length, and how advantageous is the knowledge of the
 intensity of the illumination of the plate which may thus be gained.
 But as, on account of the difference in the amount of reflection and
absorption of the lenses, two lenses with the same C.I. number of
 stop may differ more than 10 per cent, in the intensity of illumination
 in the centre of the field, as in the same objective the difference of
 illumination of different parts of the field is generally more than
 20 per cent., and as the photographer is seldom able to estimate his
 unit of exposure within this latter percentage, it can hardly be
seriously contended that the focal length must be known with very
 great accuracy for this purpose.      The second object for which the
 photographer may require to know the focal length is for the use of
 the tables in which the distance is given at which the object has to
 be placed to obtain a given enlargement or reduction ; it has already
 been stated that this is not, we believe, a want often felt, except for
 getting approximate results; but if the focal length is used for final
 adjustments in this manner, it should be kno wn with very consider
 able accuracy.
     With regard to the first condition, as to the focal surface being a
 plane, it should first be stated that it is found convenient at Kew to
 bring the ground glass into focus when the swinging beam is in con
tact with one of the stops, thus insuring the greatest sharpness of
image at the points of observation ; that is to say, in fig. 4, the prin
 cipal focal surface is made to pass through the points B' and C, and,
 if it is not a plane, it may be represented by the dotted curve C'F2B'.
 Under these circumstances, therefore, the principal focus will be at
 F2, and N,F2 will represent the principal focil length according to
our definition ; but it has been shown that the observation gives N]F
as the focal length, thus introducing an error equal to FF2 in the
result. It is to be observed, however, that with a lens giving a
markedly curved focal surface, the photographer, in order to get a
general minimum amount of diffusion, would adjust his focus by
looking at the image at a point somewhat more than half way from
the centre to the margin of his plate : for example, with a lens
covering 50° or 60°, he would focus at a point some 15° from the
centre, or at about the position where the Kew observation for the
    vol. mi.                                                   2 F

 422             Major L. Darwin.         On  the Method of
 focal length is taken; thus, with such a lens, C'B', in fig. 4, would
 represent the position of the photographic plate ; and it is evident
 that, for all questions of illumination or enlargement, N,F, or the
 distance from the plate to the point from which all the light may be
 snpposed to emanate, should be introduced into the calculations, and
 will give the true results, or, at all events, more nearly the truth than
 if N^Fs, the true principal focal length, had been used in its place.
 Thus, by recording the length N|F in the Certificate of Examination,
 we always give more nearly what the photographer practically wants
 than if the length NiF2, or the true principal focal length, had been
 ascertained.  But in any case the point raised in this paragraph could,
 if thought desirable, be met by focussing the plate in the centre of
 the field when the observation for focal length is made.
    The second point raised, as to the theoretical correctness of the
 principal focal length as found at Kew, is with regard to the distor
tion of the image, which may be described as the results due to the
 theory of the nodal points being not strictly applicable except near
                                    Fig. 5.
the centre of the field.    In fig. 5, let N, and N2 be the nodal points,
F   the principal focus, and B" and C" the images of the infinitely
distant points B and C ; if there is distortion, the lines SB" and SC",
drawn parallel to the incident rays, do not cut the axis at N"i, the
nodal point of emergence; let these lines cut each other at S, which
may be called the principal point of similitude with regard to the
images B" and C".      This construction represents the Kew method of
observation, and therefore SF is the distance found as the principal

              Examination of Photographic Lenses at Kew.                423
focal length, thus introducing an error equal to ISNi       in the result    ;
the focal length given is, in fact, the distance from        the   principal
focus to the principal centre of similitude for the part of the plate
where the observation is made.         But here again, since BNjC, the
cone of incident rays, is spread over a disc on the plate of which
B"C" is the diameter (and not B'C), the meau intensity of illumina
tion of the plate between these points will vary inversely as (SF)2;
and, if the plate covers an angle larger than BN3C, the C.I. numbering
of the stops will give a better indication of the relative exposure on
the assumption that SI1 is the principal focal length than if the true
value NtF is introduced into the calculations.       Thus, what has been
given  in the  Certificate of Examination will again be nearer what is
practically required by the photographer than if the true principal
focal length has been recorded.       If, however, the lens is intended to
be used for enlargements or reductions, and the final adjustment of
the distance of the object is to be made by reference to tables, then,
no doubt, the true principal focal length must be accurately given ;
but no photographer would ever use a lens showing sensible distor
tion within 15° of the axis, for such purposes, for, if he did, the ratio
of the enlargement or reduction would vary sensibly in different
parts of his plate ; and, if there is no distortion within this distance
from the axis, S and Nj will be coincident, and the Kew method will
give accurately and truly N,F as the principal focal length. Thus, in
the only circumstances under which the principal focal length is
practically wanted with theoretical truth and great accuracy, it is
seen that. the results given in the Kew certificate do answer these
requirements.
    The third condition that has been laid down as being necessary
before the Kew method gives theoretically correct results is that the
nodal point should be the same for white light as for photographi
cally actinic rays.     This may be hypercritical, but if, in fig. 5, C"
and B" represent the images as seen on the photographic plate, C
and B' those seen by the eye on the ground glass, Ni the mean posi
tion of the nodal point of emergence for visible rays, and S the
mean position for actinic rays, then it is evident that FN! will be the
principal focal length found by the observation, whereas SF will be
the quantity required in calculations with regard to enlargements or
illumination.    If  the lens gives any distortion, Ni would represent
the centre of similitude for visible rays and S that for photographi
cally actinic rays ; the condition might, therefore, have been more
rigidly defined by stating that the point of similitude for visible rays
and that for actinic rays must occupy identical positions for parts of
the field between the points of observation. As far as can be judged,
this is a negligible source of error in all cases.

424             Major L. Darwin.       On  the Method   of
14§° on each side'of the axis, has been adopted at Kew in order that
any error in the measurements on the ground glass may produce a
small proportional error in the results. But it should be observed
that, the smaller this angle, the less will be the errors just discussed,
and by lessening the angular movement these errors can be reduced
to any extent, but only with a proportional loss in the general
accuracy of the results obtained.
    This is not the place to enter into a general discussion on
focometry, but a few words to justify the choice of the Kew method
may perhaps be permitted.        Many of the known means of finding
the principal focal length depend in principle on measuring the
relative size of the object and the image, and the foregoing remarks
on the errors involved are more or less applicable to them, thus
showing that they are open to the same criticisms on theoretical
grounds as the work at Kew.        Many methods of focometry have to
be rejected because they do not measure the distance from the nodal
point, and others are unsuitable because the calculations or successive
adjustments involved, render the operation too lengthy. There are
no doubt many instruments, as for instance that devised by Professor
Silvanus Thompson, which do give the true focal length as measured
on the axis with theoretical accuracy, but these have not, as a rule,
been specially designed for photographic          lenses.   One method,
which is hardly open to criticism on theoretical grounds, may be
mentioned in a little greater detail as being that specially recom
mended by the International Congress of Paris ; this is the elegant
plan which Commandant Moessard proposes to cany out by means of
his instrument, called the Tourniquet, which is described in Wallon's
'
  Traite elementaire de l'Objectif Photographique,' and elsewhere.
Advantago is taken of the principle that if a lens is revolved about
an axis passing through the nodal point of emergence, the image of a
distant point will not appear to move if seen through a fixed eve-
picce ; thus, by successive adjustments and trials, the lens can be so
 placed that an axis does pass through the nodal point ; and, by
 measuring the distance between this axis and the focus of the eye
 piece, the true focal length can therefore be obtained.            Since
 a movement    can be detected before it can be measured, a smaller
 angular  movement    is required with this method than with the Kew
 testing camera, and therefore, as far as distortion is concerned,
 greater, but not absolute, theoretical accuracy is obtained.      As for
 the coincidence of the visual and 'actinic centres of similitude, better
 theoretical results are only obtained by this method on the assump
 tion, which is probably a true one, that these points approach each
other as the point of observation gets nearer the axis.
    By taking observations some 14° away from the axis of the
 lens, we conclude, therefore, that we obtain the most rapid and

accurate method of focometry, and, in the case of the image within
this limit being distorted, that the focal length thus obtained, even
though it is not identical with the principal focal length measured on
the axis, is what the photographer in reality wants to ascertain.  The
Kew method is, therefore, wo believe, open to no criticism on theo
retical grounds as far as the value of the results is concerned.
     Under the same heading as the principal focal length is also re
corded the " back focus," or the length, from the ground glass surface
to the nearest summit of the lenses, when the focus is adjusted on a
distant object. The difference between the principal focal length and
 the back focus therefore gives the distance of the nodal point of
emergence from the inner summit of the lenses, thus enabling any
 one to mark the place where the principal plane cuts the mounting.
 In symmetrical lenses, which are generally used for plan work, the
 position of the principal plane of incidence, or the point from which
 tbe distance of the object must be measured when regulating en
  largements, can also be marked ; for it then occupies the same rela
 tive position with regard to the furthest summit of the lenses (that
 is, to the outside end of the lens) as the nodal point of emergence
 does to the inner summit of the lenses.

   The following is the method of finding the curvature of the
principal focal surface. The image of a distant object (or of the
collimating telescope) is thrown on that point on the ground glass

so that the image comes successively to positions at convenient in
tervals from the centre of the plate, and on each occasion the focus             is
adjusted afresh, and the focus scale read off. By subtracting the
central reading from these outer readings, the results recorded in the
Certificate of Examination are obtained.
   But a mere observation of the curvature of the focal surface does
not at once indicate how serious      the evil effect of this defect in the

appear on the plate as a disc, except on the circle or at the point
where the principal focal surface either cuts or touches the plate.
If the photographic plate is in the position M'F', such that it bisect
ed, then the discs of diffusion will be greatest at the centre and at the
margin of the plate ; and any movement of the plate from this position
will increase the size of the disc at one or other of these places ; if the
 photographer adjusts his focus so as to produce the best general focus,
eg (= c) will therefore be the diameter of the largest disc of diffu
sion on his plate.     Assuming that this position of the plate has been
adopted,   and   that   the lens gives no distortion, then, by similar
triangles, it can be seen that : —

Hi

 428              Major L. Darwin.      On the Method of
    When judging the quality of a lens hy means of the results given
 in this test, the above table may also be used in the following
 manner : — Decide on the valae of S (the diameter of the greatest
 disc that will be tolerated in the image of a point), and find, from
 the results recorded in the Certificate of Examination, the difference
 of focus, /t, between the centre and the extreme corner of plate ; then,
 knowing these two quantities, the table at once shows what is the
 C.I. number of the stop that can be employed under these conditions,
or, in other words, with what rapidity the lens will work.
    It may also be remarked that this table gives for any part of the
plate, and for stops of given size, the radius (e) of the image of a
point after the plate has been removed a distance, ft, from its proper
focus in either direction, the movement being measured in a direc
tion perpendicular to the plane of the plate.
    According to the recommendations of the International Congress,
lenses should generally be supplied with stops, numbered according
to the proposed system, in the following series : 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
(34, &c.   I should have thought that the series, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30,
60, &c, would have been more convenient for the purposes of mental
arithmetic ; for example, with the two last stops in this series, the
exposure would be the same multiple of the half minute or minute
that the unit of exposure is of the second. Both series have therefore
been included in the above table.
   The results recorded in the certificate under this heading may
possibly also be useful to the photographer in another way, by enabling
him to decide approximately what part of the ground glass he should
use when focussing.      In fig. 6, let k be the point where the plate
M'F' cuts the principal focal surface when in the position which
has been proved to give the best general focus ; hence the image will
be perfectly sharp at k, and conversely, if the focus is adjusted by
looking at the point k on the ground glass, the plate will be brought
to the position M'F' required; but since kl is half cd, there is no diffi
culty by interpolation or plotting to find the approximate position of
k for any given distance of the point c from tho axis.      Look in the
Certificate of Examination for cd, the difference of focus between the
centre of the plate and its margin, find in the above manner the posi
tion of k, where the difference of focus from the centre is only half
cd, and we get the point on the ground glass which should always be
used when focussing with all stops, if it is desired to get the best
general focus.

         No.       gives     definition over the whole of a          inch     by
               inch plate.
   The . system by which the defining power is measured consists
in ascertaining what is the thinnest black line of which the image
is just visible, the test being conducted in the following manner.
 The test object consists of a thin straight strip of steel, about
O'l inch wide, and about an inch long ; it is capable of being
rotated about an axis in the direction of its greatest length, thus, if
seen against a bright background, making it appear as a black line
of varying width ; when presented edgewise to the objective, it is so
thin that the image becomes invisible ; and there is an arc so gradu
ated that the angle subtended by the two edges of the strip at the
lens can be at once read off, thus giving a measure of the apparent
thickness of the line. The test-object is placed as far as possible
from the lens in a darkened room (at Kew the accommodation in this
respect leaves much to be desired), and beyond it is a ground glass
screen illuminated by a lamp.
   In order to test the defining power of a lens in the centre of its
field, the focus is first very carefully adjusted on the ground glass,
and the test-object is then slowly revolved from the edgewise position,
where its image is invisible, until the first appearance of a dark line
can be seen against the bright background ; the angular width of the
line is read off, and is noted as a measure of the defining power of
the lens in the centre of its field.  The light of the lamp is regulated
so that the image of the line can be seen as soon as possible.
   Besides measuring the defining power where the axis of the lens
cots the focal surface, an observation is also made at a point repre
senting the extreme corner of the plate of the size for which the lens
i8 being examined, that     at a distance from the centre equal to half
                             is,
the diagonal of the plate. As the object of this second test         to  is
measure the general definition over the whole plate, the focus   taken
                                                                    is
at a position half-way between the point of observation and the axis
of the lens, this being the method generally adopted by practical pho
tographers when desirous of getting the best general focus.       It          is
necessary, moreover, that the test-object should be so arranged that
the steel strip makes an angle of 45° with the horizon for, since the

 4   30           Major L. Darwin.      On the Method     of
 after another, beginning with the largest and going on to smaller
 ones,  nntil the image of the black lino on the bright ground is first
just visible ; the C.I. No. of the stop with which the lens gives defini
 tion up to a known standard at the extreme corner of the plate ia
thus ascertained, and, as it may fairly be assumed that the definition
will be no worse than this at any other part of the plate, it follows
that the defining power over the whole plate comes up to or exceeds
the standard selected.
    It cannot be denied that the defining power is the most important
quality of a photographic lens for almost every purpose, and yet the
best method of testing definition has never been satisfactorily dis
cussed or considered.     If a thoroughly good test could be devised, it
would be hardly necessary to examine at'Kew for curvature of field or
for astigmatism, for these defects are only hurtful in so far as they
affect definition.   But it must be confessed that the method above
described is open to some objections, and the following discussion
is merely intended to show that it is the best that could at present
be devised.
     In considering this question, it    was natural that attention should
 first be turned to the excellent arrangements adopted at Kew for
 testing the definition of telescopes.       The method generally used,
 especially when dealing with instruments supplied for the public-
 service, is to compare each one separately with a standard telescope
 by an observation on a distant object; telescopes sent for examination
 can by this means be passed or rejected, but hardly classified.     But in
 examining photographic lenses, where there is a much greater variety
 of form and pattern, it would be quite out of the question to keep a
 sufficient number of standard lenses to be of any practical use.
 Thus little assistance was obtained from the experiences gained in
 the examination of telescopes.
    It was necessary therefore to seek some method which did not
 depend on comparisons with standards, and in devising such a test
 the object most to be kept in. view was evidently to diminish as fat-
 as possible the errors due to the variations either in the transparency
 of the atmosphere or in the personal qualities of the observer.
    With regard to the first point, that   is, the effect of fog, mist, and
 dust in the air, the only way to avoid errors from these causes<appeared
to be to conduct this test in a room.      This was considered especially
necessary   ina  climate  like that of London.   It no doubt theoretically
                                                 is
right to examine portrait lenses, or lenses for copying plans, by
observations on a test-object not too far away; but for landscape
lenses a distant test-object would, from other points of view, be pre
ferable, and the adoption of the examination in       a room was only the
  loice of the lesser of two evils.
      ith regard to variations due to the personality of the observer, the

              Examination of Photographic Lenses at Keio.                431
case is more difficult.     Probably the most important consideration is
that the test should not be based on a mere judgment, the reason for
which one person cannot readily communicate to another. In many
works on photography the extent of field over which the lens pro
duces a " sharp
                    "
                      image is discussed, as if by mere inspection this
could be determined ; whereas no two people would exactly agree as
to where the diffusion of the image was sufficient to be classed as
want of sharpness, and no two objects would serve equally well for
such a test. It is essential, at such an establishment as the Kew
Observatory, that the observer should obtain some definite numerical
result from his examination, even though it may bo considered
advisable to merely employ general expressions in the wording of the
certificate ; under any other system it would be impossible for any
length of time to prevent the standards from varying.
    Still more difficult is it to avoid errors from actual variations in
eyesight, whether between different individuals or at different times
iu the same individual.        Some general conditions may, however, be
laid down. When the illumination of an object is very feeble, the
subjective light of the eye, as it has been called by Helmholtz, plays
an important part in determining the least intensity of illumination
which is visible, and this subjective light is a very variable quantity ;
the eye increases in sensitiveness        for a long time when light is
excluded from it, the increase at first being very rapid, which may be
another way of expressing the same fact. Hence, any feebly illu
minated object must be a bad test-object, for its appearance will vary
very materially according to the state of the eye.            On the other
hand, if the illumination is too bright, the eye will be much in
fluenced by irradiation, and the subjective effect on the eye will be a
bad indication of the true condition of the object ; moreover, as
irradiation is the effect on the appearance of an object produced by
brighter surrounding objects, and as this effect diminishes as the
differences of shade get less, the test-object should show no marked
contrasts in illumination.      But in applying these general remarks to
the case under consideration, it must be remembered that it is not
the test-object which is seen by the eye ; it is the image of the test-
object, as produced by the lens under examination.                 Hence, it
appears    that  the  test-object  should   produce  an   image   of medium
intensity of illumination, and one in which there are no great differ
ences in shade.      The test-object used at Kew, it will be remembered,
consists of a perfectly black object seen against a bright background,
and it might therefore appear as if it were not a good selection.         In
order   to prove  that, as a rule,  the differences of  shade  in  the image
are small, and that no objections can be raised to the Kew test on
theoretical grounds, it is necessary to show what is the effect on the
image produced by a want of defining power in the lens.

    The result of bad definition in the lens is to make the image of a
point occupy a sensible area on the photographic plate, and conse
quently to prevent the image of the edge of a surface from being
sharply indicated.     The general effect can be best illustrated by
 means of figs. 7 and 8, where the abscissa? are enlarged dimensions
 measured on the plate, and the ordinates indicate the intensity of
 illumination at each point. In fig. 7 let a, e, b represent a section
through the image of a small spot of light.        In fig. 8 let the curve
/, h, k represent the actual image of the edge of a bright surface,
 which would be represented by /, d, e, k if the defining power of the
 lens were perfect ; it is evident that a b' in fig. 8 is equal to the
 limiting value of ah in fig. 7 as the spot of light becomes infinitely

  small.    In fig. 10 is shown the effect of bringing two bright surfaces
  near together ; that is to say, of a dark line as seen against a bright
  background;      f,g,f  will represent a section through the image of
  the line, gx being equal to xc.     If this curve is turned upside down,
 as in fig. 9, it can be shown that it represents the image of a bright
  line on a dark ground.
      In this latter case — that of the bright line on the dark ground — it
                                                                              '
  can be readily seen that the effect of narrowing the slit of light will
  be to decrease the illumination gd at the centre of the line until it
  becomes zero as the slit closes.      The worse the definition of the lens,
  the sooner will the centre of the line reach the limit of visibility ; but
  by ascertaining what is the width of the finest bright line just
  visible, a good test for defining power will not be obtained for the
  following reasons; in the first place, the illumination of the image
  will be feeble, which has already been shown to be objectionable,
  and in the second place, since with feeble illuminations the ocular
  sensation varies as a first approximation as the intensity of the
  illumination, considerable errors would arise through the difficulty of
 obtaining a constant illumination through lenses of different types.
      These objections do not apply, however, to testing definition by
 finding the width of the finest dark line that can be seen against a
 bright background. In this case as the line becomes thinner, the
 illumination at its centre increases until it reaches that intensity of
 illumination which can no longer be distinguished by the eye from
 the illumination of the field. If the illumination eg in fig. 10 can be
 distinguished from cd by the eye, it is evident that a blurred image
 of the dark line is visible, and if any illumination greater than eg is
 indistinguishable from cd by the eye, it is evident that the figure repre
 sents the image of the thinnest black line which is visible. Fig. 11
represents generally the same condition of things as that shown in
 fig. 10, except that the defining power of lens is much better ; and it
 will be seen how much finer the line must be in this case to produce
 the same proportional illumination at its centre ; that is to say,
 before the limit of visibility is reached.         Now there is a certain
intensity of illumination at which and about which the eye is at its
maximum of sensitiveness to differences of shade, and this is when
the object is what would be described as not bright and not
dark ; between these wide limits the minimum difference of shade
visible is a fixed proportional part of the total illumination.         This
proportion      differs  with different  observers, but not  to a very great
extent. Hence if a plan is adopted by which a dark line on a
bright ground can be made to vary in thickness, and if the illumina
tion is arranged so that the eyo is at its maximum sensitiveness (that
is therefore so that the line remains longest visible as it diminishes in
width), then the moment at which it disappears will occur when the

 434                 Major L. Danvin.         On the Method       of
 difference    of intensity of illumination of the centre of the line and
 the field is the minimum          difference of shade discernible by the eye,
 and this will be independent of the actual intensity of the field, and
  will not vary much with different observers.              But it has been shown
 that the thickness of the line does vary with the defining power of
 the lens, and it may therefore be concluded that the test adopted
 at Kew is not open to serious objections on theoretical grounds.
    In the foregoing discussion, it has, however, been assumed that the
 curve representing the image of the edge of a surface is such as that
 which Helmholtz has shown to be produced as an ocular effect by the
 circles of diffusion being dne to want of accommodation of the eye
 itself :* it will be observed that no part of the curve is tangential
 to the vertical. If, however, the curve is similar to that given by the
same author as being due to dispersion in the eye, and illustrated in
fig. 12, it will be seen that the result of gradually diminishing the
thickness of a line will not be exactly as above described ; for, how
ever thin the dark line on the bright ground becomes, the intensity
of illumination at its centre can never be more than twice ch ; and if
the ratio of twice ch to cd is less than a given ratio, the image of the
black line will remain visible until it is so thin that the eye cannot
perceive it. Therefore it might come about that two lenses giving
images of the edges of surfaces as different as flhf and nlhn', as
shown in fig. 13, might give equally good results under the Kew test
for definition, because in both cases the limit of visibility would be
due to the minimum size of the line visible by the eye, and would
have nothing to do with the definition of the lens.                        Helmholtz
remarks on the very little evil effect of a diffusion represented by the
curve shown in fig. 12, since the true edge is always visible. Hence
we may assume that the Kew method still gives in such cases a good
practical test for definition, though it does not test the amount of
dispersed light over the image of fine lines, or, as a photographer

 would say, the brilliancy of small objects. In fact, since the definition
 of an objective could only be rigorously expressed by a curve (or,
 more accurately, a surface) with dimensions, it is impossible for any
one result to give all the information on this head which might be
 desirable.
    As the eye is capable of detecting a difference of shade of about
 1 per cent, of a moderately illuminated field, it will be only necessary
 for the curve shown in fig. 12 to be tangential to the vertical for
  1 per cent, of its height to render the image of an infinitely thin line
 visible in so far as that visibility depends on difference of shade.
 But take the case of a Jine not absolutely black, and seen against a
 bright background ; then, in fig. 10, the illumination of the centre of
t he image will be represented by gc, plus some proportional part of
yd ; in comparison with the case of the absolutely black line, it can
be shown that the curve must be tangential to the vertical for a
 proportionately greater distance before the shade of the centre of the
 image of the infinitely thin darker line will be sufficiently deep to
 form a visible contrast. For instance, if the line is illuminated to
nine-tenths of the intensity of illumination of the field, the curve
                                        '
must be tangential to one-tenth of dc (see fig. 10) before this con
dition of things occurs.     A test depending on the thickness of a line
which is darkened to a definite proportional intensity of the field
would therefore present this disadvantage, that there would be fewer
occasions on which different degrees of imperfection of definition of
lenses would show the same result in testing ; such a test may there
fore in future be adopted at Kew.
    It should, however, be remarked that in the whole of the above
reasoning it has been assumed that the minimum proportional diffe
rence of shade visible is the same in a thin line as in a thick one,
which can hardly be the case.      But this false assumption will not, it
is thought, vitiate the general conclusions arrived at.
    It is of course conceivable that the actinic rays will be brought to
either a better or to a worse focus than the visible rays ; it is believed,
however, that no serious error is likely to result from the test being
done by the eye and not by photographic methods ; it is almost
certain that the curve representing the edge of a surface will have
the same general character in the two cases, and therefore that the
results obtained with the eye will be a good indication of those which
would be obtained by photography.

positive if it is measured towards the centre of the plate from the
chord, thus giving the name of positive and negative distortion in
the two cases.
   The distortion for distant objects is not necessarily exactly the
same as for nearer ones, and therefore the uses for which the lens is
intended should not be forgotten ; for example, with portrait lenses,
an object some 10 to 20 ft. away should be used to throw the image
in the above test.
   Probably it will not at once be admitted that this is the best means
of measuring distortion ; for no doubt it might be done in many other
ways, and a method might easily have been selected which would
have been less open to criticism on purely scientific grounds.          We
believe, however, the Kew certificate gives the information really
required in practice. In order to determine if a lens is suitable for
any particular purpose, all that is required to be known is whether
the image of a straight line near the edge of the plate will show too
much curvature, the amount of tolerance depending greatly on the
work for which the lens is to be used. There is no means of enabling
the photographer to form a judgment on this point more readily than by
giving him the sagitta or sag in the image of a straight line along the
edge of his plate.    That it would be difficult to find a better method
may, perhaps, be made more evident with the aid of figs. 17 and 18,
the former representing a section through a lens and the photographic
plate, and the latter showing part of the plate in plan, with the curved
image of a straight line just inside its margin.      In fig. 17, let N\ be
the nodal point    of emergence  ;  Sp  the centre of  similitude for rays
emanating from a distant object and making an angle () with the
axis; and S« the same for an object at an angle 0; e and g will,
therefore, be the images of these two objects as seen on the plate,
whereas, if there had been no distortion, they would have appeared

 tortion in each case. In fig. 18, let the rays coming from the objects,
 of which the images are seen at e and g, make the angles ft and 0
 with the axis of the lens at the nodal point ; if ef and eg are equal
in length to the lines similarly denoted in fig. 17, it is evident that
 the curve ege represents   the image of a straight line, which, if
 there had been no distortion, would have appeai*ed as the line fhf.
Now it would not have been difficult to have devised means of
measuring the total distortion at any part of the plate ; for in
stance, to have measured the distortion ef for the point e at the
corner of the plate — but the following considerations show, it is
thought, that that would not be a suitable way of testing the
lens; let the curve efe in fig. 18 represent the greatest curvature
that would, be tolerated for the class of work for which tho lens is
intended ; compare the lens producing this curve with another in
which Sp occupies the same position, but in which Sj is nearer the

be less in the second case, and the curvature would therefore exceed
the tolerated limit : with two lenses giving an equal total distortion
at the margin, one should be passed and the other rejected.                The
total distortion at any one point will not therefore give a measure by
which the lens should be judged, the greatest rate of change in the
distortion more nearly representing what is required to be known;
and, as the rate of change is certain to be greatest at the margin, the
Kew certificate supplies the information required.
    The tourniquet has already been mentioned as an apparatus which
has been specially recommended        for the purpose of testing photo
graphic lenses ; by means of this invention, Commandant MoSssard
obtains an excellent means of detecting distortion, bnt hardly of
measuring it in a way to indicate the curvature produced in an
image.    It will be remembered that the lens can be revolved about
an axis which passes through the nodal point Txu whilst the eyepiece
remains stationary ; the effect of this movement can be seen in
fig. 17 by imagining the lens to be stationary, whilst the object and
the eyepiece revolve about the nodal point, the arc abcdF being the
path traversed by the eyepiece.        Let a be the image of the object

   The photographer may be said always to adjust his focus in day
light, and  the astinic rays are not brought to the same focus as the

the photographic plate, the focus of which has just been adjusted in
daylight ; if the lens has not been properly corrected for achromatism,
the different coloured rays will form different cones, and those
coming to a focus at w will have a wave-length of about 5570, for
that,   I am informed by Captain Abney, is generally speaking the
dominant wave-length for white light.         Let b'bb' be the cone of rays
of 4420 wave-length, which is not far from the position of the
maximum actinic effect for ordinary bromide dry plates, and let u'uu
be the cone for rays of 4000 wave-length ; since the actinic effect
with silver salts begins to fall off rapidly at about 4000 wave-length,
the cones outside the cone u'uu' may be neglected, and it may be
 taken that the image of a point covers a disc on the photographic
plate of which u io is the radius.         It is evident that what the
photographer wants to know, with regard to the achromatism of his
lens, is the amount of diffusion caused in the image by any errors in
its construction, that is to say, what is the actual size of the disc of
diameter u'w.
    The examination for achromatism is therefore made in the follow
ing manner : — First the focus is carefully adjusted, in daylight on a
suitable object placed as far away as possible in the room, and then
the focus scale is read off.     After this, a sheet of blue glass, the
colour of which has a dominant wave-length of 4420, is placed
behind the object aud close in front of a small opening in the shutter
through which all the light enters the room ; the focus is re-adjusted,
the focus scale read off again, and the difference in reading to that
observed in white light is noted; the length bio in fig. 19 is thus
obtained.      Now let / be  the principal focal length of the lens ; and
 let /'  be the focal distance  when the observation was made, which
 can be easily obtained with sufficient accuracy by a direct measurement

442              Major L. Darwin.      On  the Method of
from the ground glass to the nodal point of emergence, or to the pivot
¦which has been made to pass through that point.      The difference of
focus, bw, noted between the blue and white light is then multiplied
by ///, and the result thus obtained is that finally recorded in the
Certificate of Examination as if it were the direct result of an ob
servation made on a distant object. Exactly the same process is then
repeated with a sheet of red glass, the colour of which has a dominant
wave-length of 6250.
   The reason for multiplying the result of the observations by    f/f is
that it would evidently be unfair to test objectives of different focal
lengths on a near fixed object, for in some cases the ground glass
would be close to the principal focus, and in others far removed from
it. It seems, therefore, advisable to reduce all results so as to make
them equivalent to observations taken on infinitely distant objects,
and this is done by applying this correction. An assumption is here
made that the difference of focus between different coloured rays in
the same lens varies directly as the focal distance, and this in
all probability, though not strictly accurate, introduces an exceed
ingly small error in the results.
   The blue and red glasses, which were selected and measured for
colour by Captain Abney, form a perfect contrast, as may readily be
seen by placing them together and observing how very nearly com
pletely all light is excluded.
   By simply noting the difference of focus recorded in the certificate
between observations made in red and white light, or between observ
ations made in blue and white light (the latter being of far more
practical importance), it can at once be told if the lens is or is not
well corrected for achromatism. But it would seem desirable, as
already remarked, to form' an estimate of the actual amount of
diffusion produced in the image as a result of any error that may be
detected in the chromatic adjustment of the lens.     Now there can be
no difficulty in determining the size of the disc of radius b'w, for bte
has been directly determined by experiment, and, since the cone b'bb'
represents the cone of rays of maximum actinic effect, on this disk
will be concentrated the bulk of the rays which produce the effect
on the photographic plate.     But what we want in reality to find is
the radius u'w, since that has been shown to represent more accu
rately the radius of the disc of diffusion; it may, however, be re
marked that no fault can be found on this head with the method of
testing, because the probabilities of error are lessened by taking the
observation with rays of the maximum actinic effect. With a lens not
at all corrected for achromatism the length between the different foci
for different coloured rays varies approximately as the difference of
the squares of the wave-lengths of the colours in question ; and, taking
the wave-lengths as above given, uw will be found to be to bw as 5 to

4. But it must be confessed that this rule may have little or no
relation to the truth with a corrected lens, and it is merely adopted
as the only approximation obtainable.   It is assumed, therefore, that
uw = 5/4 tit).  Let bw, the result obtained by the examination for
achromatism, = «; let the diameter of the disc of confusion, or twice
u'to, = &' ; let the principal focal length of the lens = /,- and let the
effective aperture = e.     Then it can be seen, by reference to fig. 6,
that—

    The table on p. 427, which gives the values of 200^/(0.1. No. of
stop), affords a ready means of obtaining the required results in the
 following manner : —
    Knowing the C.I. No. of the stop, decide on <5', the diameter of
 the maximum disc of diffusion that will be tolerated ; then, under
 the columns thus ascertained, look out ft in the table, multiply the
 fignre there given by       and the maximum difference of focus, a,
                                   -J,
 that can be tolerated between white and blue rays      thus obtained.
                                                                   is
    Or, in the line opposite the stop of the size under consideration,
 find a number equal to a, the observed difference of focus for white
 and blue rays then 0, the diameter of the disc of diffusion, will be 5/2
                  ;
 times    the figure given at the top of the column in which a has been
 found.
    It may be observed that the either the principal focal length or
 the position of the nodal point of emergence may vary as different
-coloured lights pass through a lens.       It would not be difficult to
 investigate these two sources of error separately, but the results
 would be of little or no practical value.

line, and then, as the focus is lengthened, as a fine horizontal line.
The focal scale is read off at each of these positions, and the dif
ference, 7, between the two readings gives a measure of the astig
matism. But, in order to judge of the amount of astigmatism that
can be tolerated, the diameter, a, of the disc of diffusion caused
thereby should be calculated.    This is done by multiplying 7, ths
difference of focal distance             of the focal lines, either by                       -   c°s<*>

at the same distance from the testing camera    as  was the object in the
examination for achromatism, the ratio ///'       exactly the same as in

that case. The same result may be obtained by the use of the table
on p. 427 in the following manner — Find the value of

size of the stop that could be nsed to obtain any required standard of

matism, that      is,

size of the stop used during the observation.
   In the above discussion           has been assumed that the focal lines

are sharply defined.        If this is not the case the reasoning here
given     isdefective, because the distanoe separating the focal lines
is  then no indication of the amount of diffusion. An exaggerated
idea of the amount of diffusion due to astigmatism may thus be
obtained by the above method of calculation, for the disc may have
only half the diameter thus found. Therefore, unless the focal lines
are sharp — that is, unless the image of a point appears as a very
thin line, first in one direction and then in another — no entry                                      is

   Objections have been raised to the use here made of the term
astigmatism, when it is intended to mean the effect of spherical
aberration on oblique rays ; it has been proposed to limit the use of
the word so as merely to signify cylindricity in the lenses, such as
might be produced by turning them in a lathe with elliptical motion.
Whatever may be the theoretical value of this objection, we fear that
the use of the term has been so thoroughly incorporated into the
photographic vocabulary, both in England and abroad, that it would
now be impossible to substitute another expression in its place.

   The intensity of illumination of the field is always greatest near
the axis of the lens, and falls off more or less rapidly towards the
edges of the plate.       The lens should therefore be examined with the
view of ascertaining if this inequality of illumination is greater than
that which experience shows must be tolerated under given circum
stances.    The apparatus employed for conducting this test is shown
in fig. 23, the method being devised by Captain Abney.                  There is a

servations ; F represents a paper screen, placed in that position in
order to give a practically uniform source of light ; O is the lens,
which is fixed in a frame, not shown in the sketch, revolving about
the pivot N ; by means of a suitable adjustment, this axis, N, is made
to pass through the nodal point of emergence of the lens. At S there

is a sheet of cardboard with, a small hole in the centre at H, and this
screen, hole and all, is covered with thin white paper on the side
away from the lens ; the distance between H and N is always made
equal to the principal focal length of the lens ; the bar D is made
to cast a shadow from the movable lamp M on the paper just over
the hole in the cardboard ; thus, in this shadow, the paper is illu
minated entirely by transmitted light from the lens, whilst the
paper round it is illuminated entirely by the light of the movable
lamp.
    An observation is made in the following manner : — The lens is
first placed in such a position that its axis passes through the hole H ;
the lamp M is then moved backwards or forwards until the trans
mitted illumination of the paper at H is made to match as nearly as
possible the reflected illumination of the paper round it; the dis
tance between S and M is then noted.       The lens is now placed in the
position   shown  in fig. 23, where AB represents the length of the
diagonal of the plate for which the lens is being examined, and where
the angle 0 is half the angle of field under examination.             The
balance of light is readjusted by a movement of the lamp, and the
distance MS is read off a second time. By finding the inverse ratio
of the square of these two readings, we thus obtain the ratio between
the illuminations at P and H, the lens being in the position shown in
the sketch, and the object being supposed to be equally illuminated
in both cases. But what is wanted is the ratio between the illumina
 tions on the plate at P and A ; this is found with perfect accuracy by
 multiplying the ratio of the illumination at P and H, as above ob
 tained from the observations, by cos3      and this result
                                           <fi,                that which
                                                                    is
is  entered in the Certificate of Examination.     The relative illumina
 tion of the centre and of any part of the field can, of course, be ob
 tained in this manner, in the above instance the corner of the plate
being the point chosen.
   This test may with advantage be made with the largest stop sup
plied, and also with the stop which has been shown, under test No.
13, to give good definition over the whole plate.
   It cannot, however, be denied that there are objections to this
method of examination. The fact that the illumination of the plate
is not uniform  is   due to several causes — (1.) The amount of light
                                                  :
which passes through any aperture evidently diminishes with the
obliquity.   (2.) With lenses not free from distortion, the effective
aperture itself varies with the angle of incidence. (3.) The amount
of reflection from the surfaces of the lenses, and consequently the
amount of transmitted light, varies with the angle of incidence. The
method of observation above described may be said to fully take into
account these three causes of variability in intensity.      Then again
(4)  the light falling on the plate varies inversely as the square of its

             Examination of Photographic Lenses at Kew.                419
distance from the nodal point, and also (5) with the obliquity with
•which the rays strike the plate. As far as these two latter considerations
alone are concerned, it is evident, therefore, that the illumination on
the plate varies as the third power of the angle of incidence, and also
that by multiplying the result obtained on the screen at H by cos3 0
•we obtain the required result on the plate at A.       Thus the record in
the certificate includes all these first five causes of irregularity of
illumination. But there are other causes which are not correctly
represented in this method of examination. In lenses not free from
distortion the nodal point of emergence varies in position with the
angle of incidence, and as the pivot N does not shift its position
with reference to the objective daring the observation, the condition
of illumination of the photographic plate cannot be accurately repre
sented.     This is probably a trifling cause of inaccuracy ; but one
somewhat serious source of error remains to be mentioned.               The
method of examination does allow for (6) the variation of illumina
tion due to the different amount of glass through which the oblique
pencils have to travel ; but, as the observation is made by eye, no
allowance can be made for the fact (7) that the actinic rays may be
affected in this manner out of all proportion to the apparent varia
tions produced in the visible rays.
    The method of examination adopted at Kew assumes that the
light transmitted through the paper, as well as that reflected from
the paper, varies in amount with the intensity of the incident light.
Captain Abney informs me that his experiments prove this to be the
case.     But in making the observation the eye should be placed in
 the  same  position during both readings ; for we have no reason to
suppose the transmitted and reflected lights vary in the same way
 with the anglo of vision.
    It is impossible to suppose that the screen P will be illuminated
with perfect regularity, even near its centre, and this must be a
 source of error, though probably a negligible one. When the axis
 of the lens passes through H the rays which are brought to a focus
 at that point, will be parallel to each other as they enter the lens ;
 but when the axis of the lens is inclined this canuot be the case, for
 H will no longer be on the principal focal surface ; the screen F
 should therefore be brought as near the lens as possible, as by that
 means the part of the screen from which the light comes will be
 more nearly identical in the two cases. The lamp L should, moreover,
be placed as far from the screen as practicable, so as to m ake the
illumination as uniform as possible. With lenses in which the nodal
points are some distance apart, the part of the screen from which the
 light comes will vary considerably with the inclination of the axis,
and considerable errors might be introduced by uneven illumination
of the screen.

450                 Major L. Darwin.        On   the   Method   of
   In  deciding on tbe quality of a lens as regards the illumination
of the field, this test should be considered in connexion with test
No. 10, under which heading are given the angles of the cones of
illumination.   With regard to the normal use of any lens, except
perhaps snch    as are specially designed for portraiture, certainly the
whole of the smallest stop, and, as a rule, the whole of the largest
normal stop, should be visible from the whole of the plate ; for if the
plate extends much beyond the limits of the inner cone (outside
which the aperture begins to be eclipsed) the falling off of density
near the edges of the plate will be a serious defect in the photograph.
When considering the part of the field lying within this inner cone,
it is to be noted that, the wider the angle which the lens covers, the
greater is the inconvenience caused by the diminished density near
the margin ; if the stop is in front of or behind all the lenses, the
intensity of illumination of different parts of the plate can be shown
in this case to vary approximately as the fourth power of the cosine
of the angular distance from the axis of the lens, and in cases where
the stop is between two lenses, the limits of variation will be the
third and fourth powers of the cosine of the angle. The following
table is therefore inserted to give an approximate idea of the
decrease of illumination as we recede from the axis of the objective,
the truth lying theoretically somewhere between the two limits here
given : —

  Eminent lens makers have spoken of the illumination produced by
their lenses    being uniform from the centre to the margin, but our
               as
experience     that tbe decrease
               is               iseven more rapid than here indicated.
The above table shows how very objectionable is the use of wide
angle lenses, whenever they can possibly be avoided.        It shows,
moreover, that the theoretical exposure for different stops should be
materially modified according to the angle which the lens covers                ;
for instance, taking the last column to represent the truth,    would      it
be right, even though the stops in the two cases had the same C.I.
number, to give half as much exposure again with      90° objective as

¦with one   only covering 40 , in. oi^€*--^gpHtJie same mean exposure
over the whole plate.
    In connexion with this test it may he mentioned that the most
serious omission in the Kew examination is, that there is nothing to
show the actinic transparency of the glass. A slight yellow tinge in
the lenses, which would not be noticed by the eye, might yet be
sufficient to serionsly affect the rapidity of the objective.     But no
test could be devised to investigate this point which did not intro
duce photographic methods, and, as already stated, the consideration
of expense put such operations out of consideration for the present.
I  should like, if possible, to have introduced some test which would
have at the same time indicated the actual rapidity of the lens, and
also the actual falling off of density towards the margin of the photo
graph ; with the aid of photography this would not have been
difficult, and a plan of this kind would have been adopted, but for
the cost.      This subject is, however, still under consideration by
Captain Abney.

  Bakerian Lecture. — " The Rate of Explosion in Gases."
        By Harold B. Dixon, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Chem
        istry in   the    Owens     College,     Manchester.    Received
        July  8, 1892.
                                 (Abstract.)
   1. Berthelot's measurements of the rates of explosion of a number
of gaseous mixtures have been confirmed. The rate of the explosion
wave for each mixture is constant. It is independent of the diameter
of the tube above a certain limit.
   2. The rate is not absolutely independent of the initial temperature
and pressure of the gases. With rise of temperature the rate falls ;
with rise of pressure the rate increases ; but above a certain crucial
pressure variations in pressure appear to have no effect.
   3. In the explosion of carbonic oxide and oxygen in a long tube,

452                    The Rate of Explosion in   Gases.       [Jan. 19,
the     presence   of steam has a marked effect on the rate.       From
measurements       of the rate of explosion with different quantities of
steam, the conclusion is drawn that at the high temperature of the
explosion wave, as well as in ordinary combustion, the oxidation
of the carbonic oxide is effected by the interaction of the steam.
    4. Inert gases are found to retard the explosion wave according to
their volume and density. Within wide limits an excess of one of
the combustible gases has the same retarding effect as an inert
gas (of the same volume and density) which can take no part in the
reaction.
    5. Measurements of the rate of explosion can be employed for
determining the course of some chemical changes.
    In the explosion of a volatile carbon compound with oxygen, the
gaseous carbon appears to burn first to carbonic oxide, and afterwards,
if oxygen is present in excess, the carbonic oxide first formed burns
to carbonic acid.
   6. The theory proposed by Berthelot — that in the explosion wave
the flame travels at the mean velocity of the products of combustion
— although in agreement with the rates observed in a certain number
of cases, does not account for the velocities found in other gaseous
mixtures.
    7. It seems probable that in the explosion wave —
      (1) The gases are heated at constant volume, and not at constant
            pressure ;
      (2) Each layer of gas is raised in temperature before being
             burnt ;
      (3) The wave is propagated not only by the movements of the
             burnt molecules, but also by those of the heated but yet
             unburnt molecules ;
      (4) When the permanent volume of the gases is changed in the
             chemical reaction, an alteration of temperature Is thereby
             caused which affects the velocity of the wave.
    8.  In  a gas,   of the mean density and temperature calculated on
these assumptions, a sound wave would travel at a velocity which
nearly agrees with the observed rate of explosion in those cases
where the prodncts of combustion are perfect gases.
    9. With mixtures in which steam is formed, the rate of explosion
 falls below tho calculated rate of the sound wave.       But when such
mixtures are largely diluted with an inert gas, the calculated and
found velocities coincide. It seems reasonable to suppose that at
the higher temperatures the lowering of the rate of explosion is
brought about by the dissociation of the steam, or by an increase in
its specific heat, or by both these causes.
    10. The propagation of the explosion wave in gases must be ac

conrpanied     by a very high pressure lasting for a very short time.
The experiments of MM. Mallard and Le Chatelier, as well as the
author's, show the presence of these fugitive pressures. It is possible
that data for calculating the pressures produced may be derived from
a knowledge of the densities of the unburnt gases and of their rates
of explosion.

        Communication)            By J. W. Pickering, B.Sc, Assistant
        Demonstrator in Biology at St. Bartholomew's Medical
        School. Communicated by Professor HALLIBURTON, F.R.S.
        Received November 25, 1892.
         (From the Physiological  Laboratory  of King's College, London.)
   The object of the following experiments has been to study the effect
of varying conditions on the heart previous to the development of
a nervous mechanism, and thus to throw some light on the discussion
as to the relative importance of the two factors in the heart's action,
viz., the contractile tissue and the nervous elements.              The heart     I
have used is that of the chick* at a period of incubation of seventy-two
hours at a temperature of 38° C. In some cases the embryos have
been a few hours older or younger. The embryo is not removed from
the egg, but a window is cut 3 cm. square through the shell and
shell membrane, exposing the albumen and blastoderm, which remain
undisturbed ; the egg and embryo is fixed in a small chamber sur
rounded on five sides by a water-jacket.               The uppermost side is
covered with glass, while the air of the chamber is kept moist by the
evaporation of water from a small bowl placed inside it. The tem
 perature of this chamber can be kept constant or varied at pleasure.
 My experiments have fallen under three main heads : 1. The results
 of varying the temperature. 2. The introduction of drugs. 3. Elec
trical stimulation.      In my full paper the results will be shown in
 tables giving the number of heart beats per minute, the peculiarities
in the beat, when such exist, being duly noted. At present, however,.
I  am only prepared to give an abstract of the results obtained, in so
 far as temperature and drugs are concerned.             The electrical experi
ments are not yet completed.
      * Observations are being carried on upon the mammalian    embryo in titu.

 462                         Mr.  J.  W. Pickering.                    [Jan.  26,
                                 1.  Temperature.
    Each embryo has an individual rhythm of its own, which, if the
 conditions are constant, remains unaltered, but different embryos,
 even of the same age, may have different rhythms, so that it is neces
 sary to determine for each embryo its normal rhythm before varia
 tions can be studied. An embryo's heart, aged seventy-two hours, at a
 temperature of 31° C, was beating with a regular rhythm of 84 per
 minute. The temperature of the air of the chamber was rapidly
 raised to 42° C, when the rhythm rose to 91 per minute.               A further
 rise to 50° C. increased the rhythm to 128,       it  still  remaining regular.
 The temperature was then rapidly lowered to 2G° C, when the rhythm
 fell to 114 per minute. A further fall to 16° C. reduced the rhythm
 to 34 per minute. The temperature was then raised to 46° C, when
 the rhythm rose to 117° per minute.           On again letting the tempera
 ture fall to 25° 0., the rhythm fell to 36° per minute.
    The above experiment, taken as an instance from several, shows
 that, other factors being constant, the rhythm of the embryonic heart
 varies directly with the temperature of the surrounding medium.
    Extremes of temperature stop the heart ; thus exposure to a tem
 perature of 10° C. causes the beats to become weaker and slower,
 and finally to stop in diastole.       If the air of the incubator be raised
 above 50°   C, the beats become so rapid as to be uncountable.             They
 are feeble, and the heart is pale, due to the passage of less blood
 through it than in the normal state. Violent systolic spasms alternate
 with periods of quiescence.        It stops in an expanded condition when
the surrounding temperature is about 55° C.                  Lowering the tem
perature restores the beating, but the heart is enfeebled.                If the
 temperature is raised much above this limit the heart is killed.
 Mechanical stimulation of the heart in standstill, due to either
extreme of temperature, if applied at the ventricular end, gives rise
to one or more waves of contraction, commencing from the auricular
end, and showing the direct conduction through the fibres of the
heart. The heart will respond to auricular stimulation when irre
sponsive to ventricular stimulation.         Small variations of temperature,
such as one or two degrees, occurring over a long period of time, as
in an hour, do not affect the rhythm.
                        2.  The Introduction of Drugs.
    The drugs employed were applied directly to the heart substance
at the temperature of the embryo, and dissolved in normal saline
(0'65 per cent, sodium chloride) solution.
   a. Caffeine. — An embryo, aged sixty-eight hours, at 33° C. had a
rhythm of 88 per minute. To its heart 0'00015 gram* of caffeine was
               * All weights of drugs used aro expressed in grams.

 1893.]         On  the   Physiology  of  the  Embryonic Heart            463
 administered, and in two minutes the rhythm rose to 100 per minute,
 and remained constant for two and a half minutes, when it fell to 96
 per minute. A second dose of 0'00015 gram raised the rate to 102
 per minute.      The beats were also of greater force, since more blood
 was seen passing through the heart. A dose of 0-0025 gram was
 fatal. When given to an embryo, aged seventy-five hours, at 37° 0.,
 beating with a rhythm of 116 per minute, it reduced the rhythm,
 after one minute's action, to 100 per minute. The beats, however,
 remained very strong. After one minute forty-five seconds' action
 the heart stopped in strong systole, but started again and gave a few
 powerful beats. After the drug had acted nine minutes thirty seconds
 the heart stopped permanently in powerful contraction. Caffeine,
 therefore, acts directly on the cells of the embryonic heart.
    b. Strychnine was given to a seventy hours' embryo in a dose of
 0-000017 gram, and depressed the rhythm of the heart from 112 per
 minute to 52 per minute. There was no spasm.              In an eighty hour
 embryo,    at 39° C,   a  dose of 0"00002    gram temporarily increased the
 rhythm, both in force and number of beats ; then the systole rapidly
 became weakened and the rhythm irregular.                A further dose of
 0-00002 gram still more rapidly reduced both force and frequency of
 beating, till death in diastole occurred.
    c. Morphine acetate, if given in doses of 0"0001 gram, is a powerful
 depressant.     With a dose of 0'0002 gram, after one minute's action
 on an eighty-five hours' embryo at 40° C, irregularities and slowing
 were obtained ; after two minutes' action the beating stopped, but
went on again, the waves of contraction sometimes passing from
ventricle to auricle, and at others in the normal direction. Periods
of rest alternated with violent bouts of rapid beating.
   A. Veratrine.— Doses of 0'0001 gram increase the number of beats
per minnte. Larger doses may cause, temporarily, an increase of
 rhythm, but soon depress the heart by greatly lengthening the
systole, which becomes very weak while the diastole is complete.
The heart stops in an expanded condition. The heart of a seventy-two
hours' embryo that had stopped in diastole, after a dose of 0'0005 gram,
was restored by the application of 0-01 gram of potassium chloride
almost to its normal rhythm.         This agrees with Kinger's observation
on the frog's    heart.
   e. Potassium chloride, when applied in a dose of 0"005 gram to an
embryo aged seventy-two hours, reduced the normal rhythm of 76
per minute to 60 per minute. A further dose of 0-01 gram reduced
the rhythm to 64 per minute. After the administration of a total
amount of 0*07 gram of the substance, the heart stopped in
diastole.
   f . Nicotine, in very minute doses, stimulated the embryonic heart ;
j  o.c. of a solution containing    |  o.c. of nicotine to 100 c.c. of normal

464                       Mr.  J. W. Pickering.               [Jan. 26,
saline was a stimulant ; with       c.c. the frequency and force of the
heart diminished, systole becoming almost absent, while the heart was
finally paralysed in diastole. The addition of O03 gram of potassium
chloride restored the heart to almost its normal rhythm, the beats at
the same time becoming strong, both as regards systole and diastole.
A further dose of nicotine depressed the heart, and again brought it
into diastolic stoppage, the systoles having become weaker and weaker.
There was no spasm.
   g. Atropine. — Doses of O'OOl gram had, in a sixty hours' embryo, a
slightly depressant effect, and even after 0 006 gram had been ad
ministered, the rhythm of the heart had only fallen from 96 to 72
per minute. In a seventy -two hours' embryo, with a heart beating at
 116 per minute, 0"012 gram, after three minutes' action, had de
 pressed the rhythm to 80 per minute, while even after the administra
tion of 0"275 gram the rhythm was strongly maintained at 64 per
 minute.
   h. Muscarine Nitrate. — To the heart of a seventy-two hours' embryo
at 35° C, which was beating with a rhythm of 90 per minute, 3 drops
of half saturated solution of muscarine nitrate were applied ; the
rhythm remained constant for two minutes, after which period 2
more drops were added, and the rhythm kept constant at 94 per
minute during the next three minutes, after which period 4 more
 drops were added, and the ensuing rhythm was 93 per minute;
2 drops of saturated solution were then added, which was so concen
trated as to stain the embryo brown. During the following five
minutes the rhythm was constant at 84 per minute, each beat remain
ing normal in direction and force. Two more drops of saturated solu
tion caused slight irregularities, but the rhythm during the next seven
minutes averaged 72 beats per minute. Finally 2 more drops of satu
rated solution were added, and during the following seven minutes
the heart's rhythm was 75 per minute. The whole experiment lasted
thirty minutes, and 10 drops of half saturated plus 9 drops of
saturated solution of muscarine nitrate were administered. A con
trol experiment with the hearts of two frogs showed that the musca
rine used stopped their beats, which were typically restored by atro
pine.   In a similar experiment, witnessed by Professor Halliburton,
with both embryonic and frogs' hearts, the rhythm of the former was
maintained at 136 per minute, while the latter was stopped and sub
 sequently restored by atropine. Identical results were obtained with
a ninety-six hours' embryo. In an embryo aged seventy hours at a
temperature of 30° C, which is subnormal in the chick, a rhythm of
92 beats was obtained after the application of 1 c.c. of half satu
rated solution for the following nine minutes, after which 1 c.c. of
saturated solution was applied. This was fatal to the heart, almost
instantly coagulating the tissues.    There were no typical phenomena

of muscarine poisoning, and the application of atropine failed to re
store the rhythm.      Probably any strongly alkaloidal body in such a
concentrated solution would produce a similar effect.
   i. Schmiedeberg's Digitalin. —An embryo aged seventy-two hours at
30° C. had a heart rhythm of 132 per minute. To it 1 c.c. of normal
saline containing O000022 gram of digitalin was applied. During
the next eleven minutes the rhythm remained constant, after which
time 1 c.c. containing O00005 gram was added, which produced no
change in the rhythm ; then O'OOOl gram was put in, and after one
minute's action the frequency of the rhythm had fallen to 92 per
minute, but both the systole and diastole were strong. The rhythm
after six minutes' action rose to 104 per minute. After this another
O'OOOl gram was added, and the rhythm fell after two minutes' action
to 50 per minute. The systole was typically perfect, bnt the diastole
was incomplete.     The whole heart after two minutes' more action of
the drug became very pale and in a state of tonic contraction with
very feeble fluttering diastoles, which faded away, leaving the heart
stopped in a contracted condition.
   j. Strophanthin (of Merck's manufacture). — A seventy-two hours'
embryo at a temperature of 32° C. had a heart rhythm of 132 per
minute. A dose of 0 00006 gram did not alter the rhythm.              A
second  dose of the  same  amount  after twenty minutes' action reduced
the rhythm to 54 per minute ; both systole and diastole were regular
and complete. Five minutes after this the diastole became irregular,
and the systole was more marked than in the normal condition.
After another minute had elapsed the ventricle passed into a state of
tonic contraction'with a few feeble beats, in which the diastole was
very weak.    The auricles had a marked diastole and a weak systole,
and were engorgod'with blood. During the next five minutes the
auricle had a rhythm averaging 24 beats per minute, while the ven
tricle remained in tonic contraction. Finally, forty-one minutes after
the administration of the dose the auricle stopped in diastole, the
ventricle remaining in tonic contraction. The auricles responded by
10 beats to a mechanical stimulus ; the beats did not extend to the
ventricle. Six minutes after this the auricle responded to mechanical
stimuli, the wave of contraction passing either from the ventricular
end to the auricle or vice versa, according to which end of the auricle
the stimulus was applied.
   In larger doses of 0-0002 gram the rhythm in a seventy hour
embryo at 33° C. was depressed from 120 to 102 per minute, the
systole becoming very strong and the diastole imperfect. After four
minutes' action the rhythm returned to the normal both in frequency
and force.   To the same embryo 0-00025 gram was then added, when
after one minute's actioD the auricle dilated, giving small twitch-like
contractions, while the ventricle passed into tonic contraction. The

 466                On  the  Physiology     of  the Embryonic    Heart.     [Jan.  26,
 auricle remained for six minutes feebly responsive to mechanical
 stimuli.
     k. Nitrite of Amyl. —A ninety-six hours' embryo kept at 35° C. was
 subjected to the influence of the vapour of 5 minims of nitrite of
 amyl.      After one minute's action the rhythm rose from 96 to 124, and
 after another minute fell to 112. After another minute it had fallen
 to 104, and six minutes afterwards was at the normal. In a seventy-
 two hour embryo at a temperature of 47° the rhythm was 124 per
 minute. A dose of 1 c.c. of solution of amyl nitrite dissolved in
 olive oil (strength being 1*5 c.c. of the drug to 10 c.c. of olive oil)
 was given, and the frequency of the rhythm fell in one minute to 112,
 but the beats were strong. Six minutes afterwards another c.c. of
 the solution was introduced, and the rhythm fell to 104, but was
 strong. Three minutes later another c.c. was put in, and the rhythm
 rose to 112, but was very weak and irregular, and finally before death
 the rhythm was reversed.
                                    Concluding    Remarks.
    The observations here recorded show that the embryonic heart when
 kept under favourable conditions reacts in a very delicate manner to
 all those classes of stimuli which influence the adult heart. The ex
 periments on temperature show that its variations act directly on the
 cardiac muscle, and thus confirm the opinion of Newell Martin* and
 others who have arrived at the same conclusion from experiments on
 the adult heart.
    The action of caffeine, morphine acetate, potassium chloride, vera*-
trine, nicotine, digitalin, strophanthin, and amyl nitrite is direct on
the contractile tissue of the embryonic heart.                This greatly favours
the view that they act direct on the adult cardiac muscle.                 It will be
 noted that many of the actions here described on the embryonic heart
are almost identical to those observed by others on the adult heart.
Notoriously so is the antagonism between veratrine and potassium
chloride, where my observations are identical with those of Ringerf
on the frog's heart.           A similar antagonism exists between nicotine
and potassium chloride.              The remarkable correspondence of my re
sults with strophanthin on the embryonic heart with those of Pro
fessor FraserJ on the frog's heart greatly supports the view of that
observer as to the direct action of strophanthin on cardiac muscle
without the intervention of any nervous mechanism, and, further, the
absence of diastolic stoppages in my experiments also supports
Fraser's view that that condition in the frog's heart is due to the

  action of small doses of strophanthin on the cardiac nervous mecha
  nism of that animal.
     The lengthening out of the systole in veratrine poisoning corre
 sponds to the same well-known lengthening of the systole in the
  frog's heart under veratrine. The reversing of rhythm observed in
  morphine poisoning is similar to that mentioned by Ludwig* as
 •occurring in the mammalian ventricle when under the influence of
 opium, for then the auricular beats follow instead of precede the
 ventricular beats, the rhythm being reversed.             The same occurs in
 amyl nitrite poisoning.
     Krukenbergt has stated that neither atropine nor muscarine
 affects the heart of Ascidians.
     My observations on the action of atropine and muscarine, which
 have been made on a large number of embryos, show that in the
 absence of a nervous mechanism they do not influence the heart.
 This will probably modify the current views on the action of these
 drugs, and my results show that the method I have adopted is a
 valuable one for differentiating the functions of cardiac muscle from
those of the nerves which supply it.

    In    1886-87 and in 1890       I submitted papers to the Royal Society
bringing      under   notice facts  which   had come to my knowledge whilst
engaged upon the practical extraction of this beautiful metal from its
ores, and in its separation from impurities which are always associated
with it when in a crude or unrefined state.

    In   a paper dated February 10, 1887,1 allusion is made to the fact
that     arsenic is often one of these impurities, and at the same time a
method is given by which the separation of this metal from bismuth
was then successfully effected.
    The process adopted when that paper was read, and for a consider
able period subsequently, when working upon bismuth containing
arsenic, consisted in removing the arsenic by fusing the arsenical

 bismuth in contact with metallic iron at a dull-red heat and under
 flux. A compound of iron and arsenic was thus formed and could be
 removed as a scum ; the disadvantages of this process being, 1st.
 loss of bismuth by volatilisation, and, 2ndly, much loss of time in the
 manipulation of any large quantity to be treated.
    Having occasion, a few months ago, to melt together a large quan
 tity of arsenical bismuth, some 700 or 800 kilos., that is, more than
 three .quarters of a ton, in order to obtain a homogeneous alloy upon
which to work subsequently by the process above alluded to, it be
came evident that when the temperature was raised above the melt
ing point of bismuth, the surface of the metal beiug exposed to the
atmosphere, arsenical fumes appeared, and that these increased as
the temperature of the metal became more elevated, the result being
that the arsenic came off in dense white fumes (As203).
    The observation of this fact led to further experiments, and it was
found that if the surface of the bath of fused arsenical bismuth was
freely exposed to the air at a temperature rather higher than its own
melting point, and if the molten metal was constantly stirred, it was
possible to eliminate the whole of the arsenic alloyed with the bismuth
by this simple process of fusion with stirring.
    As it is a matter of considerable interest for metallurgists to know,
not only that this elimination does take place, but also at what tem
perature it occurs, a series of experiments have been conducted with
a view of determining this accurately.
    The work of Roberts- Austen has shown that a thermo-junction is
practically the only form of pyrometer that can be used for delicate
thermal investigations of this kind, but the question arose which par
ticular thermo-junction should be adopted.        Was it well to use the
platinum-iridium one as advocated by Barns, or the platinum-rhodium
one suggested by H. Le Chatelier?        My previous work on the alloys
of platinum and rhodium, lately published in the ' Philosophical
Transactions,' sett led the question in favour of the rhodium-platinum
thermo-junction, for    I was satisfied that the alloy of platinum with
10 per    cent, of rhodium is as homogeneous as any known alloy could
well be, and is therefore admirably adapted for use as a thermo-

    The diagram shows the results obtained by calibrating the thermo-
junction by the aid of certain known melting points.        The tempera
ture at which arsenic is eliminated is also shown on the diagram.
    Analysis proved that the alloy operated upon in these experiments
contained 0"65 per cent, of metallic arsenic.
    From the diagram it will be seen that the melting point of this
alloy of bismuth is 278° C.         By raising the temperature of the
alloy  to  395° C. the arsenic freely sublimates from the bismuth alloy,
and at a temperature of 513° C. the whole of the arsenic is eliminated.

  A  point of much interest in relation to molecular physics became
evident in the course of the investigation.     Arsenic, as is well
known, volatilises at the comparatively low temperature of 180° C,
without passing through the molten state. Arsenic is not, however,

 {fiven off freely from the arsenical bismuth until a temperature of
 395° is reached.    So that the temperature of disassociation of this
 alloy, containing 0'65 per cent, of arsenic, is 114° C. higher than the
 melting point of the mass.      It was interesting to determine at what
temperature    the arsenic would   be evolved if the alloy were heated in
vacuo.
    A portion of the bismuth alloy containing 065 per cent, of arsenic
 was introduced into a hard glass tube, slightly depressed to its centre,
and connected at one end with a Sprengel pump, by which it could be
rendered   vacuous.
    The pyrometric wires were in contact with the metallic alloy and
passed to the galvanometer through the opposite sealed end of the
glass tube.
    Heat being applied, the first indication of the volatilisation of the
arsenic, shown by the condensation of a film on the cool part of the
tube, occurred at 275° C.     When the alloy was quite melted the tem
perature indicated was 316° C. ; arsenic came off freely ' when the
temperature rose to 569° C, condensing in a black mirror.
    The metal was then allowed to cool, and its setting point was
found to be 268° C, which corresponds with that of the melting point
of bismuth.
    The bulk of the arsenic does not appear to be evolved in vacuo at a
lower temperature than in air.
    As regards the industrial application of the process, some ten to
twelve tons of arsenical bismuth have already been treated in this
very simple way, and it has been satisfactorily ascertained that there
is no loss of bismuth by volatilisation with the arsenic.
          Pabt V. — The Separation of Bismuth from Antimony.
    The process hitherto adopted in practice for the separation of
antimony from bismuth has usually consisted in a simple fusion at a
dull-red heat with bismuth oxide or bismuth " litharge "— an opera
tion successful enough as to its results, but one requiring no small
amount of skill in manipulation; it is also one by which only small
quantities can be treated readily at one time — and moreover, the
temperature which is necessary to effect the separation of the
antimony involves appreciable loss on account of the volatilisation of
the bismuth at a red heat, notwithstanding many tens of tons of
bismuth have, however, been treated under my direction by this
process.
   In an operation lately    conducted,    involving the melting of a
quantity  of bismuth  containing  about one  per cent, of antimony, it was
found that a peculiar oily film was noticeable rising to the surface of
the melted alloy; this film did not form all over the surface of the

 1893.]              On the Metallurgy   of Bismuth.                  471
metal, but  appeared to rise as from a boiling centre, and this
although the metal was at a temperature very little above its melting
point.  A portion of the film or layer was removed and tested in
order to ascertain its nature, and it was found to contain a very
appreciable proportion of antimony.     I, therefore, caused the opera
tion to be continued, stirring the metal from time to time with a
dried wood stirrer. In the course of three or fonr hours, removing
the film from time to time, the surface of the melted metal assumed a
much brighter appearance, and on carefully testing it at this point,
the metal was found to be absolutely free from antimony.     To confirm
this and to ascertain more exactly the conditions under which this
separation takes place, a further quantity of impure bismuth was
operated upon in a similar manner. This second quantity contained
other impurities besides antimony, its analysis being as follows : —
               Bismuth, by difference                  96-20
               Antimony                                 0'80

                                                     10000
   The same simple process of fusion and stirring was again adopted
— the   quantity being about 350 kilogrammes — and when the same
oily film commenced to rise to the surface the temperature of tho
molten mass of the alloy was taken by means of the Le Chatelier
pyrometer.     A portion of tho film removed showed, on being tested,
a percentage of over 30 per cent, of antimony. A slightly perceptible
fume of arsenic was apparent as volatilising, so proving what I found
to be the case in the separation of arsenic by simple fusion. (See
ante.)
    The point at which this separation of antimony occurs was found
to be 350° C, and at this temperature the metal was maintained for
about five hours.
    The evidence of an oxidising action became now much less, and,
although a very small amount of antimony was present, there was still
a little remaining in the alloy ; the temperature, therefore, was slightly
raised and maintained at 458° C, as shown by the pyrometer, for
about four hours, at the end of which time the bismuth became
absolutely free from antimony.
   The form in which the antimony separated was peculiar — a trans
parent glass, consisting of antimony oxide — containing about 10 per
cent, of bismuth, but of course in the removal of the antimony oxide
a small proportion of the bismuth was mechanically carried with        it,

  resulting in the production of several very interesting and very
  beautiful metallurgical specimens.
    The great advantage of this process is, like that of the foregoing
 separation from arsenic, its extreme simplicity, the low temperature
 which renders it possible to work upon very large quantities at one
 time, and the very small amount of time necessary for this separa
 tion in comparison with the process hitherto adopted, and the
 absence of loss in the bismuth operated upon by volatilisation.     It is
 obvious that where metals can be so easily treated in large quantities,
 the labour and skill hitherto necessary is very considerably reduced,
 and there is the additional advantage that the loss attending large
 operations is minimised.
    In this and in my previous papers upon this beautiful metal
 bismuth, I have been able to point to simple dry processes for it*
 separation from gold, lead, copper, arsenic, and antimony, and ali
 these processes are available for treating with care large quantities at
 one time.    "When it is remembered what is involved in having to
 dissolve any quantity of bismuth in acids, and its subsequent pre
 cipitation from solution, it surely will be admitted that much of the
 difficulty in purifying crude bismuth has been effectively removed,
 as the methods given have been found possible in practice, and ad
 vantageous.
    I have introduced upon the diagram the points at which arsenic is
 volatilised, and also the point at which antimony separates from
 bismuth under the conditions described in this paper.

    The figure represents a simple form of " Watt's Parallel Motion."
 OA = O'B = r are the arms that can turn freely about O.O', fixed
centres, in one plane.      The link AB = 2.1 is pivoted at A and B.
As the arms move, P the middle of the link, traces out a portion of
the curve, viz., from Q to Q', backwards and forwards, nearly in a
right line.
    OC = O'C = d. — Of the three parameters d, r, I, any one can be
taken as unit (in this paper I is taken 10 units) ; then d and r are
independent parameters.       The problem Watt had to solve was to
discover numerical values of d and r that should give the tracing
point P the smallest deviation from a right line.
    Watt gave a series of values for d and r which are employed bv
engineers, with small thumb-rule ameliorations, to this day.   They are

they are all subject to the relation cP—i3 = P. The curve above is

the preceding writers in "approximate methods."
   The present paper takes up the subject at this point, and the general
substance of the paper and its results may be stated under three
heads, viz. —    :

given by Watt.

or where the tracing point divides the rod unequally, are also dealt
with.

istent at that point.
    This method is capable of great extension ; it is used in the pre
 sent paper in the heading (3), and has been found of great service
in dealing with other complex enrves, as when the tracing point P
is not in the straight line AB.

(P— t3 = P. A very simple practical rule for fixing has been found
for all values of d and r.

   The numerous writings of late years on Three-Bar Motion, by Mr.
Roberts, Professor Cayley, and others, do not appear to invade the
narrow area of the present paper, which especially aims at obtaining
nnmbere for d and r of practical value.

      ments of Flame-cap Indications furnished by this and other

      fessor of Chemistry, University College, Nottingham.
      Communicated by Professor Armstrong, F.R.S. Received
      January     10, 1893.
                                 Introductory.
    The presence of firedamp is still almost invariably detected, and
its amount is more or less accurately measured, by the observation of
the pale blue " cap
                       "                     "     " over the flame of the
                          produced by the      gas
safety-lamp.      By suitably reducing the flame of an ordinary oil
safety-lamp by drawing down the wick, it is generally considered
that percentages of gas in the air varying from about 2-5 to 6 can be
defeated and estimated.        The upper limit is that at which an inflam
mable mixture is approached.            The lower limit reached by this
method of testing is, however, not considered sufficiently low, and for
two reasons. W. Galloway has shown (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 24,
p. 361) that air containing less than 1 per cent, of gas becomes
 explosive when it is mingled with fine coal-dust; hence the ordinary
 safety-lamp test for gas is incapable of indicating a dangerous state
 of the atmosphere in dusty mines.             And, further, even in the
 absence of coal-dust in the air of the mine, it is necessary to test the
 " returns," or the ventilation currents as they leave the working
 " districts " and the mine, in order to ascertain whether the general
 ventilation of the mine is well distributed and sufficient.     It is stated
                                   "
 by high authorities that the main return
                                                   "
                                                     air should not contain
 more than 0"5 per cent, of
                                 " gas," and that 1
                                                     per cent, should never
 be reached.     An ordinary oil safety-lamp gives no indications with
  1 per cent, or less of gas.
     During the last twelve years several forms of gas-testing apparatus

1893.]           A New Portable Miners Safety-lamp.                   485
have been introduced with the object of enabling percentages of gas
as low as 0'5, and even as 0'25, to be determined. The lower propor
tion, 0'25 per cent., is considered to be low enough for all practical
purposes.
   Of these apparatus, the    following are considered to effect their
purpose satisfactorily : E. H. Liveing's electrical indicator (' Physical
Soc. Proc.,' June, 1880): Fr. Pieler's alcohol-lamp, described in a
pamphlet ('Ueber einfachen Methoden zur Untersuchung der Gru-
benwetter,' Aachen, 1883) : and an apparatus brought forward by
Coquillon and by others, which depends upon measuring the reduc
tion of pressure produced in a confined volume of the mine-air when
the firedamp is burnt out of it, this being effected by maintaining
the air in contact with a metallic wire rendered incandescent by an
electric current.
   Apart from general considerations of convenience and of safety
when these apparatus are in use in the mine, a serious objection to
«ach of them is that it is by no means small or light, and that it
must be carried together with an ordinary safety-lamp, since it does
not itself serve for illuminating the darkness of the mine.
   The Liveing apparatus has recently been proved by James Grundy,
working with my test-chamber, to give very accurate readings of
"gas" varying in percentage from O'll to 2 "2; but he found the
platinum wire exposed to the gas to be subject to changes when in
use, which make the apparatus difficult to maintain in working order
and which sometimes render it useless.
   There seems to be a general disposition amongst all classes in
terested in mining to improve, if possible, the flame-cap test, rather
than to resort to other methods for securing accuracy and delicacy in
gas-testing.    This object was in some measure attained by MM. Mal
lard and Le Chalelier in 1881 (' Annales des Mines,' 7th Ser., vol. 19,
p. 186), by suitably screening the reduced oil flame of the safety-
lamp, and then viewing its tip against a black background of cloth
or of blackened metal sheet. It is stated that a slight indication was
obtained by this means when the percentage of gas present was as
low as 0'5. The lamp, however, suffered a loss of illuminating power
when its flame was turned up, owing to the obstruction of the screens.
The indications of the lower percentages were also confessedly ex
tremely slight and feeble ; they are further rendered uncertain by the
fact that an oil-flame itself gives a feeble cap-like mantle.     Still the
improved lamp has the advantage of being at once an illuminator
and also a gas-tester of greater delicacy than the lamps in ordinary
use.
   The inventors of this improved oil-lamp state that they consider
the hydrogen flame to be superior to any other for gas-testing. They
ascertained that this flame would detect 0"25 per cent, of gas ; but
                                                             2 k 2

  486                        Prof. F. Clowes.                     [Feb. 2,
  they do not publish any further account of its indications, appa
 rently because their attempt to introduce the hydrogen flame into a
 safety-lamp was altogether unsuccessful.
     Pieler was also so much impressed with the advantages obtained
 by the use of a hydrogen flame for gas-testing, that, failing to apply
 this flame to a portable lamp, he still recommended (loc. cit.) the
 application of the hydrogen flame, fed by a chemical generator, in a
 stationary apparatus above ground, to testing samples of mine-air
  which were conveyed to it. He confesses that his alcohol-lamp is
 only a substitute for the impossible hydrogen-lamp, which he would
 evidently recommend if it were available. The alterations recently
 made by M. Chesneau (' Annales des Mines,' August, 1892, p. 203)
 in the Pieler lamp would therefore probably not have been recom
 mended by the original inventor of the alcohol lamp, if a portable
 hydrogen lamp had been in existence ; and although they add to the
 safety of the lamp, they do so by rendering the lamp self -extinguishing
in moderately high percentages of gas. The extinction of the testing-
lamp is a serious inconvenience to the gas-tester, and will not prove
to be a recommendation to him.
    The Pieler lamp farther labours under the serious disadvantage
that the pale caps have to be observed through wire gauze, which
obstructs much of their light. The caps become actually invisible
if the gauze around the lamp is bright and reflective, as it frequently
 is in a new lamp.
    When samples of air can be conveniently collected and carried to a
testing station, no arrangement will be found more convenient and
delicate than a hydrogen flame of standard size, fed by a large
cylinder of the compressed gas. The flame-cap is then observed in
a dark room against a dead-black ground, and its height is noted. A
portable hydrogen safety-flame will, however, be found to be much
more convenient, as it can be carried to the spot where the test is to
be made.      The troublesome collection and transport of bulky air
samples are thus avoided.
      A Portable Safety-lamp with  interchangeable Oil and Hydrogen
                                 Flames.
    An arrangement for introducing a standard hydrogen flame into
any ordinary form of safety -lamp has been already described (' Roy.
Soc. Proc.,' vol. 51, p. 90).   The requisite supply of hydrogen was
contained in a compressed state in a steel cylinder, which was
similar to those in common use, but of much smaller dimensions.
The cylinder was slung from the shoulder by a strap, and was con
nected when necessary with the lamp by means of a length of
flexible tubing.    On slightly opening the valve of the cylinder, the

1893.]           A  New Portable Miner   s Safety-lamp.            487
hydrogen was fed through a copper tube of very fine bore within the
lamp to a jet terminating beside and just above the wick of the lamp.
This copper tube passed through the oil reservoir of the lamp.
   The hydrogen having been kindled by the lamp-flame, the wick was
drawn down by the " pricker " until the oil-flame was extinguished.
The hydrogen flame was then set to a standard height of 10 mm. by
regulating the very tapering cylinder-valve, whilst looking across a
vertical 10 mm. wire fixed on the wick-holder in front of the hydro
gen flame.    The flame-cap was then looked for against a dead-black
background, produced by smoking with a taper a vertical strip half an
inch wide upon the interior of the back of the lamp-glass. The lamp-
glass was specially made of greater length than usual, so as to enable
the whole of a flame-cap 60 mm. in height to be seen. The height of
any flame-cap thus observed was estimated by comparing it with the
standard 10 mm, hydrogen flame, or, if the flame had increased in
height, by taking the vertical wire as the fixed 10 mm. standard of
measurement.
   When the observation of the flame-cap had been completed, the
lamp- wick was pushed up once more against the hydrogen flame ; and
as soon as the oil-flame had been kindled, the hydrogen was shut off
by the valve of the cylinder, and the flexible tube was disconnected
from the lamp.
   The whole process of producing the standard hydrogen flame within
the ordinary safety -lamp was very simple and was very rapidly
effected  ; and the change from the oil flame to the hydrogen flame,
and the converse, presented no difficulty.    A littio practice enabled
the operator to turn on the hydrogen sufficiently slowly, if the vaTve
was properly constructed ; and a little care sufficed to prevent the
extinction of the hydrogen flame by sudden shocks imparted to the
flexible connecting tube.
   This form of apparatus appears to be suitable for many purposes.
But practical mining men objected to the unnecessarily large weight
and dimensions of the hydrogen cylinder, and to the inconvenience of
 the connecting tube.     For making one's way along rough and awk
 ward passages underground something more compact and light was
 requisite.
   After many experimental forms of apparatus had been tried, a little
steel cylinder directly and rigidly attachable to the safety-lamp was
adopted. It is shown attached to Ash worth's modified lamp in fig. 1.
The sectional drawings represent the key of thi valve below the
cylinder ; it is in reality at the side and is detachable ; the attach
ment of the cylinder to the lamp is also not accurately represented
in the sections.   This cylinder may be adapted to any other form of
safety-lamp, but for several reasons Ashworth's lamp has been pre

 ferred. The cylinder is made of hydraulic steel tnbe ; it is 5 inches
 in length by 1 inch in diameter, and barely exceeds 1 lb. in weight.
 It can be instantaneously attached to the lamp by a quarter turn ; a
 clip arrangement then holds it firmly at both ends ; it is as quickly
detachable.     When the cylinder is not attached, the lamp is an
 ordinary safety-lamp. The cylinder, when attached, forms a most
convenient strong and rigid handle at the side of the lamp, by which
the lamp may be supported in the left hand while the hydrogen flame
 is being adjusted by the right.     The whole process of passing from
 the bright flame to the hydrogen flame and back again to the bright
flame, including a hydrogen-flame test, is easily effected in thirty
seconds.     The process of testing is precisely that described above for
the cylinder with flexible lamp connexion.
    The little cylinder is charged with hydrogen by connecting it with
a larger store cylinder of the gas under a compression which may vary
between 120 and 60 atmospheres.        When charged at 100 atmospheres
pressure, it furnished the standard 10-mm. flame, burning continuously,
for about 40 minutes. This would be an ample supply of hydrogen
for one inspection of a mine, since the hydrogen flame would only be
 used occasionally, and then for very short intervals only. If a longer
service is required, a cylinder of the same diameter, but of greater
length, and of capacity half as great again, may be adapted to the
lamp. Or one or more reserve cylinders can be easily carried in the
pocket.     The small cylinder may be charged sufficiently for use
several hundred times from a large cylinder under 120 atmospheres
pressure.

    When " gas " is being tested for in the mine, the examination
would first be made in tbe usual way by carefully and gradually
drawing down the wick, watching continuously meanwhile through
the well-cleaned glass, with the dead-black smoked background
already described, whether at any stage a cap appears over the
flame. If a distinct cap within the limits of the glass should be
seen, the percentage of gas will be between 3 and 6 ; by noting the
height of the cap as judged against the standard 10-mm. wire, the
percentage of gas can be ascertained with very fair accuracy, as is
proved below.
   If no satisfactory cap can bo seen over the reduced oil flame, and
small percentages of gas have to be looked for, the hydrogen cylinder
is attached to the lamp, the standard hydrogen flame is produced
within the lamp, and a cap is looked for over the flame. This standard
flame will readily indicate and measure percentages varying from
0'25 to 3 : the caps being easily seen and readily measured by com
paring their heights with that of the hydrogen flame or of the
standard wire. The cap corresponding to 0'25 of gas is very pale,
and is somewhat hazy and ill-defined. at its edge; the cap with 05
per cent, is somewhat more dense and well-defined ; but both these
caps are easily seen even by an inexperienced eye.
    The dimensions of the caps given by less than 1 per cent, of gas can
be much increased by turning up the hydrogen flame to 15 mm. (see
H, Hi, figs. 5, 6). Similarly, the cap indications of the standard
hydrogen flame, which exceed the height of the lamp-glass when
more than 3 per cent, of gas is present, can be brought within the
visible limits by reducing the flame, while in the presence of the gas,
to 5 mm. (see Ha Ha, figs. 5, 6). These higher percentages of gas
may in this way be estimated by means of the hydrogen flame,
instead of by the reduced oil flame.
   It has been occasionally noticed that, when the hydrogen flame is
allowed to burn for a long time within the lamp, the lower part of
the lamp-glass becomes cool, owing to the feeble radiative power of
the flame ; drops of water then condense upon the glass and interfere
with the accurate observation of the flame and of the cap. If this
should occur, it is only necessary to turn on the oil flame for a short
time ; and this, by its superior lateral radiation, rapidly dissipates
the water.
   It will be readily understood that the main advantages resulting
from the use of the hydrogen flame are the following : —
   1. The flame is non-luminous, whatever its dimensions may be,
        and therefore does not interfere with the perception of the
        cap, and does not require to be screened from the eye.
   2. The flame can always be adjusted at once to standard height, and

 490                            Prof. F. Clowes.                    [Feb.   2,
           maintained at that height sufficiently long for the completion
           of the test ; whereas other testing flames are constantly varying
           in dimensions, and most of them cannot be set to standard six
           at all with any certainty.
              Thus a colza-petroleum flame, exposed in air containing a
          low percentage of gas, when twice adjusted, gave caps of 8 and
          of 20 mm.       The reduced oil-flame also fell so quickly that
          cap-readings with low percentages of gas could not be taken
          at all.
   3. The caps produced over the hydrogen flame are larger than
          those produced by any flame of corresponding size.
   4. The size of the hydrogen flame can therefore be so far rednced
          as to enable it to be used in an ordinary safety-lamp.
             The size of the flame may further be suitably varied, so as
          to increase or decrease the height of the cap, and thus either
         increase the delicacy of the test or extend its range.
   5. The standard hydrogen flame shows no trace of mantle or cap in
         air free from gas ; it shows only a slender thread above its
          apex. The colza-petroleum and the benzoline flames show pale
         mantles in gas-free air, which may be easily mistaken for a
          small percentage of gas.
   6. The standard hydrogen flame burns vigorously, and is of fair size,
         and therefore cannot be extinguished by accident ; whereas the
         reduced flames, ordinarily used in testing, burn feebly and are
          readily lost.
   7.  Hydrogen is supplied fairly pure and of practically invariable
         composition ; whereas commercial oil and alcohol are apt to
         vary much in composition, and therefore to give flames whose
         indications change with the sample of liquid which is being
         burnt.
                    The Precise Measurement   of Flame-caps.
   The flame-caps in a long series of observations, of which the results
are here stated, were observed in the test-chamber already described
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 50, p. 122 and vol. 51, p. 87).     This apparatus
has been made more         convenient for use by slinging    the  water-tray,
which effects the closure of the chamber below, from the bottom of
the chamber by four rods which furnish a kind of parallel motion.
The tray can thus be pushed back and again brought into position,
and be maintained throughout in a horizontal position. It has also
been found necessary to introduce a small circular trap-door in the
 oor of the chamber, and just behind the window. When an oil-lamp
   "•laced over this opening, its flame can be readily adjusted by the
                from outside, without removing the lamp from the
      S

 1893.]          A New   Portable Miner's Safety-lamp.              491
chamber. The chamber was found to clear itself of gas in two
minutes when both top and bottom apertures were left open. With
the bottom aperture only opened, it stood for five minutes without
appreciable change occurring in the composition of its internal atmo
sphere.
    Precautions were always taken, before commencing the measure
ments of caps, to make the eye as sensitive as possible, more especially
when observing the paler caps. This was effected by remaining in a
dark room for some time. The interior of the test-chamber and the
back of the lamp-glass received a dead-black coat : and advantage
was gained by coating in the same way all those brass parts of the
lamp which could receive and reflect the light of the flame or cap.
Very feeble daylight was found to cause much more serious inter
ference than full gaslight did, with the observation of the cap.
    A suggestion made by Professor H. B. Dixon was found of great
advantage when examining feeble caps ; the eye was directed on the
side of the lamp, instead of directly upon the cap ; the pale image
of the cap was thus formed upon a very sensitive part of the retina,
and the cap was much more readily seen than when it was observed
directly.
    All attempts to measure the heights of flame-caps by means of
graduated scales fixed within the lamp ended in failure, since the
light emitted by the cap near its summit was far too feeble to
illuminate    the scale.   The method of measurement ultimately
adopted, which has served for making many hundred readings, is
described below.
    An ordinary flat parallel-ruler was pressed against the window of
the chamber in a horizontal position (fig. 2), and supported a vertical
                                  Fig. 2.

 inner edges : the cap being considered to extend downwards from its
 apex to the tip of the flame.     The position of the inner edges of the
 rule were then marked upon the paper strip by means of a sharply
pointed pencil ; and the distance thus marked was read
                                                                  off on a

 the cap, and was corrected by multiplying it by the distance between
 the eye and the cap (230 mm.), and dividing the product by the
 distance between the eye and the glass (150 mm.).
    It may be mentioned that every reading was made in duplicate ;
 most readings were repeated many times, and in many cases were
 taken by more than one observer.         Successive readings of the cap
 produced by the standard hydrogen flame in the same percentage
 of gas were frequently identical, and rarely differed by more than
 1 mm.     In the case of flames which could not be brought with
 certainty to an invariable standard condition, the readings were
 naturally less constant, but this arose from no fault in the method of
 measurement     adopted.
    The lamps used for testing should be kept clean.           Small open
 ings protected by gauze must, if above, be especially kept free from
 obstructive deposits of soot from the flame ; and, if below, must he
 cleansed from films of oil, which may close the meshes of the gauze
 entirely.
    It is noticed generally, that the caps produced by low percentages
 of gas are pale and wanting in density and definition. As the per
 centage of gas increases, the cap gains in size, in density, and in defini
 tion, and wraps round the flame to its very base. The testing flame
 also increases gradually in dimensions as the percentage of gas rises,
 and in the presence of 3 per cent, of gas and upwards the testing
 flame becomes more bulky, growing both in height and in girth.           It
 is therefore important to note that the 10-mm. hydrogen-flame was
 adjusted in gas-free air, because its size did not materially alter until
  over 3 per cent, of gas was present ; the 15-mm. and 5-mm. flames,

 mixture of dried sodium acetate with caustic soda and slaked lime.

 by the constant results which it yielded in the test-chamber, the gas
 must at least have been of fairly constant composition.

    The 10-mm. hydrogen flame was adjusted to its height in gas-free
 air ; it remained unaltered in height until 3 per cent, of gas was
reached, when its height increased by from 2 to 3 mm.
    The 15-mm. and 5-mm. hydrogen flames were adjusted to height in
the presence of the gas.
    The Pieler, the benzoline, and the blue oil-flame were each of them
adjusted in gas-free air. The faintly luminous oil-flame was adjusted
in the air containing gas, the bright flame being gradually reduced
until the cap was seen to be of the largest possible dimensions.

    In  cases where caps of equal height are given for different percent
ages of gas, it must be understood that the higher percentage gives a
more dense and sharply denned cap than the lower percentage
does.
    The general conclusions drawn from these measurements, and from
experience derived from working with the different lamps, are the
following : —
    1.  The indications of the Pieler lamp begin at the lowest limit of
          0"25 per cent., but quickly become too great to be utilised.
          The thread-like tip extending above the flame for several inches
          in pure air must not be mistaken for a cap, but it is scarcely
          distinguishable from the cap given by 0-25 per cent, of gas.
             This lamp suffers under the disadvantage that much of the
          feeble light of the caps is lost by the obstruction of the gauze :
          the gauze also frequently presents a bright reflecting surface
          behind the flame, and this renders the observation of the
          cap impossible.          All the other lamps in use are free from the
          interference due to the gauze, and if their glasses are black
          ened, as already described, they become well suited for the
           observation of caps.
    2.  The Ashworth benzoline lamp begins its indications doubtfully
          at 0-5 per cent., the cap thus produced being more distinct, but
          not greater in height, than the mantle of the flame seen in gas-
          free air.
             But starting with certainty with an indication of I per cent.,

         (water-white) prodnces an apparent cap, which, though some
         what more intense than the natural mantle seen in gas-free
         air, is only equal to this mantle in dimensions, and might
         easily be mistaken for it.
            The oil flame, when it is reduced until it just loses its
         luminous tip, however, gives distinct indications from 3 to
         6 per cent.
            The largest indications are produced by drawing down the
         flame in the presence of the gas, until a cap of maximum size is
         obtained.
    A  carefully regulated oil flame may, therefore, conveniently supple
ment the hydrogen flame for the indication of gas varying from 3 to
6 per cent., and in the new hydrogen lamp this will be found to be a
convenient method to adopt.
    The use of colza alone in the oil-lamp is very inconvenient for gas-
testing : the wick quickly chars and hardens on the top, and the flame
cannot then be reduced without danger of extinction ; the flame can
never be obtained satisfactorily in a non-luminous condition. The
admixture with petroleum obviates these difficulties.
      Results of Flame-cap Measurements     in Air containing Coal-gas.
    The miner's safety-lamp is frequently employed for purposes of
illumination in gas-works, and in other places in which the air maj
be contaminated with coal-gas.        It seems, therefore, only reasonable
to make the lamp also serve the purpose of detecting the percentage
of coal-gas present.    The amount of gas thus found indicates whether
the air is in a dangerous condition.          Careful measurements 'were
accordingly made of the flame-cap heights seen over the hydrogen
and oil flames of the safety-lamp, when it was placed in the test-
chamber with air containing a known admixture of Nottingham
coal-gas.
    The following measurements in millimetres were obtained.           They
are represented graphically in millimetres and in inches in fig. 9, but
no attempt is made in these drawings to show the marked increase in
dimensions which the test-flame undergoes in the presence of the
higher percentages of gas :—

    On comparing these cap-heights with those for the corresponding
 percentages of methane, it will be seen that they somewhat exceed
 the latter when the hydrogen flame is used, and are somewhat less
 than the methane cap-heights when the oil flame is employed.              It is
important   to remember    that  this  difference  exists,  if coal-gas is used
 to represent firedamp in the test-chamber.
     Observation of Flame-caps    in a Rapid Current of Air containing
                 Coal-gas, and   in the presence of Coal-dust.
    The test-chamber was originally introduced as a convenient form
of apparatus for testing the delicacy of lamps.            The chamber is far
less costly, and   less troublesome     in  use, and far more    economical of
the gases to be tested, than the forms of apparatus previously used for
the same purpose.
   But it has been frequently stated by practical mining men that the
examination of the flame-caps in the still air of the test-chamber
                                                     "
might lead to fallacious conclusions ; since the gas," when tested for
in the mine, was contained in a rapidly moving air-current caused by
the ventilating fan ; and this movement of the air around the safety-
lamp might entirely alter the character of the flame-caps which were
seen with the same percentage of gas in still air.
   That any effect could be produced on the cap by the movement of
air seemed extremely unlikely, since no lamp is now considered safe
in the mine the flame of which is at all affected by the ordinary
ventilation current.
   But whilst working with air containing coal-gas, which was easily
obtainable in large quantity, the question was put to the test of
experiment in the apparatns represented in fig. 10.
                                     Fio.  10.
    A square wooden tube, 12 feet in length and 14 inches square in
section, had a fan, A, driven by a little electric motor, pushed into one
end of it. This fan, when in rotation, drove an air-current at the rate
of 300 feet per minute through the tube ; a pipe, B, supplying coal-gas
from the mains, fed the gas into the air current drawn by the fan.

1893.]             A New   Portable Miners Safety-lamp.                 501
The gas was thoroughly mixed with the air, partly by the action of
the fan, and partly by the passage of the air current through coarse
wire-gauze baffles, C. The lamp was introduced through a hinged
window, D.
    The hydrogen flame in the Ashworth's lamp was not affected in
the least by this air-current. The cap shown over the flame indicated
the presence of 0-5 per cent, of gas. At a given signal the hinged
door E was dropped into position B|, and closed the tube, and the fan
was simultaneously stopped. The lamp was thus exposed to still air
of the same composition as that which was previously in motion.
Not the slightest effect upon the flame or cap was perceptible.
    A similar experiment made with the reduced oil flame of the lamp,
and with air containing a larger percentage of gas, showed that the
air-current in motion produced no effect on the oil flame and its cap
other than the quiescent air of the same composition did.
    It may be concluded, therefore, that with a good safety-lamp the
test-chamber indications are applicable to the conditions ordinarily
fonnd in the mine.
    [February 7. — It was found, however, that the presence of fine
coal-dust in very large proportion in the air rendered the test-flame so
luminous that no cap could be seen even when gas was present. A very
dusty atmosphere will render gas-tests impossible by all the forms of
testing apparatus at present known.      No interference arose from the
dust ordinarily met with in the mine.]
      Results of Flame-cap Measurements in Air containing    Water-gas.
    The poisonous nature of " water-gas," which is produced by passing
steam over red-hot coke or charcoal, is well known.        It is due to the
large proportion of carbon monoxide present in the gas. Since
 water-gas is free from odour, it is very necessary to find, if possible,
some delicate method of detecting it and of measuring its amount in
air. Accordingly the heights of the flame-caps yielded by the hydro
gen flame and by the oil flame of the safety-lamp, when the lamp
 was introduced into air containing known percentages of water-gas
 in the test-chamber, were measured.    It was hoped that the flame-cap
 test might prove available for water-gas, as it is for firedamp and for
coal-gas.
    The samples of water-gas were prepared in the laboratory by pass
ing steam over red-hot wood charcoal contained in a porcelain tube.
The flame-indications proved that portions of the gas collected at
different periods of the preparation were very different in composi
 tion ; and a chemical analysis of the gas showed an undue proportion
 of carbon dioxide and a deficiency of carbon monoxide. The percent
                                                              2  l2

ages found were       :  carbon dioxide 18-5, carbon monoxide 5'4,              hydrogen
761.
    In this     gas the oil flame showed no trustworthy indication until
4 per cent, of water-gas was present, when the height of the cap was
10'9 mm. ; the cap rose to 15*3 mm. with 5 per cent, of water-gas.
 The cap over the standard hydrogen flame was 15'3 mm. when 0"25
per cent, of the gas was present, and rose gradually to 32 mm. when
5 per cent, was present.           These results would indicate the flame-test
to be of inferior delicacy for water-gas, but they require to be
repeated with water-gas of better quality before final conclusions
are drawn.
    [January 27. — The flame-test, as applied to water-gas, was further
investigated in the test-chamber, by employing an artificially prepared
mixture of the separate gases. This mixture approximately corre
 sponded to the average composition of water-gas.                    The      percentages
found on analysis were as follows : —

The Measurement of    the Percentage  of Gas in Air by the Spiring of  the
                          full Luminous Flame.
   It  has recently been stated   that the " spiring" of the fall bright
flame of the lamp is a very delicate and trustworthy test for gas.
This effect occurs when the flame, which has been raised to the
verge of smoking in air free from gas, is brought into air containing
gas.    The flame then stretches upwards a thin tongue, assumes a
redder tinge, loses iD brightness, and begins to smoke.      It is stated
that 05 per cent, of gas may thus be detected with ease and
certainty.    Experiments in the test-chamber failed to detect 0"5
per cent, of gas with an ordinary colza-petroleum flame. With a
benzoline flame, however, 0*25 per cent, was detectible ; and the
spiring of the flame with 0'5 per cent, was most pronounced ; while
with 1 per cent, of gas a very distinct red spiring flame was produced
which smoked freely. But it was at once evident that any safety-lamp
flame when delicately adjusted for this test was very easily made to
" spire " by causes other than the presence of firedamp ; this was
especially the case with the benzoline flame, which seemed to spire
spontaneously at any moment.
   When it is remembered that the " spiring " may be caused by any
slight increase in the oil supply to the wick, or by the reduction of
the supply of air or oxygen to the flame, arising from any cause other
than the presence of " gas," it will be seen that the indications cannot
be very trustworthy.    The method is further impossible of application
in many situations, since the flame must be adjusted for the test im
mediately before it is applied, and this must be done in air free from
gas.    Air known for a certainty to be free from " gas " is not obtain
able in many situations where the test would have to be carried out.
This test further clogs the meshes of the gauze with soot, and this
impedes the proper action of the lamp.
   The conclusion, drawn from a series of comparative experiments
made in the test-chamber, was that the flame-cap test when carried
out in the way already described, and with the apparatus mentioned
above, exceeded both in delicacy and in trustworthiness the test
depending upon the " spiring
                                " of the full
                                              bright flame of the safety-
lamp.
   I  have much pleasure in acknowledging the valuable and intelli
gent assistance rendered by W. T. Bigby in the above investigations.

     The specimen described in this memoir was found in the year 1871.'
  in a bed of clay which was cut through in making a railway at Ir-
  vercargill, near the southern end of the Middle Island of New
  Zealand. Originally this meteorite appears to have been about the
 suse of a man's fist, and to have weighed 4 or 5 lbs., but it was
 broken up, and only a few small fragments have been preserved. The
 stone evidently consisted originally of an intimate admixture of
  metallic matter (nickel iron) and of stony material, bnt much of the
 metallic portion has undergone oxidation. Microscopic examination
 of thin sections shows that the stony portion, which is beautifully
 chondritic in structure, contains olivine, enstatite, a glass, and prob
ably also magnetite, and through these stony materials the nickel
 iron and troilite are distributed.   The specific gravity of portions of
 the stone was found to vary between 3'31 and 3"54, owing to the un
equal distribution    of the metallic particles. A partial chemical
examination of this meteorite was made by the author and Mr. James
Allen, bnt the complete analysis has been undertaken by Mr. L.
 Fletcher, F.R.S., of the British Museum. The analysis, which when
finished will be communicated to this Society, has gone so far as to
show that the percentage mineral composition of the Makariwa
meteorite may be expressed approximately by the following numbers:
nickel iron 1, oxides of nickel and iron 10, troilite 6, enstatite 39,
olivine 44.

some given type, produced by the force at its own or some other
place.    Or it may be that it is not an impressed force that is given,
but displacement of some kind.         Or, in order to produce mathe-

matical simplicity, we may have a space-distribution of force or of
displacement given, whose effect is required.
    To answer the question, we may investigate the general differential
equation of the system, find its solution (serieB, integrals, &c), and
then introduce special values of constants or of functions to limit the
generality of the problem, and bring the solution to satisfy the re
quired conditions. Details may differ according to circumstances,
 but this may serve to describe the usual process.
    2. There is, however, a somewhat different way of regarding the
question. We may say that we have no special concern with the
general solution which would express the disturbance anywhere due
 to initial energy throughout the system ; but that we have simply a
connected system, a given point (for example) of which is subjected
to impressed force, communicating energy to the system, and we
only want to know the effects due to this force itself.               Since,
therefore, the connexions are definite, we must have some definite
connexion between the " flux F and the " force "/, say
                                  "
                                    P = T/,                               (1)
where Y is a differentiating operator of some kind, a function of djdt,
the time-differentiator, for instance, when the connexions are of a
linear nature. Here      /  is some given function of the time, and Y
                                      /
indicates the performance upon of certain operations, whose result
should be to produce the required function P.
   3. An important point to be noted here is that there is, or should
be, no indefiniteness about the above equation.             The operator Y
should be so determined as to fully eliminate all indeterminateness,
and so that the equation contains in itself the full expression of the
connexion between the force and the flux, without any auxiliary con
ditions, or subsequent limitations, except what may be implicitly
involved in the equation itself.
            Determinateness   of a Solution through  the Operator.
   4. But as soon    as we come to distinctly recognize this determin
ateness of connexion, another point of important significance presents
                                                               /
itself. It should be possible to find F completely from through the
operator Y without ambiguity and without external assistance.
That is to say, an equation of the form (1) not only expresses a
problem, but also its solution. It may, indeed, not be immediately
interpretable, but require conversion to some other form before its
resultant meaning can be seen. But it is, for all that, a particular
form of the solntion, usually a condensed form, though sometimes it
may be of far greater complexity than the full ordinary solution. In
this respect the nature of the function     / is of controlling importance.

506                            Mr. 0. Heaviside.                             [Feb.   2,
We need not assert that the determinateness of F from equation (1)
is true for all forms of the function Y that may be written down
arbitrarily ; but that it is true in the forms presenting themselves in
dynamical problems seems to be necessitated.
    5. We have, therefore, presented to us the problem of solving this
equation for any particular form of Y that occurs.                    This may be
very easy    and  obvious,   or  it may   be excessively    difficult  and obscure.
In the latter case it may be so merely because we do not know how
to do it. Then we should find out.            As our argument is that Y finds
F from /definitely, there should be definite rules for the manipula
tion of the operator Y, or of the expression Y/, for its conversion to
the form of an ordinary mathematical function, which will be the
solution in the usual sense, freed from differentiating operations.                 We
may    find how   to work   by   experiment.      For,  if two   different   methods
lead to different results, one of which we find to be correct by in
dependent tests, we can safely assert that one of the methods was
partly wrong, whilst the other may have been wholly correct.                    So by
practice we may come to know something about it.
   6. Again, the function Y, regarded as an algebraical function, may
admit of different forms of expression.               These are algebraically
equivalent,   but   to what    extent   they may    be  equivalent in their ana
                   —
lytical aspects for instance, one series involving differentiations
equivalent to another involving integrations, and leading to results
which are either identical or equivalent — cannot be safely said
beforehand.      It is, in its generality, a rather difficult and obscure
                                I
matter. In special cases find that forms of Y which are algebrai
cally equivalent are also analytically equivalent; but                    I have not
succeeded in determining the amount of latitude that is permissible
in the purely algebraical treatment of operators.              No doubt there are
 definite limitations, but they have to be found.                 I  have, however,
extensively employed the algebraical treatment experimentally,* sub
ject to independent tests for guidance.               It proved itself to be a
powerful (if somewhat uncertain) kind of mathematical machinery.
We may, for example, do in a line or two, work whose verification
by ordinary methods may be very lengthy. On the other hand, the
very reverse may be the case.            I  have, however, convinced myself
that the subject is one that deserves to be thoroughly examined and
elaborated by mathematicians, so that the method may be brought
into general use in mathematical physics, not to supplant ordinary
methods, but to supplement them ; in short, to be used when it is
found to be useful. As regards the theory of the subject, it is in
teresting in an unusual degree, and the interest is heightened by the
mystery that envelops certain parts of it.
   * The reader will find examples in my 'Electrical Papers,' vol.     2, of the treat
ment of irrational as well as rational operators.

     7. Perhaps the best way of beginning the subject, to obtain a
 good idea of the nature of the operators and the advantages
 attending their use, is through the theory of a connected system
 of linear electrical conductors.        For the electrical equations seem
 to be peculiarly fitted for the illustration of abstract dynamical
 properties in a clear manner, even when quite practical electro
 magnetic arrangements are concerned.           We know that we may, by
 the application of Ohm's law to every conductor (or to circuits of
 conductors), express the steady current C» in a conductor n due to an
 impressed force en in a conductor m by an equation
                                   C = YmHem,                           (2)
 where Ymn is some algebraical function of the resistances of the con
ductors — usually of all the resistances, although in special cases it
 may become independent of the values of some of them.                Now,
suppose     it is not the steady current that is wanted, but the   variable
current when em varies. The answer is obviously given by the same
 equation when the function Y involves only resistances ; that is, when
there is no storage of electric or magnetic energy, so that T is a con
stant not involving djdt. Then the flux and the force keep pace
 together, and their ratio does not vary. It is, however, less obvious
that the same equation should persist, in a generalized form, when
every branch of the system is made to be any electromagnetic
arrangement we please which would, in the absence of its connexions
 with the rest of the system, be a self-contained arrangement. To
obtain the generalized form of YmH we have merely to substitute for
 the resistances concerned the equivalent resistance operators.        That
is, instead of V = RC, where V is voltage, C current, and R resist
 ance, we have an equation V = ZC in general for every conductor,
where Z is the resistance operator appropriate to the nature of the
 conductor, which may be readily constructed from the electrical
particulars.       These Z's substituted 111 X mn in place of the R's make
eqnation (2) fully express the new connexion between the flux            C
and the force em.       There is much advantage in working with resis
tance     operators because they combine and are manipulated like
simple resistances. Of course (2) is really a differential equation,
though not in the form usually given. To make it an ordinary
differential equation we should clear of fractions, by performing such
operations upon both sides of (2) as shall remove denominators and
all inverse operations.       It is then spread out horizontally to a great
length (usually)     and  becomes   very unmanageable. Also, we lose sight
of the essential strncture of the operator Y.

508                            Mr. 0. Heaviside.                    [Feb. 2,
we may construct an infinite variety of resistance operators, and of
conductance operators, such              above. They are, however, always
algebraical functions of p, and are finite. If expanded, equation (2)
always becomes an ordinary linear eqnation of a finite number of
terms. But if we allow conduction in masses, or dielectric displace
ment in masses (with allowance for propagation in time), the finite
series we were previously concerned with become infinite series.
This, at first, appears a complication, but it may be quite the reverse,
for an infinite series following an easily recognized law may be more
manageable than a finite series.         Still, however, the equivalence to
ordinary    differential   equations persists, provided our arrangement is
bounded.       But when we remove this restriction, and permit free dis
sipation  of  energy in space (or equivalently), another kind of operators
comes into view. The complexity of the previous, due to the reaction
of the boundaries, is removed ; simpler forms of operators result, and
they do not necessarily admit of the equations taking the form of
ordinary differential equations, as they may be of an irrational nature.
This brings us necessarily to the study of generalized differentiation,
concerning which, more presently.
                    Operators admitting of Easy Treatment.
    9. In the meantime, notice briefly some of the ideas and devices
that occur generally in the treatment of operators.          First of all, we
may obtain the steady state of F due to steady /, when there can be
a steady state of F, by simply putting p = 0 in the operator          Y   con
necting    them,   p   meaning    djdt.  Even   when   there is no  resnltant
steady state of the flux, as when reflections from a boundary continue
for ever, the term F = Y0/ has its proper place and significance.
    Next, we may notice that if the form of Y should involve nothing
more than separate differentiations, as in
                             F = (a + bp + cp* +....)/,                    (3)
then all we have to do is to execute the differentiations to obtain F
from /.      When    /   is a continuous function, this presents nothing
special.    When     discontinuous,   however, a special treatment may be
needed.
    In  a similar   manner, there may be only separate       integrations   or
inverse differentiations indicated in Y, as when
                           F = (a + bp-i + cp-* + ....)f.                  (4)
Since   / is a definite function of the time, so are its successive time-
                               /
 integrals. In this case, may be discontinuous, and yet present no

difficulty.  Suppose it is zero before and constant after the moment
t = 0.    Then we shall have
                  P-y=fi,    &c,         p-"f=f--                      (5)
A   combination of direct and inverse operations, which frequently
occurs in the theory of waves, is exemplified in
                     F = c-t'l'(a + bp~l + cp~- +     )/.              (0)
Here    we may perform the integrations first, getting the result
<p(i) say, and then let the exponential operate, giving, by Taylor's
theorem,
                              F=0O-r/«).                               (7)
Or we may let the exponential operator work first, and then perform
the integrations.    This may be less easy to manage, on account of
the changed limits.
   Two important fundamental cases, which constitute working
formulae, are
                   F              and     F                            (8)

with unit operand, that is, =0 before and constant after t = 0.
Here we may expand in inverse powers of p, getting, in the first
case
                    F = (l + ap-1 + a'p-l+.. ..) =   6-',              (9)
and in the second case e~al. The latter expresses the effect of a
unit impulse in a system having one degree of freedom, with friction,
as when an impulsive voltage acts upon a coil.
    Solutions for Simple Harmonic, Impulsive, and Continued    Forces.
   10. A very important case, admitting of simple treatment, occurs
when the force is simple periodic, or a sinusoidal function of the
time. It may happen that the resulting state of F is also sinus
oidal.    For this to occur, there must be dissipation of energy, to
allow the initial departure from the simple periodic state to subside.
We then have p2 = — n' applied to F as well as /, where nj2ir is the
frequency ; so that the substitution of ni for p in Y brings equation
(1) to the form

the interpretation of the result may be valuable and instructive
physically.

Take p = ni in Y to convert the quantity to be integrated to an
algebraical form.
   Since a continuously varying force may be represented by a suc
cession of infinitesimal impulses, we see that a single time- integration
applied to (13), f0 being then a function of the time, gives us a form
of solution of the equation F = Y/, for any kind of      /

occur. It is, however, a theoretical rather than a practical form of
solution.   For it usually happens that the definite integral is quite
unamenable to evaluation.     The same may be often said of the solu
tion (18) for an impulse, and in snch cases it may be questioned
whether the form F = Y/ itself is not just as plain and intelligible.
In fact, in certain cases, a very good way to solve (or evaluate) a
solution in the form of a definite integral is to undo      or convert it

                  Partial Fractions and Normal Solutions.
   11.  There is also the method of partial fractions.     It is not always
applicable, and     is   especially inapplicable   when   the   removal of
boundaries drives the roots of the determinantal equation into con
tiguity.     But the application is very wide, nevertheless.            Put
Z = Y_1 ; then the solution of F = T/, when/ is constant, starting
when t = 0, is
where Z0 is the steady Z, got by taking p = 0 in Z, and the summa
tion ranges over the roots of the equation Z = 0, considered as an
algebraical equation in p. That is, p is entirely algebraical in (14).
Similarly, the effect of an impulse /0 is represented by
and from this again, by time-integration, we can obtain an expression
for the effect due to any varying /, which may be quite as un
manageable as the previous definite integral for the same.          On the
other hand, (14) and (15) furnish the most direct and practical way
of investigating certain kinds of problems, whether there be but a
few or an infinite number of degrees of freedom. This method is
the real foundation of all formulas for the expansion of arbitrary
functions in series of normal functions.          For, find the impressed
forcive that would keep up the arbitrary state. We may then apply
the above to every element of the forcive to find its effect, and by
integration throughout the system get the arbitrary functions ex
panded in normal functions.          Or, without reference to impressed
force, find the differential equation connecting any element of the
initial state and the effect it produces later. It will be of a form
similar to our F = T/, and it may be similarly solved by a series,
 which contains the expression of the expansion of the initial state in
 the proper functions.
    Or we may investigate the normal functions themselves, and em
 ploy their proper conjugate property to obtain the expansion repre
 senting any initial state.       But this method does not apply very
naturally to eqnations of the form we are considering.
       Decomposition   of an Operator into a Series of Wave Operators.
    12. There is also another method which contrasts remarkably with
 the previous, viz., to decompose the operator Y into a series of other
 operators of a certain type expressing the propagation of waves. This
 is best illustrated by an example. Suppose the question is, given an

 512                         Mr. 0. Heaviside.                    [Feb. 2.
 impressed force acting at one part of a long telegraph circuit, find the
 effect produced.     One way would be to first find the effect due to a
 simple periodic force ; from this the effect of an impulse follows ; and
 from the latter the effect due to any/.     A second way is by means of
 the normal functions, either through the conjugate property or by
 partial fractions.    Lastly, we may decompose the operator Y into
 operators of the form which would exist were the circuit infinitely
long, so that the effect of terminal reflections and absorptions does not
appear.     Say we have
                         F = (Y0+Yl+Y,+....)/.                        (16)
Then     F = Y0/ will    represent the initial wave from the source /,
whilst the rest   will express the succeeding reflected waves from the
terminations of the circuit.     The operators Yo, Ac., may be all of the
same type, so that it suffices to solve F = Y0/, that is, convert it to
au ordinary algebraic functional form, to obtain that form of the
complete solution which has the greatest physical meaning, inasmuch
as   it shows in detail the whole march of F in terms of f. So does the
solution in terms of normal functions, but not immediately, because
the successive waves are expressed in the form of an infinite series of
vibrating systems. Their resultant effect cannot be seen at once.
We might, indeed, almost say that the form of solution in successive
(or simultaneous) waves was the solution, being of the most explicit
nature. Should, however, the impressed force be of a distributed
nature, of the type suggested by a normal function, for example,
then clearly it is the expression in terms of waves that becomes com
plex and unnatural.       We also see that, although a direct transforma
tion from one form of solution to another may be wholly impracticable
algebraically, yet it may be readily carried out through the function
Y   as intermediary.
   Treatment  of an Irrational Operator.   Solutions in Ascending Series.
    13. The above general remarks are necessarily very sketchy. Some
of the matters mentioned may be returned to, but the object of the
preceding is merely to prepare the mind of the reader for the more
transcendental matter to follow. Let us now consider how to treat
irrational operators directly, without the assistance of definite integ
rals. The first form that presented itself to me was that exhibited
where p is djdi and R, S, K, L are constants. It occurs in the theory
of a submarine cable or other telegraph circuit, and in other problems.

1893.]           On Operators in Physical Mathematics.                 513
R   and  L are themselves differentiating operators of complicated form
in  general, or, more strictly, R+Lp is a resistance operator, say R",
of very complex form. Bat it is quite sufficient to take the form
R + Lp, where R is the effective resistance and L the inductance per
unit length of circuit.     S and K mean the permittance and leakage
conductance per unit length.
   Now we may readily obtain the simple periodic solution out of (17),
by the before-mentioned substitution p = ni ; and in doing so we may
use the general operator R", for that will then assume the form
R + Lp. From this solution a wholly uninterpretable definite integral
can be derived to express the effect of an impulse or of a steady im
pressed force.    The question was, how to obtain a plain understand
able solution from (17) itself to show the effect of a steady force.
To illustrate, we may here take merely the case in which K = 0, whilst
R and L are constants, because the inclusion of K (to be done later)
considerably complicates the results. We have then to solve
where a is a constant and p = djdt. The operand is understood to
                    /
be unity, that is, = 0 before and =1 after t = 0. It is needless to
write unit operands, and it facilitates the working to omit them.
Now, the first obvious suggestion is to employ the binomial theorem

     14. There is such a perfect harmony in all the above transforma
tions,  without a single hitch, that you are tempted at first to think that
you may do whatever you like with the operators in the way of alge
braical transformation.     There is a considerable amount of truth in
this, but it is not wholly true. I shall show later some far more
comprehensive     and surprising transformations     effected by simple
means.    At the same time                   I
                                     should emphasize the necessity of
caution  and  of frequent  verification, for no matter how sweetly the
algebraical treatment of operators may work sometimes, it is subject
at other times (owing to our ignorance) to the most flagrant failures.
   But in the above we only utilized one way of effecting the binomial
expansion.     There is a second way, viz., in ascending powers of the
differentiator.   The two forms are algebraically equivalent so far as
the convergency allows, but we have, so far, no reasou to suppose
that they are analytically equivalent. But on examination we find
that they are. Thus, using the first of (25) and expanding, we
get

 calculating the value of tbe function.      It is, however, the series for
 practical  use when  at is big enough   to  make calculation by the con
 vergent ascending series very lengthy.        Stop when the convergency
 of (31) ceases.    The result   will be   too   big.  Leave out the last
 oounted term, and the result is too small.         Counting only half the
 last convergent term, the result is nearly right, being a little too
 big. There seems no possible way of hitting the exact value.           But
 still, when at is big, we can get quite close enough, to four or
 more figures, or any other number we please when at is sufficiently
 increased.
                         Fractional Differentiation.
    15.  Knowing in the above manner pi, the values of pi, pi, &c., follow
 by complete differentiations. But although, on the basis of tbe above,
a considerable amount of work may be done, and extensions made,
yet it is desirable to stop for a moment.        For the whole question of
generalized differentiation is raised.     The operator pr presents itself
 in analogous problems, along with pi, &c. We want a general method
of treating p", when n is not confined to be integral. Notice, however,
in passing a remarkable peculiarity of the above investigation.          If
we had put L = 0 in (17), as well as K = 0, we should have had the
form Y =pi to consider at the beginning, with no evident means of
treating it. By taking, on the other hand, a more general case, as we
did, we avoided the fractional differentiation altogether, and easily
obtained a convergent solution, viz., (21), through (18), (19), and
(20). It is not always that we simplify by generalizing.
    The snm total of the whole information contained in my mathe
matical library on the subject of generalized differentiation is con
tained in the remark made on p. 197 of the second part of Thomson
and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy,' paragraph (n), relating to the
process by which spherical harmonics of any degree may be derived
from the reciprocal of a distance : — " The investigation of this gene
ralized differentiation presents difficulties which are confined to the
evaluation of P„ and which have formed the subject of interesting
mathematical investigations by Liouville, Gregory, Kelland, and
others."
   I   was somewhat struck with this remark when I first read it, in
trying to plough my way through the fertile though rather heavy field
of Thomson and Tait, but as the subject was no sooner mentioned than
it was dropped, it passed out of mind. Nor did the absence of any
reference to the subject in other mathematical works, and in papers
concerning mathematical physics generally, tend to preserve my re
collection of the remark.    Only when the subject was forced upon my
attention in the above manner did      I  begin to investigate it, and not
having access to the authorities quoted, I was compelled to work it oat

myself. I cannot say that my results are quite the same, though there
must, I think, be a general likeness. I can, however, say that it is a very
interesting subject, and deserves to be treated in works on the Integral
Calculus, not merely as a matter concerning differentiation, but
because it casts light upon mathematical theory generally, even upon
the elements thereof.      And as regards the following brief sketch,
however imperfect it may be, it has at least the recommendation of
having been worked out in a mind uncontaminated by the prejudices
engendered by prior knowledge acquired at second hand.              do not            I
say  it is the better for that, however.

  16. The question is, what is the meaning of v"> if V signify djdx,
•when n has any value ?  This is, no doubt, partly a matter of con
vention   ;but apart from all conventions, there must be fundamental
laws involved. Now observe that the effect of a whole differentiation
V upon the function x* is to lower the degree by unity. This applies
universally when n is not integral. "When it is integral, there seem
to be exceptions.     But we can scarcely suppose that there is a real
breach  of  continuity in the property. We also observe that a whole
differentiation v multiplies by the index, making v** = nx*~l ; and
again there are apparent exceptions.     Now the first thing to do is to
get rid of the exceptions. Next, the obvious conclusion from one v
lowering the index by unity, v2 hy two, and so on, is that v" lowers
the degree n times, whether n be integral or fractional. Further, since

infinity  for all negative values of n. Similarly, (39) .becomes (l — 1)_",
which is zero for all negative and infinity for all positive values
of n. That is, from vanishing at detached points, the functions vanish
all the way between them as well. Besides, apart from this, we cannot
have the value of |» correct when n is integral.
   We may, however, readily set the matter right. To get rid of the
infinity on one side and vanishing all over on the other side of the
 origin, multiply the functions (38), (40) by r" and (3?), (41) by r~*.
 Take
          ^ = r-»(l-l)-" = r-»(l               +       «)(l

We now satisfy all the requirements of the case, and when       infinite         r   is
make the iuvei-se factorial curve (37) be a continuous curvo from — oo
to +co, subject to (34), in agreement with the known values when                                n
is positively integral, and harmonizing with the generalized dif
ferentiation in (33).
  Multiplying (42) and (43') together, we obtain

The multiplication therefore brings all the equidistant roots into playr
on both sides of the origin. .

   for all values of n, the right member is really          a^/jo,  and means 0 on
   the left, and   1 on the right side of the origin of x.         That is, it is the
   limiting   form   of  the fnnction  xn/\n, when  * is infinitely small positive.
   It is convenient in the treatment of equations of the form F =              Tf   to

   Imagine the unit amount of a quantity spread along an infinitely long
  line to become all massed at the origin.            Its linear density will, in
  the limit, be represented by, as (12) is derived from (11),

     It  is zero except at x — 0. But its integral is still finite, being

  infinite point, and so on. But it is the function v1 that is most
  useful in connexion with differentiating operations, whilst the others
  are less prominent.
     But when n is taken to be< infinitely small negative in y =
  then y drops from oo to.l near the origin, or the corner is turned the
 other way. That is, the function x" is unstable when n is zero.                   It
  is the difference, of the curves y = x" with n infinitely small positive,

     18a.  It will  be seen by (42) that our factorial function is the gamma
 function of Euler somewhat modified and extended.                 Thus, when n is
                      l

But when n is less than —1 we have the oscillatory carve of t'i

the gamma       function expressed        in   \n   = T(n + l) is so exceedingly
inconvenient in generalized differentiation that the factorial function
had better be used constantly.    For completeness and reference, we
may add the general formula.        Take the logarithm of (42) and

to substitute the generalized exponential for the ordinary, and there

I  make to be 2815 71 by the ordinary formnla, and 2815-75 by (78),
including the semi-convergent part. But the last two figures are
probably wrong, as there is a good deal of figuring involved in the
calculation of both (72) and the convergent series in (78).
    When smaller values of x are taken, the numerical agreement per
sists as far as the initial convergency of the descending series permits,
as in the case of the series (31), for example.                         Later on I will co

We might expect this to be a form of the oscillatory function J0(*).
Bat it is not. It represents the oscillatory companion to J<>(z), say
 G0(x), which maybe exhibited in an ascending >series of the whole

at infinity.     This function will appear later. The double series (79)

         Lecturer on Chemistry and Physics in St. Mary's Hospital
         Medical School. Received January 5, 1893.
   In the previous six papers* it              has been shown that when silver is
                  for tin       " solvent    "   metal the critical curve deduced is
substituted                as
uniformly raised, whether the two immiscible metals emploved be
lead and zinc, bismuth and zinc, lead and aluminium, or bismuth and
aluminium ; it was thought desirable to examine similarly the effects
of other solvent metals, more especially cadmium and antimony, direct
experiments having shown that these metals respectively are miscible
in all proportions whilst molten with either lead, bismuth, or zinc ;
although in some cases more or less marked segregation of the metals
from one another takes place on cooling so that solidification commences.
Accordingly the experiments described below were made with zinc as
lighter immiscible metal ; but on substituting aluminium for zinc, so
as to prepare ternary alloys containing lead (or bismuth), aluminium,
and cadmium (or antimony), it was found that the close analogy
between zinc and aluminium found in Part VI to subsist in alloys
containing one or other of these metals along with lead (or bismuth)
and tin (or silver) breaks down with these other combinations ; in
the case of the alloys where cadmium is the solvent metal, because
molten cadmium and aluminium (contrary to the usual statements in
the text-books) are not completely miscible together, like zinc and
aluminium, but behave as lead and aluminium, or bismuth and
aluminium, the heavier metal dissolving only a fe*v tenths per cent,
of aluminium, whilst this latter dissolves only some 2 or 3 per cents,
of the other metal ; and in the case of the alloys where antimony is
the solvent, because aluminium and antimony combine together to
form a most remarkable compound, represented by the formula
AlSb.f which possesses a melting point higher by upwards of 340° C.
than that of the least fusible of its constituents ; thus, whilst an
timony melts at about 432° C, and aluminium at below 700° C.
(varying somewhat according to its purity or otherwise), the com
pound AlSb appears (from observations kindly made for the anthor
by Professor Roberts- Austen with the Le Chatelier pyrometer) to have
a solidifying point close to that of gold, viz., 1045°. The effect of the

tendency towards the formation of this difficultly fusible compound
with alloys richer in antimony is to cause a partial separation of
antimony and aluminium thus combined together in the form of solid
particles when the melted alloy is allowed to stand for some time at
temperatures not exceeding some 900° ; which separation interferes
with the accurate tracing ont of the upper portions of the critical
curve.
     The discus3ion in detail of the results obtained with ternary alloys,
containing simultaneously aluminium and cadmium (or antimony) is
postponed to a future communication ; but it may be here noticed
that ternary alloys, such as aluminium, cadmium, and lead, or
aluminium, cadmium, and bismuth, belong to a class different from
that of the ternary alloys hitherto examined.        Calling the three con
stituents A, B, and C respectively, three pairs of metals may be
 formed, viz., AB, AC, and BC. In the alloys previously described,
one only of these pairs consists of two metals not miscible together in
all proportions, e.g., in the case of lead, zinc, and tin, the pair lead
 and zinc are immiscible ; whilst the pairs lead and tin, zinc and tin
 are perfectly miscible.    With alloys of the aluminium-cadminm-lead
 class, on the other hand, two pairs of immiscible metals exist, e.g.,
 aluminium and cadmium, and aluminium and lead. The effect of
 this difference is to modify very largely the nature of the critical
 curve deducible by means of the triangular method of graphical
 representation.
     A priori, there seems no reason why a ternary alloy could not exist
 of a third class, where all three pairs of metal are immiscible ; hitherto,
 however, the author has not met with such a case in actual practice.
  If mixed in approximately equal quantities of the three constituents,
 such an alloy should divide itself into three different ternary alloys,
 forming three different layers, viz., one consisting of A, with a small
 admixture of B and C ; another chiefly containing B, with a little
  A and C ; and a third principally consisting of C, together with a
  little A and B. Although metallic mixtures of this class have not
  been obtained so far, other sets of three liquids have been found
 possessing this peculiar physical character ; thus a mixture of w it.tr,
 castor oil (genuine — not largely adulterated with other kinds of fixed
  oil), and petroleum hydrocarbons (such as ordinary kerosine) separates
  into three layers when well shaken up and then allowed to stand.

poured into hot clay test-tubes, and kept 7 8 hours in the lead bath.
To diminish possible volatilisation of cadmium, the temperature
employed was somewhat lowered, so that it always lay between 550°
and 650°, averaging near to 600°.
   The analysis of the alloys .containing lead, zinc, and cadmium was
effected by dissolving in nitric acid and evaporating with sulphuric
acid ; the filtrate from the lead sulphate was diluted, further acidulated
with hydrochloric acid, and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen till all
cadmium was precipitated.          The cadmium sulphido thus thrown
down generally     carried down  more  or less zinc sulphide ; to separate
this, the mixed sulphides were dissolved in a little hot concen
trated hydrochloric acid, diluted, and again treated with sulphur
etted hydrogen, the process being repeated when necessary, till no
more zinc was contained in the filtrate.          The cadmium sulphide
finally obtained was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and bromine
water added in excess to destroy sulphuretted hydrogen ; finally,
the cadmium was precipitated boiling by sodium carbonate, and
ultimately weighed as CdO. The acid liquors containing zinc were
united and treated with ammonia and ammonium sulphide, the zinc
sulphide being finally converted into carbonate and weighed as ZnO.
correction being made for traces of Fe203 when prespnt.
   The alloys containing bismuth instead of lead were examined in
the same way, excepting that the alloy was dissolved in nitro-hydre-
chloric acid, and the solution evaporated        to dryness and treated
with a large bulk of water, so as to separate the bismuth as oxy-
chloride. This oxychloride was boiled with ammonium sulphide to
remove chlorine (which is apt to interfere with proper conversion
into carbonate), and the resulting bismuth sulphide dissolved in
nitric acid, the solution being precipitated boiling with ammonia
and ammonium carbonate,           and the bismuth finally weighed         as
Bi,03.
                   Mixtures of Lead, Zinc, and Cadmium.
    The following figures were obtained as the averages from the
 examination of 24 compound ingots (48 alloys).           In the mixtures
 used for deducing the earlier ties, the lead and zinc were used in
 about equal quantities ; subsequently the proportion of lead was
 increased relatively to the zinc, until finally the two metals were
 employed in about the ratio 10 to 1, this being found necessary to
 bring about the formation of the lighter and heavier alloys in not
 widely different quantities. The percentages are uniformly reckoned
 «>n the sum of the weights of the three metals found as 100.

    Obviously, this configuration strongly suggests that a definite
 atomic compound PbjCd exists, the tendency towards the forma
 tion of which is the cause of the convergence together of the tie lines;
 as in the analogous case with lead-zinc-tin alloys (Part V), where a
 similar convergence suggests the existence of the definite compound
 SnZn4.
    Some observations  were   made at temperatures a   little higher than
 those employed in the foregoing experiments, the result of which
 was to indicate that the critical curve is somewhat rapidly lowered in
 position with a raised temperature, at any rate, as regards its upper
 most portion.   Thus, at temperatures ranging between 600° and 700°,
 and averaging about 650°, or some 50° higher than before, it was
  found that no separation at all took place with a mixture containing

    On contrasting together the two critical curves thus obtained with
cadmium as solvent it is noticeable that in this case also the same
 rule is observed as was found to hold in all the previously-described
 cases, viz., that, cceteris paribus, the subsiitutioyi of bismuth for zinc as
 the heavier of the two immiscible metals depresses the curve.               As
 regards the direction of slope of the tie lines, however, it is remark
 able that with cadmium as solvent the ties slope uniformly to the left
 with lead, and to the right with bismuth, as the heavier immiscible
 metal.    With silver as solvent all ties slope to the left whether lead
 or bismuth be the heavier immiscible metal, and whether zinc or
 aluminium be the lighter one ; whilst with tin as solvent the opposite

is the case, the t ies here all sloping to the right, with the exception of
the lower ties in the case of the mixtures lead-tin-zinc and lead-tin-
alumininm;      this exception being presumably due, as previously
described, to the iufluence of the endency towards the formation of
a definite compound of lead and tin, PbjSn.
Alloys containing Zinc with Lead     {or Bismuth) and Antimony as Solvent.
    These experiments were made in the same way as before, the only
difference being that the temperatures at which the mixtures were
kept in tranquil fusion lay between 600° and 700°, averaging near
to 650°.
    The resulting alloys were analysed by dissolving in diluted aqua
regia, precipitating by sulphuretted hydrogen (after copious further
dilution), separating antimony from lead (or bismuth) sulphide by
repeated treatment with ammonium sulphide, and finally collecting on
a weighed filter the mixed sulphur and antimony sulphide thrown
down on acidulating the filtrate, and heating a known fraction of
the dried precipitate in a current of carbon dioxide so as to expel
 sulphur and leave antimony sulphide. In the case of lead alloys the
lead sulphide left undissolved was dissolved in nitric acid, eva
porated with sulphuric acid, and the lead sulphate finally obtained
 weighed as such ; when the acid filtrate from this contained small
 quantities of zinc (as occasionally happened, owing to zinc sulphide
 being carried down along with lead and antimony sulphides) this
 liquid was added to the first zinc-containing filtrate, and the two
 jointly precipitated with ammonia and ammonium sulphide, the zinc
 being ultimately transformed into carbonate, and weighed as ZnO as
 usual, correction being made for traces of FejOj when present.          In
 the case of bismuth alloys, the bismuth sulphide left undissolved by
 ammonium sulphide was dissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated
 boiling by ammonium carbonate.          When zinc was present (carried
 down as sulphide, as before) this was chiefly found in the ammonium
 carbonate filtrate ; sometimes, however, traces were carried down with
  this basic bismuth carbonate ; these were separated by dissolving the
  weighed impure Bi203 in hydrochloric acid, evaporating to dryness,
  diluting the residue largely with water, and filtering off from the
 precipitated bismuth oxychloride.
     In all cases the analyses were calculated taking the sums of the
  weights of the three metals found as 100.

     The following average values were deduced from fourteen com
 pound ingots (twenty-eight alloys), the proportion between       lead and
  zinc throughout being near to equality : —

   Here the bismuth and zinc are in proportions near to those indicated
by the formula BiZn8 ; with tin, silver, and cadmium as solvent
metals the corresponding proportions were respectively near to those
indicated by BiZnw, BiZn2, and BiZn5.
    It is noticeable that the limiting point thus deduced is the highest
point of the entire curve ; whereas, in every one of the other eleven
curves so far investigated, the limiting point lies on one side or the
other of the highest point, and more or less lower down.
   Two remarkable irregularities are visible in the contour of the
above-deduced critical curve for antimony-bismuth-zinc alloys ; on
the right-hand side a peculiar notch or depression               is noticeable,
strongly suggesting a phenomenon similar in character to that pre
viously observed in the case of silver-zinc-lead and silver-zinc-bismuth
alloys ; i.e., the formation of a definite compound of solvent with one
of the two immiscible metals more soluble in the other of these two
metals than any other neighbouring mixture of the two in other pro
portions. On the left-hand side an analogous, but far wider, de
pression is observable.       These depressions reach their greatest depths
at the 7th tie line, where at each of the two conjugate points the
ratio between the bismuth and antimony present is not far from that
corresponding with the formula BijSbj.

    Experiments now in progress indicate that an analogous depression
exists in the critical curve obtained with antimony-bismuth- aluminium
alloys, also most strongly marked at a point where the bismuth and
antimony are in proportions not far from that corresponding with
 BijSb,.
    On comparing together the two curves deduced with antimony as
solvent it is noticeable that they show the same general characters as
t he corresponding pair of curves similarly obtained with cadmium as
solvent; i.e., whilst the curve with bismuth as heavier immiscible
metal lies inside that with lead (as in all other similar cases as yet-
examined), the direction of slope of tie lines is opposite in the two

cases  ; viz., uniformly to the right with bismuth and to the left with
lead. It is remarkable, however, that this relationship does not hold
when aluminium is substituted for zinc, the experiments now in pro
gress indicating that the ties then always slope to the left, whether lead
or bismuth be the heavier immiscible metal.
   On comparing together the three sets of critical curves deduced for
temperatures not far apart (600 —650°) with tin, cadmium, and
antimony respectively as solvent metal, it is noticeable that whether
bismuth or lead be the heavier immiscible metal the curve with
cadmium as solvent lies outside, and that with antimony inside, the
curve deduced with tin as solvent. The curves obtained with silver
as solvent cannot properly be directly compared with these on account
of the higher temperatures (800 — 870°) employed ; but, judging from
the marked effect of a rise of temperature in depressing the critical
curves obtained with cadmium as solvent, it seems probable that for
the same temperature the curve with silver as solvent would be found
to lie outside of that with cadmium as solvent, the two immiscible
metals being the same.         At any rate, in all cases the curve with
silver as solvent   lies far  outside that similarly obtained with tin as
solvent.
   In the case of alloys containing aluminium as lighter immiscible
metal, it has been shown (Part VI) that with silver as solvent the
critical curve also lies outside that obtained with tin as solvent,
whether bismuth or lead be the heavier immiscible metal.              The
experiments now in progress seem to indicate that the corresponding
curves with antimony as solvent lie again inside the curves deduced
with tin as solvent. As already stated, corresponding curves with
cadmium as solvent cannot be obtained, as the immiscibility of
aluminium and cadmium causes the resulting ternary alloys to belong
to an entirely different class, the critical curves pertaining to which
cannot be directly compared with those belonging to ternary mixtures
analogous to the twelve so far investigated.
   Much of the analytical work requisite for the above experiments
was carried out by Mr. Sydney Joyce, to whom the author's acknow
ledgments are due for the assistance rendered.

I. " Preliminary Account of the Arrangement of the Sympa
          thetic Nervous System, based chiefly on Observations
          upon Pilo-motor Nerves." By J. N. Langley, F.R.S.,
          Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Received January
          21, 1893.
                                     [Plate   14.]
    I  propose to give here a general statement of some of the conclu
sions which        I have come to with regard to the arrangement of the
sympathetic nervous system, reserving detailed treatment for a later
time. As a starting point          I  take the distribution of the pilo-motor
nerves in the cat.*
    In the cat, the spinal nerves which contain pilo-motor fibres in their
nerve-roots, are usually the 4th thoracic to the 3rd lumbar inclusive.
Such fibres are, in rare cases, present in the 3rd thoracic nerve, and
occasionally in the 4th lumbar nerve.
   • A certain number of facts with regard to this, I have given in an earlier paper
written in conjunction with Dr. Sherrington.         Dr. Sherrington dealt with the
                                         '
pilo-motor nerves in the monkey (cf. Journ. of Physiol.,' vol. 12, p. 278, 1891).
    VOL.   LII.                                                        2 0

 548           Mr. J. N. Langley.     On  the Arrangement         [Feb. 9,
    The spinal pilo-motor fibres run into the sympathetic trunk, there
they become connected with nerve-cells ; on leaving the sympathetic
chain, they run to their peripheral endings in cranial or spinal
nerves.    The fibres to the body accompany those dorsal cutaneous
branches of the spinal nerves which supply the skin over and close
to the vertebra.
    Broadly speaking, the pilo-motor fibres run from the sympathetic
chain to the cranial and spinal nerves in the grey rami, but a few
fibres may run out in the white rami ; and in some of the upper
thoracic rami, as is well known, no anatomically separable white rami
occur.
   Broadly speaking, the fibres issuing from any one ganglion are con
nected  with nerve-cells in that ganglion, and with no other sympa
thetic nerve-cell. In some cases a certain number of such fibres are
connected with nerve-cells, not in the ganglion from which they issue,
but in the ganglion immediately above or below it. In the following
statement these fibres, and those which may take the course of the
white rami, are, for the sake of simplicity, left out of account.
   The fibres, before and after they have joined nerve-cells, I shall call
respectively pre-ganglionic or pre-cellular, and post-ganglionic or
post-cellular.
   Each ganglion, by its post-ganglionic fibres, supplies, in any one
individual, a definite portion of skin. This portion varies somewhat
in different individuals.   The more important variations only will be
mentioned here.
   The areas supplied by the ganglia from above downwards, starting
with the superior cervical ganglion, are, apart from a variable amount
of overlapping, successive areas.
   An overlapping of the areas occurs when one nerve receives post
ganglionic fibres by more than one ramus ; thus the 3rd cervical
nerve, and so the skin of the upper part of the neck, may receive
pilo-motor fibres from the superior cervical ganglion by one grey
ramus, and from the ganglion stellatum by another grey ramus ; not
uncommonly the 7th lumbar nerve, and so the skin over the upper
coccygeal vertebras, receives pilo-motor fibres by two separate grey
rami, one from the 7th lumbar ganglion, and the other from the
1st sacral ganglion.      Similarly, also, a lower thoracic, or upper
lumbar, nerve may receive pilo-motor fibres by the grey ramus of ita
own ganglion, and others by the white ramus which it gives off to
the ganglion below.
   A second cause of overlapping is a spreading out of the pilo-motor
fibres in the skin itself.    When two successive grey rami, or two
successive dorsal cutaneous branches, are stimulated one after the
other, the area of skin affected by both of them may be not more
than 5 to I mm.; but it may be about 5 mm., and in such case the

  1893.]           of the Sympathetic Nervous    System.               543
 "exclusive"   area   of a ramus may be about a half only of the total
 area supplied by   it.
    A third cause of over-lapping may be the formation of a plexus in
 the dorsal cutaneous branches of the spinal nerves ; this is, perhaps,
 the cause of some of the cases of over-lapping of areas which     I have
observed in the sacral and coccygeal regions.
    Most of the details with regard to the over-lapping of the areas we
 may leave on one side, and, treating the areas as successive, proceed
 to consider their position.
    The cranial rami of the superior cervical ganglion supply the
skin of the dorsal part of the head, except a posterior portion, begin
ning about 1^ cm. behind the anterior level of the ears ; this unaffected
region we may call the occipital region.
    The cervical rami of the superior cervical ganglion supply the
skin of the occipital region of the head by fibres running in the great
occipital (2nd cervical) nerve, and the skin over the first three or
four cervical vertebrte by fibres running in the 3rd cervical nerve.
    The ganglion stellatum, by its cervical rami, supplies the skin from
the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebra? to some point between the spine
of the 2nd and 3rd thoracic vertebra.           Often its area extends
upwards to join the occipital region.
    The areas supplied by the post-ganglionic pilo-motor fibres of the
3rd 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical nerves vary in relative size in different
individuals ; roughly, we may take the 3rd nerve as supplying the
skin over the first three and a half vertebras, and the others as supply
ing successive strips of about two vertebras each.
    We come now to the fore leg region, in which one, two, or three
spinal nerves send no cutaneous branches to the mid-line of the back.
These are the 7th and 8th cervical, and the 1st thoracic, nerves.
    Sometimes the 7th, sometimes the 1st, thoracic has such a cutaneous
branch ; when it is present it contains pilo-motor nerves.        I  have
not, in any case, observed any such cutaneous branch from the
8th cervical nerve. Corresponding to the presence or absence of these
cutaneous branches — so far as my experiments go — is the presence or
absence of pilo-motor fibres in the rami which pass from the ganglion
stellatum to the respective nerves.      Thus, if the 1st thoracic nerve
sends a branch to the skin over the vertebrae, stimulation of its ramus,
as of the branch itself, canses a movement of hairs.
   In the two experiments in which there was a mid-line cutaneous
branch from the 7th cervical nerve, it supplied the lower part of the
area usually supplied by the 6th nerve, the area of this and of the 5th
and 4th nerves lying a little more anteriorly than usual.
   The ganglion stellatum also sends pilo-motor fibres to the first four
thoracic nerves.    From the 5th thoracic nerve downwards (and some
times from the 4th) there is a ganglion and ramus for each nerve.

550           Mr.  J.  N. Langley.          On   the Arrangement    [Feb. 9,
The distribution of all these rami down to the 4th lumbar we may
consider together.
   The area of the 2nd thoracic ramus (or of the 1st, as mentioned
above) follows on the area of the lowest effective cervical ramus.
The 4th lumbar ramus supplies either the skin over the 7th lumbar
vertebra and a small piece of sacrum, or the skin over the sacrum.
Between the limits just given for the 2nd thoracic and the 4th
lumbar the areas follow on each other, the length of each area
being about that of a vertebra. There are variations in the relative
length of the areas in different animals, but, generally speaking, we
may say that in the thoracic region the areas are a little larger than the
neighbouring vertebrae, and in the upper lumbar region a little shorter.
   Below the 4th lumbar nerve we reach the hind leg region, which is
like that of the fore leg already mentioned, in so far as one, two, or
three nerves have no dorsal cutaneous branches to the mid-line,
and the corresponding rami have no pilo-motor fibres.                  These
nerves are the 5th, 6th, and 7th lumbar.                On the rami of these
nerves I have made many more experiments than on the rami of the
ganglion stellatum, and, no doubt in consequence, I have found
greater variation.     Thus, as   I  have said, I have not so far observed
any case in which the ramus to the 8th cervical nerve contained
pilo-motor fibres.    In the lumbar region the 6th nerve is that which
most frequently has no pilo-motor fibres, but in two cases it appa
rently did contain some ; it is worth mention that in these cases
the lumbo-sacral plexus was an extreme form of my Class I* (posterior
type of arrangement, part of Sherrington'sf post-fixed plexus), the
7th nerve sending a filament to the obturator. The 5th lumbar ramus
has pilo-motor fibres more commonly than the 7th.
   About the end of the sacrum appears to be the dividing line between
the areas of the rami which come from above and those which come
from below the ineffective ramus or rami. Thus the skin over the
lower part of the sacrum may be supplied by the 4th, 5th, or, perhaps,
the 6th lumbar ramus, the skin over the upper coccygeal vertebra? by
the 7th lumbar or 1st sacral. In each case there are one or more nerves,
lying between the nerve which supplies the lower part of the sacral
region and that which supplies the upper coccygeal region, which con
tain no pilo-motor fibres. This dividing line in the experiments in which
1 have specially noted the point has only varied from a position mid
way between the spine of the 2nd and 3rd sacral vertebra) to a
position a little below the spine of the 3rd sacral vertebra.           As I
have indicated earlier, the corresponding line in the upper thoracic
region also appears to undergo very slight variations.            J  All the

other dividing lines between the areas vary not inconsiderably in
position.
    The 2nd sacral ramns, as a rnle, supplies the hairs of the tail just
above the level of the anus and over it ; the 3rd sacral ramus supplies
the hairs for about an inch and a half below the level of the anus.
The coccygeal ganglion gives off rami to the several coccygeal nervee,
and these supply different lengths of the tail. This ganglion supplies
by its rami the whole, or nearly the whole, of the tail.
    The distribution of the pilo-motor post-ganglionic fibres of each
spinal nerve, i.e., of the fibres which run to each spinal nerve from
the sympathetic system, can also be determined by stimulating the
nerve inside the spinal canal.           This method depends upon the
spreading of the current down the nerve to its dorsal branch, in
which the pilo-motor fibres run. In most cases rather strong shocks
are required ; in others, as in the sacral region, moderate shocks are
sufficient. A similar spreading down of the current to the ventral
branches of the nerves may perhaps be the explanation of the
assertion that the lower lumbar nerves contain direct spinal secretory
and vaso-motor fibres for the foot.         When a spinal nerve sends pilo
motor fibres (pre-ganglionic fibres) to the sympathetic, as well as
receiving some from it (post-ganglionic fibres), the two can readily
be distinguished by injecting nicotine.          This cuts out the effect of
the pre-ganglionic, but not that of the post-ganglionic, fibres.
    So far, I have been chiefly concerned with the description of the
portion of the dorsal skin innervated by each ganglion through its
grey ramus. The next question to consider is the connexion of each
ganglion with the spinal cord.         Like the other questions dealt with
here, this must be treated somewhat broadly, since there are more
or less pronounced individual variations.
    In the following table I give what appear to be the ordinary con
nexions* in an animal in which the 4th lumbar nerve and the 6th
lumbar sympathetic grey ramus contain no pilo-motor fibres.                I  omit
the connexion of the 4th and 5th spinal nerves with the sympathetic
ganglia.    I  insert the connexions of some spinal nerves which do
not contain pilo-motor fibres.       In the left-hand vertical column, the
numbers refer to the spinal nerves arranged in order, beginning with
the 1st thoracic. The numbers placed in a horizontal line with the
number of each spinal nerve represent the sympathetic ganglia in
which its fibres make connexion with nerve-cells to issue in the
corresponding grey rami.          S.c.g. and g.st. are used respectively
for the superior cervical ganglion and the ganglion stellatum. When
oither of these, or the number of a ganglion, is enclosed in brackets,

1893.]                of the  Sympathetic Nervous System.                        553
it indicates that the connexion of the spinal nerve with the gang
lion has been determined, not by pilo-motor,                    but by some other,
fibres.
    The facts given in the table, together with those given earlier
regarding the distribution of the rami of the ganglia, show the
areas of the skin which are supplied by the pilo-motor fibres issuing
from the cord in the roots of each spinal nerve given in the table.
    Can we from these data deduce any conclusions with regard to the
distribution of the other sympathetic fibres of the spinal nerves ?
    I have said that the pilo-motor fibres to the skin over the vertebra?
run to the periphery in the dorsal cutaneous branches of the spinal
nerves.      It is easily shown that the area of the skin supplied with
pilo-motor fibres by the dorsal cutaneous branch of any given spinal
nerve is also supplied by it with sensory fibres.                      I
                                                                 And think there
is good reason for believing that the fibres of the grey ramus of a
nerve, i.e., the post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres of a spinal nerve,
have, in the main, the same distribution in the skin as the sensory
 fibres of the nerve.
    The chief physiological observations on the distribution of sensory
fibres in the skin are those of Tiirck,* made on the dog, and of
 Sherrington,t made on the monkey. These observations give the
sensory areas of both dorsal and ventral cutaneous branches.                       To
compare with these, we have the pilo-motor nerves of a portion of
the dorsal cutaneous branches, and the secretory nerves of certain
ventral cutaneous branches running to the hind foot.                J    There would
be no advantage in attempting here to discuss in detail the degree of
coincidence in the areas of the sensory and of the visceral fibres, and
chiefly because, in many cases at any rate, a given spinal nerve in any
 one of the animals has not an exactly corresponding spinal nerve in the
other two animals.           But, in my opinion, the correspondence            in the
areas of the sympathetic          and    the sensory    fibres,  so far as we know
them, is close enough to justify the conclusion that the sensory and
the post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres in any spinal nerve have, in the
main, the same distribution.              The chief point which may be urged
against this view is that, according to Sherrington, the areas of the
 sensory fibres of the dorsal and upper lumbar spinal nerves largely
 overlap. § An overlapping of pilo-motor fibres as great as that found
 by him for sensory fibres has not occurred in my experiments. On
 the other hand, it is to be remembered, that in my experiments—

  whenever the matter was tested — the pilo-motor area of a cutaneous
  branch was found to be supplied with sensory fibres from the same
  branch ; that there is a certain amount of overlapping in the pilo
  motor areas of successive cutaneous branches ; and that the sym
  pathetic fibres of any given kind may have a rather less or rather
  greater extension than the sensory fibres with which they run.
     Of the distribution of sympathetic fibres to muscles we have no
  information, but, if the view I have given above is true, it establishes
  a probability that such of these fibres as may run in a given grey
  ramus to a nerve would have approximately the same distribution as
  the muscular branches of the nerve.
     We have seen that at the origin of the nerves for the arm and for
  the leg, one, two, or three grey rami contain no pilo-motor fibres.
  Let us consider a simple case, say, when the 6th lumbar grey ramus
  has no pilo-motor fibres.       Five spinal nerves, the 12th, 13th thoracic,
 the 1st, 2nd, 3rd lumbar, give off nerve-fibre3, which leave the sym
 pathetic by each of the grey rami of six or seven ganglia in the
 neighbourhood of, and including, the 6th lumbar ganglion.*                 Of this
 series of rami, the 6th lumbar is about the last supplied by the
  12th thoracic, and about the first supplied by the 3rd lumbar nerve
  (c/. table above). Further, each of these spinal nerves has abundant
 pilo-motor fibres, and sends them to every ramus except the 6th
 lumbar. Why is it that the pilo-motor fibres of each nerve skip this
 particular ramus, skipping it wherever it comes in the series of rami
 supplied by the nerve ?          And, further, why do variations occur in
 different animals, so that any one or all of the grey rami of the 5th,
 6th, or 7th lumbar ganglion may have no pilo-motor fibres ?
     The proximate explanation I take to be that the sympathetic ganglia
 develop in connexion with the spinal nerve-roots ; t that, as is now
 generally believed, the number of consecutive nerve-roots passing
 out in a particular spinal nerve varies ; that the sympathetic fibres
issuing from the sympathetic ganglion to run to the nerve follow
 in the main the course of the nerve ; and that probably the connexion
 of the ganglion with the cord by the white rami is a subsequent
event.      The following diagram represents the chief points of this
 explanation.
     A   detailed account of the facts summarised above             I  hope to be
 able to give in no long time, and then, also, I hope to deal with one
 or two problems of the sympathetic Bystera which I have omitted
 here.

         in all cases as  it   is represented in the diagram.      There are individual varia
         tions.
   3.  Any one spinal nerve is connected with certain of its ganglia by a consider
         able number of fibres, and with others by very few.            It is connected by few
         fibres with either the uppermost or the lowermost, or with both uppermost
         and lowermost, of its series of ganglia.         Thus the 7th thoracic nerve sends
         comparatively few fibres to the superior cervical ganglion, and the 3rd lumbar
         nerve sends     comparatively      few  fibres to    the   6th  lumbar     sympathetic

         of this variation has been described in the text. In the scheme given here,

         grey ramus is usually supplied by fibres from the coccygeal               ganglion.   It
         will be noticed that only the base and       tip of the tail are represented.

    The     muscular reaction known as the knee-jerk is notoriously
affected by conditions obtaining in what is often described as a reflex
arc, consisting of afferent and efferent paths, and a centre situate in
the lumbar portion of the spinal cord.                     I recently* described experi
ments determining             more    particularly    than   hitherto the locality of the
muscular and nervous mechanism on which the jerk depends.                                       I

  of the vastus interims and part of the crureus divisions of the great
  quadriceps extensor muscle of the thigh.    The spinal centre was found
  located in the 5th and 4th lumbar segments of the cord of the Rhesus
  Monkey (4th and 3rd lumbar of Man). The efferent path was found
                                                                            '
 in the anterior roots of the 5th and 4th lumbar nerves, and was trace-
 able along the anterior crural nerve into those of the muscular
 branches of that trunk which supply the above-mentioned portions
 of the quadriceps extensor max. The efferent side of the path corre
 sponds accurately with the course of the motor nerve fibres to the
 muscles in question, and there is little reason to doubt that it con
 sists of nothing more or less than of those motor fibres themselves.
 The afferent path was found to lie in the posterior root of the 5th
 lumbar of Rhesus (4th of Man, 6th of Cat), and was not usually
 demonstrable at all in the posterior root of the 4th lumbar, but a
 small portion of it may, perhaps, lie within that root.
    The posterior root in which exists the afferent path on which the
jerk is dependent receives afferent fibres from the obturator and
anterior crural nerves, and from the external and internal popliteal
nerves, and sometimes from the division of the great sciatic which 1
 may be called the hamstring nerve, because distributed to the ham
string muscles.     Of the fibres entering the root from these various
 sources, those on which the " jerk
                                          "
                                            depends are not from any
except the anterior crural nerve. Further, in the anterior crural
 nerve, they are those fibres of the nerve which issue from the vastus
internus and crureus muscles.      Thus the afferent fibres on which the
jerk depends seem to arise within muscles, and from exactly those
muscles, to which belong the efferent fibres with which the " jerk
                                                                        "
is concerned.
    The rapid abolition of the jerk produced by severing the posterior
root of the 5th lumbar of Rhesus may conceivably be due less to
                                                                          "

path by the " current of injury       set up in the injured fibres (" de
marcation current ") of it. This doubt has frequently been strength
ened in my mind by the fact that section of one half the root often
suffices to abolish the "jerk," although the remaining half can,
when tested, still be shown able to conduct centripetal im
pulses from the skin; and further, by the fact that it appears
immaterial whether the anterior or the posterior part of* the
posterior root be selected for the section.        The " jerk " I have
seen then abolished in a manner not obviously different from that in
which section of the whole root abolishes it.          Against such an
explanation is, however, the permanence of the effect upon the
" jerk " produced
                     by section of the whole root, for the effect con
tinues at least for many days.       Regarding the permanence of the
effect of section of half the root  I have no observation.

558     Dr. C. S. Sherrington.           On  the  Knee-jerk and      the   [Feb. 9,
    I  have repeated the observation substituting for severance other
modes of destruction of the conductivity of the root.                The root is a
fairly long one, longer in the Monkey than in the Cat, and it is not
difficult to apply reagents to it.              I find the jerk immediately
abolished by cooling the root to near the freezing point. To do this
I   pass under the posterior root, well lifted from the anterior, one end
of a copper strip, the other end of which lies in an ice and salt-
mixture. The application of C02 vapour to the root has a similar
                                                 "
effect, and on removing the vapour the jerk returns.
                                                          "
                                                                         The vapour
I have applied through a thin-walled india-rubber tube, made to
enclose the root.     Cocain     I  have also applied, and found it abolish
the jerk in about 70 sees., when used as a 1 per cent, solution in
0"6 per cent, sodium chloride solution.          I  place under the root, before
applying    the  cocain, a  thin   strip  of  india-rubber     sheeting, and apply
the solution with a fine camel's-hair brush by painting on the fila
ments of the root.
     There seems, therefore, no doubt that abolition of the jerk can be
produced by lowering the conductivity of the fibres of this posterior
root. Whatever the nature of these afferent fibres which thus come
up from part of the quadriceps extensor of the thigh, and keep
the "knee-jerk"        going, facts show that they are less hardy
under experimental interference than are those from the skin which
carry centripetal impulses subserving tactile sensation.                    A very
 little interference with this posterior root abolishes the knee-jerk ;
a very great deal will often not obviously impair cutaneous reflexes
 elicited through it.      To lift the posterior root by a thread passed
 under it will often suffice to interrupt the afferent fibres for "the
 jerk," but at the same time leaves the afferents of tactile sense not
 obviously impaired. Probably the former fibres are much the smaller
 and more delicate.
     The irritation of this root, when cut, by its own demarcation
 current does not cause inhibition of the jerk. I have tried on three
 occasions to recover the "jerk," after its disappearance on section of
 this root, by electrical excitation of the central end of the divided
 root.    The excitation, when too feeble to elicit any reflex contraction
 of the muscles, did not obviously influence the briskness of the jerk
 in either direction. The excitation very readily, however, causes
  contraction of the hamstring muscles, which so alters the position of
 the knee that the condition of the "jerk " can no longer be satisfac
  torily compared with what it was before.
     Excitation of the central end of the divided hamstring nerve does
  at once abolish, or greatly reduce, the briskness of the "jerk." I

efferent, spinal roots immediately below that one on which the jerk
itself depends. I added, with regard to it, " Its explanation appears
to lie in the abolition of the tone of the hamstring muscles by section
of the afferent roots belonging to them." I wish now to support, and
somewhat enlarge, the explanation then offered.
    Severance of the great sciatic trunk produces, as Tschiriew* has
pointed out in the Cat, an increased briskness of the jerk." This
                                                                   "              I
find to depend scarcely at all, if indeed at all, on section of the
external or internal popliteal divisions of the trunk, either singly or
together ; but to depend upon the cutting that portion of the trunk
 which is destined for the hamstring muscles — the portion referred to
in my previous paper as " the hamstring nerve." In Macacus this
 " hamstring " division of the sciatic sends afferent fibres into the
 spinal cord by the posterior roots of the 8th, 7th, and 6th sub-
 thoracic nerves.    In Cat, the 8th and 7th posterior roots are those in
 question.    On severance         of these afferent roots, the " tonus " of the
                                                     " jerk " becomes more brisk ;
 hamstring muscles is broken, and the
 sometimes there is a short interval of depression immediately suc
 ceeding the operation.        The motor fibres of the hamstring muscles
 leave the cord by    the     anterior    roots, correspondent with the above-
 mentioned posterior. Severance of these anterior roots causes im
 mediate increase in the briskness of the jerk.
    As to the manner in which the loss of tonus of the hamstring
 muscles gives rise to increase of the knee-jerk, two possibilities at
 once present themselves.           One is purely mechanical ; the other is of
 a physiological nature.         The loss of tension accompanying the loss of
 "tone " will leave the leg more free to swing at the knee joint. It is
 for that reason that the posture of limb usually employed as the
 most favourable when the jerk is to be elicited is with the ham
 strings relaxed and the leg at a right angle with the thigh.               In this
 way the points of bony            attachment      of   the  hamstring muscles are
 approximated, and the knee can swing through a greater arc to that
 point at which it is cut short by the mechanical check of the flexor
  muscles passively tightened by the movement.                  The extensor move
  ment during the     "          "
                         jerk has, in this way, further scope before the
  hamstrings   break    it.    As far as this explanation goes, the above-
  mentioned increase of the jerk would occur even if the hamstring
  muscles were replaced by india-rubber cords, the effect produced by
  severance of the hamstring nerve being equivalent to any arrange
  ment which rendered those india-rubber cords less tight.
     I should have considered this simple explanation sufficient had it
  not been for certain additional facts.              During experiments on the
  effects of stimulating the motor spinal roots of the lumbo-sacral
  nerves there is much risk of being deceived by escape of the excit-

    560    Dr. C. S. Sherrington.       On the Knee-jerk and    the  [Feb. 9,
   ing current to other motor roots besides the one to which the
   electrodes are applied.     When stimulating the motor root of the 7th
   lumbar, I frequently observed contraction of the extensor muscles of
   the knee as well as of the flexors, and imagining that the phenomenon
   must be due to escape of the exciting current to the 5th lumbar root,
   I  was accustomed to reduce the strength of the exciting current
   until the contraction of the extensors of the knee no longer occurred.
   To avoid this supposed escape of current, it was necessary to reduce
   the strength of stimulus sometimes to very slightly indeed above
   minimal efficiency for the motor fibres to which the electrodes were
   applied. The use of such weak currents has serious disadvantages,
   aud was extremely embarrassing for the experiment. It was not
   until  I  had discarded a number of experiments on the ground of
   escape   of current, that three points concerning the contraction of the
^  extensor muscles produced by stimulating the motor nerve to the
   flexors attracted my attention.        (1.) If for the excitation of the
   motor root to the flexors a series of induced currents are employed,
   succeeding each other at a rale slow enough to produce not perfect
   tetanisation, but tremulent contraction of the muscles, the contraction
  obtained in the extensor muscles coincidently was, nevertheless, per
   fectly steady and tetanic, although not vigorous.       (2.) If the flexor
   muscles are severed from connexion with the knee joint, so that their
   contraction cannot affect the joint, and if the " knee-jerk " be elicited
   before, during, and after stimulation of the motor root to the flexor
  muscles, during the excitation, when those flexor muscles were con
  tracting, the knee-jerk, brisk previously and brisk later, disappeared,
  or almost disappeared.       (3.) If the sensory spinal roots belonging to
  the hamstring nerve are severed, the stimulation of a motor root to
  the hamstring muscles is no longer accompanied           by contraction of
  the extensor muscles of the knee, even when strong stimulation is
  employed.
      One next observed      the effect on    the extensors of the knee of
  excitation of the central end of the nerve to the hamstring muscles
  after that nerve had been ligated and cut through.                 It was
  found that excitation with currents just perceptible at the tip of
  the tongue causes immediate disappearance or diminution of the
  " knee-jerk."      " Exaltation " of the jerk follows the depression by
  the excitation.     If the excitation be continuously maintained for a
  time, the jerk tends to return in spite of the continuance of the
  stimulation.     By use of stronger currents the extensors are imme
  diately    thrown   into a tonic contraction, lasting so long as the
  stimulus is continued. The same effects on the knee-jerk, and on the
  activity of the extensor muscles, are elicited by exciting the central
  ends of the divided posterior roots of the 7th or 8th subthoracic
  nerve.

   I then attempted to determine if mere tension of the hamstring
muscles could give the same result as electrical excitation of the
central ends of their nerves.           It is, of course, essential that the pro
duction of increased tension in the muscles should not alter the

   position of the knee joint or affect it mechanically.            This precaution
   was observed by isolating the two inner hamstrings from their
   attachments, except at their origin, from the tuber ischii, and simul
   taneously cutting through all nerve branches to the outer hamstrings
   and to the adductor muscles.           The nerves to the inner hamstrings
   were carefully preserved although the muscles were otherwise dis
   sected out.      It was found that by pulling on the inner hamstring
   muscles sufficiently to stretch them out of the doubled-up shape they
   assumed after being freed from their lower attachments, the knee-
  jerk, previously brisk, was at once abolished or greatly diminished,
>  and on relaxing the strain on the hamstring muscles at once re
   appeared, and was apparently somewhat more brisk than before the
   diminution.      It is often sufficient to merely compress the hamstring
   muscles, as they lie flaccid on the hand, between fingers and thumb.
   A kneading of the muscle as in massage has the same effect. On
   two occasions, at the end of an experiment, when the muscles had
   suffered from exposnre,       I bave seen the curious phenomenon that ex
   citation of a motor root supplying them of strength insufficient to
   throw the injured muscles into obvious contraction yet suffices to at
   once cut out the
                          " knee-jerk," although before and after the excita
               "      "
   tion the      jerk was very brisk indeed. The effect was obtained
   several times in succession, and immediately disappeared on dividing
   the sensory roots coming in from the exposed muscles.                 The current
   of injury in the muscles must have been considerable, and this suggests
   that the mere negative variation of the current of injury in the
   muscles might originate centripetal impulses. Certainly there was
  on neither occasion any obvious contraction in the muscles.
      The most efficient mode of excitation of the afferent fibres from
J  these muscles appears to be the mechanical above described, i.e., the
  myotatic    (Gowers).*
      Excitation of the central end of the divided popliteal or peroneal
  nerves does not produce this effect upon the jerk.                   Neither does
  stretching of the crural triceps by pulling on the tendo Achillis, nor
  stretching of the rectus femoris muscle.             Stretching of the rectus
  femoris can easily be employed without interference to the movement
  of the knee joint.         It appears to me neither to increase nor to
  diminish the jerk. Excitation of the central end of the divided nerve
  to the rectus femoris exerts likewise no obvious influence on the
  jerk ; nor does excitation of the central end of the cutaneous divisions
  of the anterior crural, viz., the internal saphenous and the internal
  and middle cutaneous nerves of the thigh.             Excitation of the central

end    of the cutaneous branch of the hamstring nerve itself also
appears without effect upon the jerk.
   Tension produced in the crural triceps muscle by pulling on the
Achilles tendon does not appear to influence the brisk flexor move
ment of the ankle joint evoked by tapping the subcutaneous face of
the tibia, and related chiefly to the 6th lumbar spinal segment of
Macacus and to the 7th lumbar segment of the Cat.
   It would thus seem clear that the exaggeration of the knee-jerk
produced by severance of the branches given from the great sciatic
nerve to the hamstring mnscles is not due to the fact that the result
ing relaxation of those muscles simply leaves the joint mechanically
more free to move.      The exaggeration would seem due rather to the
severance of the nerves in question interrupting a stream of centri
petal impulses that passes up from the hamstring muscles and enters
the spinal cord by certain afferent roots, and in the cord exerts a^,
depressing or restraining influence on the jerk. It further appears
that a stream of impulses similarly efficient can be set up by moderate
electrical excitation of the central ends of the divided nerves of the
 hamstring muscles ; or by simply stretching or kneading those
muscles when they are released from one of their fixed points ; or,
finally, by simply throwing those muscles into contraction through
excitation of motor roots supplying them, so long as the sensory roots
remain intact. The physician, when he, in order the better to elicit
the jerk, flexes the knee and reduces the strain in the flexor muscles,
 by doing so removes, with relaxation of the flexors, a physiological
 depression which the tension of those muscles normally exerts upon
 the jerk obtainable from their antagonistic group.
    Further, it would seem that at the knee joint excitation of the
 afferent fibres coming from one set of the antagonistic muscles
induces reflex tonio contraction of the opposing set with extreme
 facility, despite the fact that the opponent muscles are not innervated
from the same spinal segments.        The reflex is obtainable with extra
 ordinary facility,  even across intervening  segments of the cord.
    Thus the degree of tension in one muscle of an antagonistic couple
 intimately affects the degree of "tonus" in its opponent, not only
 mechanically, but also reflexly, through afferent and efferent channels
and the spinal cord.
    It is obvious that the correlation of action thus existing be-        s
tween the antagonistic muscular groups of the thigh and knee
 may be not widely different from that originally pointed out by
Hering and Breuer as regulative of the movements of respiration.
 One is tempted to institute a comparison also between it and the
 physiological arrangement studied by Biedermann in the antagonism
 of the muscles of the forceps of Antaeus. I would, however, reserve
 further details until I have been able to perform a larger number of

    afferent nerve fibres from muscle that investigation of their ana-

    problem further.
       [Just as the   lumbo-sacral region of the cord may be split along the
    median plane without interference to the jerk of either side,* so the
    same may be done without hindering the above ascending reflex
    abolition of the jerk.       Extinction of the jerk by exciting the central
    end of the 8th root (from hamstrings) affects the jerk four segments
    higher without in that distance spreading over to the opposite Bide.
    But the excitation affects the jerk of the opposite side if the scope of
    a considerable length of cord be allowed it. If in the Cat the cord be
    transversely divided at the 11th thoracic segment, excitation of the
    afferent fibres from a hamstring muscle of one side {e.g., right) applies
    chiefly to the jerk on the same side (right), but also to the jerk on
    the opposite.     If, however, in the Cat (in which jerk belongs to the
    6th and 5th lumbar segments) the cord be transversely cut at or
    below the 3rd, the extinction from the hamstring nerve is conflned to
  / the same side only. In other words, the presence of additional higher
    segments seems requisite before the passage of the impulses in
    question across the median plane of the cord, a fact in curious
    harmony with an observation by Hallstent; regarding the elicitation
    of " crossed reflexes " in the frog. The median posterior column
    between the 8th and 4th lumbar levels can be removed in toto without
    impairing the influence of the hamstring nerve on the jerk.                It is
    clear also that those fibres of the posterior root which pass to Clarke's
    column cannot be the requisite afferents, either from the extensor or
    flexor thigh muscles, because the jerk and the above-described extinc
    tion of it are unaffected in the Cat by transverse section of the cord
    just below the 4th lumbar segment, i.e., the segment where Clarke's
    column stops short. — February 8, 1893.]

enumerations were made by diluting the blood 200 times with an
8 per cent, solution of magnesium sulphate, which had received a
sufficient addition of gentian-violet to stain the cells darkly in the
course of a few minutes.           The enumerations were invariably made
in duplicate samples of each blood, and in each sample the absolute
number of leucocytes was counted on 250 squares of the Gowers
heemocytometer.        An agreement within 10 per cent, was exacted
betweeu the counts of the duplicate samples. When this was obtained
the counts were added together, and their sum multiplied by 200 to
obtain the total number of leucocytes in ths cubic millimetre.                       The

    The figures in column 2 have not been corrected for the dilution effected by the
injection of the peptone solution.         Taking the blood as 1/13 of the body weight
the amount of peptone solution introduced would effect a dilution of from 3 9 to
ti'5 per cent. The figures in column 2 ought therefore to be increased by this
fraction in order to be strictly comparable with the figures in column 1.
     The above tables show that Dog's peptone blood differs from oxa-
lated, leech-extract, and S per cent. MgS04 blood (this last blood was
employed throughout as the standard of comparison) in containing a
mere tithe of the normal number of leucocytes.                          These missing
leucocytes have either remained behind in the tissues or in the
internal vessels, or they have disintegrated and have passed into
solution in the plasma.              I  have endeavoured to decide between
these alternatives          by making comparative estimations of the
 leucocytes in the mesenteric veins, and in the carotid blood, and
 further by making a series of careful histological examinations of
the various organs which might be expected to harbour the leuco
cytes (I selected the liver, the kidney, and the heart muscle for this
 purpose).        In no case was I able to find any trace of stasis or of
emigration of lencocytes either in the Dog or in the Babbit after
peptone injections.         I, therefore, feel justified in concluding that in
all probability the leucocytes have dissolved in the plasma.                            I
believe that this view is borne out also by a consideration of the
chemical properties of peptone plasma, notably by the fact that it
deposits on cooling a heavy precipitate of a nucleo-albnmen, which is
probably identical* with Wooldridge's tissue or cell-fibrinogen, in
other words, identical with the characteristic albuminous constituent
of the white blood corpuscle.
     This "cold precipitate" is not obtained from any other plasma
except from oxalate plasma, where               I have obtained it, after allowing
 it to stand for 24 hours before separating it from the white blood
corpuscles. Under these circumstances a certain disintegration of
white blood corpuscles takes place in this plasma.                     The non-occur-
                 "                     "  in leech-extract plasma is in accordance
rencef of a cold precipitate
with the fact that this plasma contains no disintegrated leucocytes.
The n on- occurrence of the precipitate in salted plasmas (Halliburton)
probably similarly depends on the fact that the white blood corpuscles
do not disintegrate readily in these plasmas, but it may be noted that
Wooldridge showed that the addition of neutral salts prevented the
                          "
precipitation of his cold precipitate."
    We have thus reason to believe that the occurrence of a precipitate
on cooling peptone plasma is dne to the fact that the plasma contains

   leucocytes in solution.    If this is so, we have a ready explanation of
   some of the other characteristics      of peptone plasma, notably of the
  fact that the C03 in this blood is remarkably diminished as compared
   with the normal blood, and also of the fact that peptone plasma clots
   when a stream of C02 is passed through it.
      With regard to the diminution of the C02 in peptone blood, Lahousse
                           '
   (Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv,' 1889) surmised that it was due to a
  driving out of gas from the blood. He based this view on the extreme
  rapidity with which this diminution occurred in the blood after peptone
  injection. Blachstein (Du Bois-Reymond's 'Archiv,' 1891), who fol
  lowed up Lahousse 's work, contributed the following to our knowledge
  of the question. A diminution of C02 is found in the Rabbit's blood
  as well as in the Dog's blood after the injection of peptone.       In the
  three experiments reported by Blachstein the C02 of the normal
  Rabbit's blood stood to the C02 of the peptonised Rabbit's blood
  approximately in the relation of 4 : 3, 4 : 3, and 3:2. In his three
 experiments on Dog's blood the ratios were approximately 3 : 1, 3 : 1,
 and 2:1. It will be noticed that the C02 undergoes a greater
  diminution in Dog's peptone blood than it does in Rabbit's peptone
  blood.
      Grandis (Du Bois-Reymond's ' Archiv,' 1891) pursued the subject
 further, and demonstrated that the tension of C02 in peptone blood
 is approximately double that of the CO? in normal blood.          He indi
 cates that the phenomena point clearly to the liberation of some
 substance with -acid properties in the blood.
     In view of these facts I would suggest that this substance with
 acid properties is in all probability the nucleo-albumen of the white
blood corpuscles which have become dissolved in the plasma under
the influence of the peptone injection.         The liberation of this sub-
stanoe in the blood would result in a driving out of C02 from its
combination with the bases of the blood plasma, and would thus
account for the great diminution of the C02 in peptone blood.           The
differences in this respect between Dog's and Rabbit's peptone blood
are in perfect agreement with the results of the enumerations given
above for1 those 'bloods.    The hypothesis of the driving out of C02 by
a liberation of nuoleo-albumen in the blood would further harmonise
with the increase of the tension of the C02 in peptone blood, and
also with the diminished excretion of C02 after peptone injections
          '
(Bohr, Centralblatt f. Physiol.,' 1888).
    The fact that casein (better, perhaps, called " caseinogen," Halli
burton) will drive out C02 from CaC03 constitutes an almost perfect
analogy with the property of driving out C02 which is here surmised
to characterise Wooldridge's cell-fibrinogen.        In both cases wc are
dealing with nucleo-aJburaens.

this might be very naturally explained by assuming that we are
dealing with         direct reversal of the process which occurs when
                     a
peptone   is  injected into the blood.    The COa coagnlation in peptone
blood would upon This hypothesis be due to a precipitation of cell-
fibrinogen in the plasma under the influence of an excess of weak
acid. Such a precipitation of cell -fibrinogen in the plasma would be
in some sort an equivalent of an addition of cell-fibrinogen to peptone
plasma, and would, therefore, naturally inaugurate coagulation.
   The coagulation of peptone plasma in vitro by COa would be closely
paralleled      bythe fact that intravascular coagulation after injection
of cell-fibrinogen occurs, as     have pointed out

of excess of dilute acids.

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Sm   William   Bowman was born at Nantwich       in 1816.   His mind
was   in early life directed towards natural science ; for his father,
Mr. John Eddowes Bowman, a banker, was a Fellow of the Linnoan
Society, an ardent botanist and geologist, an intimate associate with
many of the best naturalists of his time, and, during the last years
of his life, one of the most active promoters of literary and scientific
societies in Manchester.    The ' Catalogue of Scientific Papers' gives
references to fifteen papers on various subjects which were published
by him between 1828 and 1842 in the Transactions of the Linnean
and Geological Societies or in scientific journals.     They show that
he was a careful and minute observer in a wide range of study, a
clear and vigorous descriptive writer, and a good artist ; the illustra
tions of some of his papers, engraved from his own drawings, aro
admirable.
   Sir William in his boyhood studied botany       and geology with his
father and drawing with both his parents ;    for his mother also was an
accurate and skilful artist ad naturam, both with the pencil and in
needlework. A disposition for earnest study and for high mental
and moral culture prevailed in his home, and all his brothers were in
their several ranges of work successful and well esteemed. One was
Professor of Classics in the Manchester New College ; another was an
architect of good repute in the same town and author, with his
partner, of a work on
                          " The Churches of the Middle             "
                                                             Ages ; the
third was Professor of Practical Chemistry in King's College, and
author of two small widely-read books on Practical Chemistry and
on Medical Chemistry.      They all died before him.
   After completing his general education at Hazel wood School, near
Birmingham, Bowman was apprenticed to Mr. Joseph Hodgson, a
Fellow of the Royal Society, Surgeon to the Birmingham General
Hospital, and one of the most distinguished surgeons of the time.
He could not have had better opportunities for the study of surgery
than were thus provided for him. The hospital, in which he was a
house-pupil, supplied large numbers of cases which he could observe
 and record, and Mr. Hodgson was not only an able teacher and an
 earnest worker in surgery, but, as is proved by the illustrations of
 his book on ' Diseases of the Arteries,' which were engraved from his
    VOL. ml                                                      b

                                     11
own drawings, he was an excellent anatomical artist.                Tims en
 couraged, Bowman studied constantly and carefully, and made many
 records of cases and pathological drawings, some of which were pub
lished in 1834, in illustration of Ryland's ' Essay on Diseases of the
 Larynx and Trachea.' The records of the cases and the coloured
 engravings appear alike accurate, and are at least remarkable as the
 work of a student only eighteen years old.
   In 1837 he entered as a pupil at King's College, and, after the
coarse of study usual at that time, became a Member of the College
of Surgeons in 1839. In the same year he was appointed a Demon
strator of Anatomy and Curator of the Museum at King's College,
and he gave himself especially to the study of minute anatomy.            The
improvements     of microscopes  and  the  facilities of   working with them
had, at that time, so increased the range and importance of histology
(or general anatomy as it was then called), that it had become the
most attractive of all the subjects of biological research. It was only
in 1836, on the appointment of Dr. Sharpey at University College,
that it was, for the first time in any London school, separated from tho
teaching of descriptive anatomy and combined with that of physio
logy. Dr. Todd, soon after, taught it in the same method at King's
College, and Bowman worked with him and for him. Dexterous,
patient, loving completeness, and working after the manners of both
tho naturalist and the artist, he Boon attained great results, and they
were shown, especially, in four papers, illustrated with engravings
from his own drawings, which were published in 1840 and the follow
ing two years. The first, " On the Structure and Movements of Volun
                                         '                               '
tary Muscles," was published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1840.    It was followed, in the next volume, by an " Additional Note
                                                 "
on the Contraction of Voluntary Muscles ; and in the volume for
1842 by a paper " On the Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies
of the Kidney " ; and a paper " On the Minute Anatomy of Fatty
Degeneration of tho Liver," was published in the Lancet,' of January
                                                         '
22, 1842.     Among the speedy evidences of the value of these papers
were his election into the Royal Society in 1841, and the award of a
Royal Medal in 1842 ; bat yet more complete evidence was and is in
their abiding reputation. Other anatomical essays of great value were
published by him between 1842 and 1851. They include the articles on
Mucous Membrane, Muscle, Muscular Motion, and Pacinian Bodies in
the ' Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,' vol. 3 ; eight others
                                                                '
relating chiefly to muscles and the sense-organs, in the Physiological
Anatomy and Physiology of Man,' which was published between 1843
and 1856, and of which Dr. Todd and himself were joint authors :
and a small volume of " Lectures on the parts concerned in the
Operations on the Eye and on the Structure of tho Retina," which
were given at the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital in 1847, and with which

                                    ...
                                    Ill
were included a notable paper on the Structure of the Vitreous
Humour, and a few Cases of Ophthalmic Disease.
   It may justly be believed that no series of papers by one author
has been more important in the progress of histology and of its
influence on physiology than wore these. They have been called by
many " epoch-making ;
                          " and the term
                                          may certainly be well applied
to those on the structure of muscles and of the kidneys.
   In the structure of striated muscle, Bowman showed that the
whole substance of the fibre, " primitive fasciculus," exclusive of the
sarcolemma and nuclei, " muscle-corpuscles " (of both of which he
                                                                 "
gave the first minutest account), was composed of particles, sarcous
elements," united together by an intermediate material (concerning
which he offered no exact opinion), so as to form in one direction
fibrill®, and in another discs. This conception cleared away the many
previous views as to the nature of the striation ; and, though subse
quent researches have led to the belief that the structure of the fibre
is more complicated than he thought, yet, in many ways, the ideas at
present accepted may be regarded as expansions or modifications of
                                                             " is not now
those expressed in these papers.     The " sarcous element
regarded as a simple homogeneous body, but as one made up of dif
ferent parts : but it is still held that the fibre is made up of such
" elements," and that, as Bowman believed, the act of muscular con
traction consists essentially in a change in these elements.
   By his researches on the structures of the kidney he first mado
known the relation of the blood-glomerules to the uriniferous tubules,
which were previously supposed to end blindly or in loops, with the
glomerules lying in spaces outside them.         He gave a very good
account of the circulation in the kidney, and rendered possible a true
view of the process of urinary secretion, and suggested the donble
nature of that process; a suggestion which subsequent researches
have done little more than amplify and enforce.
   In his work on mucous membranes, Bowman gave clearness and
distinctness to the views previously arrived at by Henle ; and by his
descriptions of their structures and of the glands associated with them,
he contributed largely to the knowledge of the process of secretion.
And in his studies of the structures of the eye he added clearness
and fulness to all previous descriptions of them, and made many
things sure that were before his work deemed doubtful. Indeed, it
may safely be said that scarcely inferior in value to his discoveries
were the many instances in which his accuracy and clearness decided
doubts and questions, and led to the general acceptance of his descrip
tions as sure for teaching and for guidance in further research. And,
though he did not often work at what might be deemed experimental
physiology, yet he derived from his minute anatomy of structures
 many accurate suggestions of their modes of action; he called it

Physiological    Anatomy, and made it distinctly physiological when
ever  it  was reasonable to dednce function from structure.
   In   1848 Bowman was appointed joint lecturer with Dr. Todd on
Physiology and Physiological and Morbid Anatomy at King's College,
and this appointment he held till 1855, when he was succeeded by
Dr. Beale, who bad shared the lectureship with, him in and after
1853.      His lectures were, like his published works, clear, well-
defined, plainly descriptive, fully illustrated by specimens and draw
ings ; and he lectured very earnestly, as one sure of the importance
of his subject, always at work in it, and wanting bis pupils to work
with him. His resignation of bis lectureship was due, chiefly to his
constantly increasing practice ; for, busy as he had been in scientific
research, he had never neglected surgery.         In 1840, when King's
College was established, he and Mr. (now Sir John) Simon, who had
been Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy, were appointed Assistant
Surgeons, and in 1846 he was appointed to a similar office in the
Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital in Moorfields. In both these he
gained high repute, for he was as observant in the practice of surgery
as he was in the study of structures, and he was very dexterous and
careful. It was for some time doubtful whether general or ophthal
mic surgery would be his chief occupation ; but this was determined
by events over which he had no control. At the time of his appoint
ment at Moorfields, in 1846, Mr. Dalrymple, who was the Chief
Surgeon to the hospital, had the leading ophthalmic practice in
London, but his health was failing, and when he died, in 1851, Bow
man succeeded him both in the hospital and in the chief private prac
tice.    From this time he gave himself almost entirely to. ophthalmic
surgery, and his devotion to it was increased by the singular coinci
dence that, in 1851, while he was at the hospital, von Graefe and
Donders met there for the first time.       They both worked with him,
 studying especially   with the recently invented ophthalmoscope ; and
 thus began their life-long friendship and constant mutual help and
encouragement.      His last published writing was his biography of
 Donders in the 49th volume of the Proceedings of this Society.
    Bowman was singularly well fitted for ophthalmic surgery : light'
handed, dexterous, clear-sighted, calm, and, by his own researches,
familiar with all the structures of the eye, his operations were fault
less. His educated sense of sight made him perfect in the use of the
ophthalmoscope, and his habits of minute research made him observant
of every thing that might guide to accurate diagnosis.    Besides, he had
many habits and mental qualities favourable to the attainment of
success.    He was punctual, businesslike, calm and deliberate in con
sultation, gentle and sympathetic, always clear in the statement of
his opinion, making all feel confidence in him. And he never showed
any of the faults often ascribed to specialists.    His method of work

                                      V
continued,   as  it always had been, thoroughly         scientific ; all the
papers that he published show the same care and completeness, the
same earnestness      and width in research as his earlier anatomical
studies ; and he never lost the advantage of the general knowledge of
surgery which he gained in his duties at King's College Hospital,
to which, after sixteen years' service as Assistant Surgeon, he was
appointed Surgeon in 1856.
   Of the numerous ophthalmological papers which he published after
1850, and which are all included in the second volume of his collected
works, the most important and influential on practice were those on
                                       '
the Treatment of Epiphora, in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,'
                       '
vol. 34, and in the Ophthalmic Hospital Reports,' vol. 1, 1857 ; on
Conical Cornea, in the same Reports in 1859 ; and on the use of two
needles in Capsular Cataract, in the same Transactions, vol. 36. Other
                                                      '
valuable papers were published in the ' Lancet and other medical
                         '                                                   '
journals, and in the Proceedings of the Ophthalmological Society ;
and cf all it may justly be said, as it may of his minute anatomical
work, that, although later studies of the same subjects have added
facts and have increased the practical utility of those which he had
made known, yet none have detected in them errors.           In practice, as
in minute   research,   he was always accurate and careful, and limited
his deductions to such as he could, at least, be nearly sure of. He
thus exercised great influence in the increase and diffusion of the
knowledge of safe ophthalmic surgery, and scarcely less than the in
fluence of his writings was that which was due to his speedy adoption
of the right opinions and practices of others, especially in the use of
the ophthalmoscope, and of the antiseptic treatment of wounds, and
in the promotion of von Graefe's pathology and treatment of glau
coma, and of Donders's discoveries relating to errors of refraction and
their remedies.
   The quantity of work that Bowman did may appear the more re
markable for the fact that his health, though not unsound, was never
vigorous.     It was, probably, for this reason that he limited his work
almost exclusively to study and the plain duties of his life. In
subjects far beyond his range of work he often seemed to enjoy think
ing and wondering, but he did not give his whole mind to them ; he
worked for facts, and for the best use of facts in his practice or in the
extension of science.      Similarly, he avoided all the larger official and
social occupations of public and professional life, and engaged only
in some that were nearly associated with his proper work, as in the
Councils of the Royal Society and of King's College, in the Royal
Institution, in the Ophthalmological Society, of which in 1880 he was
elected the first President, and in the Association for the Advance
ment of Medicine by Research, of which he might be regarded as the
founder. In these he did all that could be deemed his duty, and he
                                                                   b 2

                                      vi
did it quietly, wisely, and without self-assertion; just as he did many
generous things in charity and the promotion of religion.
     His personal character, hardly less than his scientific eminence,
made all who knew him wish to 6how him how widely and deeply he
was esteemed.        He received many honours from universities and
scientific societies, the titles of which are added to his name in the
List of Fellows ; he was created a baronet in 1884 ; his friends at
home and abroad presented him with his portrait by Mr. Ouless,
R.A., and arranged for the reprinting of all his works and all their
illustrations in the complete edition recently edited by Professor
Burdon Sanderson and Mr. Hulke, after careful revision by himself ;
and in 1883 the Ophthalmological Society founded in his honour the
 " Bowman Lecture."
      He had resigned the Surgeoncy of the Ophthalmic Hospital in
 1876 ; but he retained the pre-eminence in private practice till, after
holding it for more than thirty years, he began to retire and to spend
 an increasing portion of his time at Joldwynds, near Dorking, where he
 had a country-house in beautiful scenery, and gardens which he loved
 to cultivate.    Here he enjoyed the prosperity which he had attained
 after great difficulties in his early professional life, and with it he
 had complete domestic happiness. He had married in 1842 a daughter
 of Mr. Thomas Paget, a highly esteemed surgeon at Leicester ; they
 had seven children, and, as he had imitated his parents in his scien
 tific and artistic studies, so, and with the like success, were they
 imitated in his home. As one who could speak with knowledge
  states,    they were imitated in the high moral and intellectual train
  ing    of the children," and " in the high standard of rectitude which
  they maintained."       But, besides all this, he enjoyed his partial re
  tirement because it gave him time to gratify his love of Nature and
  of scientific observation.    He cultivated rare plants, and those about
  which questions might, perhaps, be determined by experiment ; he
  set apart a piece of land in which he might find the fittest place for
  each species, and subject it to various tests ; and, with willing coin
  cidence, he especially studied the LathrseaB, which had been the subject
  of one of his father's earliest investigations.     He formed what Mr.
   Thiselton Dyer, with whom he was in frequent correspondence, and
   from whom these facts were learned, considered one of the best col
   lections of open-air plants in the country, and he often blended his
   scientific work with his love of art in so grouping shrubs and flowers
   as to show by the arrangement of forms and colours the most perfect
   beauty.     Thus he attained old age without apparent diminution of
   mental power or of the love of acquiring knowledge ; and, to the last,
   his studies of science and of art gave him great happiness. It was
    little more than a week after his final retirement from practice, and
    his leaving the house in Clifford Street in which he had long lived,

                                    vii
that, on the 29th of March in last year, he died of pneumonia at
Joldwynds.
                                                                J. P.
    Carl Schorlemmek, Professor of Organic Chemistry in Victoria
University, Owens College, Manchester, was born in 1834, at Darm
stadt, a town remarkable as having given birth to many distinguished
chemists. He was educated at Darmstadt and at Giessen ; he came
to Manchester as private assistant to Professor Roscoe, in the year
1858, and shortly afterwards, on the resignation of Mr. Dittmar, he
became the official laboratory assistant in Owens College. In this
position he not only supervised the practical work of the laboratory,
but also lectured on organic chemistry ; yet he found time for original
investigation, and shortly afterwards began his work on the hydro
carbons, which has placed his name high in the list of organic
chemists of the century. The commencement of this research was
due to the initiative of the late Mr. John Barrow, of the Dalton
 Chemical Works, Gorton, who placed a sample of the light oils
which he had obtained in the distillation of cannel coal at Professor
 Roscoe's disposal. At that time our knowledge of the chemical com
position of the light boiling coal-oils was very incomplete, and Schor-
lemmer was urged to begin the investigation.
    This work led to results which altogether modified the existing
ideas concerning the constitution of the paraffin hydrocarbons, and
laid the foundation of the modern science of organic chemistry.
    Up to 1848 the only known member of the paraffin series of hydro
 carbons was methane, CH4.        In the above year the researches of
 Kolbe, on the one hand, on the electrolysis of the fatty acids, and
 those of Frankland, on the other, respecting the isolation of the
  so-called alcohol radicals, had opened out new fields for investiga
 tion.
    The hydrocarbons, then termed the alcohol radicals, were supposed
 to contain two molecules of the radical, methyl being represented as
  CH3 — CH3, ethyl as C2H8— C2H5.       Together with these, a second
 series of hydrocarbons, possessing the same composition, was supposed
 to exist, thus : C2HSH, ethyl hydride, having the same composition as
 the radical methyl, and CiH9H, butyl hydride, having the same com
 position as the radical ethyl, were considered as being bodies stand
 ing in the same relation to the radical as an alcohol does to an
 ether.
    The existence of two such series of hydrocarbons is, however, only
 explicable upon the supposition of a difference existing between the
 four combining powers of each carbon atom, and such a supposition
 is at variance with a general theory of the mode of building up of the
 carbon compounds.

                                    viii
    Schorlemmer at once saw the importance of the question, and not
only seized upon the correct method of solution, but carried it out
successfully. If, said he, the radical methyl, CH3 — CH3, is identical
with ethyl hydride, CaH6H, not only must they have the same pro
perties, but must yield the same product on treatment with chlorine.
    This identity he proved, experimentally, not only in the above, the
most simple instances, but also in the more complicated cases of
ethyl-amyl and di-amyl, CjH5 — CsHn and C5HU — C6Hn, these hydro
carbons being shown to yield, respectively, chloride of heptyl and
chloride of decatyl, C,H1SC1 and CioH^Cl. It is difficult to over
estimate the importance of this discovery, for it proved the non
existence of two sets of isomeric hydrocarbons of the paraffin series,
and, therefore, placed the theory of carbon combination on a firm
basis.   This, though the most important of Schorlemmer's researches,
is only one amongst many, a list of thirty-two separate papers baing
found in the Royal Society's Catalogue. In 1871 he was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1874 his position in the scientific
world was acknowledged by the creation by the Council of Owens
College of a distinct Chair of Organic Chemistry, the only one at pre
sent in England, of which he was the first occupant.
    It was, however, not only as an expert experimentalist that
Schorlemmer excelled.      He possessed an exhaustive knowledge, nn-
conimon even amongst professional chemists, of the extensive litera
ture, not only of the chemical science of his day, but also of that from
the earliest times.
   His acquaintance   with other subjects was also considerable ; thus,
if he had not been a distinguished chemist, he would have been an
equally remarkable botanist. Moreover, he possessed, in full measure,
that dogged power of work which distinguishes the German, and
which has placed that people in the front as a nation of investigators.
    He became joint author with Professor Roscoe in the ' Treatise of
Chemistry,' and in the organic portion of that work especially, he
has shown both a perfect knowledge of the science, and remarkable
literary power. Only those who have attempted to write, even a
moderately complete treatise on modern organic chemistry, can know
what serious labour such work entails.           Several distinguished
chemists have given up the task as hopeless, and have not completed
what they had begun.         If Schorlemmer's life had been spared,
nothing would have prevented him from bringing his work to a
satisfactory conclusion.
   As a laboratory teacher Schorlemmer was excelled by few, merely
as a lecturer by many.     Bat, although, like some eminent lecturers,
his diction may have been faulty, the staple article was there, and no
real student who passed through his hands can be named who does
iot express his admiration for the man, and the sense of obligation

                                   IX
which he felt for the masterly instruction which he received.          The
long  list of honours which  his students   gained,  both in London,    and
afterwards in the Victoria University, prove how successful bis
teaching was.
   Although for many years a naturalised Englishman, and enjoying
and appreciating English freedom and English ways, he retained
more than is usual a lively interest in the welfare of the
                                                                   " Vater-
land."
   Schorlemmer's name will long be remembered in the annals of our
science as an investigator, as an author, and as a teacher.
                                                               H. E. R.
   Heney Tibbats Stainton, who died at Mountsfield, Lewisham, on
December 2, 1892, was the eldest son of Henry Stainton, Esq., of
Lewisham.      He was born in London on August 13, 1822, but was
removed to Lewisham when only a few weeks old, and thus practi
cally resided all his life in this now suburban borough.            He was
educated almost entirely at home, and by        a lady, and   finally for a
short time at King's College, where amongst his companions was
Professor Cayley. The regulations of his father's household were
very stringent, and young Stainton during the whole of his childhood
and boyhood was not allowed to mix with companions of his own
age, and to this,    and partly perhaps    also to extreme    myopia, the
marked diffidence, amounting almost       to shyness, exhibited by him
throughout life was probably due.          For several years he was
engaged in commercial occupations         under his father, and thus
acquired those habits of method and      accuracy that were so marked
in his character during the whole        of his career, for he never
wrote a letter to which there was the slightest possibility at
tached of reference to it being necessary hereafter without hand
copying it. About the year 1840 he made the acquaintance of the
Rev. William Johnson, a friend of his father, and an ardent col
lector of British Lepidoptera, and it was no doubt from him that he
acquired a taste for entomological pursuits, to which he at once de
voted himself with great ardour.      Prom the first his attention as a
specialist turned to the small Moths known as Micro-Lepidoptera,
and one of his first essays was " A Monograph of the British
                                 '            '
Argyromiges," published in the Zoologist for 1848, a work which he
was in after years wont to style " most rubbishy."      At the commence
ment of his scientific career Stainton discovered that British ento
mologists were not in touch with their fellow-workers on the Conti
nent and elsewhere, and he commenced a correspondence with all the
prominent students of his special branch, which as years went on
was strengthened    by visiting them personally and by inviting them
to be his guests at Mountsfield.    After the death of James Francis

                                     X
 Stephens,    in 1852, he acquired the very extensive library formed
 by   that entomologist, and built an annexe to his house for its recep
 tion, and this formed the nucleus of the rich collection of entomo
 logical works of which he ultimately became possessed.
     Stainton's forte undoubtedly lay in the direction of working ont
 the life histories of the minute Insects he studied. When in early
 life other occupations gave him but little of an ordinary working
day to devote to his studies, he got over the difficulty by rising at
 five o'clock in the morning, and this habit (which was partly inhe
rited) he continued down to the beginning of his fatal illness. The
 minute size and the concealed habits of the majority of the objects
of his study rendered the greatest patience necessary for the dis
 covery of their modes of life, and the peculiar condition of his eye
sight (before alluded to) no doubt aided him, for by the unaided eye
 he was able to detect what to most others was invisible without a
lens, and it was probably owing to this cause that during the whole
of his life he was never able to use the compound microscope, but
 contented himself with a pocket glass of comparatively low power.
 His principal separate works are, ' An Attempt at a Systematic
 Catalogue of the British Tineid» and Pterophorida?,'          1849, with
Supplement in 1851; the volume on "Tineina" in the Insecta
                                                                  '

Britannica series, 1854, which from a strictly scientific point of view
is usually regarded as his best ; ' A Manual of British Butterflies and
Moths,' 2 vols., 1857 and 1859, which is still the most concise treatise
on the subject ; ' The Natural History of the Tineina,' in 13 vols.,
1855-73, with the assistance of his old friend Mr. J. W. Douglas,
and of Professor Zeller, of Glogau (afterwards Stettin), and Pro
fessor Frey, of Zurich, an ambitious work in four languages, each
 volume delineating and describing the life histories of a large number
of species, and for which a host of still unpublished material had

                     '
 Southern Europe (in connexion with which he passed each spring
 for many years upon the Riviera) ; ' Tineina of Syria and Asia
Minor' ; and ' Tineina of North America' (the latter edited by him).
He also published many papers in the Transactions of Societies and
in Journals, and in connexion with entomological journalistic litera
ture Stainton became most prominent. In 1856 he established the
'
   Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer,' published at one penny (!), an
attempt to popularise the study in this country, with, at the same
time, a view to induce mere collectors to look at the subject from a
more serious point of view.       If not always successful, he, through
the medium of this journal, was the means of bringing forward many
                                                                    '
young men who afterwards became prominent workers. The Intel
           '
ligencer went through ten volumes, and was discontinued in 1861.
        '
The Entomologist's Annual ' was commenced in 1855 and continued

                                     xi
 to 1874, mainly a resunU of the additions to the British Insect fauna
 in each year.    In 1864 he, in conjunction with several friends (of
 whom the writer of this notice was one), established the ' Entomo
 logist's Monthly Magazine,' which continues, and of which he looked
 over the revise of the number for December, 1892, only a few
 days before his death.     For many years he held reunions of young
 entomologists at his house, for a long time every Wednesday evening,
 and subsequently less frequently ; and it was on one of these occasions
 that the writer first met him, about thirty-five years ago, an event that
 ripened into a friendship for life.
    In 1848 he joined the Entomological Society of London, was a
 Secretary in 1850-51 and President in 1881-82, and there were few
more regular attendants at the meetings.         He was elected into the
 Linnean Society in 1859, was a Secretary for a short time, and a
Vice-President in 1883-85. He became F.R.S. in 1867, and was on
the Council in 1880-82.      At the meetings of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science he acted as a Secretary of Section
D in 1864, and from 1867 to 1872. He became Secretary of the
Ray Society in 1861 at a critical moment in its history, and con
tinued down to 1872. In 1871 he was instrumental in founding the
                       '
 'Zoological Record Association, of which he became Secretary until
the publication was taken over by the Zoological Society in 1886,
and to his liberality it was largely owing that the ' Record ' was not
allowed to lapse.
    The indications given above show some of the results (but by no
means all) of an unusually busy life ; in fact Stainton revelled in
 work. He was never of a strong constitution, and suffered much
 from gastric troubles. It must be now fully fifteen years ago that
he had a serious illness, but not of long duration.          Nevertheless
those who knew him intimately noticed a marked change in his
character afterwards.      His capacity for close continuous study be
came impaired, and he sought work more and more in a secretarial
and administrative direction.
    Stainton was a man of great geniality, and also of most marked
individuality, extremely methodical and conservative in his habits,
slow to accept or even to realise changes, yet his astonishment when
he became convinced that a change was beneficial, and that he had
not found it out before, was sometimes almost ludicrous.       In politics
he was an active Liberal, and took a prominent position in the party
so far as concerned West Kent, and subsequently the Borough of
Lewisham, until the recent " split," when he became a dissentient. As
a friend, only those who knew him long and intimately can realise the
loss they have sustained. As a benefactor, those who received proof
of his generosity were many, but in this respect he " did good by
 stealth," and it was not until after his death that the writer had even
    YCi. nr.                                                      e

  an idea    of the pecuniary help received from him by some of his
  fellow- workers. In local affairs his interest and benevolence in the
  educational and charitable institutions of the parish of Lewisham are
  now, alas ! matters of history.
     For more than two years before his death his friends noticed with
 concern that his health was visibly and seriously impaired.      A severe
 attack of eczema was followed by chorea, and this by severe gastric
  disturbance.     About a year ago, indications of cancer of the stomach
  showed themselves, and became more and more confirmed. His ill
 ness was painless, but the great weakness constantly increased, as
 did his inability to retain or assimilate nourishment, and he passed
 peacefully away, in full possession of his mental faculties to the
 last.
     In 1846 he married Isabel, the yonngest daughter of Thomas Dunn,
 Esq., of Sheffield, but had no family.      She survives him, and was his
 constant companion in all his work, travels, and excursions, and his
 devoted attendant dnring his long illness.

"   Thomas    Archee Hirst, the third and youngest son of Mr. Thomas
Hirst, a wool-stapler, was born at Heckmondwike, in Yorkshire, on
22nd April, 1830.       He was educated at the West Riding Proprietary
 School   ; and, in 1844 he became an articled pupil of a surveyor at
Halifax.      It was in this office that he made the acquaintance of John
 Tyndall, who became a life- long friend of Hirst, and exercised a deep
influence on his scientific career; and, in particular, it was the
example of Tyndall which led him to give up the pursuit of the
profession at first chosen for him.         Tyndall had left England to
study chemistry, under Bansen, at Marbnrg j and thither Hirst
followed him, in 1849, to study mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
After three years at that University he obtained the degree of Ph.D.,
on examination in his three subjects and an approved dissertation in
 Analytical geometry.       Subsequently, a short time was spent in
 Gottingen with Gauss and Weber, and then he went to Berlin where
he attended lectures by Dirichlet, Steiner, and Joachimsthal.         His
intercourse with Steiner did much to determine the ultimate bent of
his mathematical investigations ; bat some years elapsed before it was
fnlly indicated, as the majority of his earlier papers are devoted to
researches in mathematical physics.
    He succeeded Tyndall, at Queenwood, in 1853, on the appointment
of the latter at the Royal Institution ; but this post was resigned in
1856 on account of the delicate health of his wife, whom ho had
married in 1854. The succeeding winter was spent at Biarritz and
Pan, but without permanent good results, as Mrs. Hirst died in
Paris, in 1857. Tyndall took him to Switzerland for six weeks.

                                    xiii
and, on their return,    left him in Paris, where the next winter was
occupied in attending lectures by Chasles, Lam6, and others, and in
making the acquaintance of the leading French mathematicians. In
the winter of 1858-59 he was in Rome ; and subsequently he travelled
in Italy, making the acquaintance of many mathematicians, especially
of his friend Cremona.
    Retnrning to England in 1860, he was appointed mathematical
master at University College School ; and he held this post for a
period of five years, during which he made his first developments in
teaching geometry. The experience of the results then attained led
him to join the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical
 Teaching, when it was formed in 1871 ; and for the first seven years
of its existence he was its President and took an active part in its
work.
    He had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1861, and it
 was from this date onwards that his researches are devoted to the
 various branches of pure geometry which proved of most absorbing
 interest to him. He was appointed Professor of Physics at University
 College in 1865, and, on the death of Professor De Morgan in 1867,
 he succeeded to the Professorship of Pure Mathematics ; but the
 latter chair he resigned in 1870 to become Assistant Registrar in the
 University of London. In 1873, the date of the establishment of the
 Royal Naval College at Greenwich, he was appointed Director of
 Naval Studies ; and he continued to discharge the duties of that
 office for ten : years.   The precarious condition of his health then
 compelled him to resign : and he subsequently lived in comparative
 retirement, spending most of his winters abroad, until his death on
 16th February, 1892.
     Hirst took a prominent part in the foundation of the London
 Mathematical Society in 1865, served as its President from 1872 to
 1874, and was a member of its Council for over twenty years.         His
 active co-operation with the Society did much to extend its influence :
 and it was largely to the pages of its Proceedings that his papers on
 pure geometry were contributed. These are the papers containing
 the particular researches for which a Royal Medal was awarded to
 him in 1883 — the year which practically marks the termination of
 his public life. He had served on the Council of the Royal Society in
  the years 186-1-66, 1871-73, 1880-82 : after 1883, the only sign of
 activity was the production of several papers, one of which in continua
 tion of his earlier researches is of considerable importance.
     The amount of Hirst's published work is not great ; but his work
 is valuable, and an appreciable portion of it has been translated
  into French and into Italian.     His papers are singularly clear : and
  6ide issues, that might lead him away from the main line of develop
  ment of his subjects, are severely excluded.      It is evident that he

                                      xiv
bestowed      groat care not merely in carrying ont his investigations,
but in considering the form in which they are expressed : and his
relactance to premature publication of incomplete work may be
gathered from the fact that, though, on quitting the Presidential Chair
of the London Mathematical Society on 12th November, 1874, he
made a brief statement of some results which he had obtained in the
 theory of Correlation of Space, the full exposition of his results was
 not communicated to the Society until 9th January, 1890.
    The work with which his name as a mathematician will be most
 definitely associated is contained in his papers on the Correlation of
 Planes and the Correlation of Space.          The simplest space of two
dimensions is a plane, and the elements of such a space are a point
and a straight line ; a correspondence is established between two
planes when all the elements of one plane are connected by a relation
or relations with all the elements of the other.        When the relations
are such that, in general, one element of one plane is associated with
one (and with only one) element of the other plane, and vice versa,
the correspondence is unique.       If each point in one plane corresponds
uniquely with a point in the other, and likewise each line in one
plane uniquely with a line in the other, the correspondence         is called
a homography : the theory of homography is considered at length by
Chasles in his ' Traite de Geometrie Superienre.'        If each point in one
plane correspond uniquely with a line in the other, and likewise each
line in the one plane with a point in the other, the correspondence is
a correlation.     A few properties of correlative planes are proved by
Chasles    in  the treatise quoted : it is Hirst's distinction to have con
structed the theory of correlation of planes and to have developed it
to a great degree of perfection.          The extension of the theory of
 correlation so that it may be applied to space of three dimensions
 was adverted to by Chasles in his ' Apercu Historique' ; the full ex
 tension was carried out by Hirst, whose investigations in this subject,
together with those of his friends Rudolf Sturm, Cremona, and others,
have resulted in important and substantial additions to the theqry of
 pure geometry.
   The following memoranda of Dr. Hirst are doe to Prqfessor
Tyndall ; the present; state of liis health is sufficient to account for
their brevitv.
                                                                 A. E. F.
                      [Memoranda concerning Dr. Hirst.']
   The " railway mania " was at its height, and profitable employ
ment was in prospect for young men trained to the use of the
theodolite, spirit-level, chain, and drawing-pen. Touths of well-to-do
families were articled in numbers to a profession offering so many

                                     XV
attractions.    Under such circumstances, Thomas Archer Hirst was
articled, in 1846, to Mr. Richard Carter, then resident in Halifax, in
whose office, at the time, I happened to be principal assistant.        He
was then about sixteen years of age. His father had been engaged in
the wool trade, his mother was a widow, and he was the youngest of
a family of three sons.
   The West Riding of Yorkshire was then the battle-field of two
great rival railway companies — the West Riding Junction and the
West Riding Union.        Our duty at the time consisted in the prepara
tion of plans and sections of the lines proposed by the latter company.
Save in the office,   I saw but little of Hirst at the commencement —
he being told oft in the field to a party different from mine.       But an
intimacy gradually grew up between us, and in due time, though
I  was ten years his senior, we became steadfast friends.               In
fluenced by the writings of Carlyle, Emerson, Fichte, and other
philosophers, I held, in those days, very serious views of human con
duct and duty. After some time,         I noticed that my conversations
with Hirst were producing a similar shade of earnestness in his mind.
          I
 In 1848, quitted England for Germany, choosing the University of
Marburg, in Hesse Cassel, where, in regard to science, Bunsen was
then the leading star.       Hirst, instead of pursning the profession
chosen for him, soon resolved to follow me to that University.           He
paid me a preliminary visit in the summer of 1849. It was associated
with a pathetic incident. Prior to the examination for the Doctor's
 Degree, it was customary for the candidates to visit the Professors,
and to invite them to be present at the examination. I was on my
 way to the rooms of one of the Professors, when the postman, meeting
me in the street, placed a letter in my hands.       It was from a young
colleague of    Hirst's,  who worked in the same office with him in
Halifax. I was stunned by the perusal of its first few lines. Hirst
had left his mother in good health, and this letter informed me of
her sudden death.       The writer told me that he had also written to
Hirst, but that knowing his strong attachment to his mother, he was
afraid to let him know the worst.           He trusted to my discretion
to disclose it to him in the gentlest manner possible.                  On
returning    to our  lodgings, I found that Hirst had        received   the
letter announcing his mother's illness, and was making preparations
for his immediate return to England. He was far from well. In
those days he frequently suffered from a malady of the throat, which
entirely quitted him in later years. Everything being prepared for
the journey, he had his trunk taken to the coach office, where, after
waiting some time, he entered the Post Wagen. I was in great per
plexity ; for, while shrinking from imparting to him the knowledge
in my possession,   I  could not bear to allow him to return, cherishing
the delusion that his mother still lived. On squeezing his hand for
                                                                   2

                                     xvi
               I said           " Dear Tom,
the last time,        to him,                 prepare your mind for the
worst." His reply was a startled, steadfast look, and, in a moment,
he added, " John, my mother is dead.        Tell me all ; I can bear it."
"Yes," I replied, "she is dead," and he drove away.
   After my severance from Halifax, Hirst was accustomed to hold a
little weekly symposium in his lodgings. A group of yonng fellows
desiring intellectual intercourse used thus to meet, mainly for the
discussion of questions touching upon religion.          One of them, I
remember, was the son of a Congregationalist minister ; another a
young author of considerable ability — at that time an ardent admirer
of Carlyle, but who afterwards became an equally ardent Roman
Catholic.    Hirst had now grown into a tall man, with a singularly
noble countenance.     It was interesting, indeed, to observe how this
nobility of expression increased as thought and aspiration mingled
more and more with his physical conformation.         His hair was dark,
his forehead finely formed, his nose and general features well
chiselled. The only exception that could be taken to the beauty of
his countenance was a certain looseness of lip, which seemed to
indicate a lack of firmness of character. But the indication was
deceptive, for Hirst could be immovable when circumstances called
forth the exercise of firmness.
   There was, at that time, near Halifax, a tract of heath-land called
Skircoat Moor, at one corner of which stood a little cottage called
" The Birdcage." The widow who occupied this cottage eked out a
livelihood by selling sweets to the children who came to the moor.
She had one son, who had begun life as an errand boy in a printer's
office, but who, by good conduct and intelligence, had risen to a highly
respectable position in one of the mills. This youth, whose name was
Booth, attended Hirst's symposium.         His health began to fail, and
Hirst observed with anxiety the increasing pallor of his countenance
as he walked to and from his work.        Medical advice was resorted to,
and Booth's malady was pronounced to be consumption.           His weak
ness increased, his usefulness as a clerk diminished, until at last
Hirst insisted that he must cease working and direct the whole of
his attention to the care of his health. As to his salary, he (Hirst)
undertook to make that good.        The poor youth lingered long. Hirst
had followed me to Marburg, had quitted that University, and had
become a favourite pupil of the illustrious Steiner at Berlin.       The
 Semester had begun ; its busiest time had set in. One morning, how
ever, he made his appearance in London, and told me that Booth,
who was obviously dying, had written, imploring his benefactor to
visit him. In response to that letter, Hirst had quitted his studies
and had come over to England.            Travelling down to Halifax, he
found that Booth's chief anxiety related to his mother.      " What will
become of her," he exclaimed,     " when  I  am gone ?
                                                       "   The means at

                                     xvii
Hirst'8 command     at the time were very moderate.           Through the
accidents of trade, or the miscondnct of individuals, the property left
by his father had, in great part, disappeared.            Still, without a
moment's hesitation,    he gave  the  dying youth    the comforting assur
ance that his mother would be properly taken care of. For some years
afterwards, while Hirst continued in Germany, I was myself the
intermediary throngh whom the widow's allowance passed to her
hands.
   Thp sum paid when Hirst was articled to Mr. Carter, together with
a professional education of five years, was naturally, on the part of
his relatives, expected to produce some tangible result; and when
they found that he had resolved to relinquish it all for the sake of
the cultivation of his intellect, they thought his resolution a wild one.
But he never wavered for a moment, and, except on occasions when
his health caused me anxjety,      I never wavered in the conviction that
the step he had taken was a wise one. Throughout the winter and
spring in Marburg, our days were spent in labour, attending lectures,
working in the chemical laboratory, and studying at home. At
10 p.m., the stroke of a piano by Hirst gave notice that the work of
the day was ended.      We had music and light reading afterwards, the
latter including the ' Essays of Montaigne,' which proved to us a
source of strength as well as of delight.       At 11 p.m. we went to bed.
I  was earliest up, for, soon observing that hard study was telling
upon the younger and less vigorous constitution,       I persuaded him to
give  more  time to repose.
   After  J   had quitted Marburg,        leaving Hirst behind me, Dr.
 Simpson, a medical man with a passion for chemistry, afterwards
Professor of Chemistry at Queen's College, Cork, came to the Uni
versity to pursue his studies in Bunsen's laboratory.           He brought
with him his wife and family and a sister of his wife. They were
both sisters of John Martin, the pure-minded Young Irelander.             Ac
quaintance ripened    into friendship  between   the young people,    friend
ship into love, and, after Hirst had taken my place at Queenwood
College in 1853, he married Miss Anna Martin.           A few years of un
alloyed happiness were wound up by an attack of tuberculosis, which
ended in her death in 1857.      He had taken her to Biarritz, thence to
Pan, whence he had returned to Paris, where she died.           I was on my
way to Switzerland when intelligence of the calamity reached me.
Ignorant of their address in Paris, I sought him in his old qnarters.
Failing to find him there, and guided by a vague indication,        I sought
him in the Rue Marboauf. Here, though baulked at first, I dis
covered where he lodged.        On turning, afterwards, the corner of a
street, I met him face to face, looking as white as marble.          He was
returning from ordering his wife's coffin.
   I stood beside him in the cemetery of Pere la Chaise when she was

                                    XV111
lowered into the grave, and afterwards carried him with me to the
Alps.    Prior to joining me at Chamounix, he had three days of lonely
wandering ; communing with himself under his changed conditions.
We made the little auberge at the Montanvert, which was then a very
small affair, our permanent residence.       For six weeks his life was
filled with healthy exercise, under conditions where constant atten
tion was necessary to his personal safety.      Nothing could have been
better calculated to divert his mind from the grief which weighed
upon it. A few days after our arrival, we were joined by Professor
Huxley.     As we assembled night after night round our pine- wood fire,
life became to all of us more and more a thing to be enjoyed. We
returned from the Alps, Hirst halting in Paris, where for some time
he took up his abode.       Here he made the acquaintance and secured
the friendship of the foremost mathematicians.       He went afterwards
to Italy ; and was at the village of Solferino, helping the wounded,
on the day after the battle.       In Italy he met Professor Cremona,
who remained his friend in a very special sense to the end of
his life.    On his return to London, Hirst became mathematical
master in University College School, then Professor of Applied
Mathematics in University College.        For the sake of his health, he
afterwards accepted the Assistant Registrarship of the University.
His final appointment was to the Post of Director of Studies in the
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, under the presidency of Admiral
Sir Cooper Key, who was succeeded by Admiral Fanshawe ; Mr.
Goschen was at the time of his appointment First Lord of the
Admiralty.    Hirst never forgot the Minister's high-minded sympathy
with his mathematical studies, or his willingness so to arrange
matters as to reconcile the prosecution of those studies with his
duties as Director.
    During his later years, the state of Hirst's health frequently caused
his friends the gravest anxiety. He relinquished in succession the
posts he had occupied, retiring finally from Greenwich with a Govern
ment pension.      During the present calamitous year, he was smitten
with influenza, to which he finally succumbed.
    I have already given an example of Hirst's kindness of heart.
To this it may be added that, apart from his scientific labours, his
life throughout was one of wise beneficence.
                                                                  J. T.
    Edward   Killwick Calver, born 1813, entered the Royal Navy in
 1828,  in the navigating branch, on board H.M.S. " Crocodile."
After a further term of foreign service in the " Satellite," he in 183(3
 commenced    his long period of service as a marine surveyor on the
 Home Station. For thirty-six years, with scarcely a break, he served
in this capacity mainly on the south and east coasts of Great Britain.

                                     XIX
From 1847 to 1871 he was in charge of this survey, and produced
charts of nearly the whole of the eastern coasts.
   Captain Calver's constant employment in the rivers and estuaries
of the east coast gave him great experience in the action of tides,
waves, and running water ; and he paid mnch attention to studying
the principles which should underlie works for the conservation of
depth and improvements of tidal harbours and entrances.        His views
on this subject were remarkably sound.         They were set forth in
various pamphlets, the principal work being entitled, " On the Con
servation and Improvement of Tidal Rivers," published in 1853. In
this he anticipated many of the principles which have now for long
been accepted in carrying out artificial works; and his predictions as
to the results of various artificial works have nearly all been verified.
He made several valuable reports to the Admiralty on the subject of
harbours of refuge.
   Captain Calver retired in 1871, and died at Vevey, in Switzerland,
where he had of late resided, on 28th October, 1892.
   Captain Calver became an Associate of the Institution of Civil
Engineers in 1866, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
1873.
