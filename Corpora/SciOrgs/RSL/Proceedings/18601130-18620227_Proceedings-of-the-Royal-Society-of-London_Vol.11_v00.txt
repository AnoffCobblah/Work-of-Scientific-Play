    The Chairman then addressed         the Society as follows     : —
        Gentlemen,
 It   is known to you all that early in the summer our excellent
 President suffered from an affection of the eyes, which was partially
 relieved   by an operation, and that he is now about to undergo a
second operation for the removal           of   a cataract.    Under these cir
cumstances,     Sir Benjamin Brodie, prompted by his well-known un
willingness to hold an office when temporarily              disqualified for the
fullest performance of its duties, signified, by letter to the Council
towards the end of September, his desire to decline to be put in
nomination for the Presidency at the ensuing (that is the present)
election.     The Council having duly .considered Sir B. Brodie's letter,
and     looking forward with confident hope            and  expectation to the
recovery of his sight by the impending operation, were unanimously
of opinion     that the interests of the Royal Society would be most
effectually promoted by his allowing himself to be again put in
nomination      for the Presidency    ;  feeling assured     also that his con
senting to do so would be in accordance           with the general wish of the
Society.      The Council further    requested     me, as the Treasurer      of the
Society, and in the absence of the President officiating            as Chairman
of the Council,     to communicate personally with         Sir Benjamin Brodie
(then at Tunbridge Wells), and to convey              the earnest hope of the
Council that he would comply with their wishes.                  Thus solicited,
Sir B. Brodie     has consented   to be again placed in nomination for the
office of your President.       In making this communication, it         is fitting
that    I should add that, in the opinion of his medical advisers, the
probability of the operation which he is about to undergo being
successful in its issue is very strong, and that they have a con
fident hope that his sight will be sufficiently restored to enable him
to reassume the duties in the spring,          if it should now be your plea
sure to re-elect him.
     Sir B. Brodie    has placed in my hands an Address, which, had he
been able to have taken the Chair at this Anniversary Meeting, it
*was    his intention to have delivered himself.           This  address   he has
requested me to read to you, which         I  shall proceed to do after     I  shall
have briefly noticed some subjects which have occupied the attention
of your     Council in the past year, and on which it is desirable that
the Society should       be informed.
                                                                  n 2

    1.                                —
        Scientific Relief Fund. The intention of several Fellows of
the Society to promote the establishment of a Permanent Fund, to
be invested in the name of the Royal Society, the interest of which
Fund     should be applied (under the control of the Council) to the
aid of such scientific men and their families as may from time to
time require and          deserve    assistance,    having been notified to the
Council, accompanied           by  a   list of several     intended donations, the
Council     passed    a resolution       accepting     the proposed       Trust, and
directing that all Donations on account thereof, paid to the Bankers
of the Society, should           be invested in Government Securities,            and
constitute a Fund to         be named     the  " Scientific Relief Fund,"      the in
terest  of which should        be at the disposal     of the President    and Council
under the following conditions, viz.           : —
    " That    the President and Council of the Royal Society have                  full
power to appoint Committees, or to make such arrangements                     as they
may, from time to time, consider most advantageous                   for the carrying
out the objects of the Trust in the most liberal sense.
    " That   no application for relief be entertained except on the recom
mendation of the President of one of the following Chartered Societies                :
— The     Astronomical,       Chemical, Geographical,         Geological, Linnean,
or Royal Society       ;  it being understood that the            several Presidents
will consult their       respective    Councils    as  to the persons     whom they
intend to recommend for relief.
    " That in each     case in which assistance         is granted, a record   of the
recommendation be entered               on   the Minutes      of the Council of the
Royal Society.
    " That    the amounts and particulars of the Fund,              as invested,  with
the account of the receipts during the preceding year, the gross ex
penditure and disposable balance in hand, appear in the annual pub
lished Financial Statement of the Royal Society."
   The Council      have made arrangements           for the administration of the
proceeds     of this Trust- Fund in conformity with           the above conditions.
The    sum     invested    in the New 3 per Cent. Annuities              amounts at
present    to X4824      9*. Od.
   2. Increased Gratuities           to   the Secretaries.    —The     duties of the
Secretaries      having augmented         greatly of late years, in consequence
partly of the increased activity with which various branches of science
are   cultivated in this country            and   the greater number of papers

  annually     presented    to   the Society, and       partly    from new      duties
  devolving on them, it appeared to the Council desirable to reconsider
  the amounts of the       " honoraria "    presented    annually to those gentle
  men as an acknowledgement, but by no means                    as a  remuneration,
  of their    services.    As a preliminary        step, a  Committee * was ap
  pointed to inquire into and to report on the duties of the Secretaries
  at   various times, and       on  the  gratuities which have been awarded
  them, as well as on the present financial condition of the Society.
  With your permission I will read the Report of this Committee.
      " Your Committee
                              beg to report to the Council, that, in perform
  ing the task which was imposed upon them, they have inquired into
  the duties of the Secretaries         at various times, the gratuities which
  have been nwarded to them, and the financial condition              of the Society.
      " They    have been favoured with valuable information and opinions
  by former Officers of the Royal Society, — Sir              John Herschel, Mr.
  Brande, Dr. Roget, and Sir John Lubbock.
      "  Previous to the year 1/20 no regular Salaries were assigned to
  the Secretaries,     but it was customary to present them from time to
  time with sums varying from £10 to £20 under the name of                       '
                                                                                   Gra
  tuities.'
      " In   1720, on the motion      of the President, Sir Isaac Newton, the
   Council directed that £50 should be paid to each of the two Secre
  taries annually.       In  1 732 this amount was increased         to £60, and in
   1760 to £70 10*.          In November      1799, on the motion         of  the Pre
   sident, Sir Joseph      Banks, the amount of the Salaries was recon
   sidered by the Council, and raised to One Hundred Guineas to each
   Secretary, at which amount they have remained                 from that time to
   the present.
       " The   office of ' Foreign Secretary    '
                                                   originated in a legacy of £500
   bequeathed to       the Society in 1719        by Mr. Robert Keck, for the
. express purpose        of remunerating      a person    for carrying on foreign
   correspondence.        In  1 720 the first Foreign Secretary was appointed,
   with   a Salary of £20 a year, which sum has been paid, without in
   crease, from that time to the present.
       " It is the concurrent opinion       of all who   have the best       means   of
   knowing, that since the gratuities were last fixed in             1 799 the busi-

   Dr. W. Farr.

                                                        (')
ness    of   the Society and the duties                   of the        Secretaries      have largely in
creased.           The    increase      of Fellows and the larger income of the So
ciety have          enabled      it     to    extend its operations.                   In the       ten years
1790 to 1799, 319 papers were                           communicated to the Society                     ;   and
in the ten years 1850 to 1859, the number of such papers was 672.
Some     of   the communications are short notices for publication                                      in the
    Proceedings,' and         it   is   impossible to determine precisely in what ratio
'
the work has increased                 ;     but your Committee are disposed to believe
that    it    is   represented          approximately               by   the above        figures.          The
                    now      edit the             Transactions               and the         Proceedings,'
                                                                       '
Secretaries
                                              '                                          '
which are found so useful by the Fellows, and this latter duty has
added considerably to their labour.
      " The current         revenue          of the Society            may be set down at about
£3514, of which              XI 150        are derived from rents and                     dividends, and
£517      from the Stevenson                   bequest.            The latter         sum,   it   is   known,
will    increase     as    lives fall in.       The annual subscriptions amount to
£1 126    ;     the entry fees,         estimated on an average of eleven years, will
be about      XI 70   ;   the compositions £360                    ;   the
                                                                             '
                                                                                 Transactions' will yield
£276; making               the   aggregate           revenue           under these heads £1932.
Your Committee             see no reason to believe that these sources                             of income
are    likely   to fail.
    " The current annual expenditure may                                 be stated at about £2839            ;
namely, £1 177 on printing; £764 on gratuities, salaries and wages                                           ;
£187 on books and                  binding; £511                   on house         expenses; £200 on
Catalogue of Periodicals.                     These items necessarily fluctuate, and the
printing bill last year exceeded considerably the above amount                                          ;   but
the amount just stated for printing                           is   estimated from an average of
the last eleven years.                 The     income         of the Society          has thus for some
years exceeded the expenditure                       by   about £675.
    " Looking        at the duties which now devolve                              upon the Secretaries,

— looking        also at the remuneration which                        it    is   found desirable to give
gentlemen          who discharge less onerous duties merely                                  as   editors of
literary works in the present                     day, — your Committee                  are      of opinion
that the Council will be acting quite in conformity with the sound
principles which were laid down in Sir Isaac Newton's presidency,
anil have been acted on since,                     by   increasing the gratuity                   to each of

                                                  7
the two Secretaries.            As the result of the inquiries made by your
Committee, they would suggest                     that the addition         should be £95,
raising each      gratuity      from £105 to £200.                  This would involve          an
increase of £190 in the expenditure.
  " The relations of the Society with foreign countries may                                     be
largely extended,      and your Committee are                   of opinion that     to accom
plish this object £80 may be advantageously added to the £20 now
voted, making the annual gratuity                     of the Foreign Secretary £100.
  " The total augmentation of                    the expenditure under this arrange
ment would be £270, leaving                  a   probable annual surplus of £400 to
be devoted to the numerous purposes which fall naturally within the
scope   of   the Society's inquiries.
  " Your Committee              are   of opinion that the            offices efficiently dis
charged will still     be to a great extent honorary                 ;   and that   so   long   as
the Society is    so   fortunate as to have able, industrious, and eminent
men as its Secretaries          it will     be still largely in their debt.
  "   Should the finances of the Society, through any unforeseen                               cir
cumstance,      require   it,   there would not, your Committee apprehend,
be any difficulty in again revising the scale                    of gratuities which may
be awarded."
  The recommendatious of                   the Committee regarding the augmenta
tion of the gratuities have been adopted by the Council                             ;    and   the
view taken by the Committee of the financial condition of the Society
has been thus far confirmed by an excess in the present year of in
come over expenditure (the increased                     gratuities being included in the
latter) of £742 2*.
   3. Duties of the Foreign                 Secretary.     —The      Council   having thus
augmented       the    honorarium            of the Foreign          Secretary, have           had
under their consideration the advantage                         which the Society might
derive from an extension              of    the duties     of   the Foreign Secretary as
hitherto defined       by   the Statutes, and            have    made additions to those
duties under the three following heads, viz.                    :—
  "1.    To prepare the Biographical                     Notices of deceased             Foreign
Members for publication in the                    Proceedings.'
                                              '
  "2.   To collect such information respecting the labours and disco
veries of Foreign Men of Science as may serve to aid the Council in
the nomination of persons for election by the Society as Foreign
Members, and in the award of the Copley and Rumford Medals.

                                             8
     " 3. To furnish the Society, from time to time, with early notice
of   researches      of special   importance carried on abroad         ;  such notice
to be drawn up in the form             of a short communication, to be read as
early    as  practicable at an evening Meeting of the Society, and pub
lished in the      '                    "
                      Proceedings.'
     These additions are to be regarded for the present                simply in the
light of Regulations        made under the authority        of the Council. They
may     hereafter be embodied            in the Statutes,   if  after trial it shall
appear      desirable    to do so, with      any  further additions or modifica
tions which experience          may point out.
     I shall now proceed, with your permission, to read Sir Benjamin
 Brodie's Address.
     " Since our last Anniversary,           the Royal Society has continued to
pursue its mission, and          I  hope that   I may add, with no unsuccessful
result.      Papers of great importance have been given to the world in
 the last volume of the ' Philosophical               Transactions ;'       and    many
 others which are of much interest may be found in the lately pub
 lished Numbers         of our     '                    This last publication has

 become a valuable addition to scientific literature, and,               as  such, has
 risen in estimation both in this and in foreign countries, beyond the
 expectation of those           by whom it was originally suggested.                The
 meetings     of the Society have been fully attended ; and the occasional
 dryness of scientific details has been not unfrequently relieved by the
  display of new experiments, and by discussions in which many of our
  Fellows have taken part, uninfluenced by any other desire than that
  of mutually giving and receiving information.               The increasing num
  ber of candidates for admission into the Royal Society sufficiently
  shows     how highly that honour is appreciated by the public                 ;  and I
  may take this opportunity of repeating an observation which                    I made
  formerly, namely, that this distinction,            like those afforded by the
  Universities, is all the more valuable to those on whom it is conferred,
  inasmuch     as  it is one of the very few which cannot be obtained either
  by the favour of the great or through the partiality of friends.                    As
  the election of the Fellows is now conducted, it is barely possible that
  that honour should be on any occasion improperly bestowed.                       There
   can indeed be no doubt that the present mode              of  election    has been a
   great improvement on that which had been adopted previously, and

                                                 9
that it has very much contributed to maintain the honour and dignity
of our Institution.           I  make this acknowledgement the more readily,
because      I  must own that       I   was not a convert to the new system              in
the first instance.          It  was perhaps because         I  had been intimate with
the Royal         Society from      a  very early period of my life, that, when
the change was first suggested,               I  was led to believe, in common with
my friend Robert Brown and some other of the older Fellows, that it
would have been better for us stare super antiquas vias.                      Experience
has altered my opinion on the subject.
      "It   would, however, be unworthy of us, as the living representatives
 of   those great men by whom the Royal Society was founded, to con
 sider the progress of the physical sciences only               as  it regards  ourselves.
 Looking       abroad into what is going on in general society,                 I am   sure
 that there is no individual              now present who is not gratified to find
 that there is      a desire    to become acquainted with            natural phenomena
 and the laws which govern them, much beyond what existed even at
 the beginning of the present               century   ;  and   that the opportunity of
 satisfying that desire, to          a  certain extent, is afforded to persons            of
 every class,       not only in the metropolis, but also in the provincial
 towns, and sometimes even in our villages, by means 6f Mechanics'
 and Literary Institutions,            and by occasional       lectures   where   no such
 Institutions      exist.     As a part of the education of those who ought to
 be the best instructed members                 of the community, in our schools and
  colleges     the   study of the physical           sciences has already     taken root    ;
  and     there is every       reason     to   believe   that the tree will grow and
  flourish.
       " In the    address which        I  offered to you at our last Anniversary,         I
  adverted to the influence which such studies must have in training
  some     of  the higher faculties        of the mind    ; and   I  also adverted   to the
  effect which they have already produced in laying the foundation                        of
  a   better method of investigation in other departments of knowledge.
  It   is not my intention to trouble you with a repetition                of these obser
  vations    ;   there are, however, some other points belonging to the same
  subject, to which        I would      willingly draw your attention.
       " In holding     the opinion that much advantage would arise from the
   study of the physical sciences being regarded as an essential part of a
   liberal education,      I  apprehend that it has never entered into the mind
   of  any person who has seriously reflected on the subject, that                it should

                                                       10
supersede those other studies which form the basis                                  of such    an educa
tion in this and others of the more highly civilized communities at
the present day.   One of these studies, indeed, namely mathematics,
is necessary to the physical sciences themselves, there being no one of
these sciences to which, under certain circumstances, mathematical
reasoning may not be usefully applied                        ;   whilst one especially, and that
the foremost and grandest and most important of the whole, is so
entirely founded upon               it,   that,   if   this were taken away, there would be
very little of the science left.                   The      languages     of       the ancient nations
of   Greece      and     Italy     have     no such direct relations to the physical
sciences      as mathematics            ;   but
                                              I        know no better method than that
which the study of them affords of training the mind, at an early
period of life, to habits of thought and attention, and so of fitting                                   it
for other studies afterwards.                     There      is   another advantage             to be de
rived from those pursuits which lead us to                          a    knowledge of the Greek
and Roman classics.                     Greek and Roman literature has been the
foundation of the best literature of modern Europe                                 ;   and an acquaint
ance with        it   stores   the mind of the youthful student with graceful
recollections and noble thoughts, which may exercise                                     a    wholesome
influence over him through all the rest of his life.                                   Further,   it   may
be observed           that the study of the ancient languages                           is   an excellent
introduction to         a   knowledge of grammar, and of the use of language
generally, and this knowledge                      is   ofkind the importance of which
                                                             a
cannot well be over-estimated                 ;    not only as    by means of language
                                                                    it   is
that we are enabled to communicate our thoughts to each other and
hand them down to those who are to come after us, but because
language      is      in itself an instrument of thought, without which                                the
reasoning powers which God has given us could be turned only to a
very small account.
     "   There   is   indeed no sufficient reason why the instruction                   of youth
should be limited to one of these subjects,                              to the exclusion of the
other, there being "ample room, and verge enough" for both;                                             it
being quite true, as has been lately observed                            in an address delivered
at   Edinburgh by         a    noble Lord,        a    Fellow of our Society, that what                 is
wanted in education                is   not so much that              a   great deal should             be
learned of any one subject, as that whatever                                  is   learned should be
learned thoroughly             ;   so that the student should acquire the habit,
so important in after life, of undertaking nothing which he does not

                                          11
undertake in earnest.          One object of education undoubtedly is to
furnish    the mind with        knowledge which may be turned to good
account hereafter.        But that     is not the only object.         And there    is
always danger that, in exercising the faculty of learning over much,
the higher faculties of thought and observation may not be exercised
sufficiently.    There     may indeed well be, for the higher order of
minds, too much        as well   as  too little    of systematic education     ;  and
hence    it is that for      some     of  the   greatest    achievements     in   the
way of scientific discovery, we are indebted to those who, like Sir
Humphry Davy,         were   in  a great degree self-educated.
    " It is a poor pedantry that would exalt one kind             of knowledge by
disparaging others.        Literature, the arts, the moral and the physical
sciences, all  of these in their      respective     ways have   tended to elevate
the condition of mankind.           But it is by the union of the whole that
the greatest    results   have    been obtained.        That union is indeed as
necessary to the higher forms           of civilization,   as the combination       of
rays of different degrees of refrangibility is to the constitution of a
beam of solar light.
    " Of the physical      sciences,   it may,    I apprehend, be truly asserted
that they have an advantage           over every other department of know
ledge,  — in this   respect,    that the field of inquiry is practically unli
mited.     The student      may indeed meet with an impassable barrier in
one direction,    but in that case he has only to proceed in another.
As   he advances,    the horizon which terminates his view recedes before
him.     He   enters   on fresh scenes,       gathers in new knowledge         ;  and
every addition     which he makes becomes the foundation of further
knowledge, to be afterwards acquired             ;  so that, at the end    of a  long
life, he finds himself a learner still.         In   the meanwhile, under what
ever circumstances he may be placed, — whether he be in the cultivated
valley, on the glaciers of the Alps, on the wide sea, in the crowded
city, in the busy factory, in the broad sunshine, or in the starlight
night, — he has only to look around him to find objects which have to
him a peculiar interest, exhibiting relations which are not perceptible
 to those whose minds have been otherwise engaged.                   While viewing
 the gorgeous   sunset, he finds, in the changing colour          of the clouds   and
in the dark    blue sky above, illustrations         of the phenomena and laws
 of light.    The   flashes    of the aurora are to him not mere objects of

                                          12
curiosity, but are associated with the magnetism            of the earth, —with
that mysterious force which, like the force of gravity, connects us
with the sun, and probably with all the other heavenly bodies, even
those which are at the greatest distance from us.             In the tumultuous
movements     of  the atmosphere,     which tear up trees by their roots, and
cause the destruction      of life by shipwreck,      he recognizes the law         of
storms, and is enabled to comprehend how the mariner, by steering
his course in one direction, may avoid those dangers                  to which he
would be exposed      if he  were to steer    it in another.     In this way it is
plain that even     a moderate     acquaintance     with the physical sciences
cannot fail to add to the interest of life        ; an advantage     which, under
occasional    circumstances, may         be extended     even   to   the    humbler
classes   of society.     A professor of      one   of our ancient universities,
and a distinguished Fellow        of the Linnaean Society,         does not con
sider it to be incompatible with his duties            as  a parish priest, nor
beneath his dignity as a philosopher, to give such simple instructions
in Botany to the girls of the village in which he resides               as  may en
able them to understand the flora          of the neighbouring      district  ;   thus
affording them not only       a  useful, but a cheerful occupation for hours
which would otherwise be passed in idleness.
    " It  was on the 28th     of November, just now         200 years      ago, that
several eminent individuals, who had previously been in the habit                    of
meeting for the purpose of communicating with each other on subjects
of common interest,        assembled    in Gresham College, and agreed to
form themselves into       a Society, having for its object the prosecuting
of physico-mathematical         experimental learning.         When      they reas
sembled on the      following week,      it was reported to them that what
they proposed was highly         approved by the reigning Monarch              ;   who
intimated at the same time his desire to do what lay in his power
towards promoting         so useful an      undertaking.     Accordingly         steps
were taken for the incorporation      of the Society under      a Royal Charter,
that Charter being conferred on them in due form two years after
wards.     Such was the origin of the Institution which           I  have now the
honour to address     ;  and to which the world is indebted for the long
series   of scientific memoirs contained in the           150 volumes         of the
'                                   The publication of these 'Transactions,'
  Philosophical Transactions.'

                                            13
however, was not begun until the year 16G5, and then only in the
form of a few pages, produced at uncertain intervals, which, being
collected, made       a  thin volume at the end of the year.
     "  Many years elapsed before the 'Philosophical            Transactions'    be
came of larger dimensions.            But   we are not therefore to suppose, be
cause so little was done in the way          of publication, that little was jeally
done for the promotion of the         objects which the Founders of the Royal
Society had in view.           At this time Lord Bacon       had already pointed
out the right method to be pursued for the advancement                 of learning;
 and the abstract       science  of Geometry, inherited from an ancient na
 tion, had been partially applied in the investigation of the physical
 sciences.     Nevertheless it cannot be said that these sciences were more
 than in an infant state       ; and some which are now among the greatest
 subjects    of attention, for instance Chemistry       and Geology, had barely
 been     called into existence.      There was indeed as yet no sufficient
 number of facts         collected on which       the superstructure     of  science
 could be raised.         The Founders of       the Royal Society well compre
 hended what was required.             If I  may be allowed to use        a  homely
 expression,      they had the good sense to begin at the beginning            ; and
 their first endeavours        were to collect a larger number       of  facts by a
 course     of experimental inquiry. t)r. Birch's 'History,' which occu
 pies a period of twenty-seven years from the foundation of the Royal
 Society, furnishes us with a great deal of valuable information as to
 this part of their labours, and gives us a more just notion of what the
  Royal Society accomplished in those days, than can be obtained from
       '                                  '
  the    Philosophical Transactions         themselves.   At  the several Meetings
  experiments were suggested,            which    were   afterwards carried into
  effect.     Mr., afterwards Dr. Hooke,         received a special appointment
  as experimentalist      ; for which office he was well qualified, not less by
  his practical skill, than by his great and discursive genius.             The col
 lection of     the experiments proposed and made during the period which
  I have    mentioned would of itself form an instructive volume.                  It
  might not indeed add much to our present              knowledge, but it would
  show us in what manner much of that knowledge with which we are
  now familiar had its origin, and at the same time furnish a grand
  example      of the caution    and   circumspection with which all experi
  mental inquiries should be conducted.
      " With the gradual exteusion of knowledge,            the method    of inquiry

                            '

borate    memoirs superseded        the brief notices of which        the earlier
volumes were composed.
    " It  is not for us to give nor even to form an opinion of what the
Royal Society      has done'during        the last few years    ;  but we are at
liberty to refer to what has been done by our predecessors             ;  and with
regard to them we are justified in the conclusion that they have well
performed the task which they had undertaken.               In adding    to human
knowledge, they have added to human happiness.                    Standing apart
from politics, they have pursued an independent course,                  having no
selfish objects in view, but acting harmoniously with the Government
of the   day, whatever      it might be. I am sure that every existing Fel
low of the Society will join with me in the desire that we and those
who come after us may continue in the same path, so                as to   maintain
 the dignity of science, and do honour to our country:            —
                      '
                        Alteram in lustrum meliusque semper
                         Proroget aevum.'

     On the motion of         Mr. Horner,     seconded   by Sir R. Murchison,       it
 was resolved,   —
     " That    the account of the proceedings of the Council communi
 cated from the Chair, be printed and circulated among the Fellows.
     "  That the thanks of the Society be returned to the President for
 his Address, with the expression of sincere regret for the cause of his
 absence   ; and that he be requested to permit his Address to be         printed."
     The Chairman then announced the adjudication                 of the Medals,
 and presented     them in the following terms.
     The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor Robert Wilhelm
  Bunsen, of Heidelberg, one of our Foreign Members, for his re
  searches on Cacodyl, Gaseous Analysis, the Volcanic Phenomena                     of
  Iceland, and other researches.
     For thirty   years    Professor Bunsen has been         a most    industrious
  and successful     investigator of various subjects in the domain of
  chemistry.      His researches on Cacodyl supplied the first instance
  of  a  compound radical, behaving through a complete series of reac
  tions like an elementary body, and being prepared in the free state

                                          15
by processes      similar to those by which many metals are prepared
from their compounds.          Notwithstanding      the extraordinary difficul
ties  of the  research,   Professor Bunsen carried it through completely,
and with such accuracy that every one of his results has stood the
test of subsequent       investigation,    and  not one of his formulae         has
been altered.       The difficulty   and danger attending these manipula
tions with spontaneously inflammable, highly poisonous and volatile
bodies, are quite unparalleled,        and enhance      our admiration of the
singular perseverance       with which the subject was followed out into
its most minute ramifications.           The importance of the results,         and
the value of the influence which they have exerted                on the develop
ment of sound views in organic chemistry can scarcely be over-esti
mated.       The most important          investigations    in   subsequent    years
have been mainly applications of the theory of organic radicals to
new bodies,      or extensions    of its  use in cases in which       it had   been
already applied.
    Another most important service to science, was Professor Bunsen's
invention     of  a simple and     effective   apparatus for analysing gases,
with    an   accuracy previously      unattained.     His     researches    on this
head may justly entitle him to be regarded            as   the founder of accu
rate gas-analysis, — a branch of quantitative analysis which now far
 excels all others in the perfection of its results.
     His  researches   on the gases evolved from blast-furnaces consuming
 charcoal, coke and coal        (the latter made in conjunction with Dr.
 Playfair), are models of experimental and analytical skill, and have
 led to important applications of the waste gases of such furnaces                to
 useful purposes.
     Professor Bunsen's researches on the volcanic phenomena of Ice
 land,    besides   being valuable contributions        to   mineral    chemistry,
 exhibit a masterly application of chemistry and physics to geological
 phenomena.
     It is  proper to remark that the important             researches   in which
  Professor Bunsen is now engaged with Professor Kirchhoff, not being
 yet complete,      do not form any part       of the grounds on which           the
  Medal has been awarded.
        Professor Miller,
     In transmitting this Medal       to Professor Bunsen, you         will not fail

                                           10
to convey    to him the deep interest with           which the Royal Society
regards   the progress of the very important researches,              in which he
is engaged in conjunction with Professor Kirchhoff.
    A Royal      Medal     has been     awarded to Mr. William Fairbairn,
F.R.S., for his various Experimental Inquiries            on the Properties      of
the Materials employed in Mechanical Construction, contained in the
 '                                   '
   Philosophical Transactions          and in the publications     of other Scien
tific Societies.
    Mr. Fairbairn'    3  first scientific publication   was, I   believe, a small
volume published in 1831 on 'Canal Navigation,'               illustrative of the
advantage    of  the use    of Steam    as a moving power on canals.        In this
work he detailed the results of experiments made on the Forth and
Clyde canal and on other canals in Scotland, and recorded experiments
made about the same time by other parties as to the traction               of light
boats by horse-power at high velocities.
    In  1837 he contributed his first paper to the Manchester             Literary
and Philosophical Society, being " An Experimental Inquiry into the
Strength and other Properties of Cast Iron."              This    was the first  of
many valuable papers on the same and similar subjects which have
                                                  '
been from time to time published in the             Memoirs  of   the Manchester
Society,' in those of the British Association and of the Institution of
Civil Engineers,      and in the
                                   '
                                      Philosophical  Transactions.'      It is well
known also, and has beeu warmly acknowledged by Mr. Eaton Hodg-
kinson, that Mr. Fairbairn rendered            most valuable assistance     to Mr.
Hodgkinson in his experimental inquiries into the strength of iron (for
which the Royal Medal was awarded in 1841), by placing at Mr.
Hodgkinson's disposal his works at Manchester, in which the experi
ments were conducted free of cost.
    In the Transactions of      the Manchester Geological Society         in 1841,
there is a paper by Mr. Fairbairn            on the economy      of raising water
from Coal Mines        ; and  in Weale's Quarterly Papers on Engineering,
an account    of his  " Ventilated     Water-wheel,"   a very material improve
ment in the construction of water-wheels.
    Since that time his experimental researches and his contributions
to various scientific bodies have been very numerous and important.
Amongst these       I  may specify Papers on Fire-proof Constructions            —
On the Strength of Iron and the best Form of Beams and                   Pillars —

                                         17
On Boiler     Explosions   — On    the Collapse      of Tubes under Pressure —
On the Density of Steam            — On     the   principle of Construction of
              —
Iron Ships and on other kindred subjects                 :  many of these being
within   the period required by the terms           of  the award   of  the  Royal
Medal.     Of separate works may be noticed a volume on the Conway
and Britannia Tubular Bridges (1849), including his researches on
the best form and strength of wrought iron beams.                A work ' On the
                                                                               '
Application     of Cast   and   Wrought Iron        to  Building purposes         (in
 1854 and 1857), and a valuable compendium entitled               " Useful Infor
mation for Engineers,"       in 185G and 1860.
    Perhaps it may be said with truth that there is no single individual
living who has     done so much for practical science,          who has made so
many careful experimental inquiries on subjects of primary importance
to the commercial and manufacturing interests of the country, or
 who has   so liberally contributed them to the world.
      Mr. Fairnairn,
   In presenting this Medal        to you from this Chair, 1       will venture    to
say that the award of the Royal Medal,                —the     Medal which Her
Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to place at the disposal
of the President    and Council,   — for scientific    services such as yours, so
eminently conducive       as  they have been to the general good, is even
peculiarly appropriate.
   A Royal Medal      has been awarded to         Dr. Augustus Waller, for his
investigations    into the     Anatomy      and   Physiology of the Nervous
System, and for the introduction of a valuable method of conducting
such investigations.
   Previously to Dr. Waller's        inquiries it was known that, when a
nerve is cut across,    the distal portion, severed from its central con
nexion, undergoes      disorganization    ;   but Dr. Waller was the first to
conceive, or at least to make known the idea            of employing    the section
and disorganization of a nerve       as a means     of tracing out its distribu
tion.   In  the art  of injection anatomists      have long possessed a method
of following   even the finest branches       of the  blood-vessels  ; and   in like
manner the well-marked          alteration in the aspect of        a nerve   conse
quent on its section and degeneration has been made available by Dr.
Waller for identifying and following its ramifications and finest divi-
    VoL. XI.                                                          C

                                       18
sions when mingled with other nerves distributed to the same organ,
or for tracing its fibres with certainty through           the intricacies     of  a
plexus to which various nerves contribute.              He has    suggested,    too,
the employment of this method to determine the course                    and con
 nexions of particular tracts of nervous fibres in the brain and spinal
 cord.
    Dr. Waller    has himself applied this method with much success in
 unravelling the ultimate distribution of the nerves of the tongue, and
in investigating the constitution of the cervical part of the sympathetic
nerve and its relation to the spinal cord     ;  and his process has also been
successfully employed by others in similar inquiries.
   But   the application   of Dr. Waller's   process is not confined to ana
tomical investigation alone.      He has shown how it may serve also to
elucidate the     functions of nerves.      The disorganization of nerve-
fibres consequent    on their section involves the loss      of their functional
activity  ;  and, accordingly, when a nerve contains fibres derived from
two or more sources and operates          functionally     on several     different
organs,   its function may be analysed,     as   it were, by the separate sec
tion and disorganization of its different tributaries and consequent
elimination of the special function of each from the general effect.              In
this way Dr. Waller has been able to show that the influence of the
pneumogastric nerve over the motion of the heart, and in great part
also its government      of the motions    of the larynx,      depend on fibres
which are contributed to that nerve by the spinal accessory.
   Having once perceived that the changes consequent on the division
of  nerves might afford a valuable means         of  research,   Dr. Waller     was
naturally    led to study with care      the    progress     arid   characteristic
features    of  the  disorganizing process,     and    the  modifications     of it
depending on the nature of the animal subjected to experiment, on
age, external    temperature,  and other circumstances.            In the   course
of  these investigations he found that, when the cut ends            of a  divided
nerve are reunited by the healing process,             the fibres   of the distal
or severed part first suffer atrophy throughout            their whole length,
and are then regenerated,      or at least restored to their original inte
grity.
   Another result of this inquiry was the discovery of an important
relation between the ganglia of the spinal nerves and the nutrition               of
their sentient fibres.     This fact, previously unknown, but now fully

                                           19
 established, may probably help to a further insight into the nature
 and office of nervous ganglia, a question in physiology on which our
 want of real knowledge has given scope to much profitless specu
 lation   ;   its discovery was deemed of sufficient importance by the
 French Academy of           Sciences   to entitle its author to the award       of
 the Monthyon         Prize in Physiology for the year 1856.
     Besides these independent researches,          Dr. Waller,    in association
 with Professor Budge of Bonn, undertook an experimental inquiry
 into the influence of the sympathetic nerve on the motions of the
 iris, which resulted in showing the dependence of certain of these
 motions on a particular part of the spinal cord.           For  these researches
 the authors obtained the Monthyon Prize for 1852.               Lastly, through
 his independent investigations, Dr. Waller had an important share in
 the discovery of the influence of the cervical part of the sympathetic
 nerve on the contractility       of  the blood-vessels    of the  head  ; and he
 first  demonstrated,      by positive experiment, the influence of the cilio-
 spinal region of the spinal cord over these vessels.
     For    these various merits the Council have adjudged to         Dr. Waller
 a  Royal Medal, but especially for having supplied a process of re
 search, which, already successful in the hands of himself and other
inquirers, promises to afford most effectual aid in the future study of
 the Nervous System.
        Dr. Waller,
     In presenting this Medal       to you, I have   to express the hope    of the
 Council that it will operate       as an encouragement      to you to prosecute
 researches      which are considered by your brother physiologists to have
 so high a value.
    The Rumford Medal           has been awarded      to Professor James    Clerk
 Maxwell, for his Researches         on the Composition     of Colours and other
 Optical Papers.
     Professor Maxwell is the author of various remarkable papers on
 subjects of pure mathematics and             physics, which cannot here be
 mentioned, besides his memoirs more immediately devoted to optics.
 In   one    of his earliest papers,   he has connected,    by rigorous calcula
                                                                  c 2

 tion, the mechanical strains to which elastic solids are subjected under
 certain conditions with the coloured curves which those solids ex
 hibit in polarized light.          In  a paper published      in the   *
                                                                          Quarterly
 Journal of Mathematics,' he            has treated in a very general manner
 the passage   of rays of light through optical combinations.
    The research specially mentioned in the award of the Rumford
  Medal, was commenced by him many years ago, and                as early as    1 852
 he had made an instrument for examining the mixture                 of the colours
 of  the spectrum    ; but the first paper which he published on the sub
 ject was read before          the Royal     Society of Edinburgh in 1855.
 Helmholtz had in the meantime published some important investi
 gations   on the composition        of  the colours   of the spectrum     ;  but as
 the main object    of his     research   was merely to make out under what
 circumstances two colours of the spectrum could be combined so as
 to give white light,     his results could not be applied to test quanti
 tatively  a mathematical theory of the composition of colours.
    Such   a theory is virtually contained in the empirical construction
 which Newton long ago gave for determining the effect of combining
 in any proportions the colours of the spectrum.              Newton's construc
 tion appears, however, to have been based on estimation only                 ;   and
 even the mathematical theory involved in          it does not  seem to have been
 clearly pointed out    ;   though it has long been known, or suspected,
 that colour depends         in some way on three elements,           whether the
 triplicity exist objectively in some quality of the light itself, or sub
jectively in our organization.           In the paper already mentioned, Pro
 fessor Maxwell has not only exhibited in its essential             simplicity the
 theory involved in Newton's rule, but has put the theory to the test
 of exact quantitative experiments.           The instrument which       he devised
                                                  '
 for that purpose, and which he calls a colour-top,' enables the ob
 server   to establish    an exact      match between      two different sets of
 coloured papers, the colours of which are mixed by rotation in pro
 portions which can be read off by the graduation.              Such a match can
always be established between any four colours (including white as a
colour), by properly varying their proportions.             If we suppose    (n)  ob
servations   to have been taken with the instrument, establishing each
a  match between two groups made up of three standard colours, and
a fourth colour different for each observation, the results may be re
garded    as expressing    the (n) fourth colours as linear functions         of the

                                            21
  standards.    If,  now,   the theory be true, the new colour-equations
  which we should obtain from the former by mere algebraical elimi
 nation, ought to agree with the results of direct observation on the
  matches   indicated thereby.         Professor Maxwell      has subjected the
 theory to this verification, and thereby raised the composition of
 colours to the rank of      a  branch of mathematical physics.
     Not the  least remarkable part       of  these researches  consists in their
 application to the case of colour-blindness.            All the phenomena of
 colour-matches, as seen by the colour-blind, can be represented quanti
 tatively  as well as qualitatively,     as  Professor Maxwell has shown, by
 supposing that,    as seen   by such persons, all colours may be expressed
 in  a linear manner by means of two chosen at pleasure.            The results,
 as he has pointed out, would seem to indicate that the normal-eyed
 have (as Young supposed) three primary colour-sensations, and the
 colour-blind but two.
    These researches Professor Maxwell has recently completed, by a
                                                  '                             '
 paper published in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions
 for the present year.
    The researches for which        the Rumford      Medal is awarded, lead to
 the remarkable result that, to        a very near degree of approximation,
 all the colours of the spectrum, and therefore all colours in nature
 which are only mixtures of these, can be perfectly imitated by mix
 tures of three actually attainable colours, which are the red, green,
and blue, belonging respectively to three particular              points of the
 spectrum.
       Mr. Professor Maxwell,
    Iu presenting you with this Medal,             I may express   the pleasure
with which the Council, and           I  may add,    I am sure, the Fellows   of
the Society generally, have seen your recent              removal to London     ;

  I. "On     Coal-Gaa."        By the Rev. W. R. Bowditch.               Com
      municated     by Professor William Thomson.              Received   June
      10, 1860.
      A distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society         discovered  coal-gas,
  when Rector      of Crofton, about two miles from my present parish,
  and nearly all our knowledge of this complex substance is derived
  from the labours of chemists who have been, or are, Fellows of the
  Society.     I  feel assured,  therefore, that an attempt to extend       the
  knowledge of the reaction of coal-gas with various substances will be
  favourably received, and that the application to practice of the facts
  made known,       will not render   a memoir less acceptable   to the Society
  which rewarded alike the abstract researches          of Leverrier   and the
  practical ones    of Arnott.
      Six years ago    I introduced the use of clay into gas-works, for the
  purpose of improving the purification of coal-gas, and now, — after so
  long an experience,      the purification of many hundreds of millions of

                                              26
  feet of   gas, and the use       of many thousand tons of the refuse         as ma
 nure, — I venture, for the first time, to submit the grounds upon which
 my process is based.
     Coal-gas may conveniently be considered under the heads of carbon
  compounds required for the production                  of heat   and light,   which
  generate water and carbonic acid by their combustion ; and sulphur
  and nitrogen Compounds which are not necessary for heat and light,
  and ought to be removed from gas on account of the injurious nature
  of the   substances    produced by their combustion.
     The former of        these     classes  will  be treated of incidentally ; the
 latter class    forms the principal subject of this paper. When speaking
 of gas,    I  always refer to that which has undergone the ordinary con
 densation of gas-works, wherefore no mention is made of the complex
 compounds removed by condensation.
     When      coal  is distilled, its nitrogen is evolved        in some forms      of
 combination which are generally familiar, while others are almost
 unsuspected.         Under certain conditions of distillation, much nitrogen
 leaves the retorts and passes the condenser as ammonia or some                      of
 its salts.     These are all removed from gas by clay, so that no trace
 of ammonia       can be discovered after gas has passed through purifiers
 charged with an adequate quantity of clay, and with lime or some
 equivalent substance to remove sulphide of hydrogen.                   Clay is thus
 entitled to be classed with acids and some metallic salts              as a  purifier
 of  gas, for these,       of   course,    remove    ammonia and its salts.       But
 between clay and acids there is an important difference,               in regard   to
 the action which takes place upon the most valuable light-giving con
stituents of the gas          ;  acids   remove    a large quantity   of  these, clay
 does not.       We    have     experimental proof that clay does not remove
the valuable hydrocarbon vapours from gas, in the fact that strong
spirit of wine digested upon foul clay for days, does not thereby be
come     much more luminous               than it was before     being so treated.
The very slight light-giving             power which it has obtained is due to
tar  ; for   if the  spirit be evaporated,       and the tar so obtained be redis-
solved     in fresh spirit, the same kind of flame will be obtained                 as
before   ;   whereas    the addition of       a small portion of coal-oil to spirit
gives a flame       of considerable illuminating power.          To this  I may add,
that long and extensive experience shows that the employment of clay
in the purifying        process    improves the light-giving       power of gas, by

                                               27
removing substances which are not otherwise removed,                      and which,   if
allowed to be burnt with the gas, lessen its illuminating power.                  These
light-damaging         compounds are produced during the later portion of
the distillatory process,          as   I  have proved by experiment.         The  same
retort was charged twice with the same weight of the same coal.
The     gas produced by one charge was purified by lime only, that pro
duced by the other charge was                    purified   by lime and clay.       The
illuminating       power of the gas passing at each half hour's end was
determined, and it was found that the purification made no difference
for the first three or four half-hours.                    About    the  middle of the
charge, that purified by my process had slightly the advantage,                      and
at the close the difference            in favour of that purified by the addition
of clay     has been found as much as ten or twelve                 per cent.   Thus it
is shown        that the compounds removed by clay from gas produced
during the early stages of distillation                 — however objectionable       on
other accounts — do not lessen the light-giving                  power of  gas, whereas
those removed         during the later periods of distillation reduce the light-
giving powers considerably.
    If conjecture      be allowable,        I would venture an opinion that cya
nogen compounds, and other nitrogenized substances with which foul
 clay abounds, are those which lessen light.                    My own investigations
lead directly to this inference,             and,   I think, explain an old Table by
                                                                                    '

    Without assuming the absolute accuracy of                    these figures, we may
 regard them       as   valuable indicators, pointing,         I think, in the direction
 I  have ventured to conjecture.
     A beautiful reaction furnishes experimental proof of the                    damage

                                                 28
done to gas by acids.                 Clean deal sawdust is well moistened                 with
pure sulphuric acid, diluted with five or six volumes of water,                       so    that
the sawdust may not be discoloured, and gas is passed through                              it in
a slow     stream.     With rich         gases, which give the      light of from          20 to
25 sperm        candles    for   a   consumption of five feet an hour, the saw
dust instantly changes               to a most beautiful  pink colour, and the tint
gradually deepens           until the       whole becomes of a dark mahogany.
With poor       gases, which give          the light of from 1 0 to 12 candles, this
coloration is exceedingly faint at first, and deepens very slowly.                          The
differences     of coloration        are so considerable and constant, that           I    have
no doubt      of   the possibility of thus determining the value              of    gas as an
illuminant.    By using a standard acid, the same kind of sawdust,
a   uniform volume of gas, and the same sized U-tubes, notation of time
and depth       of colour would         give a close approximation         to the     illumi
nating value of the gas.               At all    events, the sources   of error       are not
greater than those of photometry in the hands of all but the most ex
perienced,      and the process is quite as close an approximation to truth
as an ultimate analysis           of   gas, containing, as it does, impurities which
render skill and precaution useless.    A comparison of the analysis
of                       '
     coal-gas   given in Bunsen's Gasometry,' with the substances now
known to exist in gas, will convince                   us that at present we cannot
attach any value to such analyses.
     To   determine    the substances          in gas which produce this coloration,
some      of its chief illuminating constituents            were prepared and passed
separately      through the acid sawdust.
     Olcfiant gas made in the usual manner, and carefully purified,
reddens the acid sawdust.               Ether vapour     does not affect     it,   and there
fore need not be removed from the gas for this experiment.
     Propylene, produced by passing the vapour of fusel-oil through                           a
red-hot combustion-tube filled with cast-iron nails, but kept at so
low   a   temperature that        a    small portion of oil passed over without de
composition, reddened the acid sawdust.
   Commercial benzole, with the exception of one specimen, reddened
the acid sawdust.
I     have not yet had leisure to prepare and test acetylene.
     The coloration of fir-wood,                moistened   by hydrochloric acid, has
been mentioned         by   Williams      as    characteristic of pyrrole.
     To show that         the    colour was produced          by   illuminating       matter

abstracted, some sawdust was treated with acid strong enough to char
it slightly*     ;   and gas, which instantly reddened the clean sawdust and
dilute acid, was passed first through the black and then through the
clean acid sawdust.               No colour           was produced               in    the latter, though
the flow of gas continued for an hour.
   Hydrochloric may               be substituted for sulphuric acid, so far as that
gas colours sawdust moistened                     with         it,   but    it   is   liable to   a    consider
able disadvantage.               If   gas contain ammonia, the vapour                             of   the acid
unites with      it   in the tube before the gas comes into contact with the
sawdust, and the result                 is   a   deposit of chloride of ammonium on
the surface of the sawdust where the colour commences,                                             which ren
ders the observation less precise and easy,                                      defiant        gas     likewise
does not redden this acid sawdust,                            and therefore           cannot be estimated
by it.
   Nitrogenized compounds in coal-gas present the greatest difficulty
in the way of efficient               purification, and the almost impossibility                              of
obtaining them in           a    state fit for examination, renders their investiga
tion laborious and unsatisfactory.                             Much nitrogen              is   contained in
gas as cyanogen,           which can be separated from the clay used in purifi
cation.       Probably          not much less exists                   as    sulphocyanogen,             which
can be separated           from the foul clay with                       ease,    and     the presence        of
further       quantities in combination -with sulphuretted                                     hydrocarbons
and tar can be demonstrated.                          The      bodies       formed by this combina
tion of elements are,       I         believe, unknown at present.
   By placing clay in            a    purifier through which crude gas passes from
the condenser         of   a    gas-works, and treating the saturated clay with
spirit,   a   solution     is   obtained,        of   a   brown colour, which has no effect
upon litmus, turmeric or lead-paper, which decolorizes                                         a   solution of
iodine, and from which                   nitrate of silver throws down                            a    white or
brownish white precipitate, and acetate                               of lead     a     white precipitate.
The   aqueous solution possesses the same properties, and, like the so
lution in spirit,      is   always neutral.                   Litmus paper, immersed in either
of the solutions         and exposed             to the         air, becomes quickly, strongly,
and permanently reddened.                        Soluble sulphides have been tested for
repeatedly with nitroprusside of sodium, as well as with acetate of
lead, but have never been found                           ;   yet    a     sulphur       compound exists
in solution which possesses the power of forming               sulphide with             a
     * This acid was of the same strength as that used in some gas-works.

                                           80
 metallic mercury.        The spirit solution, digested        on mercury, with
 occasional   shaking, produces the black sulphide of mercury, while
 the aqueous     solution, similarly     treated, produces the red sulphide.
 Insoluble sulphides.however, exist in the foul clay, and evolve sulphide
 of hydrogen     on the addition      of an acid.   These insoluble sulphides
 are oxidized rapidly by exposure         of the clay   to atmospheric action.
     A solution of clay in spirit     was treated with an excess     of powdered
 acetate   of lead, and the white precipitate        filtered off.     The brown
 filtrate was supersaturated with ammonia and filtered.                  The clear
 brown filtrate, diluted with twelve          times its bulk of water, became
 milky, and with much difficulty was obtained clear by filtration.
 Part of the spirit was then distilled off, to ascertain whether it would
 bring over a volatile sulphur compound, but the spirit was quite free
 from sulphur.       The remaining fluid        was then acidified with        nitric
 acid, which caused brisk effervescence and          a   strong smell of hydro
 cyanic acid.     Nitrate of silver was added       as   long  as it continued to
 produce    a  precipitate  ;  the precipitate, dried and heated,          gave off
 cyanogen,    which burnt with its characteristic flame.            The clear fil
 trate, slowly evaporated      to dryness, left a pale yellow crystalline mass,
 which did not change colour by several days' exposure to light. Part
 of this, burnt in a porcelain crucible, gave off nitrous fumes, and left
 a considerable     residue   blackened by oxide of silver.            Water was
added     to this residue,    and the oxide      of silver filtered   off,  and an
abundant precipitate of sulphate of baryta obtained, with a salt of
baryta.      The remainder of the yellow salt        was redissolved in water,
with    a view to separate    a  granular portion which was mixed with the
more perfectly crystalline salt, but an accident            unfortunately spoilt
the remainder, and rendered any further progress impossible.
     Sulphocyanide     of ammonium may           be  obtained in considerable
quantity from an alcoholic solution of foul clay.             Upon one occasion
I   obtained nearly an ounce, in a fair state       of purity, from       less than
a   quart bottle of foul clay      ; and so tenaciously does clay retain this
compound, that from some clay which had been exposed to the full
action of the weather in       a  field for two years,    I obtained   a  consider
able coloration with      perchloride of iron.       Sulphocyanide of ammo
nium may be obtained from gas which has been purified by oxide of
iron, by passing the gas through spirit of wine and evaporating.
     When common yellow brick-clay is used in the purification of coal

                                        31
gas, the solutions from it always contain salts          of iron, but they       never
become    of  a blood-red colour until a mineral acid is added.                When,
however, the solutions are evaporated,         and the deliquescent residue is
exposed    to the air, most, and sometimes all        of the iron is peroxidized
and yields the well-known reaction.
   The nitrogen in tar may be        shown from the spirit-solution          off foul
clay.    The spirit, evaporated      to dryness     and allowed to stand,          de
posits tar and    a mixture of deliquescent      crystalline salts.      They were
al'owed to deliquesce,      the fluid was removed,         and    the residual tar
well washed with water.         Subsequently it was dissolved in hot spirit,
precipitated by water, and well washed.              When nothing         more was
removed     by washing, the tar was heated,           and   evolved     sulphide of
hydrogen and ammonia.            Contrary to every other compound in gas
with which     I have  experimented,     this tar gave off sulphide of hydro
gen before ammonia.         In other   instances    I have    found the nitrogen
compound evolved at       a  lower temperature      than the sulphur one.
   Mineral matter derived from the clay is found in all solutions            ;  but as
my object in this paper is to speak only of substances in gas,                  I pur
posely omit those united with them derived from the clay.                   For the
same reason    I make  no mention of the value of the foul clay        as a manure.
      Sulphur    compounds     in gas purified so as not to affect basic
                     acetate of lead, and their removal.
   A recent    Royal Commission on lighting picture galleries, has stated
the large quantity of sulphur found in some London gas, and has
intimated    a doubt about the possibility of its removal.             Dr. Letheby
concludes, from seven years' examination of gas in London,                        that
though    quite free from sulphide of hydrogen, it contains, on an
average,    200 grains of sulphur in       1 000  cubic feet    ;  and  Dr. Frank-
land, in the     new  edition   of ' Ure's  Dictionary of Arts,' part iv. pp.
730, 731, writes,     "It   is probable that volatile organic compounds
of sulphur     are produced by the action        of this   element with carbon
and hydrogen simultaneously, although we have              as  yet no positive evi
dence   of their  presence in illuminating gas             When once generated
with   coal-gas, all attempts to remove these constituents have hitherto
proved ineffectual, and there seems little ground for hope that any
practicable process will be devised for their abstraction."                    I  have
now the honour to submit evidence              of  the existence      of  these sul

                                         82
phurized compounds, and also           a practical process for their removal.
My attention    was specially drawn to this           subject by    a  conversation
with the manager       of  a London      gas-works.       He informed        me    that
he not unfrequently filled his gas-holders with gas which would not
affect acetate  of lead, and      that after the gas had been stored             a  few
hours, it became so foul       as   to blacken lead-paper the instant it was
applied.   He sought      an explanation     of this phenomenon         ;  and  as  the
water of his gas-holder tanks was clean, and there were no accidental
sources  of sulphide of hydrogen,          I concluded that an organic com
pound containing sulphur and hydrogen had been broken up, and
that the sulphide of hydrogen was thus produced.                 I  learnt also, by
other observations, that gas which went to the gas-holders free from
ammonia, sometimes        became      ammoniacal      if kept,   and   joining this
fact with the former one, inferred that the compound which thus
broke up contained nitrogen            as   well  as    sulphur    and     hydrogen.
Subsequently     I  observed      that the .saturated      clay taken from the
purifiers of gas-works, contained        a  quantity of foul naphthalin.          This
led me to procure a quantity of (so called) naphthalin which had
been taken from the mains of a London gas-works, and which there
fore must have been deposited            by purified gas.      Some       portions of
this naphthalin were white, but others were slightly darkened                   by the
presence   of carbonaceous      matter, and the whole was in fine powder,
aggregated    together by the process of deposition.             The tendency to
form exceedingly small crystals seems             a   constant characteristic of
naphthalin which has been deposited in gas-pipes,              for by no amount
 of care and trouble have       I  been   able to obtain it in large crystals,
 though the solutions        from which       it  has    crystallized      have    been
 months in evaporating.         With naphthalin from tar,          on the contrary,
 I have  obtained,   from an etherial solution, crystals an eighth of an
 inch thick, nearly half an inch broad, and more than half an inch in
 length.   The   supposed     naphthalin     from gas-pipes dissolves           wholly
 in ether and hot alcohol, and crystallizes from the spirit on cooling
 as pure naphthalin     does.      The solutions     are neutral to test-papers.
 Boiled with an alcoholic solution of potash it evolves no ammonia,
 and with hydrochloric      acid no sulphide of hydrogen.             Heated alone,
 it evolves first ammonia, and then sulphide of ammonium, mixed, I
 think, with a trace of bisulphide of carbon, and then distils. Several
 samples began to give off their ammonia at 388°              Fahr.,   and sulphide

                                               33
    of hydrogen at 422° Fahr., leading to the hope that here
                                                                               was a com
    pound of definite composition which would admit of correct
                                                                                  analysis
    and perhaps of formulation          ;  but some more of the naphthalin, pro
    duced, like the other, from Newcastle coal, but at another
                                                                               gas-works,
   possessed such different physical properties as to convince
                                                                                  me that
   very much more must be known of this substance before any reliable
   analyses     can be published.         The latter    sample gave a neutral solu
   tion in spirit, like the other, but of a
                                                       considerably browner colour.
   When heated alone it gave off ammonia with ebullition at 218° Fahr.,
   and then became tranquil.               When the temperature reached 375°
   Fahr., it     began to evolve sulphide of hydrogen, which continued to
   increase     in quantity up to 390° Fahr., when it nearly ceased, and
   quite ceased at      4 10°  Fahr.    The proportion of tar in this         sample was
   much greater        than    I have   seen it in any        other.    Subsequently      I
   obtained some more            naphthalin which had been deposited in the
  pipes of another London gas-works, and this, like the former, con
  tained both nitrogen and sulphur, which were evolved upon distil
  lation   as   sulphide of hydrogen and ammonia.
      Having thus obtained           one sulphurized        hydrocarbon,     and deter
  mined the temperature at which its sulphur and nitrogen could be
  obtained as easily removeable compounds, I was prepared to advance
  towards     a better   purification of gas with great probability of success.
  Another well-confirmed observation helped to guide me. Gas freed
 from every trace of sulphide of hydrogen always blackens lead-paper
 strongly when passed through clay              ;  and  if it be subsequently passed
 through       lime, it affects    turmeric though quite free from ammonia
 when taken for experiment.               This  process may be repeated         through
 a   series   of  ten or twelve purifiers         containing clay and lime        placed
 alternately, the test-papers being less affected at each purifier, until
 at length they are not discoloured at all. This experiment has been
 made upon gas produced in various parts of England and Scotland
 from many kinds of coal, and               I think   the number     of  instances   suf
ficient to justify the conclusion that all gas,                 as sold,   contains the
compound from which clay liberates sulphide of hydrogen.                         I  have
not yet been          able    to  separate    the    compound      upon which       clay
thus acts.         I  have,    however,    ascertained     that the clay which has
liberated sulphide of hydrogen from gas-which did not affect test-
papers when taken for experiment contains                    tnr, which may be       dis-

solvent.
     Although collateral matter      has been carefully excluded from this
paper,    I  cannot refrain from remarking that the property of clay
here mentioned is in fact the announcement              of  a new property      of
soils, and one which      will help   to account for the formation        of many
natural metallic sulphides.        I  hope soon to have some investigations
of this subject ready for publication.
     To ascertain whether this property of breaking up            a sulphurized
 compound in purified gas and removing tar was possessed by clay
 alone, or shared by other substances used in purification, some puri
 fied gas was passed through          a   considerable chemical excess of all
 the substances     employed in purification, viz. lime, precipitated per
 oxide of iron, sulphate of iron, chloride of calcium, and dilute sul
 phuric acid, all but the lime being mixed with moist sawdust.               Upon
 passing the gas next through a purifier filled with clay, it darkened
 lead-paper, and affected turmeric when it had passed a subsequent
 purifier filled with lime.      This    proves the power   of clay   to break up
 one or more sulphurized compounds which no other substance                   used
  in purification effects  ; and    if this sulphur   were not liberated from
  the impure naphthalin compound already mentioned, it seemed cer
  tain that gas which had been previously purified by clay might be
  much improved,      if not rendered pure, by       a removal    of  the sulphur
  of  the naphthalin.     There is strong experimental evidence that the
  compound from which clay liberates sulphide of hydrogen is not the
  sulphurized naphthalin       one  ;   for  if hydrogen   be passed through a
  vessel containing this substance,        then through clay, and subsequently
  over lead-paper, no trace of sulphide of hydrogen is found, though
   the gas passing smells strongly of impure naphthalin.             This  gas and
  vapour burn with a lightless flame.           Subsequently some naphthalin
   was heated to ebullition,    and a current     of hydrogen    sent through     it
   and   then burnt.     The   flame was lightless      as  before.     I  mention
   this fact to remove the popular error that naphthalin, as it exists in
   coal-gas, is a good illuminant.        Even Dr. Frankland thus regards it       ;
   and both in Clegg's       book on coal-gas, and in the new edition            of
   Ure's Dictionary, states that the hydrocarbons in gas are valuable in
   proportion to the carbon they contain, and that naphthalin is the
   most valuable as containing the largest proportion of carbon.               The

                                           35
  above-mentioned experiments evince the contrary.                On another occa
  sion  I  determined the illuminating power of some gas, and then,
  without alteration of the quantity passing, sent the gas through                  a
  U-tube containing naphthalin from the London gas-mains. The cha
  racter of the flame was changed           from white to red, but the photo
  meter indicated no difference        in the light given.      Two other persons
  conversant with      photometry       were   present  at this experiment and
  agreed   in the result, though up to that time they had held the pre
  vailing opinion    as to the  value of naphthalin in gas without testing
  the statements made upon the subject.
     Another    sulphur compound is said always to be present in coal-
  gas and    to be irremoveable, and which, like those              I  have hitherto
 spoken of, does not affect lead-paper, viz. bisulphide of carbon.                To
 ascertain the presence       of bisulphide      of carbon,   I  pass gas through
 strong spirit of wine (methylated spirit            answers    perfectly) kept at
 about 1 60° Fahr. The gas and vapours              pass out    of the flask which
 contains the spirit up      a  long tube into an inverted flask, so that all
 which    is condensed     may run back into the spirit.             It  then passes
 into another flask for additional condensation, and thence forward to
 a  gas-holder or burner.         Bisulphide     of carbon dissolved in spirit
 becomes precipitated as a white cloud which             settles   to the bottom
 of the   vessel, when the spirit is copiously diluted with water.              The
 white cloudy precipitate escapes slowly by single bubbles through
 the diluted spirit, and at length leaves a solution perfectly clear.
 The spirit through which gas            has passed, and      from which it has
 abstracted bisulphide of carbon,         acts in precisely the same manner
 upon dilution, and no one who has seen the reaction once or twice
can possibly mistake it.        The study of other compounds led me to
conclude that      if this  substance    exist as such, and not merely by its
elements,    in gas, it could be removed          almost  as easily as the    naph
thalin compound could be purified, and that the same process could
be made available to remove          the sulphur     of both.      I  thought that
under certain conditions the affinity of hydrogen for sulphur would
exceed that    of carbon for sulphur,       and therefore that     I  might obtain
the sulphur of bisulphide of carbon           as a sulphide of hydrogen, about
the removal of which there is no difficulty.               Experiment confirms
the reasoning.       When hydrogen mixed with vapour of bisulphide of
carbon is passed        through    a  tube filled with slaked lime or clay
                                                                    d 2

                                        SG
which has been dried at 400° or 500° Fahr., and is kept between
400° and 600°    Fahr. during the passage of the gas and vapour, not
a trace  of bisulphide of carbon passes from the tube, but sulphide of
hydrogen does pass.        The lime is darkened by        a  deposit of carbon,
and a sublimate    of sulphur is found in the exit-tube.        A considerable
excess   of hydrogen should be used, or else a portion of the bisul
phide of carbon vapour is carried over by the current and escapes
decomposition.      That this reaction is not the result of heat merely,
but is a truly chemical one which the base under the influence of
heat effects, and the remarkable fact that slaked lime when heated
forms, but does not unite with, sulphide of hydrogen, receive illus
tration from the following experiments.
    Hydrogen and vapour of sulphide of carbon were passed through             —
 1st, cold slaked lime   ;  2nd, cold clay    ; 3rd, hot oxide of iron used
 at a gas-works     in purification   ;  4th, hot broken bricks      ;  5th, hot
 broken glass, without in any instance producing sulphide of hydrogen.
 On the contrary, when        passed  through     (I)  hot lime and      (2) hot
 clay, sulphide of hydrogen was formed and passed over immediately,
 and continued to pass as long as the current was kept up.             The lime,
 when cooled out of contact with the air, gave no sulphide of hydro
 gen upon being supersaturated with dilute sulphuric              acid, but clay
 when thus treated gave off much.
    The hydrogen     used was in all cases passed through         lime and over
 lead-paper, to secure its being free from sulphide before use.               On
 one occasion, when the clay had been imperfectly dried before heating,
 I observed much sulphurous         acid instead    of sulphide of hydrogen.
 I therefore passed hydrogen,      bisulphide of carbon vapour, and        steam
 over hot clay which had been properly dried.             At first sulphide of
 hydrogen passed over alone, then mixed with sulphurous acid, which
 at length passed alone.       Subsequently sulphide of hydrogen passed,
 and at length sulphurous acid ceased.           As  the one gas increased the
 other diminished, and throughout           the experiment sulphide       of car
 bon vapour passed undecomposed.             It is shown by this experiment
  that hot clay in the presence      of   more water than forms a hydrate
  acts very differently from the same clay when             dry, and the whole
  subject deserves a   full investigation.

  Action     of sulphide of hydrogen                 upon clay and lime, cold and hot.
  Well-washed sulphide of hydrogen passed into cold slaked lime
(obtained from Buxton) in a tube, colours the lime green as soon as
it comes      into contact with           it,   and the progress of the gas along the
tube corresponds            with the coloration.                 Lead-paper            is   not affected
until the lime becomes coloured close up to the exit.
  The same gas,              passed    into      a    tube containing slaked lime kept
about      600° Fahr. at the middle, but cool at both ends, acts differ
ently.       The cool lime at the inlet end becomes coloured the hot                            ;
lime in the middle remains white, and the cool lime at the exit end
becomes       coloured,      and   lead-paper             is   stained     as    soon       as these two
eoolportions are saturated,                while the middle portion remains un
changed in colour.
     The same     gas, passed into         a    tube containing hot lime only, causes
no   discoloration, but instantly blackens                      lead- paper placed at the exit
end    ;   and upon being conducted into                  a    tube of cold lime, colours              it   as
ifit    had just passed from the vessel in which                        it   is   produced.
     The same      gas was passed          into      a    tube containing lime which had
been  thoroughly dried at 600° Fahr., and cooled out of contact with
 the air. No discoloration of the lime took place, but the gas passed
 unaffected       by   the lime, and blackened lead-paper.                            Water added to
 the lime gives        it   the power of decomposing the gas                          as   if   it   had not
 been heated.          The    presence     of more         water than           is   necessary to form
 hydrate of lime (Ca O,            HO),         is   thus shown to be required for the
 decomposition of sulphide of hydrogen                           by   slaked lime.
       Sulphide of hydrogen passed into                    a   tube of cold clay             is   taken up
 in considerable quantity, and the clay becomes black from the forma
 tion of sulphide of iron.          The blackening begins at the inlet end,
 and progresses         with the passage of the gas towards the exit end of
 the tube.
       The   same gas, passed          into clay, heated               to 500° or 600° Fahr.,
 gives      the same reactions        ;   but when the clay has been heated and
 well-dried,      and cooled in the closed tube,                      it   takes      up    a   very small
 quantity of the gas.
       Coal-gas, quite free           from sulphide              of hydrogen, when                    passed
 through       hot lime, blackens lead-paper, showing that masked and
 hitherto irremoveable compounds have been so altered as to be easily
 removeable. The lime does not take up sulphide of hydrogen, but

                                          38
  becomes     gradually, yet very slowly, darkened by the deposition of
  tar and carbon from vapour of bisulphide of carbon.                   The reaction
  with previously dried slaked lime commences                 at   108° Fahr., and
  continues through       the whole range of temperature up to redness.
  At   a  red heat the sulphur of the bisulphuret of carbon and other
  sulphur compounds unites with the lime and forms sulphide of cal
  cium.     Practically very high temperatures are useless,            as the hydro
  carbons of gas begin to be decomposed             about the melting-point        of
  lead, and to deposit their carbon upon the hot lime.                   Fortunately
  injurious temperatures are not required.         I have     frequently freed gas
  from every trace of sulphur, so that upon combustion no sulphurous
 acid was generated, by employing lime so heated as not to deposit
 any carbon, and removing the sulphuretted hydrogen evolved in the
 hot tube by ordinary hydrate of lime.
     The   same gas passed through hot clay gradually darkens the clay
 by forming sulphide of iron, and, when the blackness has reached
 the end of the tube containing the clay, lead-paper is blackened by
 the passing      gas.   The clay    treated  with an acid evolves sulphide of
 hydrogen.      Carbonic acid is evolved in both cases.           It is thus proved
 that bisulphide of carbon, in the presence of hydrogen passing over
 hot hydrate of lime, is decomposed,           and   that its sulphur       becomes
 united to hydrogen.       Coal-gas always contains      a  considerable quantity
 of hydrogen,     so that,  if it contain  vapour of bisulphide of carbon, the
 process    I have the honour to describe       will  effect    its removal.     The
 same process      will break up the impure naphthalin compound and
 convert its sulphur into sulphide of hydrogen ; and the employment
 of clay in the ordinary purifiers, before the gas passes through the
 hot ones, will so arrange the elements of certain other sulphur com
 pounds as to enable the manufacturer to remove their sulphur as
 sulphide of hydrogen.          Sulphocyanide of ammonium is decomposed
by the heated lime, and its sulphur is liberated           as  sulphide of hydro
gen.     The only requisite for complete          success was that no         injury
should be done to the light-giving           materials of gas while removing
the impurities.      I have  passed the principal illuminating          constituents
of   coal-gas   through    the hot lime and clay, and find that they are
not injured.       The temperature which suffices for purification is not
high enough for injury. The photometer shows that coal-gas is not
injured.

                                                 ••59
      The quantity of tar in             gas as supplied to consumers, and the evil
   of its  presence     as a source       of sulphur,    are not considered as,       I  think,
   they deserve to be.            It   is exceedingly rare to find gas free from tar,
   and   I  never    yet met with tar which did not contain both nitrogen
   and sulphur.         Part of this tar is combined with ammonia in                       some
   manner, and may be obtained by passing gas through a bottle con
   taining pebbles moistened with hydrochloric acid.                      Part is united to
   naphthalin,      as  I  have already mentioned            : part is united to benzole
   vapour, and part to other hydrocarbon vapours, such                       as   paraffin,    if
   two instances within           my own knowledge be sufficient to justify                    a
   statement in reference            to gas in general.        In  one instance     I   passed
   gas through        a  metal vessel filled with a number of wire-gauze                    dia
   phragms and kept below 32° Fahr.                       Some cakes of solid paraffin
   were    found floating upon the water which                  had   been placed       in the
   vessel before commencing the experiment, and a mixture                       of tarry oils
   which had deposited          the paraffin.       In another instance,         an old gas
  holder was about to be replaced by a new one, and on the water of
  the tank in which the old gas-holder had worked, there was found up
  wards of a thousand gallons of              a dark-coloured       fluid.     All but two
  carboys was sold to         a   tar distiller.    These two carboys were left ex
  posed to the air without corks for some time, and when the manager
  of the gas-works went             to get me some        of the fluid for examination,
  he found that the whole contents had evaporated.                      I had previously,
  however,     obtained about half an ounce                 of the mixture.         It    con
  tained    paraffin, naphthalin, and the oils which accompany paraffin.
  Nearly     a fifth of its weight of solid pitch was obtained by distilling
  off the hydrocarbons.                A quantity of sulphide of hydrogen                  and
  ammonia were evolved during the distillation, and some of the most
  stinking     compounds        I   ever met     with produced from coal.               From
  these two instances        it is clear that some, or perhaps all, of the volatile
 hydrocarbons in gas possess the power of upholding tar with them
 in their vapours        ; and   it   is proved that this tar is no inconsiderable
 source     of the sulphurous acid produced by the combustion of                       gas as
 at present purified.             I   have obtained tar containing sulphur               from
 every specimen         of commercial        benzole    I  have examined     ;  and as this
 will evaporate at common temperatures without leaving                           a residue,
 we are justified        in the presumption           that tar thus united to benzole
'exists in gas.

  The    best method        of showing the tar in             gas is to pass          it through
or over well-purified coal-oil, and subsequently through a good con
densing arrangement.     1 have known colourless coal-oil become of
a dark mahogany colour, and have separated                         sulphuretted hydrogen,
ammonia, and solid pitch by distillation.

                      Gyroscope."                                    Hill         Curtis, Esq.
     Communicated by Professor Boole.                                        Received        Sept.
     20, I860.
                                         (Abstract.)
   The object of this paper is to deduce on strict mechanical prin
ciples all the known properties of the gyroscope. The only assump
tion made is that the velocity of rotation impressed                              on the instru
ment is very great compared with that which the attached weight
would produce on it          if acting   alone for an instant in a direction per
pendicular to the axis.            The theorems which the author establishes
are the following : —
   Theorem I. — The              curves described by the extremity                     of the axis
of the   gyroscope        are a system  of spherical cycloids generated by the
motion of    a   point on        the spherical radius of a circle, which, con
stantly remaining on the same sphere, rolls without sliding on the
circumference of another fixed circle situated on the same sphere.
These cycloids may be either ordinary, curtate, or prolate — including
the case when the system degenerates into                      a   circle, in which case the
generating point becomes               the centre of the rolling                  circle.    Their
species depends on the direction             of the initial velocity communicated
 to the axis, the direction in which the instrument is set rotating, and
 the position of the attached weight                 ;   when, for instance,            no   initial
 velocity is communicated to the axis, the cycloids will be ordinary
 at first, and would continue so if the gyroscope were a perfect in
 strument for illustrating           the motion of a body round a fixed point                        ;
 but the inertia of the rings on which it is mounted, and of the at
 tached weight,      as   well   as the resistance       of   the air, after a short period
 has elapsed,    has the effect         of imparting          to the       axis   a   certain velo
 city which modifies the curves described by                       it,   and at last causes the*

                                               41
  motion of the axis to become for a time sensibly one of uniform pro
  gression   ;   it then    becomes      oscillatory again, the amplitudes of the
  oscillations being smaller than before.
      Theorem II. — If          the outer    ring   be fixed in any position so as to
  restrict the axis of the gyroscope to            a  fixed plane, the motion of the
  axis, when a weight is attached as above, is the same whether the
  instrument        be set rotating or not.           It  is proved that the angular
  motion of the axis is determined by an equation of the same form as
  that of a circular pendulum, which does not involve the angular
  velocity of rotation impressed on the gyroscope.
      Theorem         III. — If   the gyroscope be set rotating rapidly, and its
  axis of figure be constrained, as in Theorem                 II., to move very freely
  in  a plane     fixed with regard to the horizon, the axis will tend to take
  the position of the projection on the given plane of the line drawn
  through      the centre     of gravity of the gyroscope, parallel            to the axis
  of the earth, in such          a way that the earth and            the gyroscope may
  turn in   the same direction        ;  while,  if the   axis be perfectly free,   it will
  move exactly in the same way             as  the axis of a telescope directed con
  stantly towards the same fixed star, their initial positions being sup
  posed    parallel,    as   established experimentally by            M. Leon Foucault
   (Comptes Rendu, September, 1852).
      To prove this theorem, the angular velocity of the earth round its
   axis is resolved iuto an equal and codirectional motion of rotation
   round the line through the centre of gravity of the gyroscope parallel
   to the earth's axis, and      a  motion of translation, the direction of which
^  is constantly changing, common to all parts of the earth.                      Of these
   motions the latter is communicated to the gyroscope by the friction
   of its  base, and       docs   not modify its position with regard to the
   horizon.       The first    alone    requires to be considered.           In order    to
   estimate its effect,     a rotation equal to it and round the same axis, but
   in an opposite direction, must be supposed                to be communicated both
   to the earth and the gyroscope.                 This   does not affect their relative
   motion, and simplifies the problem, as it enables us to consider the
   earth at rest.        The relative motion of          the gyroscope may therefore
   be found by adding to the three components,                       round its principal
   axis, of its instantaneous angular velocity of rotation,               as  found from
   its equations of absolute motion, the components of this introduced
    velocity of rotation, the moment of resistance                   of the given     plane

                                                -12
 being taken into account in forming the equations                                    of motion, and its
 intensity supposed such as to counteract that part of the total angular
 velocity of the axis which is perpendicular to the given plane.                                      The
 equation which determines the motion of the axis is shown to be
 identical with      that of a circular              pendulum, and                    the motion con
 sequently one of oscillation, the mean position of the axis being that
in which it approaches,           as    close       as   the conditions of the question
permit, to the line drawn through                        its centre of gravity parallel to
 the earth's axis, and in which           it    rotates in a direction similar to that
of the earth's rotation.               Similar reasoning establishes                        the second
part of the theorem, which is theoretically true whether the gyro
scope    be set rotating or not.               This result               is, however,        in practice
modified by the effects of friction             ;    but when a rapid rotatory motion
has been impressed        on the gyroscope, it acquires a stability which
enables it to overcome       to   a great       extent these effects.

   Arbogast's Method of Derivations was devised by him with                                      a   view
to the development of        a    function          <p   (a   + bx       +   car'   + ...), but it   is at
least   as    useful for the formation of only the literal parts of the co
efficients,    or, what is the same thing, the combinations of a given
degree and weight in the letters(a, b, c, d,                         . .     .),    the weights of the
successive letters being     0,    1,2,    3,   &c.           Thus instead of applying the
method to finding the coefficients

we     may apply         it   merely to finding the sets of terms

   Nothing can be more convenient than the                                    process when the entire
series of columns is required ; but it is very                                desirable      to have a pro
cess for the formation of any column apart from the others ; and the
object of the memoir is to investigate a rule for the purpose.     It
is    found that there               is,   in fact,    a   rule analogous           in   some measure      to
Arbogast's, but which                  consists        in operating simultaneously upon cer
tain      pairs   of   letters   :   the pairs which may                    be operated      on are four in
number,       but the conditions                     are such, that, as regards two                of   these
pairs, when the one                  is     operated on, the other                  is   not, and for the
same        term the number of pairs operated                                on   is   therefore three at
most.

           Circular Functions connected with that Method."                                          By the
           Rev. Robert Harley, F.R.A.S., Corresponding Member
           of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.
           Communicated                    by   Arthur Cayley,                    Esq.      Received Oct.
           18, 1860.
                                                     (Abstract.)
       After briefly adverting                  to his own and to             Mr. Cockle's earlier        re
 searches         on the subject, the author proceeds                          in the first section        of
 his paper to give a concise                       systematic exposition of the method of
 symmetric products, and to                      indicate   new application of the method
                                                                  a
 to the solution of the lower equations. Hitherto, in applying the
 theory to the solution of cubics and quartics, an auxiliary equation
 has been introduced, the symmetric product of which equation has
 been made to vauish.                      The peculiarity of the process here employed,
 is    that the auxiliary equation                    is   dispensed        with, and the symmetric
 product          remains finite.
       In the      second      section the author deals with circular                            functions.
 The structure of such functions                        is   considered, and           a   calculus devised
     by   means    of which operations upon them                          may be materially abridged.
 The new cyclical symbol (£')                         is   defined    ;   some     of its applications    are

                                       41
 given, and   its power   as  a working instrument is illustrated         by ex
amples.     By  the help of this symbol, certain expressions which occur
in endeavouring to       extend the theory of symmetric products to
quintics are greatly simplified and presented in an intelligible form,
 and the direct calculation is effected     of  a certain sextic equation on
the solution whereof that of the general            quintic  may be made to
 depend.
    The third and concluding section is chiefly occupied with the cal
 culation of the perfect symmetric product for the quintic.             By  com
bining Eulerian with Lagrangiau functions, and introducing a simple
artifice, the symmetric product for the quintic wanting in its second
term is obtained.     This result   is then made the basis      of a calculation
for the    perfect form.     Employing       the property    of seminvariancy
pointed out by Mr. Cayley, the author succeeds in effecting the cal
culation of the symmetric product for the complete quintic.                 This
product is composed       of three   hundred and twenty-five functions         of
 twenty-four dimensions.
III.   " On the Surface-condensation of Steam."                       By J. P.
       Joule, LL.D., F.R.S. Received Oct. 10, 1860.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In  the author's experiments steam was passed into a tube, to the
outside   of which  a stream    of water was applied, by passing it along
the concentric space between         the   steam-tube   and   a  wider tube in
which the steam-tube       was placed.       The  steam-tube    was connected
at its lower end with a receiver         to hold the condensed        water.   A
mercury gauge indicated the pressure            within the apparatus.        The
principal object of    the author was to ascertain         the conductivity    of
the tube under varied circumstances, by applying the formula sug
gested by Professor Thomson,
                                  C=— log— ,
where a is the area of the tube in square             feet, w the quantity     of
water    in pounds transmitted per hour,         V and    v the   differences of
temperature between       the inside   of  the steam-tube,    and   the refrige.
rating water at its entrauce     and at its exit.    The following     are some
of  the author's most important conclusions.

                                             45
    1. The   pressure   in the vacuous         space is sensibly the same in all
parts.
    2. It is a  matter of indifference in which direction the refrigerating
water flows in reference to the direction of the steam and condensed
water.
    3. The temperature of the vacuous space is sensibly equal in all its
parts.
    4. The resistance to conductivity must be attributed almost entirely
to the film of water in immediate contact with the inside and outside
surfaces   of the  tube, and is little influenced by the          kind of metal   of
which the tube       is composed,      or by its thickness up to the limits of
that of ordinary tubes.
    5.  The conductivity increases up            to a limit as the rapidity  of the
stream of water is augmented.
    6.  By the   use  of  a  spiral of wire to give a rotary motion of the
water in the concentric space, the conductivity is increased                for the
same head      of water.
    The author, in conclusion,         gives an account of experiments with
atmospheric air      as the    refrigerating agent      ; the conductivity is very
 small in this case, and will probably prevent air being employed for
 the condensation     of  steam except in very peculiar circumstances.
 IV. " Notice of Recent Scientific Researches                carried on abroad."
        By the Foreign Secretary.
     During   the last Session    of  the Royal Society the Council passed a
 Resolution,   — That it should          be one     of  the  duties of the Foreign
 Secretary to furnish the Society, from time to time, with early notice
 of researches of special importance carried on abroad ; such notice to
 be drawn up in the form           of  a  short communication to the Society,
 to be read     as  early   as  practicable at an Evening          Meeting of the
                                           '
 Society, and published in the                Proceedings.'    In  the time which
 has since elapsed     I  have been       only partially successful in obtaining
  that cooperation without which it is scarcely possible to comply with
  the instructions   of the Council.

     The regular and frequent appearance of the ' Comptes Rendus,'
  and of the Abbe* Moigno's ' Cosmos,' containing, as they do, the
  earliest notices of important memoirs, and the publication in full of
                               1
 many memoirs in the              Annales de Chimie,' render superfluous any
 mention of the labours of men of science in France.                            So also, very
  striking discoveries,     such for instance           as  the qualitative analysis by
  the lines of the spectrum, and the consequent                         discovery of a new
 element,     due to Professors Bunsen             and     Kirchhoff, published in the
 English Journals almost             as  soon as they are made, may be passed
 over in silence.
     For most of      the following notices          I  am indebted to the kindness         of
 our Foreign Member,         M. Haidinger, of Vienna.                  On receiving a letter
 containing the substance of the Resolution of the Council, he sent a
 printed circular, dated Sept.           1, 1860,       to various active       labourers in
 the field of science, inviting them to send                 a  short account of the re
 searches in which       they themselves           or others had been engaged, to
 the Foreign Secretary         of the Royal Society. This appeal                      was re
 sponded     to  by the arrival of a number of letters containing                     a large
 amount of information which would otherwise have been most dif
 ficult to obtain.

    Major v. Sonklar        is the    author of   a   paper on the diminution          of
temperature at different heights, in different seasons                of the   year, in
the Eastern Alps.
    M. Kreil    has determined the magnetic            constants and geographical

places on the coast of Asia.
    M. Karl Friesach         has continued the publication           of his Magnetic

    M. Simon Spitzer         has written a series       of  papers   on the integra
 tion of linear differential equations.
    MM. Helmholtz          and v. Piotrowski       are the authors        of a memoir
on the friction of incompressible fluids.
    M. Karl Fritsch         has    written several     memoirs on Meteorology.
 One of these is on the disturbances of the daily range of the most
important meteorological elements              on days in which thunder-storms
 occur.     The daily    range    of atmospheric pressure, temperature,            press
ure of vapour contained in the atmosphere,                  from hour to hour, in
 different months, are known already for various stations.                       These,
however, hold only for          a mean   condition of the atmosphere.           In  days
 on which thunder-storms occur, the range                 of  each   of the   meteoro
 logical elements      exhibits     a  peculiar character impressed          upon it in
 the course    of   the   preceding night and morning;             and, as thunder
 storms usually occur in the afternoon and evening, the approach of
 a thunder-storm,       or of the gale of wind by which              it  is not unfre-
 quently accompanied,          may     in most    cases    be predicted.       Another
 gives an account of the phaenological                 observations     made     in   the
 Austrian Empire        in the course of the year           1858.     This contains      a
 comparison of the times of blossoming of seventy-three species of
 plants, at fifty-nine      different stations, with the times of blossoming
 of the   same plants at Vienna.             On an average of the whole year,
 vegetation    is earliest     at Villa Carlotta on the lake of Como, 1 20
 toises  above the level        of the   sea, being fourteen days in advance            of
 Vienna   ;  and   latest   at  Gurgl in     the Oetzthal, 9GG      toises   above the

     The supplement to the eleventh volume of the ' Jahrbiicher der
 k. k. Central-Anstalt fur Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus,' con
 tains a comparison by M. Fritsch of those epochs in the life of
 plants and animals in different localities in               the Austrian       empire,
 which      admit   of being accurately determined for the year 1857.
 These observations include a record of definite phases of vegetable
 and    animal life under the most various local circumstances,                 and ex
 tend as far as possible over the whole flora and fauna.                   They have
 been now continued for eight years.              It is proposed to continue them
 till they    embrace   a period     of ten years, when        M. Fritsch     hopes to
 deduce from them many important results, a task which                 will probably
 occupy him for several years.             A memoir      on   the law of the influ

     Professor Zantedesehi      is the author       of nine    papers  on Acoustics,

 1.   On the     doctrine of the third sound, or on the coincidence of
 sonorous vibrations, with       a  remark on the analogy presented by the
 vibrations which constitute the light of the solar spectrum.                       The
 experiments of the author show that the number of vibrations in
 a given time, of the third sound, is always the difference of the
 numbers of vibrations of the two given sounds, and is not always the
 greatest    common measure         of the two       given   sounds,   as    has   been
 asserted by some writers.         2. On the correspondence         which sonorous
bodies manifest in the resonance           of many sounds in one.          3. On the
unit of measure of musical sounds, on their limits, on the duration of
the impression of the vibrations on the acoustic nerve of man, and on
the increase of pitch of the fundamental note in tuning-forks of steel
due to a spontaneous          molecular change.          The principal object of
the author is the determination of            a fixed    note, to which, as to an
invariable unit of measure, the notes of different instruments may be
referred.      The number of vibrations per          second which produces the
note   C   is from 272 to 276       at St. Petersburg;        271  in Naples;      268

                                      49
in Milan, 266 in Venice,      268 in Vienna.        According to M. Lissajous,
in Paris, in 1856, the number of vibrations of the            note  A was 898     ;
while according to Sauveur in 1715 it was 810.             This elevation is by
some supposed      to be due to improvements made in the construction
of musical instruments.         Professor Zantedeschi attributes it to a
molecular change which is gradually developed in the steel of which
tuning-forks are made.       In order     to eliminate this source   of error, he
proposes to substitute for the tuning-fork           a pipe such as is used at
the present    time by tuners of instruments in the South of Italy.
He  compared     a number   of tuning-forks       and pitch-pipes   known to be
more than fifty years old, and found that the former had become
higher, though unequally, when compared with the latter.              In order  to
secure the  fixity of a note,   he considers that it ought to be compared
with  the syren of Cagnard       de la  Tour, or with     the  toothed wheel of
Savart.    By   these means, especially when combined with              improve
ments suggested by      M. Zantedeschi, the stability of the note, or the
amount of its error, may at any time be ascertained.              In France the
A  has been lowered from 898 to 870 vibrations.             4. On the limits of
the sounds produced by free reeds, and on their harmonics, considered
in relation to the law    of Bernoulli.        5.  On the fundamental law of
the harmonics of     a musical string, on the vibratory motion from which
they are derived, and on the interpolation of harmonics between the
notes of instruments sounded        by means of n bow and those of the
human voice.       6. On the separation       of  waves corresponding to har
monics, and on the coexistence of several vibratory waves in the same
aerial column.      7. On the lengths       of  the aerial waves, and on their
velocity in pipes, and on the influence which            various circumstances
exert on the sound produced.           8.   An experimental examination of
the method commonly followed in the determination of the nodes and
ventral segments of columns of air vibrating in tubes.                9. On the
fundamental laws of vibrating rods, and of the oscillation of air in
tubes.
   Professor Zantedeschi is in possession of a series of meteorological
observations embracing a very long period, by means of which he
hopes to be able to establish the constants of the climate of Italy.

    Professor Lorenz, of Fiume, the author of various Essays on Geo
logy, Physical Geography, and Natural History of various districts in
the Salzkammer Gut and on the Croatian coast            of the Adriatic, which
 date back   too far to fall within the scope      of  the present   notice,  has
 recently published the      following    memoirs    : — Geological Survey of
 the  Liburnian Karst and the adjacent Quarnero islands, giving a
 sketch of these Adriatic coast declivities and islands, the geological
constitution of which had never before been examined with accuracy
(Jahrbuch     der  k. k. geologischen Reichs-Anstalt,         Band    X.).    An
 inquiry into the sources of the springs of the Liburnian Karst and
 adjacent Quarnero islands, some of which are remarkable for their
excessively low and constant temperature (Mittheilungen           der  k.k.  geo-
graphischen Gesellschaft in Wien, B.        III.).   On the forest-trees of the
Liburnian Karst     range.    A Report     on the question whether trees and
other growths could be produced on the declivities             of the Croatian
Adriatic  coast, being the result     of physical   and botanical researches
continued for two years, accompanied by a vegeto-geographical map
of that country. This Report is now going through the press, and

    During the last five years Professor Lorenz has been             engaged in
researches on the Liburnian (Croato- Adriatic) coasts, and           also in the
hitherto   unexplored waters of the Quarnero (or Gulf of Fiume), his
object being to inquire into the distribution of submarine algie and
animals, on the same principles that had guided the founders of this
still youthful department of science, such as CErsted in the Baltic,
Forbes in the jEgean and British seas, Sars, Arbjornsen, Loven in
the Scandinavian sea.        Professor Lorenz considers that he has made
improvements in the method of carrying on researches of this kind.

depths, &c., were methodically observed                during four years.       Algae
and animals      of   every    kind  were   arranged according to their vertical
and horizontal distribution, and their natural groups and paragenesis
were deduced       from the above-mentioned physico-marine observations.
A bathygraphical        map, and numerous tables          and figures, accompany
the work, which in       a few weeks      will be ready for the press   .   A memoir

for the Royal Society any information that may be desired respecting
the natural history of the Adriatic coast, adjacent to Fiume, a service

           By the Foreign Secretary.
     On the 29th of last November, an extract was read before the Berlin
Academy from a memoir on the magnetization of iron and steel,
by Professor Wiedemann.              In following up his investigations on the
relation between           the magnetic and mechanical properties of iron and
steel, published in the ' Verhandlungen der Baseler Naturforschenden
Gesellschaft,'        Band      II.,    Professor Wiedemann has obtained the fol
lowing results : —
      1.   If an   iron wire be twisted during or even after the passage of a
voltaic current through                it,   the wire becomes magnetic.
     When the wire         is   twisted in the manner of               a   right-handed        screw,
the point at which the current enters becomes                              a    south pole, in the
opposite case        it   becomes      a   north pole.        If, during the         passage   of   the
current, the wire be twisted in different directions, the polarity changes
with the direction of the twist.                  If   it   be twisted     in   different directions
after the interruption of the current, the magnetism                              produced     by   the
first twisting diminishes rapidly.
     2.    If   a voltaic current be transmitted                  through        a   magnet in the
direction of its axis, the magnet will twist.
     The experiments were made with wires of iron and steel, of from                             1   to
2    millimetres in diameter, surrounded                    bya   voltaic helix, and stretched

                                        54
  by weights attached to their lower ends.         The torsion  was measured
  by observing the image of      a scale   reflected in a mirror fastened    to
  the lower end of the wire.
     When the south pole of the magnetized wire was uppermost, and
  the current descends, the lower end of the wire, as seen from above,
  twists in the direction of the motion of the hands of          a watch.    A
  change in the direction    of either the transmitted or the magnetizing
  current changes the direction of the torsion.
     As long    as the magnetizing current remains constant,       the torsion
 increases with the intensity    of the transmitted current till it   reaches
  a maximum.
     When the intensity of the magnetizing current increases, the trans
  mitted current remaining unchanged, the torsion diminishes.
     The torsion of the wire is nearly independent of the weight by
 which it is stretched, as long as the intensities of the magnetizing
 and the transmitted current remain invariable.
     3. The   same torsion is produced when a voltaic current is trans
 mitted through iron wires which have been for some time suspended
 vertically, and thus magnetized       by the magnetism      of the earth, or
 which have acquired permanent magnetism in any other manner.
    4.  A voltaic current being transmitted through         an iron wire sus
 pended in the axis    of a spiral, if a weak current be afterwards trans
 mitted through the helix, the wire will twist in the same direction        as
if  the current had been transmitted first through the spiral and after
wards through the wire.        The torsion    increases with the intensity  of
 the magnetizing current till it attains       a  maximum.     On increasing
 further the intensity of the magnetizing current, the torsion diminishes.
    5.  If an iron wire be suspended      in the axis of a helix, and tem
porarily magnetized, the intensity of the temporary magnetism will
be weakened      on transmitting a voltaic current through the wire.
    On interrupting the current through the wire, the temporary mag
netism    of the wire will   be increased.      If the circuit be completed
repeatedly, whatever be the direction in which the current is trans
mitted through       the wire, the temporary magnetism will diminish,
and on interrupting     the current will resume its original intensity.
    6.  If a voltaic current be transmitted through the iron wire after
the magnetizing current has been interrupted, its permanent mag
netism will be weakened.

                                         .05
   Ou interrupting the current the permanent magnetism will increase
a little, but will not regain its original intensity.          Repeated trans
mission of     a current through the wire produces only a feeble dimi
nution of its permanent magnetism.              If  a  current be transmitted
through the wire in an opposite direction, the magnetism             will again
be greatly enfeebled.
    7. When a large        portion of the permanent magnetism has been
destroyed by repeated inversion of the current transmitted through
the wire, and     a current is made to pass through it first in one direction
and then in the contrary direction, the magnetization in one case is
found to     be  much stronger than in the other.           At the same time a
very gradual diminution of magnetism is continually observable.
   In   the opinion    of Professor Wiedemann,      these phenomena may be
explained by the self-same hypotheses which he used to illustrate his
former observations        on the relation between     torsion and magnetism.
These are     :—
    1.  The hypothesis of molecular magnets, which take a direction
under the influence of a voltaic current and are thereby caused to
rotate round their centres of gravity, and also to glide past one another,
as  in the   case  of torsion.
    2.  The hypothesis, that the molecular magnets, after their move
ments of translation and rotation, do not return quite to their original
unmagnetic positions of equilibrium, even after the disturbing forces
have ceased to act, so that bodies composed        of these molecular   magnets
retain a permanent magnetism, and in certain cases, a permanent
 change    of form,   viz. torsion.

to commence       the present investigation by a series                    of    analyses    of our
material,     in order to ascertain which variety of narcotine we were
dealing with.
     The narcotine employed              was obtained from          Mr. Morson,           to whom
we are greatly indebted for the scrupulous care bestowed on its pre
paration and purification.               He     stated that   it   was extracted from the
residues which had accumulated during the preparation                                  of very large
quantities of morphine and codeine, from opium of various qualities
and from various sources.                If, therefore, distinct varieties of narcotine
exist, there was reason to expect                 that our narcotine would prove to
be a mixture      of   several    of them.           The results of all our               analyses,
however,      agree    with    the       formula     Cas   H" NO7,         as shown by          the

     We    may here remark that the               recorded    analyses          of narcotine and
its salts, with the exception of one by Dr. Hofmann,                                  published by
Blyth,     agree at least as well with the former as with the latter                            for
mula   ; moreover,      during the course of experiments made with several
pounds of narcotine, we have observed                      nothing, either in the be
haviour of this base itself, or in the nature or proportions of its pro-

ducts of decomposition, to indicate that it was variable in composition.
Further     data   are, however, needed       for the final decision of this
question, and we shall accordingly feel very much indebted to any
chemist who has a specimen of narcotine of well-ascertained origin,
or which he believes to have        a different composition from that given
above,   if he  will kindly    spare us a sufficient quantity for analysis.
                          II. Composition   of Cotarnine.
    The combustion of cotarnine with oxide of copper and oxygen, as
well as the determination of the proportion of platinum in its chloro-
platinate, leads us to adopt the formula C,a             H" NO3    for this base.
The formula usually adopted contains one more atom of carbon ; but,
independently of our analytical results, the supposition that cotarnine
contains only twelve atoms of carbon is supported by the simple
manner in which the action of oxidizing substances on narcotine can
then be expressed,         namely, by the equation
               C" H" NO7 +0 =          C,0 H'°  O* +  Cu  H" NO3,
                  Narcotine.          Opianic acid.     Cotarnine.
and, as will be shown hereafter, by the manner in which cotarnine is
 decomposed      by dilute nitric acid.
                     III.   Decompositions   of Opianic Acid.
    Opianic    acid is readily      decomposed      when     heated with strong
 hydriodic acid    ;  no iodine is set free, but iodide    of methyl is formed
 in considerable quantity at the same time          as a non- volatile substance,
 very easily altered by heat and exposure to air, especially          if in contact
 with alkali, the precise nature of which we have not yet been able to
 ascertain.
     When opianic acid is heated with an excess of a very strong solu
 tion of potash, it splits up into meconin and hemipiuic acid. These
 substances    were found by experiment to be formed in proportions
 corresponding to the equation
                 2C,0H,0O'        = C,0H»oO4        +    C,0H")O',
                 Opianic acid.        Meconin.         Hemipinic acid.
     The meconin thus produced         has all the characters which have been
 ascribed by previous observers to meconin obtained by other processes             ;
 its identity was further established by analysis, and by the preparation
  of chloro- and nitro-meconin,         the former     of which    was analysed.

                                           58
The hemipinic    acid was also found to be identical with that obtained
directly from narcotine     : the acid and its silver-salt were analysed.
   Having thus found        a method by which            meconin and hemipinic
acid can be produced with certainty and in large quantities, we intend
to make an extended investigation of them and of opianic acid, in the
hope of discovering the nature of the relationship of these three bodies
to each other and to narcotine.           The principal results which        we have
hitherto obtained in this direction are as follows.
   Action  of Hydriodie Acid       on Meconin.        — Meconin     is decomposed
by hydriodie acid like opianic acid, giving iodide of methyl and an
easily alterable substance,     the nature of which has not been deter
mined.
   Action of Hydriodie Acid           on Hemipinic       Acid. — Hemipinic acid,
heated with concentrated hydiodic acid to within a few degrees                 of the"
boiling-point   of the latter     substance,       is decomposed into iodide       of
methyl, carbonic acid, and an acid of the formula C7 H6 O4.                   It  was
found by direct experiment that two atoms of iodide of methyl are
formed from each atom of hemipinic                  acid, so that the following
equation probably represents       the reaction : — ,
              C,0 H,0 0° + 2 HI = 2 CH5          1 + COa + C7 H6 Ol
            Hemipinic acid.                                  New acid.
   The   new acid is moderately soluble in cold water, and very soluble
in boiling water, alcohol, and ether         ;  its solution has    a strongly acid
reaction with test-paper.      It separates from hot water in small needle-
shaped crystals containing        14-80 per cent. water of crystallization,
which they lose at 100° (the formula C7 H' 0'+ 1|Ha O corresponds
to 14-92 per cent. water) ; at a higher temperature the acid melts
and sublimes without apparent alteration.
   Dried at 100°, it gave the following results on analysis              : —

                                     V. Conclusion.
    In the absence of more definite knowledge of the constitution of me-
conin     and opianic and hemipinic               acids,  it is obviously       useless    to
try to assign        a rational formula          to  narcotine.     According       to   the
formulae which we have adopted for narcotine and cotarnine, nar
cotine contains the elements of cotarnine and meconin                     : —
                    Caa  H" NOT=C»a         H,3 N03 + C,0 H,0       0\
                      Narcotine.          Cotarnine.         Meconin.
    It will  be seen that these         formulae      are the same as those          of the
methyl-narcotine         and methyl-cotarnine            of Hinterberger        and  Wer-
theim.      The ground upon which Wertheim admitted the existence of
ethyl- and propyl-narcotine            was the formation         of volatile   bases con
taining     Ca H7   N  and    C3   H" N by      the   distillation   of narcotine with
potash.       An experiment which                we   have    made    goes     some    way
towards explaining the formation of these bases without assuming the
existence    of more than       one variety     of narcotine. Having        so frequently
observed     the formation of methyl-compounds                   from the derivatives
of narcotine,      we tried the       direct action of hydriodic            acid on this
base, expecting to obtain iodide             of methyl.        By distilling     20 grms.
of narcotine with          concentrated hydriodic            acid, 19 grms. of pure
iodide of methyl were obtained, a quantity which corresponds, as
nearly    as  could     be  expected,     with three atoms         of iodide of methyl
for one atom of narcotine*,
            (CMHJ3N07          :  3CH3I     : :  413   : 436 or 20    : 211).
    Narcotine therefore contains three atoms of methyl                  so   combined as
to be easily separable         f;   and it is very probable that when it is di
stilled with     potash, according to the conditions of the experiment,
sometimes      nearly pure ammonia is evolved, while, at other times,
methylamine, CH8 N, dimethylamine, CJ H7 N, or trimethylamine,
C3 H9   N, predominates.
   We wish not         to close without         acknowledging       our obligation to
Dr. M. Holzmann for              very valuable assistance rendered to us at the
commencement of our investigation.
   * It is possible that narcotine   will prove to be an economical,     as  it is certainly
the most convenient,     source of iodide of methyl.
   f  Gerhardt (Traite, iv. 64) had previously observed the production of a volatile
substance,   which he supposed to be nitrate of ethyl or of methyl, by the action of
nitric acid on narcotine.

III. "    Researches      on    the Arsenic-Bases."           By A. W. Hof-
        mann,    LL.D., F.R.S.         Received November 24, 1860.
    In  a previous note *    I  have shown the existenee      of  a group   of dia
tomic bases, containing phosphorus and arsenic, which are formed by
the action of monarsines       on the bromethylated bromide, so frequently
mentioned in my researches            on the phosphorus-bases.          The idea
naturally    suggested     itself  to examine    the deportment of this salt
under the influence of monostibines, with the view of producing the
phospho-stibonium- compounds.             The two bodies react upon        one an
other, but only after protracted digestion or exposure to rather high
temperatures.       The product of the reaction is complex, yielding a
comparatively small quantity of a difficultly soluble platinum-salt of
diatomic appearance.          I have  repeatedly modified the circumstances
and analysed the products in the form of platinum-salts              ;  I omit to
quote the detail of      these experiments, since they have failed to dis
entangle the difficulties of the reaction.
    Some experiments upon the deportment              of dibromide of ethylene
with triethylarsine were       more successful. The reaction between these
two    bodies   had been selected      as  a subject   of inquiry by Mr. W.
Valentin,     to whom     I  am indebted      for valuable assistance       at   the
earlier stage of these researches.         Circumstances have subsequently
prevented      Mr. Valentin from carrying out his plan, and I                  have
therefore to take upon myself the responsibility              for the following
statements.
         Action    of Dibromide of Ethylene       upon   Triethylarsine.
                            Monarsonium Series.
    The  experience gathered during the examination          of the phosphorus-
bodies, enabled     me to establish the nature      of this reaction by    a   com
paratively small number of platinum-determinations.
    Bromide     of Bromethyl-triethylarsonium.      — To    avoid   as far as pos
sible the formation     of the   second product, a mixture      of triethylarsine
with a very large excess of dibromide of ethylene was digested in
sealed tubes at a temperature not exceeding 50° C.             Notwithstanding
the low temperature, the tubes invariably contained compressed gases                ;
the product of the reaction was treated with water, which extracted

a  soluble bromide from the ethylene-compound unacted upon. On eva
poration, a beautiful bromide was left, which being copiously soluble
in boiling, and sparingly soluble in cold alcohol, could be readily re-
crystallized from absolute, and even from common alcohol.                 In water
this substance      is excessively    soluble, and therefore scarcely crystal-
lizable from an aqueous solution.
     Analysis,   as  might have been expected, proved this salt to be the
analogue of the bromethylated triethylphosphonium-salt.                 It contains
                Ca H„ As Bra= [(C, H4 Br) (C, H5)3 As] Br*.
     The bromide of bromethyl-triethylarsonium,               the composition of
which is sufficiently established by the analysis of the corresponding
platinum-salt,      can be obtained in beautiful crystals.        Their form    was
determined by Quintino Sella           ;  it corresponds exactly with that of
the corresponding phosphorus-compound.
     Platinum-salt. — The solution of the previous salt, converted by
 treatment with chloride of silver into the corresponding chloride,
yields with dichloride of platinum, splendid needles of a double salt,
 difficultly soluble in cold and even in boiling water, which contain
         C8H„BrAs Pt Cl3=[(CaH4 Br) (CaII5)3As] CI, PtCT,.
                     Compounds     of Vinyl-triethylarsonium.
     The bromide of-bromethyl-triethylarsonium,            like the corresponding
 phosphorus-compound,          loses its latent bromine under the influence
 of oxide of silver.       If the solution     of  the bromide be precipitated
 by an excess of nitrate of silver, one half of the bromine separates as
 bromide of silver ; the clear filtrate mixed with ammonia yields the
  second    half of the bromine in          the  form of a dense precipitate.
  Nevertheless the reaction differs from that observed                in the phos
  phorus-series.      The bromide of the bromethylated phosphonium, as
  has been    pointed out in a former part of the researches on the phos
   phorus-bases, is almost invariably converted into an oxethylated body,
  its transformation into a vinyl-compound being altogether exceptional.
  The bromide of      the bromethylated arsonium, on the other hand, yields
  as a rule the vinyl-body      of the series, the formation     of an oxethylated
  compound taking place only under particular              circumstances, in fact
  so rarely as to leave some doubt regarding the existence             of this term
  of the   series.

    oxide of silver, yields     a powerfully alkaline solution, the nature of
    which was determined by the analysis of the corresponding platinum-
    salt.   Transformed into the chloride and precipitated with dichloride
    of platinum, this solution yielded beautiful rather soluble octahedra
    which were found to contain
               C8HiaAsPtClJ=[(CaHs)           (CaH5),   Aj] CI, PtCl,.
       The analysis of this   salt shows that the transformation    of the brom-
    ethylated compound ensues according to the following equation,

                                   *| }

       The   idea suggested   itself that the vinyl-compound obtained in this
   reaction might be a secondary product resulting from the decom
   position of an oxethylated compound of limited stability formed in
    the first instance,

        It was with the view    of avoiding this decomposition that in     one of
    the   operations the digestion was accomplished at the common tem
    perature   ;  the result, however, showed that even in this case the
    vinyl-compound was obtained.
       Nevertheless the oxethylated body appears           to exist : under cir
    cumstances     which were not sufficiently well observed at the time, the
    action of oxide of silver upon bromide of bromethylated triethyl-
   arsonium yielded an octahedral platinum-salt,         which on analysis fur
   nished exactly the platinum-percentage of the oxethylated compound.

       The bromide or chloride of the bromethylated arsonium- compound
   is but slowly acted upon by triethylarsine at 100° C. Two days'
   digestion at that temperature had produced but          a slight impression  ;
   at 150° the reaction is accomplished in two hours.           The phenomena
   now to be recorded presented        themselves  in the succession repeatedly
   observed     in the diphospbonium-series.      The dibromide

  Treated with acids, this alkali                  produces a series of fine               salts,

beauty the corresponding diphosphonium-compound.

   I have   also made a few experiments on the action             of dibromide of
ethylene upon triethylstibine.          The reaction is slow, and requires
long-continued digestion at      temperatures higher than that of boiling
water.     The  tubes invariably contained much gas           ;  and the product
of  the reaction proved to be a complex mixture          of several compounds,
many of them        secondary,  which in no way invited me to a more
minute examination of this process.            I  omit to quote the few pla
tinum- and chlorine-determinations which were made, since they do
uot admit of    a simple interpretation.

   The preparation of the ethyl-bases by the action of ammonia upon
iodide of ethyl, presents a difficulty which greatly interferes with
the general application of this otherwise so convenient method. This
difficulty consists in the simultaneous formation of all the four ethyl-
bases.    The   equations
                         H3N + C,H5I=[[(C,H,) H3N]I*

are an ideal representation    of   the four different phases through which
ammonia passes during its transformation into iodide of tetrethyl-
ammonium.         In practice it is found impossible to carry out this
transformation in the several         steps  indicated by these         equations.
The first substitution-product, generated as it is in the presence of
the agent of substitution, is immediately acted upon again, the second

product being formed, which in its turn may be converted                   into the
third and even into the fourth compound.               The following equations
represent     perhaps    more correctly       the   final result of the several
changes which        are  accomplished in the reaction of ammonia                  on
iodide   of ethyl.

    The mixture of iodides, when submitted to the action of                 potassa,
 yields ammonia, ethylamine, diethylamine,               and   triethylamine,    the
 hydrate     of tetrethylammonium,          which   is liberated, splitting     into
 ethylene,    triethylamine, and water.          The separation of the three
 ethyl-ammonias presents       unusual difficulties. The differences between
 their boiling-points being rather considerable,

  it was thought that they might be readily separated by distillation.
  Experiments made with very large quantities showed, however, that
  even after ten fractional       distillations  the bases were far from being
  pure.
      After many unsuccessful attempts,           I   have   found a simple and
  elegant   process   by which the three ethyl-bases may be easily and
  perfectly separated.       This    process   consists in submitting       the an
  hydrous mixture of the three bases to the action of anhydrous oxalate
  of ethyl.    By this treatment, ethylamine is converted into diethyl-
  oxamide,    a   beautifully  crystalline     body very difficultly      soluble in
   water, diethylamine into ethyl-oxamate          of ethyl,   a liquid boiling at a
   very high temperature, whilst triethylamine           is not affected by oxalic
   ether
      By the action of oxalic ether upon ethylamine, two            substances  may
   be formed, viz. ethyl-oxamate        of ethyl  and diethyl-oxamide.

   In practice it    appears   that the second of these compounds only is
produced.
   In    the action   of  oxalate  of ethyl upon diethylamine, two similar
phases may be distinguished capable           of producing respectively
   In practice the first of     these two compounds only is generated.

under the circumstances under which             I  have worked, the two sub
stances do not combine.
   The product of the reaction of         oxalate  of ethyl upon the mixture
of  the ethyl-bases,     when distilled in the water-bath, yields triethyl
amine   free from ethylamine and diethylamine.
   The residue in the retort solidifies on cooling into         a  fibrous mass
of crystals of diethyloxamide, which         are soaked with an oily       liquid.
They are drained from the oil and recrystallized from boiling water.
Distilled   with potassa, these crystals furnish         ethylamine free from
diethylamine and triethylamine.
   The oily liquid is cooled      to 0°, when a few more       of   the  crystals
are deposited    ; it is then submitted to distillation.     The boiling-point
rapidly rises to 260°.         What distils     at that temperature is pure
diethyl-oxamate of ethyl, from which, by distillation             with potassa,
diethylamine free from          ethylamine     and    triethylamine     may be
obtained.

                                             (Abstract.)
     It   is easy to      see   that for an equation of the order n, the product
of    the differences           of all but    one   of the      roots         will     be determined by
an equation          of   the order n, the coefficients                   of which        are alternately
rational functions              of the     coefficients     of the original equation, and
rational functions multiplied by the square root of the discriminant.
In    fact,   if
            the equation be <{,v=(a, . . .^v, l)"=a(»— a)(v— /3). . .,
then putting for the moment a= 1, and disregarding numerical factors,
V <U+25A1> , the           square root      of   the discriminant, is equal to the product                             of
the differences           of    the roots, and         f'a is   equal             to   (a— /3)(a— y).       .   .,
consequently the product                   of the      differences            of   the roots, all but n,
is equal to         V <U+25A1> -Hp'",       and the expression           -J-         is   the root   of    an equa-
                                                                 <p   a

of the coefficients of the original                        equation.               I     propose      in    the
present       memoir to determine the equation in question for equations
of    the orders three,           four, and five    :     the process employed                   is   similar
to    that in my memoir                   "On    the     Equation             of Differences for            an

             Stereotrope.'
                                  " By William Thomas Shaw, Esq.                                            Com
         municated           by   Warren De la Rue, Esq. Received                                               Dec.
         6,   1860.
     This instrument            is   an application                 of the principle of the                 stereo
scope to that class of instruments                                variously       termed       thaumatropes,
phantascopes, phenakistoscopes, &c, which depend for their results
on " persistence of vision." In these instruments, as well known,                              is
an object represented                on   a      revolving disc, in the successive positions
it   assumes       in performing             a        given      evolution,   is    seen to execute              the
movement           so delineated      ;   in the stereotrope the effect of solidity                                is
superadded, so that the object                          is    perceived      as   if   in motion and with

                                            71
an appearance     of relief  as  in nature.       The following is the manner in
which I adapt to this purpose the refracting form of the stereoscope.
    Having procured eight stereoscopic pictures of an object— of a
steam-engine     for example    —in      the successive positions it assumes in
completing a revolution,       I   affix them, in the order in which they were
taken,    to an octagonal drum, which             revolves   on a horizontal     axis
beneath an ordinary         lenticular      stereoscope    and  brings them one
after another into view.         Immediately       beneath   the lenses, and with
its axis situated half an inch from the plane of sight, is fixed a solid
cylinder, 4 inches in diameter, capable            of being   moved    freely on its
axis.     This cylinder, which is called the eye-cylinder, is                pierced
throughout its entire length         (if  we except a diaphragm in the centre
inserted for obvious reasons) by two apertures, of such a shape, and
so situated relatively to each other, that a transverse section of the
cylinder shows them       as   cones, with their apices pointing in opposite
 directions, and with their axes parallel to, and distant half an inch
from, the diameter of the cylinder.             Attached to the axis of the eye-
cylinder is a pulley, exactly one-fourth             the size  of a  similar pulley
 affixed to the axis of the picture-drum, with which it is connected
 by means of an endless         band.       The eye-cylinder thus making four
 revolutions to one of the picture-drum,            it is evident that the axes of
 its apertures will respectively coincide with the plane of sight four
 times in one      complete       revolution     of the instrument,       and   that,
 consequently, vision will be permitted eight times, or once for each
 picture.
     The cylinder is so placed that at the time of vision the large ends
 of the apertures     are next the eyes, the effect         of which is that when
 the small ends pass the eyes, the axes            of the  apertures,   by reason of
 their eccentricity, do not coincide with the plane of sight, and vision
 is therefore impossible.        If, however, the position of the cylinder         be
 reversed end for end, vision        will  be possible   only when the small ends
  are next the eyes, and the angle          of the aperture will  be found to sub
 tend    exactly the pencil of rays coming from a picture, which is so
  placed as to be bisected at right angles by the plane of sight. Hence
  it follows that, the former arrangement of the cylinder being re
  verted to, the observer looking along the upper side of the aperture
  will see a narrow strip extending along the top of the picture              ; then,
  moving the cylinder on and              looking   along the lower side of the
                                                                      o 2

                                          72
aperture, he will     see  a  similar strip at the bottom of the picture            ;
consequently, in the intermediate positions of the aperture, the other
parts of the picture will have been projected on the retinae.                   The
width of these strips is determined by that of the small ends of the
apertures, which measure
                                 .
                                   1 25  inch  ;  and the diameter     of the  large
ends is 1*5 inch, the lenses being distant 9 inches from the pictures.
The picture-drum being caused to revolve with the requisite rapidity,
the observer will see the steam-engine constantly before him, its
position remaining unchanged in respect of space, but its parts will
appear to be in motion, and in solid relief, as in the veritable object.
The stationary appearance of the pictures, notwithstanding the fact
of their being in rapid motion, is brought about by causing their
corresponding      parts to be seen, respectively, only in the same part
of   space, and that for so short a time that while in view they make
no sensible progression.        As, however,       there is an actual progression
during    the instant of vision, it is needful to take that fact into
account —in    order that it may be reduced            as far as practicable — in
regulating the diameter of the eye-cylinder, and of the apertures at
their small ends    ;  and the following are the numerical data involved
in the construction of an instrument with the relative proportions
given above    : —
    The circumference of picture-drum=22-5 inches (A).
    The circumference of eye-cylinder=12 inches x 4 revolutions =48
inches   (B).
    The diameter of apertures         at large   ends=l'5 inch (C).
    The diameter of apertures         at small ends=*125 inch         (D).
    While   the large    end is passing the eye, the picture under view
progresses    ^—        of 22-5 (A), or '703 inch.
    This amount of progression (703 in.), if perceived at one and the
same instant, would be utterly destructive of all distinctness of defi
nition  ;  but it is evident that the total movement                brought under
visual observation     at any one moment is                       of  *703 inch, or
                                                       1'5  \y)
*058 inch.     This   movement must necessarily         occasion a corresponding
 slurring,  so to speak,   of  the images        on the retina  ;  and the fact of
such slurring not affecting,       to an appreciable extent,       the distinctness
of definition,   seems to be referable to a faculty which the             mind has

                                                    78
of correcting or disregarding certain discrepant appearances or ir
regularities in the organ of vision ; as a further illustration of which
I    may   cite the      mentioned by Mr. Warren De la Rue iu his
                            fact,
"   Report on Celestial Photography," that the retinal image of a star
is, at least under some atmospheric conditions, made up of                                           "   a great
number of undulating points,"                       which, however,                    the    mind rightly
interprets as the effect of the presence                            before        the eye       of   a single
minute object.              That this corrective power
                                                might be supposed,     is,   as
very limited, may be proved experimentally by this instrument   for                                       ;
if   the small ends be enlarged                  in only    a    slight degree,            so as to increase
this slurring on the retinae,                a   very marked diminution in clearness of
definition      is   the immediate result.
     That form of          the stereotrope,         in which Professor Wheatstone's re
flecting stereoscope                is   made use of, and which               is       better adapted for
the exhibition of movements                    that are not only local but progressive
in   space,
                it
                is       needless        to describe     here, because the principles                     it   in
volves are essentially the same as those which are stated above.

in the present paper to submit the results of the lunar-diurnal

    t[Note added on February 8th, 1861.]                    When this communication was read to
the Royal Society on January 10th, 1861,                 it  contained the lunar-diurnal variation
for the years 1858 and 1859 only       whilst : was passing tluough the press, the
                                                            it
calculation of the lunar- diurnal variation for 1860 was completed, and the results
in that year have been added.

                                      74
 for each month and        hour computed, after the omission from the
record of all the hourly directions which deviated              3'-3 from their
 final normals, — the differences were taken between each of the re
maining hourly directions and the final normal of the same month
 and hour, and were entered       afresh in lunar monthly tables, having
the lunar days in successive        horizontal lines, and the twenty-four
lunar hours in vertical columns, each difference           being placed      under
the lunar hour to which it most nearly approximated.                  The entries
in these tables should consequently represent directly the lunar in
fluence   at the different lunar hours, subject only to minor disturb
ances ; the effects     of the solar-diurnal variation       as well    as  of the
larger disturbances having been eliminated.               The   differences    were
marked with a + sign when the north end of the magnet was east
 of its mean direction, and with the — sign when west               of the    same.
The differences      ware  then summed up, and hourly,             monthly,     and
annual means taken by the non-commissioned officers of the Royal
Artillery employed at Woolwich,              under the      superintendence       of
 Mr. Magrath.
    Having in the former paper exhibited the results of the disturb
ances at Kew in comparison with those at Hobarton, I propose to
do the same with the lunar-diurnal          variation treated of in this com
munication     ; believing that such comparisons are very conducive to
a  just appreciation of the systematic character and natural reality of
the results, and instructive both by the agreements                and   disagree
ments which they exhibit.        The lunar-diurnal variation         at Hobarton
has been obtained for the purpose           of this comparison, by       a  similar
process to that which has been described above, from observations at
every solar hour during five years (Sundays excepted), from Oct. 1,
 1843 to Sept. 30, 1848      ; omitting   as  disturbed such observations as
deviated   2'- 13 from their respective   final normals.      The total number
of hourly observations was 36,832       ;  the disturbed observations 2606         ;
and the number employed in the lunar-diurnal             variation 34,226.       As
it has   been    customary to represent such periodical variations               by
formulae   of well-known character, the results         at  Kew   and Hobarton
are here represented      by formula in which a, corresponding to x (the
lunar time for which the lunar-diurnal variation is desired), is counted
in hours and parts of an hour, multiplied by           15°,  from the epoch of
the moon's upper culmination.         The +      sign corresponds (as before)

                                              75
to a deflection     of the north end of the           magnet    to the east      of its  mean
place, and the       — sign    to the west.
Kew          A*= +0"-64-2"-54 sin(a+6°-2)—                     9"-74 sin(2a+59°-8).
Hobartou     Aj= — 0"- 1 + 1"-14           sin(a+344°-7)+6"-8sin(2a+43°-2).
    In   computing       the lunar-diurnal       variation by means of these for
mulae, the coefficient       of the term which includes the               sine  of twice the
hour-angle      is  of principal importance : the subsequent terms are
comparatively of little significance, and are therefore omitted on the
present occasion.          When "all the terms are employed, the original
observed values are reproduced.
    Table   I. exhibits, at Kew, in column 2 the lunar-diurnal                     variation
as actually observed on the mean              of the three    years, and in column 3,
the same computed by the formula.                    Column 4 is the lunar-diurnal
variation at Hobarton on the mean of the five years                       as observed,      and
column 5 the same computed by the formula.

    The aspect of the lunar-diurnal            variation at Kew and Hobarton
presents     features   of great simplicity as well        as   accord.     The form    at
both stations is a division of the 24 lunar hours into four equal or
nearly equal portions, in which the magnet is attracted alternately to
the east and to the west of its mean position, which is passed through
four times in the progress          of  the magnet towards two extreme               east
erly and two extreme            westerly deflections        :   the   easterly extremes
are about      12 hours apart, and the westerly the same.                  As far  as our
present experience        goes, this appears      to be the general         form of the
lunar diurnal variation of the declination at all the stations at which
it  has been examined ;        it is also that    of  the corresponding variations
of the Dip     and Total force.       At Hobarton,        where the results are ob
tained from five years of observation, there is scarcely                  any difference
deserving      of notice between the amplitudes of the extremes on either
side    of  the upper culmination and those on either side                 of  the lower
culmination.        At Kew,      where    the   results are obtained from only
three years,      the    extreme   deflections    are not quite so symmetrical
in amount, but they may become                 more    so as additional        years   are
brought into the account.          The amplitude of the oscillation on a mean
of the   two alternations is 9"- 74 at Kew and 6"-8 at- Hobarton, a differ
ence in correspondence         with the difference       in the opposite direction of
the antagonistic retaining force of the earth's magnetism at the two
stations,    which is 3-7 at Kew and 4-5 at Hobarton.                     On inspecting
the Table, we      see  that the lunar times when the moon's influence pro
duces no deflection (or the times              when the variation is zero), are
four, and arenearly the sameatKew andat Hobarton, two of them being
a  little more than an hour before the moon's passage of the meridian,
both at her upper and lower culminations, and the other two inter
mediate.       So far the     two stations      are alike     ;   but in regard to the
direction' towards which the magnet is deflected                     (if iu conformity
with general usage we speak in both hemispheres of the north end
of   the   magnet,    as  is done in the      Table), we        see  that the variation
becomes west at      Kew    when it becomes east at Hobarton, and vice versd;
the phases, while agreeing in hours at the two stations, having through
out opposite signs.
    By extending       the comparison      of the lunar hours        at which the lunar
variation passes through its zero-points to other stations than Kew
and Hobarton,        we are made       aware    of   differences      which appear to

                                         77
deserve   particular    attention in theoretical respects.       At Pekin, for
example  — which      may be advantageously compared with Kew, being
both in the same hemisphere, but Pekin some degrees nearer                    the
equator — the variation is zero in the passage of the north end of the
magnet from east to west at 20£ lunar hours, or 2£ hours earlier than
the corresponding epoch at Kew.               Again, at the Cape of Good
Hope,    situated in the same hemisphere with Hobarton, but                 some
degrees nearer the equator,        the variation is zero in the passage   of the
north end of the magnet         from west to east also at 20£ lunar hours,
or 2£ hours earlier than the corresponding epoch at Hobarton.              Thus
there is an accord of precisely the same kind between Pekin and the
Cape of Good Hope that there is between Kew and Hobarton, whilst
there is a difference between the two pairs of stations of 2£ hours in
the position of the moon relatively to the meridian at which she
ceases to exercise a deflecting influence on the magnet.              Again,    at
St. Helena, which is in the same (geographical) hemisphere               as  Ho
barton and the Cape of Good Hope, but still nearer to the equator
than either, the lunar influence is zero in the passage from west to
east at   19
             \ lunar hours, being one hour earlier than at the Cape,
and 3£ hours earlier than at Hobarton.
    Where the whole range of the variation of which we have been
treating is   so  small (not more than a few seconds of arc in each lunar
day), it may be desirable to show by the accordance of the independent
evidence    obtained in single years, the degree of confidence which may
be placed in the mean results         of several years.   This  may be seen in
the Table on the next page, which contains the separate results h.
each   of the   five successive   years of observation at Hobarton,      as   well
 as their mean.
    In this Table    the principal features    of the variation are seen to be
 substantially alike in each year.       The individual results   at the several
 hours in single years are of course somewhat less regular than in tlu
 mean   of the five years   : such small discrepancies    are no doubt in great
 part due to the lesser disturbances which, being below the separating
 value of 2'-13, have been left in the body of the observations.            They
 slightly disfigure the symmetry of the results in single years, but
 almost entirely disappear when the mean of several years is taken.             In
 order to appreciate justly and fully the confidence        to which the whole
 investigation is entitled, it must be borne in mind that every single

entry in the Table (exclusive of course of the column which exhibits
the mean of the five preceding columns) is derived from a wholly
independent body of observations               which belong to itself alone, and
are not employed in the deduction              of any of the other entries.

    It  may operate       as   an encouragement            to those who have        not yet
 subjected their observations        to any process          of examination or analysis,
 to perceive,       by this example,       how substantially satisfactory are the
 results which may be obtained from even a single year of hourly ob
 servations,     after the larger disturbances and the solar-diurnal variation
 have been eliminated.
    I  have      spoken in     a recent    paper of an unexceptionable test by
 which we may satisfy ourselves              as to the confidence            which may be
 reposed   in a series of observations, whether obtained by the eye or
 tabulated from instrumental traces.                  Such    a test   is furnished when
 the entries at solar hours are rewritten according to the lunar hours
 to which they most nearly approximate, and when consequently their

                                               70
original order and relations are changed                   and are replaced by others
which were wholly unforeseen, so that the observationsmustnecessarily
be free from the possibility             of having been influenced by any mental
bias.  When      we     find the effects of a natural law, represented by such
minute values as that of the lunar-diurnal                   variation, exhibited by the
observations of a single year with the degree of symmetry shown in
Table   II,  we may safely        conclude that the observations themselves
are worthy     of the labour       bestowed      in eliciting their results.         In this
view the Hobarton observations prove themselves                          to have been not
only a faithful, but also an extremely careful series, highly creditable
to Qaptain Kay, R.N., and to the Naval Officers who with him and
their Civil Assistant Mr.. Jeffery, maintained for so many years the
laborious and monotonous duty of hourly observation.

   In   conclusion, it may be useful to call the attention of the Society,
and of those Fellows in particular who interest themselves              in tracing
up the phenomena of nature to their physical causes, to the assem
blage    of facts which    are now available for such inquiries, in a branch
of magnetical       science    which   may not inappropriately          be   called
eelestiav magnetism.         In the introductory discussion prefixed to the
2nd volume of the St. Helena Magnetical Observations, p. cxliv to
cxlviii,   the lunar-diurnal     variation     is given for each of the three
magnetic elements, the Declination, the Dip, and the Intensity of the
force, at the four stations      of Toronto, St. Helena,       the Cape    of Good
Hope and Hobarton, and for the Declination at two additional stations
Kew    and Pekin.       The variations     are given both in formulae        and in
tables   ;  the latter exhibiting     the amount of the lunar influence at
each   of the   24 lunar hours, in the several magnetic elements            at each
station.      These data are directly        applicable to inquiries      into the
nature of the moon's magnetism           ;  and into the mode by which the
moon's magnetism acts either on the magnetism                 of the earth itself,
or on the magnetic needle stationed at different points of the earth's
surff.ce, so as to produce a small but systematic and                perfectly ap
preciable variation in each of the magnetic elements, having a double
period in every lunar day.
   The lunar-diurnal variation of the Declination              at  Kew    and   Ho
barton, as given in this communication, is slightly different from the
figures in the 2nd St. Helena volume referred to, because the results at
Kew     are a mean    of 3  years instead   of  2, as in the St. Helena volume ;
and    at Hobarton      a  lower standard has been taken for the disturb
ances, causing a larger number          of  the disturbed     observations to be
omitted in the calculation of the lunar-diurnal            variation.

" On     the   Homologies      of the Eye       and      of its Parts     in the
       Invertebrata."        By    J. Braxton         Hicks,      M.D.     Lond.,
       F.L.S.      Communicated by           John Lubbock, Esq.               Re
       ceived December 20, 1860.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The author first remarks, that the great similarity which exists in
the parts of the eye throughout all classes of the Vertebrata, coupled
with the desire to find in the eyes of all animals the same component
parts as in that great       group, has militated much against          a  proper
understanding of the different parts of the invertebrate eye.
    A different method has        been  followed in the observations upon
which the present communication is founded             ;  for, starting from the
simplest condition in which the organ appears in the animal series,
the necessary elements of a picture-seeing eye are first determined,
and afterwards those parts which are superadded to it.              A distinction
is then drawn between         the mere light-seeing        eye and    that which
 perceives   a picture  ; the former requiring no lens, the latter having
 one.     The  elements   of the picture-seeing       eye are, in fact, — 1st, a
 nerve-fibre, and bulb     ; 2ndly, a cell possessing       more or less refrac
 tive power, and resting on the nerve-bulb          ;  3rdly, pigment    ;  4thly,
 the nerve-sheath, including       the other structures.         The homologies
 of  these   parts are then considered, and traced through the various
 classes.    The cell resting   on the nerve-bulb is the homologue          of the
 crystalline lens.     It has the power of secreting into its interior           a
 highly refractive   substance,    which, in the Invertebrata        generally, is
 semifluid, but sometimes,      as in certain Insecta, solid.       The bilateral
 tendency of the cell in Asterias and in some Entomostraca is pointed
 out, as also the tendency of the solid lens of insects to split longitu
 dinally into four portions.        This  is compared with        the same con
 dition in the more fluid lens of the decapod crustaceans,           and referred

                                        82
to the mode of development as set forth by Dr. E. Claparede.                More
over, as in many cases these cells become            so fused    as to form an
entirely homogeneous body,            the   author   thinks    that   the single
crystalline lens, possessing       many nerve-bulbs (as in mollusks), is
formed really by the combination of their various lenses; the pig
ment in this case being confined to the nerve-bulb,                which is its
normal position.
    It is then pointed out, for the first time, that in some insects, and
in lulus, the lens possesses a very slight refractive power, being filled
with a fluid as little refractive as water.         This  is more particularly
the case in the Diptera, where the dermal facets become so spherical
as   to usurp the function of the lens, while an example is furnished
by the eye of Aromia tnoschata of the complete disappearance                of the
lens.     In opposition to the opinion entertained by many naturalists,
the author maintains that each bulb, provided with           a refracting body,
is capable of perceiving       a picture independently of the assistance of
other adjoining lenses.
    The homology of the nerve-sheath          is traced from its condition as
a delicate   membrane which passes over the simple eye, to that of the
sclerotic and cornea       ; and it is shown to constitute the true cornea.
After referring to the pigment           and  iris, the author discusses       the
parts added to the simple eye.          The anterior    chamber,    or the space
found anteriorly to the lens and iris (where the latter exists), first
appears in the leeches, but is a very variable element in the Inver
tebrate,    existing in some aquatic animals, as leeches and cephalous
mollusks, while it is absent in others, as Paludina, Limncea,                See.  ;
and thus the opinion held by some, that an anterior chamber is                    of
little use in aquatic animals, as in fishes, is scarcely tenable, because
they have a compensation in the globular              lens.   The author       has
never found an anterior chamber in the compound eyes                  of  the  In-
secta, although     a space   has been described,    and erroneously called a
lens.     Still the possibility of such a space is not thereby denied              ;
only, should it exist, it would be homologous to the anterior chamber,
and not to the lens      ;   and the transparent body behind it is the true
lens, and not a vitreous humour, as is often represented.                There is
such    a  chamber in the Decapods, in which it is well marked.                 In
regard to a chamber posterior to the lens, the author is of opinion
that none is to be found below the mollusks, and points out that what

                                                       83
has been so called in the                     ocelli and stemmata is not the homologue
of the vitreous humour, but probably that of the lens, which other
wise is absent in these eyes, for the lens of the ocelli is shown below
to be   of dermal origin.
     The next portion of             the        paper is occupied in pointing out the
part which the integument                       plays in regard to the optical organs
where it passes over them                 ;   and it is shown that in all of the Inverte-
brata the integument becomes more or less subservient to the func
tions of those organs.                   It    is in animals with a dermo-skeleton that
the greatest       subjection of the integument to the eye is seen                                ;   and
the change is reviewed gradatim from where the eye is independent
of   the integument, as in Daphnia,                            through Gammarus, where the
integument is merely applied to                        it,   till, in Artemia fSalina, we find the
inner surface         indented, but not yet facetted.                           In Branchipus          the
inner layer only becomes                  facetted,          till in the Decapods both layers
become so.         But   it   is   in the Insecta that the change                  is   most marked,
the form of the facets becoming more or less lens-like, till in Diptera
they are nearly perfect spheres.                             Their power of refraction           is   very
high   ;   they are supplied with corrections for spherical and chromatic
aberration, and they almost altogether supply the place of the true
crystalline lens, as before                    pointed out.             The ocelli in Insects and
Arachnida         show this condition                   carried to the extreme             ;    and    the
author conceives that the so-called crystalline lens of these organs                                    is
derived entirely from the integument                              :   this he endeavours        to show
by reference to their structure and intimate connexion with the other
dermal layers, and by tracing them through the various tribes                                    ;    and
a    more complicated              structure        is       described,    for the      first time,     in
the median eye         of   one     of   the Scorpionidae               (ButAus), where the inner
integumental layer          is     converted into             a   lens more distinct than in any
other of     the      Arachnida.              A    chamber         is   also   shown to exist in        it,
formed       by   the separation              of   the epidermis from the other layers,
producing         a   plano-convex              lens     similar        in form    to     the anterior
chamber of the higher animals, and analogous to                                      it   in function.
The     stemmata                         of the compound eye, have
                      and ocelli, like the facets
peculiarities in their structure for the correction of spherical and
chromatic aberration.
     The author        concludes              by pointing             out the striking         homology
existing throughout                the    whole animal world in those parts which

                                           84
  were pointed out at the commencement              of the paper    as forming the
  essentials  of   an eye, and considers that it affords a contradiction to the
  position of Agassiz,
                              " That           great type is formed on          a di
                                        every
  stinct plan, — so peculiar, indeed, that homologies cannot be extended
  from one type to the other, but are strictly limited to each of them."
  On the contrary, the eye of an Asterius is formed on the same plan
 as that   of  a  Planaria    and a Daphnia    ;  and the eye of the leech pos
 sesses the same parts as that           of the Helix, while the similarity of
 the eye   of the cephalopod to that of the vertebrata is obvious to all.

 I. "On       the Calculus        of Symbols, with Applications               to the
        Theory of Differential Equations."               By W. H. A.     Russell,
        A.B.        Communicated by           Arthur Cayley,           Esq.      Re
        ceived December 20, 1860.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The calculus of generating functions,               discovered by       Laplace,
 was, as is well known,       highly instrumental in calling the attention of
 mathematicians to the analogy which exists between differentials and
powers.      This analogy     was perceived at length to involve an essential
identity, and several        analysts devoted     themselves     to the improve
ment    of the   new methods      of calculation which      were thus called into
existence.       For  a long time the modes         of combination     assumed    to
exist between        different classes    of symbols      were those  of ordinary
algebra ; and      this sufficed for investigations respecting functions of
differential coefficients and constants,         and consequently for the inte
gration of linear differential equations,            with constant coefficients.
The laws of combination of ordinary algebraical symbols may                       be
divided into the commutative and distributive laws              ; and the number
of symbols in the higher branches of mathematics, which                    are com
mutative with        respect   to  one another, is very small.          It   became

                                         85
 then necessary to invent an algebra            of non-commutative symbols.
This important step was effected by Professor Boole, for certain
classes of symbols, in his well-known and beautiful memoir published
in the Transactions of this Society for the year             1 844 ;  and the ob
ject of the paper which I have now the honour                  to lay before     the
 Society is to perfect and develope the methods there employed.
    For this purpose     I have constructed systems        of multiplication and
 division for functions of non- commutative symbols, subject to the
 same laws      of combination    as   those   assumed    in Professor Boole's
memoir     ;  and  I thus arrive at equations      of great  utility in  the   inte
 gration of linear differential equations with variable coefficients.
    I then proceed to develope certain general theorems,             which will, I
 hope, be found interesting.         I  have applied the methods        of multi
plication,   as just explained,  to deduce theorems       for non-commutative
 symbols analogous       to  the  binomial and       multinomial     theorems     of
 ordinary algebra.
    Lastly,   I have shown how to employ the equations            deduced    in the
 earlier part of this paper in the          integration    of linear differential
 equations.      I have, for this purpose, made        use  of   methods   closely
 resembling the method of         divisors which has so long been used in
 resolving ordinary      algebraical equations.       The whole paper will,        I
 hope,   be found to be a step upwards in the important                subject of
 which it treats.
    I shall just observe, that the symbolical combinations used in this
 paper may also be applied to the calculus of finite differences,                 as
 may be seen in Professor Boole's memoir.

    In this communication the author          has shown how a small quantity
of liquid carbonic acid       may be readily and safely prepared in glass
tubes closed      by stoppers of gutta percha, and be brought in            a  pure
state   into contact with any solid substance          upon which it may be
 desired to ascertain its chemical or solvent action, or be submitted

to the action of electricity by means of wires introduced through the
stoppers.
    By immersing about fifty substances in the liquid acid for various
periods of time, he has found that it is comparatively a chemically
inert substance,      and not deoxidized by any ordinary                 deoxidizing
agent     except   the alkali-metals.       Its solvent power is extremely
limited; it     dissolves   camphor freely, iodine sparingly,             and a few
other bodies in small quantities        ;  it  does not dissolve oxygen-salts,
and it does not redden solid extract of litmus               ;  it penetrates    gntta
percha, dissolves      out the dark-brown        colouring      matter, and leaves
the gutta percha undissolved, and much more white.                    It also acts  in
 a singular and somewhat          similar manner upon india-rubber             ;   the
 india-rubber whilst in the liquid acid exhibits no change, but imme
 diately on being taken out it swells to at least six or eight times its
 original dimensions, and then slowly contracts to its original volume,
 evidently from expansion and liberation of absorbed                  carbonic acid   ;
 and   it is found to be perfectly white throughout           its substance.   These
 effects   upon gutta percha and india-rubber               may prove useful for
 practical purposes.
     The liquid acid is a strong insulator of electricity ; sparks (from
 a  Ruhmkorff s coil) which would pass readily through ^nds of
 an   inch of cold air,       would   with     difficulty     pass   through     about
  ^th of an inch of the liquid acid.
     In its general properties it is somewhat             analogous    to bisulphide
 of carbon, but it      possesses much less solvent         power over fatty sub
  stances.

      The      present      communication relates to the theory of the solution,
in positive and negative integral numbers, of systems of linear inde
terminate equations,             having integral coefficients.                    In connexion with
this theory, a solution is also given of certain problems relating to
rectangular matrices,               composed of integral numbers, which are of
frequent use in the                 higher arithmetic.                Of this kind        are the two
following : —
           "
      Given (in integral numbers) the values of the determinants
      1.
of any rectangular matrix of given dimensions, to find all the
matrices, the constituents of which are integers, and the determinants
of which           have those given values.
      2.   "   Given any rectangular matrix, the determinants of which
have a given             number D for their greatest                   common divisor, to find

square matrices,            of which     the determinant is             D."
      A solution of particular, but still very important                                cases   of   these
two problems, has been already given by M. Hermite.                                       The method
by which in this paper their general                            solution has been obtained,
depends         on an elementary, but apparently                        fertile principle in the
theory of indeterminate linear systems                      ;    viz. that        if   m be the index
of indeterminateness of such                  a system     (i.   e.   the excess of the number
of indeterminates            above the number          of really independent equations),
it    is   always possible to assign             a   set of m solutions, such that the
determinants of the matrix                     formed by them                 shall admit of no
common divisor but unity.
      Such     a   set   of solutions        termed
                                     fundamental set, and possesses
                                        is            a
the characteristic property, that every other solution of the system
                            '
can be integrally expressed                   by means of the solutions contained in
it.    A     set   of independent solutions           is   one in which the determinants
of the matrix have              a   finite common divisor,              i.   e.    are not all zero.
                                                                                          h   2

The theory of independent and fundamental sets of solutions in some
respects resembles that of independent and fundamental systems of
units in Lejeune Dirichlet's celebrated                              generalization of the solution
of the Pellian equation.
   By the aid of the same principle of fundamental                                          sets, the     follow
ing criterion is obtained for the resolubility or irresolubility                                         of inde
terminate linear systems.

II. "   Contributions to the Physiology of the Liver— Influence
       of Alkalies."         By Frederick W. Pavy, M.D. Com
       municated       by   Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.               Received January
       24, 1861.
    I have   already communicated to the Royal Society the fact that
the introduction of an alkali,          as the   carbonate of soda, into the cir
culation, prevents       the production      of   diabetes in an animal after an
operation on the sympathetic nerve that otherwise occasions it.                    On
excising, for example,        the superior cervical ganglia, or dividing the
ascending branches of the superior thoracic ganglia, diabetes is an
almost constant result in the dog.                Now,     I have   a record  of   ten
experiments, in which, before attacking the superior cervical ganglia,
200 grains, or nearly so, of the crystallized carbonate                 of soda   dis
solved in   a  small quantity of water, were introduced into the general
circulation through the jugular vein.               In not   one  of these cases was
there any diabetes produced.            In another     instance, where   I employed
only 100 grains of the carbonate             of  soda,    the urine soon after the
operation on the ganglia became              decidedly, although not strongly
saccharine.      On dividing the ascending branches of the superior
thoracic ganglia also, after the introduction of 200 grains of carbo
nate   of soda,   I  have failed to meet      with sugar in the urine. Under
this injection of 200 grains of carbonate of soda into the circulation,
the urine becomes exceedingly copious in quantity, pale-coloured, and
alkaline to test-paper, and effervesces           strongly on the addition of an
acid.
    Although    the    introduction     of  carbonate     of  soda into the system
thus counteracts the influence         of certain    lesions  of the sympathetic in
leading to the production of sugar            (I  presume) in the liver, yet it is
not sufficient to prevent the appearance              of sugar in the urine where
life has been destroyed         and the circulation is kept up artificially.
On resorting to artificial         respiration immediately after death,            the
action of the heart being kept up, the sugar which is formed in the
liver, as the result of     a  post-mortem occurrence,          escapes from   it into
the blood, and in passing through the kidneys is eliminated by these
organs.     In two experiments        I  introduced 200 grains of carbonate of
soda into     the   jugular    vein  previous to the destruction of life by

                                            91
 pithing.     The circulation        wa9 maintained by artificial            respiration   ;
 an enormous flow        of alkaline urine took place, which in both                  cases
 presented     a saccharine   character.
    From another experiment, however,                it is evident that the carbo
 nate   of  soda,  if it arrives at the liver in sufficient quantity, holds in
 check the tendency of hepatine to pass into sugar, and thus prevents
 the production       of saccharine     urine when the circulation is kept up
 artificially after death.       Introduced      into the general venous system,
 as in the two experiments mentioned, the amount                     of  the carbonated
 alkali that reached the liver was insufficient to counteract the ordi
 nary post-mortem change.              Introduced      into  a  branch of the portal
 system,    it must all pass to the liver, and accordingly the result is
 altered.     I injected   200 grains     of  carbonate     of   soda, dissolved in an
ounce     of water, into     a branch     of the portal        vein   of   a dog.      The
 animal was killed by destroying the medulla oblongata.                         Artificial
respiration was performed for an hour and three quarters, during
the whole of which          time the heart continued beating vigorously.
The urine contained in         the bladder at the end         of   the experiment was
pale-coloured and alkaline, and effervesced                slightly on the addition
 of an acid.      It  did not give evidence of even a trace of sugar.                  The
 blood which escaped on opening the body behaved                          precisely   as  it
 does under natural circumstances, and               gave   just    a trace   of reaction
with the copper solution.              The liver, examined          a short time after
 removal, was quite devoid        of sugar.      The    presence     of hepatine, how
 ever, was easily recognized,         and in the course of twenty-four hours
 sugar had been produced, so as to give a copious orange-red reduc
tion with the copper solution.
    Looking      to these facts,    I  determined to investigate the effects of
an alkali on the hepatine in the liver during                life.    I had long     since
noticed that the carbonate of potash introduced into the stomach
caused a disappearance         of hepatine in      a short space       of time without
the production       of sugar.     I  had injected 200 grains dissolved in two
ounces    of water, through       the oesophagus        into the stomach of         a  dog
that had recently been fed.              An examination of the blood               before
and    at intervals after the injection,        gave     no sign of       any difference
being produced.          The animal died during the night ; and from its
condition in the morning it was probable that death had taken place
within twelve hours after the injection.              The liver      was much altered

                                           92
  from its natural appearance,         and did not contain a trace of either
  hepatine or sugar.
      In other experiments, where          carbonate    of  soda was introduced
  into the stomach and duodenum,            I  found that when the animal had
  lived several hours, the hepatine had entirely disappeared           ; but when
  it  was killed within three or four hours, some            amount of hepatine
  remained.
      Absorption      having had to take place,       the passage of the carbo
  nated    alkali to the liver can only have been comparatively gradual.
  On the other hand, the rapid distribution of it in tolerable quantity
  through the organ, as by injecting it into a branch of the portal vein,
  causes a transformation        of hepatine into something else than sugar
  in an astonishingly short period of time.            I regard the discovery of
 this fact as a most important step in our study of the physiological
 history of hepatine, and believe         that it is not unlikely to lead us to
 a   knowledge of its natural destination in the economy.
      In proof of the effect produced by the injection of a solution of
 carbonate of soda into the portal system during life, I will give the
 leading features of the first three experiments that          I  performed.
     In  the   first, sixty grains of carbonate       of soda   dissolved in five
 drachms of water were injected into one of the mesenteric veins of a
 healthy, nearly full-grown         pup.    Between    one and a    half and two
 hours afterwards the animal was killed by pithing.                 The liver   was
 much swollen, dark-coloured           from congestion, and easily lacerable.
 The walls of        the gall-bladder were thickened from oedema, and the
 tissue in the neighbourhood         of the  transverse  fissure of the liver was
 also quite cedematous.          The liver contained neither hepatine nor
 sugar.      The blood collected from the right side of the heart was
 also quite free from sugar.
     In the   second experiment, fifty grains      of the   carbonate,   dissolved
in four drachms of water, were employed as the injection.                  In per
forming the operation, the stomach was observed                 to contain food,
and the lacteals to be well injected with chyle.              Four hours after
wards     the dog was pithed.         The liver   was devoid   of both hepatine
and sugar.        The blood from the right side of the heart was likewise
devoid    of sugar. The urine found in       the bladder presented    an alkaline
reaction, and effervesced        slightly on the    addition of an acid     ;  like
the liver and       blood, it was quite devoid of sugar.           In the third,

                                            !>3
80 grains, dissolved in 6^ drachms            of water, constituted     the injection
used.     In   one hour's time the dog was killed.            The liver   was dark-
coloured aud exceedingly congested,               fluid blood oozing out of it in
large quantity when it was sliced.              Neither hepatine nor sugar was
present.
    Here, then, were the experiments which taught me that, under
the influence     of the     presence    of  a certain quantity      of carbonate    of
soda, the whole of the hepatine in the liver might be destroyed in a
short space of time during life, without any appearance                   of the pro
duction     of sugar.        The animals submitted          to  these    experiments
were    perfectly good-conditioned and healthy, and under such cir
cumstances      hepatine is always found to some considerable extent in
the liver.      There could       not be the slightest doubt that hepatine
would have been met with had not the carbonate                  of  soda exercised    a
special action in promoting its rapid disappearance              or transformation.
In   one of the experiments,          it will   be observed    that this had been
entirely effected in an hour.
    From many subsequent            experiments      I learnt that, to obtain the
result  I  have mentioned, certain circumstances require to be attended
to in making the injection.           In  some experiments      I did not meet    with
a similar total disappearance        of hepatine, although      even a larger quan
tity of   carbonate    of   soda had been employed.          I subsequently found
that this depended          on the circumstance that, when the injection is
made slowly, and the blood is flowing freely through the system, the
carbonate      of soda     passes  in great part through          the liver without
effecting    a  total disappearance       of its hepatine or materially altering
its natural aspect       ;  whereas,   when the carbonated alkali is rapidly
thrown in, it seems to cause an obstruction to the flow of blood
through the organ, and to exude into, and thus be detained                      in its
tissue.     This   may be seen on watching the liver whilst the injection
is being effected    ; a   number of small light-coloured        spots, constituting
the lobules influenced by the injection, first make their appearance,
and the liver rapidly becomes dark-coloured, swollen, and turgid with
blood.      It  may still, however, allow the blood to move through it                ;
but in some cases, in which          I  have used a large quantity of the car
bonate in a concentrated state, 200 grains for instance in an ounce                  of
water, the circulation through the liver has evidently become stopped,
for the chylo-poietic viscera          have presented      exactly the appearance

                                               94
 as  if the portal vein had been obstructed by ligature or otherwise.
 Holding the muzzle of               the   animal     so  as   temporarily     to check its
 breathing, and so impede the escape, of blood from the liver during
 the introduction of the solution, has the same effect as injecting it
 rapidly.     The    carbonate       of  soda is delayed in the liver so as to bring
 about the chemical and physical alteration                   I  have noticed.
    If, then, the conditions of the experiment                    are such as to conduce
 to the free passage          of the injected solution through the liver, the
 hepatine escapes the influence requisite to cause its rapid aud com
 plete disappearance.           But, should the circumstances                be favourable
 to the saturation of the parenchyma                 of  the liver with the carbonated
 alkali, the hepatine is        so   rapidly transformed that it soon ceases to
 be discoverable.
    In  the experiments mentioned, the hepatine completely disappeared
 in the space of an hour          ;   a much shorter time, however, than this is
 required   ;   for  I  have found that even within                a few minutes      of the
injection being completed the liver has been totally                          deprived     of
 hepatine.       Thus, in one experiment, 200 grains of carbonate                    of soda
in one ounce of water were injected into a branch of the portal vein of
a good-sized,       good-conditioned dog that had been fed about twenty
hours previously         ; as soon as the vein was ligatured, the animal being
kept under the influence of chloroform, one of the lobes of the liver
was tied at its base and removed               ;  examined      within a very short time
afterwards, it was found perfectly free from both hepatine and sugar.
In another experiment,              1 00   grains of carbonate          of soda in   half an
ounce    of water      were injected into one           of the    mesenteric     veins of a
large, exceedingly good-conditioned                  dog that had been likewise fed
about twenty hours previously.                   When the injection was completed,
a portion     of the liver    was obtained and examined              ; it was quite devoid
of hepatine, but contained just               a   discoverable trace of sugar         ; this
probably existed in the liver before the injection, and was formed in
consequence        of   the   congestion      to which       the organ was purposely
submitted by temporarily obstructing the breathing.
   I  have     tried the substitution            of  the   caustic for the carbonated
alkali, but there are accidental circumstances occasioned                        by its use
which render it unfit for employment.                     Fifty grains of caustic pot
ash were    dissolved      in one   ounce    of  water   and   introduced into a branch
of the portal vein.           After    the injection was completed and the vein

                                           95
secured,    haemorrhage      of dark pitchy blood took        place from a vessel
which gave way through the action of the alkali upon it.                     This was
very soon checked,         and  the animal lived, although          in   a comatose
state, for about an hour.            Upon examining the liver after death, it
was found that it had not been uniformly penetrated                  by the alkali,
and that the large veins were plugged up with coagulated or solidified
blood, which had arrested           the   portal circulation   ; I  have never ob
served a similar solidification       of the blood produced by the use of the
carbonate of soda.        My analysis of the liver a short time after death
indicated the presence         of both hepatine and sugar.             It  was quite
evident from the appearance of the organ, that much of its tissue had
not been reached by the injection, and therefore escaped the action
of the alkali.
    It having been thus shown that           a rapid disappearance       of hepatine
may be occasioned         by the presence       of  the carbonate    of   soda in the
liver during life, it remains now to determine the nature of the pro
cess   of  disappearance,     and to discover the material into which the
hepatine is transformed.            I  am   not in a position      as   yet to eater
satisfactorily into a discussion of this question         ; but,  if I  cannot state
how aud       into what the hepatine is thus changed — if               I   cannot at
 present speak      definitely upon the positive side of the question,              I,
however, can advert to its negative aspect, and say wliat the process
is not   ;  and, in following this course,        I  am adopting a rational pro
 ceeding,   for it is from a consideration of the known that we are
 placed in the best position for making a profitable             advance      towards
 the unknown.
    As hepatine is    a  body presenting such characteristic reactions, and
 so easily     susceptible of recognition, we can have no difficulty                in
 deciding that it is really absent or transformed in the circumstances
 stated, and that    it is not merely masked or        concealed    by the material
 employed for injection.         It  is the property of hepatine to be thrown
 down   as a   white precipitate by spirit.         The alkalies and carbonated
 alkalies, for certain, do not prevent this precipitation               from taking
 place.     A solution of hepatine        presents a most striking lactescence        ;
 and by this character, used with precaution, not only may the ques
 tion of its presence        or absence be decided,        but, when present, its
 relative amount may        be pretty accurately judged of in different speci
 mens.      With iodine it      gives a strong deep-red       coloration.      Lastly,

                                                       96
boiled with         a   little sulphuric acid, or treated when iu               a   neutral state
with saliva, at a moderately elevated temperature, it undergoes trans
formation into sugar. Now it is not upon the evidence of one, but of
all these tests, that          I   have relied.
     Does the hepatine disappear by being metamorphosed into sugar ?
If   so, taking an ordinary                  sized liver, say     1\    ounces in weight, con
taining an average amount of hepatine for an animal diet, say seven
per cent.   and reckoning (in accordance with my analyses showing
            ;
the relation of loss of hepatine to gain of sugar in the liver after
death) that the loss of one and a half part of the former is accom
panied with the production of one part of the latter, then upwards
of    150 grains         of sugar        have to be accounted for.            Under such cir
cumstances          sugar ought to be easily detected in quantity in the liver
and blood       ;   or else it must be assumed to be decomposed                        as fast as
it is formed.           But,   as    I   have mentioned, the liver in my experiments
has been found free from sugar as well as hepatine, and the blood
has exhibited a similar state, or has only been charged to a slight
extent — a condition that has probably existed previous to the injec
tion, and been produced by the preliminary part of the experiment,
chloroform having been always used to occasion anaesthesia.                                     The
sugar, then, is not to be discovered,                       and    we shall    find the other
hypothesis to be equally untenable.
     When sugar is present either in the liver or blood,                       I have      failed to
discover that the introduction                    of   a carbonated       alkali exercises      any
perceptible influence over it.                   It   is true that, in order to avoid error,
certain precautions are necessary in preparing a liquid from an alka
line specimen for the application of the copper test.                         If the decoction
of the liver is allowed to remain only in a slight degree alkaline, a
certain amount of albuminous matter is retained in solution, which
interferes materially with the action of the test.                            If acetic     acid be
used to neutralize,            a    small excess of this will produce the condition
that it was intended to avoid.                    I   find, however, that citric acid is not
liable to this objection                 ;   and, accordingly,     if   it be added        in slight
excess to a specimen                 of alkaline liver,      a decoction can be prepared
in which the slightest amount of sugar or of hepatine may be easily
and certainly recognized.
     To show that         when sugar is formed the carbonate                  of    soda    has no
power of destroying            it, I     may refer to the following experiment, which

                                             97
 accords   with my general experience.               Into the liver of    a small dog,
 about ten minutes after the destruction of its life, 100 grains of car
 bonate   of   soda in   half   an ounce     of   water were injected through the
 portal vein     ; in a  couple of hours an examination was made                  ;  the
 decoction of liver, prepared as          I  have recommended,         gave the usual
 orange-red reduction with the copper-solution that is observed where
 the post-mortem change            has   been allowed to take place.            Should
 hepatine in fact be transformed into sugar, the latter will unquestion
 ably be discoverable,       notwithstanding         the  presence     of an alkali   or
 alkaline carbonate.
    I  have tried the effect        of injecting grape-sugar along with             car
 bonate   of  soda into the liver during life, and the result was in strict
 accordance     with what     I  have   just stated.       200 grains of each were
 dissolved together in an        ounce of water, and injected into one of the
mesenteric      veins  of a good-sized      healthy dog     ; some blood taken from
 the carotid artery after the operation was found to be charged with
 sugar   to a large     extent.     In  one hour's time the animal was killed.
 The liver     and blood were both found saccharine.                  The urine con
 tained in the bladder was mixed with blood, which                    I have  observed
 always   to be the case when such an amount as 200                      grains of the
 carbonate    of   soda has been employed.          After being boiled    and filtered,
 it was tested with the copper solution, and gave               a  strong reaction of
the presence of sugar.
    The   evidence before us tends,         I  think, satisfactorily to prove that
 the hepatine is neither concealed             nor transformed into sugar when
lost sight of after injection of the carbonate of soda.                 Again, it does
not seem that its disappearance            can be owing to any direct chemical
action of the carbonated alkali.              It is one of the most striking pro
perties   of hepatine     to resist the action       of even the caustic alkali at a
boiling temperature, and          I  certainly have not been able to perceive
that the carbonated alkali is capable of exercising any direct chemical
influence upon it up to        a  boiling heat.
    Looking     to all the facts in my possession,         I am   inclined to believe,
although     I  cannot at present substantiate the opinion, that the rapid
disappearance        of hepatine which        has been noticed,      is due to one of
those   catalytic actions of which           we have such numerous examples
occurring amongst the phenomena               of life. It is well known that sugar,
under the influence of certain catalytic conditions, is transformed

                                                          98
into alcohol and carbonic acid,                           and      under others into lactic acid.
Now, may not hepatine occupy                         a    parallel position, and be susceptible
of undergoing                a process       of metamorphosis                  besides that into sugar,
the product having as yet escaped discovery                                         ?    Hepatine itself is a
body that has been known to us but                                 a very      short period.
     I   have mentioned that the                         carbonate        of    soda does not enjoy any
direct chemical power of effecting                             a    destruction of hepatine up to
the temperature of ebullition                        ;    neither,        as    far     as   I   have yet learnt,
can      it    occasion          a disappearance          of it from the liver after                  death    :   it,
however, holds the saccharine metamorphosis in check.                                                Previous to
this inquiry, although                 I   had known that             a   tolerably strong solution of
the caustic alkali prevented the production                                of sugar in the liver after
death,    I     was not aware that                  a    moderate         amount of the carbonated
alkali has so completely the same effect.                                   In      an experiment recently
performed,          I       injected, instantly after the animal was pithed, 200
grains of the carbonate                      of   soda dissolved in an ounce                       of water, into
the liver through                     the portal vein         :   a   couple of lobes               happened to
escape being properly penetrated by the injection, and in this part                                                of
the liver the ordinary post-mortem production of sugar took place.
In       the    other portion              of the organ no saccharine metamorphosis
occurred        ;       nor could     I    discover that the injection had in any degree
caused         a   disappearance           of     the hepatine, as happens under its opera
tion during life.                    The liver     examined           shortly after the introduction
of   the carbonate               of soda had been completed, was found to be highly
charged with hepatine and quite devoid of sugar                                              ;   examined     again
on the following day, the result was identically the same.
     Amongst             my examinations of the livers of the lower animals,                                       I
once       met          with     a   specimen       from      a    cod-fish in which the hepatine
resisted the              ordinary post-mortem                 transformation                into sugar.       He
patine was present in the greatest abundance,                                       but there was only the
merest trace                of   sugar discoverable when first examined,                            and likewise
after     it   had been standing aside for twenty-four hours.                                        It   was then
exposed            to   a   moderately elevated temperature for three hours, and
still indicated only                 a   trace    of the      presence         of   sugar, notwithstanding
that the decoction immediately produced sugar copiously on being
treated with saliva.                     The result being             so much at variance with that
usually met with, made                      a     strong impression upon me.                         I    can only
see two         ways of accounting for                   it;    either the hepatine was protected

                                                  99
from the influence of catalytic action in some such manner as in my
experiment with the injection of carbonate of soda into the liver
instantly    after death, or the absence of change depended upon                                         a
want of the requisite catalytic agent.
    I cannot     help regarding it as            a    most significant fact, which, how
ever,   I   merely mention here, without                       at present commenting upon
it, that after the introduction of carbonate of                              soda into the system,
the liver gives upon analysis so high a per-centage                              of fat. The usual
quantity of fat in the liver of the healthy dog kept upon an animal
diet,   I have    found to be about six per cent.                       It   is seldom much more,
and often only three or four per cent.                                After the introduction of
carbonate of soda into the system, my analyses have given me from
ten to twelve and thirteen, and even more than this per cent. The
employment of large quantities of the carbonate                                  does not seem to
have the effect       I   have   just mentioned.                 It   is only where the liver is
injected with a moderate               amount that the high per-centage                      of   fat is
noticeable:      I do not think that the hepatine is directly                     transformed into
fat, but there        is,
                       I      have strong reason to believe,                    a   close connexion
between      the two   ;     at all events,
                                                 it
                                                 is        a   point that    I   have grounds for
endeavouring to work out.                 The formation of the bile                 also, from what
I   have observed,          appears to be involved               in this question, and forms
a   subject of consideration in the investigation                      I     am conducting.
    The conclusions          advanced         in this communication are              :   —
    " That the introduction of carbonate of                            soda into the circulation
 prevents the production of saccharine urine after lesions of the sym
 pathetic nerve otherwise occasioning it.
    " That     carbonate       of     soda injected into the general venous                      system
 does    not prevent the urine from becoming saccharine                                  after the de
 struction of life when the circulation                    is   kept up artificially         ;   but in
jected into the portal                system, so that all may pass into the liver,                    it
 has the effect of keeping the urine entirely free from sugar.
     " That      carbonate       of   soda injected into the portal system during
 life, causes    a   rapid disappearance of hepatine from the liver without
 any sign of the production of sugar.
    " That in the
                  disappearance of hepatine under the influence of the
 carbonate of soda, the hepatine      not concealed, nor transformed
                                                      is
 into sugar, nor destroyed               by   any direct chemical power possessed by
 the carbonated alkali.               The     facts    before me would suggest that                 it   is

                                                      100
transformed by a process                       of the nature of catalysis, the product
having as yet escaped discovery.
  " That         carbonate             of   soda injected into the liver after death does
not effect a disappearance                    of hepatine, but     even in moderate      quantity-
holds the saccharine                   metamorphosis completely in check.
  " That          there          is probably        a close     connexion between       the dis
appearance        of hepatine, the production of fat, and the                        state   of the
bile."

  The Right Hon. the Earl of Ellesmere                              and    Professor Harkness
were admitted into the Society.
   The       Bakerian Lecture                         was then      delivered      by Professor
Tyndall, F.R.S., " On                          the Absorption       and Radiation of Heat
by Gases and Vapours, and on the Physical Connexion of Radia
tion, Absorption, and Conduction."
  The Lecturer                  gave an account          of the    researches     which form the
subject of a paper with the above title, communicated by him to
the Society       ;    and in explaining the methods followed, he exhibited
the apparatus which he had employed in his experiments.                                  The fol
lowing is an          abstract : —
                                                   (Abstract.)
  The apparatus                  made        use   of in this investigation consists of the
following parts            :   —
   1.    A   copper cube C, containing                      water kept constantly boiling,
and one      of whose                faces, coated with lampblack, forms the source             of
radiant heat.
  2.     A   brass tube 2*4 inches in diameter, which is divided into two
portions, a and                (i.
  a. The portion of the tube intended to receive the gases and
vapours      stopped air-tight at its two ends
             ;   it   is                         plates of trans             by
parent rock-salt, and                   is   attached to    a    good air-pump, by which        it
can be exhausted at pleasure.                        The length     is
                                                                    4     feet.

                                                        101
     ft.   An air-tight chamber                between the tube a and the cube                     C.     It
ia   kept constantly exhausted                 ;   and the calorific rays, therefore, pass
from the radiating plate through                             a   vacuum into the tube a, thus
retaining            the quality which belonged to them at the moment ot
emission.
     To prevent the transmission of                       heat by conduction from the cube
C    to the tube a, the chamber                     ft   is      partly embraced        by an annular
space      in which cold water continually circulates.
     3.    A     thermo-electric         pile furnished with two conical reflectors,
and connected with an excellent galvanometer*.                                   One of the faces of
the pile receives the rays which have passed through the tube a.
     4.    A     second copper cube             C,      also filled with         boiling water, and
whose rays fall upon the second                              face   of the thermo-electric              pile.
The two              cubes   C   and   C   thus radiating upon the opposite faces of
the pile, tend, of course, to neutralize each other.
     Between          the cube     C    and the adj acent face of the pile,                  a   screen    S
is   introduced, being attached to                   an apparatusof Ruhmkorff, capable
of extremely fine motion                   ;   by the partial advance or withdrawal of
this screen the two sources                    of heat can be caused to neutralize each
other perfectly.
     The tube          a and the chamber             ft   being both exhausted,               the needle
is    brought exactly to               zero    by means of the screen S.                     The   gas or
vapour          to be experimented with                   is     now admitted into the tube a              ;
and        if   it   possess     any sensible       absorbing power,             itwill destroy the
previously existing equilibrium.                          The       consequent     deflection of the
galvanometer, properly reduced,                         is   the measure of the absorption.
      In    this way the action of eight gases and thirteen vapours have
been examined,               and also the action             of atmospheric air.
      Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,                       and       atmospheric air, respectively,
absorb about 0-3 per cent. of the calorific rays                            :    this   is   the feeblest
 action which has been observed.
     The most           energetic      action      is   that of olefiant gas, which at the
tension of one atmosphere                  absorbs        81 per cent.      of the calorific rays.
Between those extremes stand carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, nitrous
oxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen.
 *   The author points out the means by which      galvanic coil of any length and
                                                                    a
of any degree of fineness, and possessing no trace of magnetism, may be obtained.
      VOl. Xi.                                                                           *

   Below a certain tension, which varies for the different gases, the
amount of heat absorbed         is exactly proportional        to the density    of
the gas.
   Above this tension the rays on which               the principal     absorptive
energy   is exerted   become     gradually exhausted, so that every aug
mentation of density produces a diminished effect.
   In the  case   of olefiant  gas, for example,     a unit-measure TVth      of a
cubic inch in capacity being made use          of; for   a series of fifteen such
measures    the absorption was exactly proportional to the quantity              of
gas ; subsequently the ratio       of the  successive absorptions approached,
gradually to a ratio of equality.           The absorption produced by a
single measure of olefiant gas of the above volume moved the index
of the galvanometer through          an angle   of 2-2  degrees, the tension     pf
the gas being only -n-Jirci^ 0i" an atmosphere.
   In the case of vapours, the most energetic              is that of sulphuric
ether  ; the least energetic      is that of bisulphide       of carbon.     Com
paring small volumes at equal tensions, the absorptive energy                    of
sulphuric ether vapour is ten times that of olefiant gas, and ten
thousand times that of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, or atmospheric air.
   On a fair November       day the aqueous        vapour in the atmosphere
produced fifteen times the absorption of the true air of the atmo
sphere.     It is on rays emanating from a source          of comparatively low
temperature that this great absorptive energy is exerted             ;   hence the
aqueous vapour      of the atmosphere must         act powerfully in intercept
ing terrestrial radiation    ; its changes in quantity would produce cor
responding changes of climate.            Subsequent researches must decide
whether this vera causa is competent to account for the climatal
changes which geologic researches reveal.
   Oxygen obtained from the electrolysis of water exerted four times
the absorptive energy of the same substance when caused to pass
through iodide of potassium ; the greater action being due to the
presence   of ozone.
   The radiative power of        gases was examined by causing them to
pass over a heated sphere       of  metal,   and  ascend in a column in front
of the thermo-electric pile       ;  various precautions were taken, which
are  fully described in the memoir. It was found that the order of
radiation was exactly that of absorption ; that any atom or molecule
which is capable of accepting motion from agitated ether, is capable.

                                                   103
 in precisely the same degree,                     of imparting        motion to still ether.
 Films of      gas on surfaces             of polished metal          are shown to act like
 coats   of varnish.
     The author        has appended            a  theoretic chapter to his memoir, in
 which he investigates            the physical connexion of radiation, absorption,
 and conduction.              In the foregoing experiments                 we have dealt with
free    atoms      and molecules,           and thus fixed upon them individually
 the responsibility of the effects observed.                        The   effects are thus de
 tached from considerations of cohesion and aggregation which suggest
 themselves       in the case of liquids and solids.
      He points out that           the reciprocity        of absorption      and radiation is a
 necessary      mechanical consequence                 of the theory of      an ether.
      But why is      one molecule competent to stop or generate                         a  calorific
  flux so much more                powerfully         than another?          The experiments
 point    as  follows    : —The        elementary gases which have been examined
  all exhibit extremely feeble powers both                      of absorption and radiation
  in comparison with the compound ones.                             In   the    former case we
  have    oscillating      atoms,       in the latter oscillating           systems      of    atoms.
  Uniting the atomic theory with                    the conception      of  an ether,     it follows
  that the compound              molecule which furnishes points oVappui to the
  ether must be capable of accepting and generating motion in a far
  greater degree         than the single atom, which we may figure to our
  minds as an oscillating sphere.                     Thus oxygen       and hydrogen, which
  taken separately or mixed mechanically, produce                            a scarcely      sensible
  effect,    when united chemically to form oscillating systems,                                 as in
  aqueous      vapour,        produce a powerful              effect.     Thus      also    nitrogen
  and hydrogen, which,                 when separate or mixed, produce but little
  action, when combined to form ammonia, produce a great action.
  So   also    nitrogen and oxygen, which,                     as air, are feeble         absorbers
   and radiators, when united                    to   oscillating     systems,      as  in nitrous
  oxide,     are   very       powerful       in both       capacities.       Comparing           small
  yolumea       at   equal tensions,             the    action of nitrous          oxide is 250
  times that      of air    ;   a fact,    which perhaps furnishes a stronger pre
   sumption than any previously existing, that air is a mixture, and
   not a compound.             Carbonic oxide is about 100 times                   as  powerful as
   its constituent oxygen            ;   carbonic acid       1 50 times as powerful           ;  while
   olefiaut gas,      as   already remarked, is 1000 times                   as   powerful       as its
   constituent hydrogen.                  In the      case   of the hydrocarbon, vapours, L
                                                                                       i   2

where       the atomic groups attain                    a   higher degree of complexity, the
action is even greater than that of olefiant gas.
     The author         also    refers          to the experiments and observations                            of
Niepce, Angstrom,              Foucault           ;   but more especially to the admirable
researches      of Kirchhoff and Bunsen,                         as regards the influence               of the
period of oscillation on the rate of absorption.                                   He points out how
the grouping of atoms to systems in                              a   resisting medium must tend
to make their periods of oscillation longer, and thus bring them into
isochronism with the periods of the obscure radiations made use of
in the experiments.
     With regard         to conduction, the author would illustrate his views
by reference          to two substances — rock-salt and alum.                                  He   was once
surprised to observe the great length of time required by                                           a   heated
mass     of rock-salt     to cool       ;   but this was explained by the experiments
of Mr. Balfour Stewart, who                           shows that rock-salt is an exceedingly
feeble      radiator.     The meaning of this                        is,   that the molecules           of the
salt glide through              the ether with small loss of vis viva.                               But the
ease   of     motion which they are thus proved to enjoy must facilitate
their mutual collision.                     The motion of the molecules, instead of
being expended on the ether between them, and then communicated
in part to the ether external to the mass,                                 is   transferred freely from
particle to particle           ;   or, in other words,                 is   freely conducted.             This
il   priori conclusion             is   completely verified by the author's                             experi
ments, which          prove rock-salt to be an excellent conductor.                                       It   is
quite the reverse with alum.                            Mr. Balfour Stewart's experiments
prove    it    to be an excellent radiator, and the author's                                   experiments
show     it   to be an extremely bad                       conductor.           Thus   it   imparts with
case its motion to the ether,                         but finds difficulty in transferring                     it
from particle to particle.                      Its molecules          are, in fact, so constituted,
that when one of them approaches its neighbour,                                    a   swell   is   produced
in the intervening ether                ;   this motion           is   immediately communicated
to the ether outside, and               is      thus lost for the purposes of conduction.
The lateral      waste prevents                 the motion from penetrating the alum to
any great extent,              and hence              it    is   pronounced        a    bad     conductor.
These considerations are dwelt upon more                                    fully in the memoir of
which this       is   an abstract           ;   and they seem to reduce the phenomena
of absorption, radiation,                and conduction to the simplest mechanical
principles.

  " On Magnetic Storms and Earth-Currents."                 By Charles V.
    Walker, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.             Received Jan. 31, 1861.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author first refers to the movements of telegraph needles, due
 to causes external to the apparatus itself, which were noticed very
 soon after the first electric telegraphs were erected.       In illustration,
 he gives   some   extracts from his diary at various dates in the year
  1847;   and a copy  of  a General Order which he issued on the 25th
 of October in that   year, calling upon the telegraph clerks under his
 charge in the south-eastern district    of England    to take notes  of these
 phenomena, and forward them          to his office.   The telegraph in     use
 there then,  as well as now, is Cooke and Wheatstone's needle instru
 ment, having one or two vertical galvanometers.
    He makes some extracts from his ' Electric Telegraph Manipula
 tion,' published in 1850, showing that the impression expressed              in
 the extracts from his diary, of a connexion between auroral mani
 festations and the phenomena in question, was confirmed.             And    he
 refers  back to the published account of       ' The daily Observations of
 Magnetometers at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in the year
 1847/ and extracts from it the reports made of the behaviour of the
magnetometers     on the days cited, showing that they were very much
disturbed.
    The author    describes  the   time in question     as a period of great
disturbance;    so much so, that in the year 1848 he was constrained
to adopt a device by means      of which the telegraph communication
might be carried on,     notwithstanding the presence of these foreign
influences in the wires.      But his plans    were hardly matured and in
operation before the cause disappeared       ; the disturbances almost en
tirely ceased.    The  years 1847 and 1848 had been          periods of great
activity.    The year   1849 was a period almost      of inaction  ; and  this

                                        106
continued,    a   circumstance which, although           it caused     at the  time
some surprise, tended to withdraw attention from the question.
    A  paper by      Mr. W. H. Barlow is then referred             to,  which   was
read   before    the Royal    Society on May 25, 1848, and subsequently
                      '                                   '
published in the Philosophical         Transactions    ;    and in which a very
interesting set of observations are given, made at Derby in May 1 848,
upon various lines of telegraph centring in that city.                 The relative
bearing of the terminal stations, and not the route of the wires, is
   '
at the basis of these observations ; and it is considered that the
wires conveyed a portion of a terrestrial current of electricity, which
current appeared to travel between S. 28° W. and S. 75° W.
    The author goes on to state that, after a comparatively long lull,
with only here and there        a sign   of  moderate     activity, attention was
again called to these earth-currents about the year 1856 ; and more
definite instructions were issued         for observations to be made, and
returns sent in, which has led to a large accumulation of observations,
commencing early in 1857.            It  is not his purpose to discuss           the
mass    of observations, nor to extract from them the                dates of great
disturbance    ;  for this would only go to show the general               relation
between    earth -current, magnetic disturbance, and            aurora, which is
already well established.
   The most notable period of disturbance that               has occurred since
electric telegraphs have been in existence, was from August 27th to
September 6th, 1859.         It was recognized     in one or more of its modes
of manifestation, not only in Europe and America, but in Australia.
Notices of the phenomena, collected in all parts of the world, are
                                              '
given by Prof. Elias Loomis in the American                  Journal of Science
and   Arts,'  and occupy ninety-three                     Two articles in     ' Lea
                                              pages.
Archives des Sciences Physiques,' by Prof. De la Rive, are also referred
to.   Referring to the reports in question, it was evident to the author
that those who, like himself, had electric telegraphs under their con
trol, had, to a certain extent,        failed in their duty.        He had, it is
true, collected many observations,          but they had been neither dis
cussed nor published       ; and  M. De la Rive had to         express his regret
that the returns which reached him of this great storm gave him no
clue as to the direction of the currents ; and for lack of this informa
tion the conclusions to which he arrived admit of reconsideration.
 Mr. Walker, upon learning this, took           the  matter up more actively.

                                          107
 The south-eastern district, where           the  observations were made,         is
 shown by the Map which accompanies              this communication, and may
 be regarded   as  bounded     N. by    the Thames,    E. and S. by the British
 Channel, and W. by the other southern counties of England.                 Kent,
 Surrey, Sussex, and Berkshire        ,  are concerned in contributing to the
 observations.    Eighteen pairs of terminal stations have been selected           ;
 the eighteen    direct lines, drawn to connect each pair of stations,
make different angles with the magnetic meridian.                The view taken
by the author is that a flood or stream             of electricity, of indefinite
width, is drifting across the       country, and that portions of it appear
as derived currents in the telegraph wires, entering by the earth
connexion at one terminus, and leaving by like means at the other.
The derived current        enters  at the terminus      nearest to the point     of
the horizon from which the main current flows, and leaves at that
nearest the point toward which it flows.
    A Table is then    given  of the eighteen    pairs of stations, their names,
the angle their     joining line   makes    with the magnetic meridian,        the
direct distance     from station to station, and the distance by the wire
route.
 , The returns       made   of the August-September         storm of 1859 are
more meagre than usual, for reasons that are given ; and the author
explains, that on the very days when the clerks would be most valu
able as observers,      they are more occupied in their ordinary duties
from the presence of the disturbances, which harass them in their
work ; and On this account he expresses himself the more indebted
to those who have observed            so well at     such   times,   especially to
Messrs.   J.  Dyke, D. Malpas, and         T. Pulley.
    An extract is next given from the last Report of the Astronomer
Royal to the Board of Visitors, stating that he cannot extract
from the returns made by telegraph clerks an idea of the phases of
earth-currents, to make        them comparable with those of magnetic
storms.     Into   these views    Mr. Walker      enters ; and while pleading
guilty to not having contributed from his district any observations
to the Royal Observatory, he explains that it is because he had not
heretofore had the opportunity           of subjecting what     he had collected1
to anything     like a    fair discussion. But he quite          agrees with the
Astronomer Royal, in thinking that it may turn out to be desirable
that observations of earth-currents            should be made in a magnetic

                                          108
observatory, side by side with those of the magnetometers,                     on wires
specially erected      ; which wires,     as appears    from the sequel, need not
be  of any great length          ;  for the Margate-Ramsgate             group, three
miles in length, is found to         be very active, and      action has been found
on a length      of 972 yards.
   Reports are then given of the behaviour of the needles during the
August-September          storm of 1859, followed by            a  Table containing    a
series     of consecutive     observations    which the Ramsgate clerk made
from August 29th to September 2nd, and which show the duration
and changes of the currents, the general direction in which they were
moving, and their comparative values              ;  details which were wanting
to  M. De la Rive when          he wrote ou this storm.
   The author       adverts   to the remarkable manner in which the change
from     a  current in one direction to        a  current in another is brought
about, by no drift of anything            like a "circular        storm," nor by any
kind of axial rotation        ; and in contrast to the calm minutes in the
midst of an active period, he cites cases of activity, which are common
enough in periods otherwise calm.              He shows        also how the value     of
the derived current varies with the size of the wire.
   Passing from this more general view, he describes the arrangement
made for forming a more definite opinion              of  the value    of  the currents
collected, and how he proposed to turn to better account the next
storm-days, of which some good cases followed on August 8 to 12
inclusive, and on Sept. 7, 1860, which is the last storm-day that has'
occurred.        On the     days   in question    a  good series of observations
were made, the        results of which are given in Tables which accom
pany the communication.             These Tables are discussed, and the values
of the currents of either kind             are given in detail in degrees and         in
time   ;   and the means are deduced.             Before discussing the results,
the author takes occasion to call attention to the very active habit of
the Margate- Ramsgate line, and to the high value of the currents col
lected there, although, as before stated, its length is only three miles.
   On discussing the Tables, it            appears    that   1   current in 20 had     a
duration of less than half a minute.                 The proportion of currents
above      and   below 5 minutes' duration was            as   1  to 2*32.    Of  those
above 20 minutes and those             between 5 minutes and 20 minutes, the
proportion was as         1  to 3-8.     The   1 -minute     currents     are most in
number;        then, in order, the 2-min.,          3-min., 4-min.,        y-min.   and

                                           109
5-miu.      The observations, which        embraced     a  period of 50 hours 42
minutes, show very nearly an equal duration of                 N. and S. currents,
the difference     being 21i minutes in favour of          the S. currents.       The
mean duration       of N. currents    was 9*5   1 min.  ;  of S., 9-42 min.       The
proportion     of currents     exceeding    45° in value       to those    below 45°,
was as    1  to 6-49.    The    15° to 20° currents are most in number;
then follow,      in order, the 5° to 10°; then the 10° to 15°.                   The
mean value      of the N. currents     was 28°-01    ;  of  the S., 2G°-07.
     Mr. Walker then      refers to the opinion     of M. De la Rive, that the
S. currents are merely due to the secondary polarities                   acquired by
the earth-plates, and shows that it is not in accordance with the facts
here accumulated;        for, from the results given, it would be hard
to say that either the         N. or    the S. currents exceed          the other in
value ; and no one         thing could here be said of the N. currents,
which might not, with equal truth and equal force, be said of the S.
currents.                        •
     The remarks thus far      have reference     to a solitary telegraph group,
from which the general drift, but not the special direction of the
earth-currents, is gathered.           The action produced might            be equally
due to a     current running in     a  direction many degrees to the right or
 many degrees to the left        of the direct line joining        the two stations.
 In illustration of this,    a series  of diagrams have been prepared, in the
 first of which the lines of direction (referred to the magnetic meri
 dian) of all the telegraph groups are set off ; in others, the lines
 alone   on which observations were made              at a given time, are laid
 down.      In proportion     as the two boundary lines in any case make
 a greater angle with each other, the absolute            direction of the current
 is more nearly determined.           Cases   are given and discussed,         and the
 conclusions progressively arrived at, in order,            as  lines with a greater
 angle occur, to give the dimensions and position of the arc                of the ho
  rizon within which the resultant line of direction is situated. When
 observations are obtained from only one line, the resultant is known
 to be somewhere       in one half of the horizon           ;  but the place is not
 proximately defined.         Frequent observations were made on a pair              of
 lines making an angle with each other of 74°.                     This   reduced  the
 limit within which      the   resultant was to be sought to 106°.               Other
  observations   were   made on a pair      of lines making an angle of 136°,
  which reduced the limit to          42°. And finally, a table of observa
  tions is given, which were made upon a pair of lines making an angle

                                           110
    of  147°, which      reduces  the arc within which           the  resultant is to be
     sought to   31°;    and this is the closest       result that has yet come out
    from absolute observation.           This   r.rc is within the limits     of  each   of
    the larger arcs that come out from the previous observations,                  and   it
    extends from 46° to 77°       E. of the magnetic north.
        The currents in all the    cases cited were not confined to the          limiting
    lines, but were constantly found in one or more of the intermediate
    lines, and always in a direction consistent with the view taken.                    In
    the last case, where the arc is reduced to 3             1°,   and in most of the
    observations tabulated, the current in the limiting lines was so strong
    that the author felt himself fully justified in concluding that                 if  he
    had lines of telegraph beyond these limiting              lines, he should have
    found currents    :   he has assumed      10° as not likely to be beyond the
    range;    and this reduces      the arc to 11°; and knowing from expe
   rience in which      limiting line the current is apt to         be more active, he
   has   divided the arc of 1 1° into the proportion of             7° to  4° ;  and has
   set off a line, which may be taken to be a very close approximation
   to the direction       in which the currents move.              It  falls 63°   E. of
   magnetic N.     ; and by deducting from this 2          1 |°, the value taken for
   magnetic declination, the direction of the earth-currents, referred to
   the astronomical meridian, is 41|° E. of N., or N.E. within 3|°.
   When the currents change in direction, it becomes S.W. within 3]°.
   The    cases discussed     go back as far as          18f'7;    and there appears
   to have been the same general direction during that period.                  A N.W.
   and   S.E. direction for the resultant is not known.
       The author    discusses,  as well as he can from the few data before
   him,   A few  observations made in France and Switzerland.                 They are
   meagre    in detail, but confirm the impression, which would naturally
  arise, that some such general direction Will be found there.                   He  also

  refers back to    Mr. Barlow's paper, in which             an arc    of 47°   was ob
  tained, and within which the N.E. bearing                was situated, being 30°
  from one limit of the arc and            1 7°   from the other ; showing that
  from the year 1848        to the   present time no great change in azimuth
  has taken place.
      A  few   remarks follow in explanation of certain specialities and
  anomalies     in the behaviour of       some     of the lines in respect to their
  azimuths, and     on the relative conductive power of the various geolo
  gical strata concerned. And the author thinks it very probable that
  many of the currents, observed some thirty years ago in the metal

                                                 Ill
liferous veins in Cornwall,                may have been veritable earth-currents,
and may have been coincident with magnetic storms.
     Having determined the proximate direction of earth-currents,                                   Mr.
Walker referred           to the magnetometers                    of an observatory merely            as
magnets,       in order to discover whether the magnetic disturbances at a
given time were in accordance                      with the known reaction of electric
currents and magnets.                The Astronomer Royal,                   as   well as General
Sabine,       furnished     him with            the photograms            from Greenwich and
Kew respectively, which                  he required for making the comparisons.
He has selected some cases of earth-currents,                             and has set them out
in   curves, side by side with the Greenwich or                           Kew       curves, and has
found     a   sufficient amount of coincidence to confirm the conclusion
that arises,         and to encourage further                inquiries.       He     has laid down
the position which the declinometer and the horizontal-force                                        mag
netometer       would tend merely               as   magnets        to assume under the              in
fluence of currents moving in the assigned                           direction, and has given
some extracts          from the Greenwich observations in support of the
views he takes.
     The author        has made no attempt to trace the origin                      of the currents
in question.           He simply         takes them as he finds them, and endeavours
to arrange them in some degree of order                       ;   and he touches very lightly
upon terrestrial magnetism itself.                    He     considers      that,    " although      we
are considerably in the dark as to the forms                           of   force   in operation      to
make up the whole              of   the causes concerned in magnetic disturbance,
we are yet quite certain that the current                          form of force is at least in
part concerned."               And       he adds,          " We    can collect this force and
measure        it,   and deal with         it   independently.              We can        receive    the
results and record them photographically                             as   foreshadowed         by    the
Astronomer Royal, side by side with those of the magnetometers.
And doubtless should such combined results                             come at any future day
under discussion — and more so, should they pass into the hands of
General Sabine,          — method would
                           a                          be devised       of eliminating the value
due to these known causes,                  that     is,   due to earth-currents absolutely
collected, and thereby rendering                           the value      thus      corrected more
manageable;            and we might get one step nearer towards penetrating
into the more recondite causes of the earth's magnetism and its
variations."           And this cannot               be     accomplished          until   Mr. Airy's
suggestion,          of including        the earth-currents in the observations                     of   a
magnetic observatory,               is   realized.

    The following communications         were read     : —
 I. " On Terephthalic Acid          and its derivatives."           By Warren
        De la Rue, Ph.D., F.R.S. &c, and Hugo Muller,
        Ph.D., F.C.S.        Received February 7, 1861.
    Whilst pursuing our investigation of Burmese naphtha,              an abstract
 of which   we have already communicated to the Society, wc noticed,
 among the products of the action of nitric acid on certain liquid
 hydrocarbons contained in Rangoon tar, an acid of peculiar pro
 perties.    A  very  lengthened investigation of this acid and its de
 rivatives we are about bringing to a close       ;   but  as the   drawing up of
 this account will necessarily occupy         a considerable       time, we have
 thought it desirable    to send a short abstract        of  the chief results we
                                      its appearing in the ' Proceedings of
                                                                               '
 have obtained, with the view      of
 the Society.
    M. Caillot,    about fifteen    years    ago,   obtained     a   peculiar acid
 among the products of the action of dilute nitric acid on oil of tur
 pentine, to which he gave the name of Terephthalic              acid, on account
 of its generation from oil of turpentine and its isomerism with
phthalic acid.       M. Caillot's account of his new acid was so
 brief and incomplete, that, although we recognized               many points    of
resemblance     between   it and the acid we had obtained from Burmese
naphtha, we were compelled to repeat              his experiments on oil of
turpentine before we could fix with certainty the identity of the two
products.      In the    course    of  these   experiments,       in which    that
identity was fully established, we noticed some interesting features
in the compounds of the acid and the derivatives                 we discovered    ;
more especially the relation of terephthalic acid to the well-known
aromatic series, — a relation precisely analogous to that which suc
cinic acid bears to the fatty acids.         The    close relation which exists
between    terephthalic acid and benzoic acid is most strikingly mani
fested   in the great number of derivatives which             are obtained from
the former ; indeed,     nearly all of the most characteristic           benzoyl

                                        118
compounds have their analogues              amongst the        derivatives of tere-
phthalic acid.      Terephthalic acid being        a  bibasic acid, maintains its
character throughout its various transformations, and it is this fact
which claims particular interest.
   Terephthalic acid, as well       as its derivatives,    forms the first term of
a new series    of well-characterized      bodies,   and may,      as  such, be con
sidered the prototype     of  a great   number of compounds still unknown.
   Without dwelling        at present     on   the   tedious process         by which
terephthalic acid is produced, we may mention that it is obtainable
from various sources.         We    have, for instance,       found that it is in
variably formed, in     a  relatively small proportion, when toluylic               acid
is prepared from cymol         ; it is   also formed when cymol is treated
with fuming nitric acid for the purpose of preparing nitrotoluylic
acid.    It  is important to mention, that whether the cymol be pre
pared from oil of cumin or from camphor, the result is the same.
   Subsequently, we found that insolinic              acid, which was described
some years ago by Hofmann            as a new    acid of the formula         C8  H3 0*,
is in reality terephthalic       acid.     The formation of this acid from
oil of cumin or cuminic           aldehyde by the action of chromic acid
on these    substances,     turned out to be the most ready method of
preparing terephthalic        acid ; and    the principal      part of our experi
ments were      made with     terephthalic acid which           had been obtained
from oil of cumin by this process.
   Terephthalic      acid being isomeric with            phthalic     acid,    has   the
formula     CFFO'      (Carbon =12, Oxygen=16), as already known.
When pure, it forms a white opake powder ; but if thrown down
from a boiling dilute alkaline solution, it may be obtained in a
crystalline state.     When collected        on a filter,    these    crystals dry in
paper-like masses      of  a  silky lustre.     Terephthalic       acid is not per
ceptibly soluble in ether, chloroform, acetic acid, water, or the other
usual solvents.      Concentrated sulphuric          acid   dissolves    it to   a con
siderable   extent,   especially when       warm, without         the formation of
sulpho-terephthalic acid, and the acid separates                 unchanged on the
addition of water.        On heating, terephthalic          acid sublimes without
previously fusing.       The sublimate, which          is indistinctly      crystalline,
has the same composition and properties as the original                       acid, and
therefore, unlike other bibasic acids,           terephthalic       acid cannot be
converted into an anhydrite            by merely heating it.             Terephthalic

                                      114
acid exhibits a remarkable deportment with regard to its salts               ;  for
although bibasic, there appear to exist no double salts             ;  and    even
acid salts are only prepared with the greatest difficulty.
    The alkaline terephthalates are all very soluble in water, but are
insoluble in alcohol.      The potassium, sodium, and ammonium com
pounds can be obtained in well-crystallized            forms.    Calcium       and
barium salts are less soluble than the before-named, and may be ob
tained in small scaly crystals.          The copper salt is       a    pale   blue
crystalline powder.       The silver and the      lead   salt occur as curdy
precipitates when obtained by double decomposition.                   The com
pounds of terephthalic acid with the alcohol radicals possess a par
ticular interest, as they furnish the most direct proof of the bibasic
nature of the acid.      There exist neutral and acid compounds.               The
neutral ethers      are obtained    either by the action of chloride             of
terephthalyl on the alcohols, or by means of the iodide of the alco
hol radicals    and terephthalate   of silver or of potassium.
    The methyl-terephthalic ether,      C6 H4 (CHJ)«     0\  is the most cha
racteristic compound, and consequently may be used to detect the
existence    of terephthalic acid in the      presence    of other acids.        It
forms beautiful flat prismatic crystals several inches long, which fuse
at a temperature above 100° (Cent.), and sublime without decom
position.     It is readily soluble in warm alcohol, and slightly soluble
 in cold alcohol.
    The ethyl-terephthalic-ether      forms long prismatic crystals resem
bling urea, and is readily soluble in cold alcohol.
    The amyl-terephthalic-ether forms scaly crystals of pearly lustre,
is readily soluble in alcohol, and fuses in the temperature of the hand.
    Phenyl-terephthalic-ether,     a white crystalline    substance,     fuses   at
above 100°     C.
    The acid compounds         are generally   formed in small quantities,
along with the neutral ethers,         by the action of the iodide of the
alcohol radicals on terephthalate of silver.          They   are  well-defined
monobasic acids, and form crystallizable substances soluble in alcohol.
    Nitro-terephthalic    acid, C6 H' (NOa)     O4.   This acid is formed by
acting with a mixture of nitric       and fuming     sulphuric   acid on tere
phthalic acid. When crystallized from certain solvents, it forms well-
developed    prismatic crystals of a faint yellow colour.         From water,
it deposits in cauliflower-like aggregations.

                                          115
    Nitro-terephthalic      acid is readily soluble in warm alcohol and in
-warm water, and possesses the bibasic character                  of the terephthalic
acid in a much higher degree.                It  forms well-defined crystallizable
acid and neutral salts.        The     ethers    of this acid    are likewise crystal
lizable.    They differ, however, from            the terephthalic acid ethers by
their greater solubility in alcohol and their depressed fusing-point.
    Chloride of terephthalyl (C8 H4 0s Cla) is obtained, together with
oxychloride of phosphorus (hydrochloric acid being evolved), when
terephthalic acid is acted upon with pentachloride of phosphorus at a
temperature of 40° (Cent.).             Chloride of terephthalyl is a solid arid
beautifully     crystalline   substance,       without      odour   at   the ordinary
temperature, but evolving, when heated, a very pungent smell like
that of chJoride of benzoyl, which it resembles                  in all its reactions.
With the alcohols it forms terephthalic                   ethers, with    ammonia ail
amide, and with the organic bases compound amides.                       Terephthalyl-,
amide,    C8  Ha Na O3, can only be obtained by acting with chloride of
terephthalyl on ammonia         ; it is a white amorphous substance           insoluble
in all solvents.      Terephthalylamide,          when treated with fuming nitric
acid, yields      nitro-terephthalic       amide,     C8 H8    (NOa)     Na O1, which.
crystallizes in beautiful prisms.
    Terephthalamide        shows a remarkable resemblance               to benzamide
 when treated with substances capable               of abstracting     the elements   of
 water.     It loses two equivalents          of water (Ha O),      and is converted
 into terephthalylnitril,     C   H4 Na. This remarkable             substance   is best
 formed by theaction of anhydrous phosphoric acid on terephthalamide.
 It distils over in form of a liquid, which solidifies in the neck of the
retort.
    Terephthalylnitril is colourless            and   without     odour,    and   forms
 beautiful prismatic crystals.          It  is insoluble in water, readily soluble,
 in boiling alcohol, less soluble in cold alcohol, and insoluble in benzol.
 When      boiled with caustic alkalies, it is gradually                  decomposed,
 ammonia is given off, and terephthalic acid is reproduced.
    It  is obvious that terephthalylnitril,            like all similar substances,
 may be considered as a cyanogen              compound, which in this instance
 would be the cyanide of the bibasic radical phenylen, C° H4, which is
 not yet discovered.        If we    could succeed in obtaining phenylen, the;
 artificial production of terephthalic acid or an isomeric would probably
 be attended with little difficulty.

                                        116
    By acting       on  nitro-terephthalic    acid with      reducing     agents,   it
  undergoes     the same change as other nitro-compounds.              The product
 of this  reaction is the oxy-terephthalamic       acid, or the    analogue of the
 glycocoll of the formula      C H7   NO4.    This   new member       of the glyco-
 colls is a lemon-yellow substance,       crystallizing in thin prismatic, and
 sometimes       moss-like   forms.    It is very slightly soluble in cold
 water, alcohol, ether, and chloroform.          Like other      substances   of this
 kind, terephthal-glycocoll       combines   with bases as well as with acids.
 The    salts  formed with the bases are crystalline           ;  they are readily
 soluble in water and dilute alcohol, yielding            colourless solutions of
 most remarkable fluorescent properties, which have been investigated
 by Professor Stokes.
    The aqueous and alcoholic solution of the pure terephthalic glycocoll
 shows the same properties.           The compounds with acids crystallize
 well, and    if dissolved  in a large quantity of water decompose.             They
 do not possess the fluorescence       when in their acid solution.
    The ether-like compounds of oxy-terephthalamic acid are obtained
 by acting upon the corresponding ethers of the nitro-terephthalic
 acid with reducing agents.          The inethylic ether is a beautiful cry
 stalline substance, readily soluble in warm alcohol, but much less
 soluble in any of the solvents than nitro-terephthalate of methyl.
The ethylic ether crystallizes in large crystals with an appearance
 resembling those of nitrate of uranium.           The solutions of this ether
possess the fluorescent property in the highest               degree.    Oxy-tere-
phthalamate of methyl and ethyl combine with acids and form well-
defined     salts.   Oxy-terephthalamic      acid, as well as its ether, are
readily acted       upon by nitrous acid, this reaction giving           rise   to a
number of new derivatives, which vary in their nature according to
the condition in which the reaction takes place.
    M. Griess      has  lately made    us  acquainted with a new            class of
remarkable substances which are obtained by the action of nitrous
acid on n certain class     of nitrogenous bodies.       The   several derivatives
he obtained      by this reaction from oxy-benzamic acid have their repre
sentatives in the bibasic terephthalyl series, and are obtained with the
utmost facility.     On acting with nitrous acid upon an aqueous solution
of the oxy-terephthalamic acid instead of an alcoholic solution, as is
employed in Griess's reaction, this substance           is readily decomposed,
nitrogen is given off iu large quantities, and there gradually separates

                                         117
 a whitish substance      which is oxy-terephthalic      acid, C" H"    0'.     This
 acid is a substance    of great interest, and its preparation offering much
 less difficulty than the analogous oxy-acids of the aromatic series, it
 affords an opportunity of studying to a fuller extent the nature of this
 class of acids, especially as it may be expected that the history of this
 acid will throw some light on the law of polybasicity.                  Oxy-tere
 phthalic acid forms beautiful crystalline salts, which are less soluble
 than the corresponding terephthalates.           The neutral   ethers are  liquid.
    The chloride of oxy-terephthalyl        is likewise a liquid readily decom
 posed by water and alcohols.
 II. " Notes on      the Generative      Organs, and on the Formation of
       the  Egg in the Annulosa." — Part I. By John Lunnock,
       Esq., F.R.S.         Received February 5, 1861.
                                    (Abstract.)
    In the   present  paper    I have communicated some observations              on
the Myriapoda, on Petrobius,           and on certain Arachnida.           Among
the former     I have  examined    species belonging to the genera Glomeris,
lulus, Polydesmus, Lithobius,          Cryptops, Geophilus, and Arthrono-
malus.       Through the labours of Brandt,            Fabre, Newport,       Stein,
Treviranus,      and  other    eminent naturalists, we are tolerably well
acquainted with the anatomy              of the     generative    organs in      the
Myriapods      ; but these observers have occupied themselves          principally
with the arrangement and forms of the organs, and have not paid much
attention to the different stages of egg-development, nor to the rela
tion in which the young egg stands to the surrounding tissues.                 This
relation is indeed very curious, and seems to have been generally
misunderstood.        It  is well known that there are        in  the Myriapods
no long egg-tubes,       as  in most insects, but that each egg arises in a
separate follicle.    It was, however, natural to suppose that this follicle
held the same position with reference to the ovary as the very similar
egg-follicles of certain insects,       as, for instance,    of   Coccus.    This,
however, is by no means the case.              If  we compare the ovary and
egg-follicle of Coccus with the ovary and egg-follicle in Glomeris, wc
shall  see  that the egg-follicle is very much alike in both cases           :  the

 shape    of the follicle, the Purkinjean vesicle, and the vitelligenoua cells
 being very similar ; but whereas in Coccus and in all insects the egg-
 follicle projects from the ovary, in Glomeris and the other Myriapods,
 so far as my observations go, the follicle projects into the ovary.              If,
 therefore, we consider the ovary as consisting of an outer membrane
 and an inner epithelial layer, it would appear that while the egg in the
 Myriapods arises between these two layers, in the insects it originates
 on the inner side of both.
     This difference    appears to me to be very important, and, as          will be
 mentioned under the head of lulus, escaped the attention of our great
 anatomist Newport, whereby he was led to give an erroneous descrip
 tion of the ovary of that genus.          I have  chosen to compare Glomeris
 with   Coccus,   because    the vitelligenoua cells make the resemblance,
 and, at the same time, the difference between           these two genera more
 striking.     If we,   however, compare with them the ovary of Phalan-
 ffium, we shall    see  not only that the vitelligenous cells are absent, but
 that the egg-follicle differs equally from that of the insect on the one
 hand, and that of the Myriapod on the other.           The egg-follicle projects
/rwnthe      ovary as in Coccus, &c. ; but, on the other hand, the      Purkinjean
 vesicle   lies on the outer side     of the epithelial layer,     as in Glomeris,
 and in consequence       the egg-follicle, which in Coccus consists of both
 the ovarian membranes (so far as the epithelial layer can be called a
 membrane), and in Glomeris of the epithelial layer only, is in the
 Phalangidae, and perhaps all the Arachnida,               formed only by the
 outer membrane.         Consequently, while in the insects the mature ovum
 passes into the ovary through the neck           of the follicle, in Myriapods
 and   the Arachnida it bursts through the epithelial layer, in the former
 at its free, and in the latter at its attached end.
     If these  characteristics are found eventually to hold good through
 out the Myriapods         and  Arachnida,     the differences     thus shown to
 exist between these groups will be of great interest         ;  but it is too early
 to generalize on the subject with much confidence.             Moreover, it often
 happens that one or a few epithelial cells are attached in Arachnida
 to the inner side of the follicle-wall.        This happens, however (as far
 as my observations        go), without    any regularity, and the cells thus
 present fulfil perhaps no important function in the formation of the
 egg.     The Crustacea     appear to differ from the three preceding groups
 in the fact that their     eggs do not possess separate follicles.

  In the    more advanced       eggs   of Glomeris, the macula of Wagner is
double, one being much smaller than the other.
  The ovary of lulus         has been described by Newport ; the specimens
which he examined had, however,                  been submitted to the action                 of
spirits of wine, and were therefore altogether unsuitable for histolo
gical examination.      The egg-follicle did not contain any large vitelli-
genous    bodies like those of Glomeris, nor could I see in it a vitelline
vesicle like that     of Arthronomalus       ;    but it very generally contained,
when the yelk was beginning to darken,                  a    patch resembling that
which appears to result from the small vitelline vesicle of Lithobius.
In both    these genera the eggs in all stages          of   development           are mixed
together without any regular arrangement.                    The macula            appears to
be generally double, as         in Glomeris.         In the      genus         Polydesmus,
however, where, as in all Chilognaths,               the eggs are arranged on a
double stroma, situated at the lower side of the ovary, the smaller
eggs are on the central parts          of the stroma,       and the more developed
ones lie towards the sides.             In   appearance       the       ova offer     a great
contrast to those of lulus, and particularly of Glomeris, since the
margin of the yelk has all the appearance                    of being bounded by               a
distinct membrane,       though    I   am not convinced that this is really the
case.     I have   not yet made out in Polydesmus anything corresponding
to the    " patch "   of lulus.    The macula         appears to be always single.
It   often contains vacuoles.
     The yelk of mature       eggs consists,     — 1st, of   globules about            80900th
of                   ; 2ndly, of greenish bodies about \ fa 0th in
     an inch in diameter
diameter; and 3rdly, of a clear, more or less viscid substance.
By the month of October most of the females have laid their first
lot of eggs    ;   after which another set immediately begin to be deve
loped.     M. Fabre      does not appear          to have    seen the spermatozoa
of Polydesmus.    They are small, elliptical bodies about ^Vi^
of an inch in length, and containing a bright nucleus. M. Stein
appears    to be the only naturalist who has hitherto described                          them
from personal observation,         but he does not allude to the nucleus.
     In Lithobius,    Cryptops, Geophilus, and Arthronomalus,                        the eggs
form a single series     ;   large ones and small ones lie next to one another
without any arrangement.               In the youngest Purkinjean                  vesicles   of
Lithobius there       are about seven nuclei, each           a
                                                                 6\,   u-th   of an inch, or
thereabouts, in diameter.          As the    eggs increase       in sue       these maculae

 appear to subdivide, at any rate they become continually smaller and
 more       numerous.           This    is very       remarkable, nothing like it taking
 place in the other genera.                 When the egg has attained a certain size,
 but before it has begun to darken, a small vesicle, about one-third of
 the size     of the Purkinjean           vesicle,     may generally be seen in it.                    This
 vesicle is probably homologous with the vitelline vesicle of                                   Arthrono-
 mains, &c.             It   soon disappears,      and is replaced by a             " patch "       resem
 bling that of Iuhis*.                  The     eggs        of Cryptops        are       narrow.        The
 macula differs from that of Lithobius,                         and agrees rather with that of
 Glomeris, in consisting of two unequal separate                                bodies.             To the
description of the spermatophores given by                           M. Fabre,        I   have nothing
of importance            to add.     The    spermathectc           of the females examined by
me contained only filiform                  spermatozoa.            The form of            the      eggs   in
Arthronomalus is spherical.                   The      yolk-nucleus is very apparent, and
has at first all the appearance               of   a vesicle.       Globules gradually appear
in    it,   and   it   loses its distinct outline.
     The     development           of the   eggs in Geophilus             is   much like that of
Arthronomalus.                  The principal          peculiarity       observed          was      in the
structure of the Purkinjean                 vesicle, which appeared                 to consist      of two
different substances, one surrounding the other.                              The inner         substance
was generally produced in the form                     of peninsula
                                                            a                 at one or two places,
almost through the outer substance.                          This latter      was    of   more regular
outline, but sometimes                 partially followed the same outline.                          Occa
sionally even the macula was thus produced.                             It    appeared       to be that
the projecting parts gradually became pinched off from the main
portion, and thus formed certain irregularly rounded bodies, which
could in most eggs be indistinctly discerned in the homogeneous                                   yolk,
and were probably homologous with the vitelline vesicle                                   of Arthrono
malus.        A        somewhat      similar phenomenon has                   been        described by
Lcuckart          as   occurring in the eggs of Aphis                rosee.
     In   the Phalangidce       I   examined the genera Phalangium,                       Nemastoma,
Opilio, and Leiobumus, in all of which the process of egg-development
was       similar, and resembled             that already described                 as    occurring in
Polydesmus.              The structure of       the male generative              organs has, how
ever, been entirely misunderstood                     byall preceding writers.             Tulk states
 *    The number of labial           teeth, which      is   a   point generally used       as   a   specific
character,    varies in many individuals;          out of twenty-eight specimens                examined,
nine were unsymmetrical            in this respect.

 that the  " testes   are formed by a cluster       of elongated    . . . caecal tubes    ;"
 and this opinion has been generally adopted, though from the structure
 and contents     of   these tubes    it is evident     that they are rather to be
 regarded   as accessory      glands.     Leydig found among these tubes one
longer than the rest,        and described this, which is in fact the ductus
 cjaculatorius,   as  the true testis.      The true      testis, however, had been
misunderstood, but not overlooked.                 It is described by Treviranus,
Tulk, Leydig,      and others, and being present              only in the male sex,
was supposed      by all to be a portion of the generative             organs, though
they were not able to trace its connexion with the penis.                          It  is a
large V-shaped       tube, which lies transversely across the abdomen                   ; at
each end     it dwindles into        a very fine tube, which passes,             on each
side,  round the tracheal trunks              close   to   the spiracles, and         then
the two approaching one another, unite in the centre                 of   the body and
fall into the long winding ductus ejaculatorius.                 Thus it will     be seen
that the generative        organs of the male Phalangidaj               are formed on
exactly the same type         as those   of the females.
    In Chelifer   and Obisium the ovary is a simple tube, on each side
of which the egg-follicles are produced. In each specimen there are
two sets of eggs in very different stages of development, and it would
appear that thirty or forty come to maturity at once.                      In the early
part of the autumn        I found four or five     specimens,     with an egg-capsule
attached to the underside        of the abdomen. These egg-capsules, how
ever, only contained seventeen or eighteen              eggs.     Moreover, in these
specimens     I found neither      a testis  nor an ordinary ovary, but a large
body consisting of about thirty follicles opening into              a common        cavity,
and   full of oil-globules.       The   eggs in the egg-capsule        were in several
cases undergoing segmentation.
    The   males   of Chelifer      appear    to be about as numerous as                 the
females.     The   testis consists    of  a median     and two lateral tubes, which
are united together by three transverse                 branches.      It   is therefore
much like that of the true Scorpions.                The    spermatozoa      in Obisium
have a small head and a long tail, while those                  of Chelifer      arc oval
bodies.    These oval bodies may be immature forms only, but                      I  never
found any further stage of development                 in the spermatheca           of the
female.
    The ovary of Petrobius         consists   of  seven short egg-tubes        ;  each    of
which in September contained three eggs, with more or less darkened

                                               123
yelk, and about fifteen or twenty egg-germs                           in earlier   stages.     The
development of the eggs reminded me much of that which takes place
in the Orthoptera.
   It   appears to be a pretty well established fact that, at least in many
animals, the Purkinjean vesicle is a modified ovarian cell, round which
the yolk is deposited.            On the other hand, according to some eminent
naturalists, there are certain animals in which the ovarian cell becomes
the     egg,    and its nucleus           the Purkinjean         vesicle.      In this      case we
should have two distinct classes of eggs, the Purkinjean vesicle in one
of which would             be homologous with the whole egg in the other.                           I
have, however, given in my paper the reasons which induce me to doubt
whether these last observations                 are altogether correct.               But    even   if
we may admit that no essential                  difference           has as yet been proved to
exist in the eggs of animals, as far                 as   regards the relations existing
between the Purkinjean              vesicle and the original ovarian cell,                  it would
still   seem that       in the relations      between the former and the yelk, two
very different types of development must be recognized.
   In describing the so-called " winter-ova " of Lacinularia socialis,

Prof. Huxley           says   (Micr. Journal, vol. i. p. 14),                             observed
that all these authors consider the winter-ova or epbippial ova and the
ordinary ova to be essentially identical, only that the former have an
outer case.        The truth is that they          are essentially different structures.
The true        ova are single cells which have undergone a special develop
ment.          The ephippial       ova are aggregations               of cells (in fact, larger or
smaller portions, sometimes the whole of the ovary), which become
enveloped        in a shell, and simulate true ova."                       This aggregation of
several cells (one           of them putting on       the appearance and              fulfilling the
functions of a Purkinjean vesicle), and the whole becoming enveloped
in a shell,      is,   however, the ordinary and only method of egg-develop
ment in many lower animals.                    In the Trematoda and Cestoid worms,
and the greater number of the Turbellaria,                           the yolk and the Purkin
jean vesicle are formed in two separate organs.
      In Piscicola, according             to Leydig, the mature egg contains, besides
the Purkinjean             vesicle and the ordinary yolk,              a   number of nucleated
cells (Zeit.      f.   Wiss. Zool. 1849. part             1.   pi.    10. fig. 56).
      In the Mites      and Spiders, in Chelifer, Obisium, the Phalangidae, and,
so far     as  I   know, all the Arachnida, the egg arises from the meta
morphosis of           a   single cell.

                                        123
    On the other hand, we find that complex eggs alone are present in
vast numbers of insects,          namely, in all the Lepidoptera,       Diptera,
 Neuroptera (excluding         the Libellulidae  and   allied genera), Hyme-
noptera, Hemiptera,         Homoptera, and Coleoptera.          We   are as yet
ignorant of the mode of egg-development in the Thripsida and the
 Strepsiptera    ;  nor does it seem quite clear whether the development of
 the pseudovum in Aphis          can be referred   to the complex type.        It
 would, however,       appear from the statements     of Leydig, Huxley, and
 Leuckart,     that in the opinion of these three eminent naturalists the
 pseudovum is       a derivation of a single ovarian cell, and differs there
 fore in this respect from the ovum of the impregnated female.
     We know little     as yet about the early stages of egg-formation in
 the Crustacea, but it would appear          that the simple mode       prevails
 generally throughout this class, with the exception of the Daphnidae.
     As regards the Rotatoria, the so-called winter eggs have               been
 observed in Hydatina, Brachionus, and Notommata, as well                  as  in
 Laeinularia     ; and we may    probably conclude that in these and other
 allied genera the development of these eggs is on the same type                 ;
 while "summer          eggs" are formed from one cell.             Among the
 Myriapoda, the eggs of Lithobius, Cryptops, Geophilus, Arthrono-
 malus, Polydesmus, and lulus are simple, the vitelline vesicles
 occurring in some of them being probably homologous with the yolk
 nucleus of Spiders.
     Glomeris, however, offers apparently an exception to the rule so
 general among the Myriapods, as the large rounded bodies present in
 the egg-capsule are probably homologous with the vitelligenous cells
 of  insects.
     In excluding the ephippial        ova of Laeinularia from     the category
 of true   eggs,   Prof. Huxley    was influenced to a certain extent by the
 supposition that they are fertile without impregnation, and are there
fore   " not  ova at all in the proper sense, but peculiar buds."       Accord
 ing to Stein, however, the reverse           is probably the case, and the
 summer eggs are agamic, while the winter eggs require to be fertilized.
 This is   also in accordance     with the case of Daphnia.      In this  genus,
as in Rotatoria, the       "summer eggs" are agamic, but it has not yet
been    conclusively proved that the "winter eggs" of either require
impregnation.         However this may be, the development of the eggs
of  insects sufficiently proves      that eggs composed      of several  ovarian

                                       124
cells,  like  those   which are unicellular,     generally are incapable of
 development without impregnation.           But no one can deny the name
of true   eggs to the ova   of Butterflies, &c.   ;   and we cannot therefore
class   as  " false       " those which    arise from more than one cell.

Perhaps it would be better to distinguish           the two classes as
                                                                         " com
pound,"    and   " simple " or unicellular.    The   names we may adopt are,
however,    of  less importance than the establishment        of the fact that
 throughout the Annulosa there are two sorts of eggs, which are of an
essentially different structure, and cannot therefore, strictly speaking,
be regarded     as homologous with one another.

I. " Tables of      the Weights of the Human Body and the            Internal
       Organs in the Sane and Insane of both Sexes at various
       Ages."       By Robert Boyd, M.D., F.R.C.P., Physician to
       the County Somerset Lunatic Asylum.                 Communicated by
       Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.            Received February 7, 1861.
                                   (Abstract.)
    These Tables have been compiled from notes of 2086 examinations
made at St. Marylebone         Infirmary between      1839  and 1847, and      of
528 examinations in cases of insanity made           at the Somerset    Lunatic
Asylum,     between    1848   and the end      of December     1860,  compre
hending, in all, a period of twenty-one years.           The Tables   are sub
mitted with the hope that they may aid in forming a standard of
the weight of the human organs at different stages of life from
early infancy to old age.       The   cases are distributed   under eighteen
periods of life, and the Tables show the height and weight of the
body, and the weight of the encephalon and its several parts, the
right and left lung, the heart      and all the abdominal organs      ;   giving
the maximum, minimum and average in each period.                In the   second
series  of cases, namely those from the lunatic         asylum, the measure
ment of the head, and the weight of the spinal cord are also stated.

                                           125
 The assigned        causes    of  death    are given in the       margin, also the
 deviations in weight of the lungs, heart and liver, occasioned                       by
 disease.
    The following       general results may be deduced         from the first series
 of  cases, namely, those occurring among the Poor                 of the Parish of
 Marylebone.
    *With few exceptions the body and internal organs arrived at their
 full  size in both sexes between twenty and           thirty  years.      In children
 especially, the body was attenuated from disease                : for   example,    one
 scrofulous female child, aged three years, weighed only 8$ lbs., and
 the numbers about that age were insufficient to counterbalance the
 effect   of such   cases on the mean result, and form a standard               of com
parison for children of         the same age under more favourable circum
stances.       The    average weight       of the  males     was   greatest    at from
 70 to 80 years,         which is to be accounted           for by the large pro
portion      cut off at earlier periods by pulmonary                phthisis.       The
mean weight        of the  male brain was, at all periods, above that             of the
female,     which was the probable cause of the large number of still
born      male    infants    as   compared with        females,     51    to   32,   and
the necessity        of resorting to craniotomy in five instances of the
former only.         The highest average weight of the brain in both sexes
was from 14 to 20 years ; the next highest was in                    the males     from
30 to 40, and in the females             from 20 to 30 years        ;   but it will be
observed      that the cases were much fewer in number in these than
in other later periods.             The weight of the lungs            was so much,
and so frequently          increased    by disease,    that healthy        lungs were
exceptions: it therefore appeared advisable to introduce in the
margin their weights in various states, also the weights of the heart
and liver, which were subject to great variations.                    The "Thymus
gland," an organ which disappears with infancy, was                    so large in the
foetus in fourteen cases, that        it  appeared  to have formed         a  fatal im
pediment to respiration.             The abdominal         organs     were   generally
heavier in the male than in the female               ;    the spleen in both was
subject to considerable variations in size, and the mean weight of
the left kidney was generally found greater than that of the right.
    The    general    results obtained from      a  review of the second series
of  cases are stated by the author as follows           : —
    The    average     height of the adult male varied from 67'8 to 65

                                           126
 inches, of the female          from 63 '2 to 61     *6  inches;    while the mean
 weight of the former varied from              11 2" 12   to 91*5 lbs., aud of the
 latter from 95*2 to 76*9 lbs., showing            a preponderance of the insane
 male    of  6 lbs., and     of the   insane female    of  8 lbs., as compared     with
 the saue adults dying at the same period of life.
    The    average weight       of the right cerebral hemisphere varied in the
 males from 20'89 oz. to 18*97 oz., and in the females from 19*21 oz.
 to  1 7*20 oz.    ;  the left varied in the males from 21 -05 oz. to 18*62 oz.,
 and from 19*51 oz. to         1 7*39 oz. in the females.       It is a singular fact,
 confirmed by the examination of nearly 200 cases at St. Maryle-
 bone,    in which        the hemispheres were          weighed      separately,   that
 almost invariably the average weight of the left exceeded that of the
 right by at      least the eighth     of an ounce.      In the Med. Chir. Trans.
 vol. xxxix., several cases of inequalities of the cerebral hemispheres
 which came under my notice are given.                 The    average weight     of the
 cerebellum varied in the males from 5*42 oz. to 5*06 oz., aud from
 5 to 4*74 oz. in the females ; that          of  the pons     Varolii and medulla
 in the male from 1*15 oz. to 1*02 oz., and from 1*05 oz. to '95 oz. in
 the females; and that of the encephalon in males from 48*17 oz.
 to 43*87 oz., and in females from 44*55 oz. to 40*55 oz.               ; in the sane,
 at the same period         of life, the  average varied in the male from 48*2
 oz. to 45*34 oz., and in the female from 43*7 oz. to 39*77 oz.
    The   general      average weight     of the lungs is shown in the Table,
 and the exceptions in the margin.             The average weight of the heart
 did not reach its maximum until an advanced period of life.
    In the abdominal         organs nothing was observed differing essentially
 from those in Table No.           1.
 II. "    On the Electric Conducting Power of Copper and its
        Alloys." By A. Matthiessen, Ph.D. Received Feb. 14,
        1861.        Communicated by Professor W. Thomson, F.R.S.
    The     difference     in the numerical results obtained            by Prof.    W.
Thomson (Proceedings of Roy. Soc. 1859, x. p. 300), and those by
Dr. Holzmann and myself (Phil. Trans. 1860), on the conducting
power of copper and its alloys, made it somewhat necessary to re
investigate the subject, in order to ascertain the cause of these dif
ferences.       For this purpose Professor Thomson kindly placed at my

disposal all his alloys             ;  and in the following Table                     I will   give     the
results of the analyses and redeterminations of the conducting power
of his     set.    The wires          were in some cases very faulty, so that                        I was
obliged to draw them finer                  ;  others drew       so     badly, that the values ob
tained could not very well agree with those already published.                                        After
having measured their resistances,                      I  sent them back to              Prof. Thom
son for redetermination.                      Table  I.     gives       the    results so obtained,
taking the alloy containing 99-75 copper and -25 silver=100                                          ; and

 so small that they could not be checked by repetition                              ;   they, how
 ever, approach very closely to the composition                          assigned      to them by
 Messrs. Johnson and Matthey                   (with the exception of the suboxide).
 The traces of iron will be due to the draw-plates.                          I  will now make
 a few remarks on the above results.
     I. That     copper containing 0-25 per cent. of silver conducts better
than that with 0 - 13 per cent., may be explained by assuming that the
 first contains less suboxide than the second                      ;   for it is very possible
 that copper containing silver will not absorb suboxide so readily as
 the purer metal.          It  must also be borne in mind that the copper em
ployed for making these alloys was in all probability simply electro
type copper (not fused), and that the suboxide therefore was ab
sorbed during the process of fusing the two metals together.                                     This
assumption explains how it is that the alloys contain almost the same
amount of impurity as was originally alloyed with the copper                                    ; for
had the copper employed contained suboxide, we should have ex
pected to have found greater differences                    in the cases of the tin, lead,
and zinc alloys, as some portion                of those      metals would have been ox
idized at the expense of part of the suboxide of copper, and escaped
as oxide to the surface            of the melted metal.

                                              129
    II.  That copper containing             0*25     per cent. tin conducts better
than that containing            0-13 per cent., may also             be   explained   by
assuming that they absorbed different amounts of suboxide during
 the process of fusion       ;  for although         tin, in presence of suboxide of
 copper, would        be   oxidized,      yet copper retains          the  suboxide   so
 tenaciously, that portions will always remain with the copper.
    III.    The fact that      the conducting          powers of the alloy of copper
 containing 0*25 per cent. lead approaches the nearest of those which
 I analysed     to that  of pure copper, is, in my opinion, a proof that the
 alloy is probably a mechanical mixture of copper, traces of lead, and
 enough suboxide to allow its being drawn into wire, and not a solution
 of  lead in copper ; otherwise a much lower conducting power ought to
 have been found       ; for, according to my own experiments, it requires
 twice   as   many volumes per cent. of lead              as  of tin to reduce   (within
 certain limits) the conducting power of a metal (bismuth, silver,
 &c., and copper, for it belongs to the same class) to the same value :
 thus, to reduce the conducting power of silver to 67, it would require
 0*9 volume per cent.          of  lead, or about 0*4 volume per cent.           of tin ;
 to reduce     it  to 47' 6,  it would require 1*4 volume per cent. of lead,
 or 0-7 volume per cent. of tin, &c. (Phil. Trans. 1860).                     Dr. Holz-
 mann and myself repeatedly tried to draw pure copper alloyed with
 0*25   of  lead without     success    ;  the alloy was perfectly rotten, which
 also seems to indicate a mechanical mixture.
    IV. It    is curious that the zinc alloys contained no suboxide.
    The     reason, therefore,     of the      difference    in our results is simply
 that Messrs. Johnson and Matthey did not use those precautions in
fusing their copper and its alloys which are necessary to ensure good
results   ;  for had they taken those precautions to prevent the absorp
tion of oxygen by their copper and its alloys which Dr. Holzmann
and myself did, and which              are   fully described in our paper on the
 subject (Phil. Trans. 1860), the lead-copper alloys which they sup
plied to Prof. Thomson would not have been superior in conductive
quality to the unalloyed            electrotype copper         ;  and   he would   have
been    led to the same conclusion as that which Dr. Holzmann and
myself arrived at, namely, that there are no alloys                   of  copper which
conduct better than pure copper              .    Professor Thomson, in his paper,
states that    it is his opinion that the differences              he observed in the
conducting powers of his alloys must depend                      upon very small ad

                                           130
mixtures of probably non-metallic                impurities.         This conclusion is
completely borne out by the above, as well as by the investigation
carried out by myself in conjunction with Dr. Holzmann.
  The results obtained by Prof. Thomson show the marked influ
ence of traces of foreign metals on the conducting power of pure
copper, —which         is fully confirmed in our             research       on   the same
subject.     Professor    Thomson's        best-conducting           alloy has a much
higher conducting power than those found by some experimenters
for electrotype copper      ;   but it must be remembered               that in all pro
bability    the copper had been previously fused, and therefore con
tained suboxide of copper.          The fact that electrotype copper may               be
drawn without having            been previously fused          is,
                                                                I     believe,   generally
not known    ;     Professor Buff of Giessen first drew my attention to it,
and stated that he always obtained high values for the conducting
powers of electrotype copper when drawn without                        previous fusion.
I   can confirm this statement,      having tested       a   great many specimens,
and found the values in all cases nearly the same.

 I. "     On the Porism of the in-and-circumscribed                       Polygon."
         By Arthur Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.                        Received February

     The Porism referred         to is as follows,     viz. two      conies  may be
 so related to each other, that a polygon may be inscribed in the one,
 and circumscribed about the other conic, in such manner that any
 point whatever of the circumscribing conic may be taken for                 a vertex
 of the polygon.         I gave in the year 1853,       in the Philosophical Ma
 gazine *, a general formula for the relation between               the two conies,
 viz.  if U=0     is the equation of the inscribed conic,         V=0     that of the
 circumscribed       conic,   and    if  disc   (U+£V),        where    £  is an ar
 bitrary multiplier,      denotes the discriminant         of U + £ V in regard    to

memoir          is    to direct attention to                     a     curious analytical theorem, which                     is
an easy         a)   priori    consequence                 of     the Porism, and to obtain the relations
for the several polygons up to the enneagon, in                                               a   new and simple form,
which puts in evidence                           d       posteriori for these                     cases, the analytical
theorem just referred to.                                  The analytical theorem                          rests upon the
following             considerations            :  — the relation for                     a   hexagon ought to in
clude that for             a   triangle         ;        in fact       a   triangle with its sides in order
twice over            isa    form of hexagon                    ;      the condition for an octagon should

may be remarked that the last-mentioned                                    equation has the geome
trical signification that the relation for                         a   dodecagon            is   the aggregate
of    the relations for           a    proper dodecagon,                a   proper hexagon,                        a    qua
drangle, and        a    triangle        ;   that   is,   the relation for        a    dodecagon               implies
one or other         of the last-mentioned relations.                             The relations for                         the

To    do this, the discriminant                  is   represented,          not as above in terms of
the constants            /3,   y,   S,   but in     a   somewhat different form, by means
of    the constants          6,   c,   d,   the last two whereof are such that                           c=0           is   the

      The functions [3], [4], &c.                     have been spoken                 of    as prime              ;    they
 are so, in fact, as far they are calculated                           ;   and that they are so in ge

 sides, there is but one form                 of relation        :    if,   for instance, in the equation
 [12]=0, which           is   the condition for             a    proper dodecagon,                       the function
 [12] could be decomposed into rational factors                                      ;    then equating each
 of these factors to zero, we should have so many distinct forms of re
 lation for    a   proper dodecagon.              I         believe          that the assumption and
 reasoning are valid          ;   but without entering further into this,                                  I      take     it
 for granted that in the general case the functions [3], [4], &c. are in
 fact prime.        But the coefficients                /3,   y,     2,    or   b,   e,   d,   instead of being
 so many independent arbitrary quantities,                                      may be given as rational
 functions of other quantities (if, for instance, the two conies are cir
 cles, radii   R,   r,   and distance           between              the centres a, then                  /3,   y,

 be functions       of R, r,        a):     and   it   is   in   a     case      of this kind quite con
ceivable   that the functions [3], [4], &c, considered                                              as functions           of
these new elements,               should cease to be prime functions.                                     In     fact,     in
the case just referred to of the two circles (the original case of the
Porism as considered by Fuss), the functions [4], [6], &c, which
correspond to       a    polygon of an even number of sides, appear to be each
of them    decomposable              into two factors                 :     the memoir contains some
remarks tending to show a                     priori that in the                     case in question this
decomposition takes                place.     I    was led to examine                          the point             by   the
elegant formulae          obtained in an essentially different manner by                                                  M.

   Considering the equation of the fifth order, or quintic equation,

coefficient whereof is determined by an equation of the sixth order                                                                   ;
and moreover the other coefficients                                  can be all         of them rationally                       ex
pressed  in terms of any                          one coefficient assumed                    to be known                     ;   the
solution thus depends on                         a single equation                of the sixth order.                            In
particular the last                coefficient,             or (fu,         ./wa ./w4)', is determined
by an equation          of the sixth order                       ;   and not only so, but its fifth root,
or   fw ./i,- .fm'    (which is a rational function of the roots, and
                            ../,<','
is the function called by Mr. Cockle the Resolvent Product), is also
determined by an equation of the sixth order                                        :    this equation may be
called     the Resolvent- Product Equation. But the recent researches
of Mr. Cockle       and Mr. Harley* show that the solution of an equa
tion of the fifth order may be made to depend on an equation of the
sixth order, originating                         indeed in, and closely                   connected                 with, the
resolvent-product                equation, but of                    a   far more simple form                       :    this is
the auxiliary equation referred to in the title of the present memoir.
The connexion                of the two                equations,         and the considerations which
led to the new one, are pointed out in the memoir                                                 ;   but       I   will here
state      synthetically               the construction                     of the           auxiliary              equation.

where C,    E, G   are rational and integral functions       of the  coefficients
of the given equation, heing in fact seminvariants, and F              is a mere
numerical multiple of the square root of the discriminant.
   The   roots  of  the given quintic equation are each        of them rational
functions of the roots of the auxiliary equation, so that the theory of
the solution of an equation of the fifth order appears               to be now
carried to its extreme limit.        We  have in fact
                      +it.+Mi+M5=(«X*i< 0*.

where    (*Xxi, i)'•         are        va^ues, corresponding to the roots
<p„  &c. of the given equation, of a given quartic function.           And   com
bining these equations respectively with the quintic equations satisfied
by the roots        &c. respectively, it follows that, conversely, the roots
xv xv &c.    are rational functions   of the combinations 0,0e +           + <p3<ps,
0i?a+&0.i+&&»          &c- respectively, of the roots of the auxiliary
equation.
    It is proper to notice that, combining together in every possible
manner the 6 roots of the auxiliary equation, there are in all           15  com
binations of the form ^,a+^304+^508-              But the combinations         oc
curring in the above-mentioned equations are              a completely determi
nate set   of five combinations    :  the equation of the order 15, whereon
 depend the combinations       <pi<pa+<p3<Pt+ <ps<p,, is not rationally   decom
 posable into three quintic equations, but only into a quintic equation
 having for its roots the above-mentioned five combinations, and into
 an equation    of the tenth order, having for its roots the other ten
 combinations, and being an irreducible equation.              Suppose that the
 auxiliary equation and its roots are known             ; the direct method      of
 ascertaining what combinations of roots correspond to the roots of
 the quintic equation would be to find the rational quintic factor of
 the equation of the fifth order, and observe what combinations of the
 roots of the auxiliary equation are also roots of this quintic factor.
 The direct calculation of       the auxiliary equation by the method             of
 symmetric functions would,        I  imagine, be very laborious.        But    the

                                                    137
coefficients are seminvariants, and the process explained in my memoir
on the Equation             of Differences     was therefore applicable, and by means
of    it,   the equation      is   readily obtained.          The auxiliary equation                gives
rise to      a    corresponding covariant equation, which                            is   given at the
conclusion of the memoir.

     In the autumn of              1859, whilst accompanying                     Dr. Tyndall       to the
summit of Mont Blanc,               I     undertook at his request some experiments
on the effect of atmospheric pressure upon the amount of combustible
matter consumed                by   a   common candle.            I      found that, taking the
average          of   five experiments,        a    stearin candle diminished in weight
9    *4   grammes        when burnt for an hour at Chamounix                       ;   whilst its igni
tion for the same length of time on the summit of Mont Blanc,
perfectly protected from currents of air, reduced its weight to the
extent of 9-2 grammes.
     This        close   approximation         to    the former number under such                         a
widely different atmospheric pressure,                            goes far to prove that the
rate of combustion            is    entirely independent of the density of the at
mosphere.
      It    is   impossible to repeat          these      determinations in a satisfactory
manner with artificially rarefied atmospheres,                               owing to the heating
of        the apparatus which             surrounds the candle,                and     the consequent
guttering and unequal combustion of the latter                               ;   but an experiment
in which          a   sperm candle was burnt              first    in   air under         a   pressure    of
                                      -
287 inches of mercury, and then in air at                           9        inches pressure, other
conditions being             as    similar as possible in the two experiments, the
consumption of sperm was found to be, —
            At   pressure    of 28-7 inches         7*85 gnus,          of   sperm per hour,
                                    9*0    „        9-10
thus confirming, for higher degrees of rarefaction, the result pre
viously obtained.
      In burning          the candles       upon the summit of Mont Blanc,                        I      was
much struck by the comparatively small amount of light which they
emitted.          .   The lower      and    blue portion of the flame,                    which under

                                         138
ordinary circumstances scarcely rises to within            a  quarter of an inch
of  the apex  of the wick,   now extended       to the height of    |th of an inch
above   the cotton, thus greatly reducing the size of the luminous
portion of the flame.
    On returning to England,         I  repeated   the experiments under cir
cumstances    which enabled me to ascertain, by photometrical measure
ments, the extent      of this  loss    of illuminating    effect  in rarefied air.
The results prove that     a great reduction in the illuminating           power of
a candle ensues when the candle           is transferred from air at the ordi
nary atmospheric pressure to rarefied air.          It was, however, found that,
owing to the circumstances mentioned above, no satisfactory quan
titative experiments could      be made      with candles in artificially rarefied
air, and recourse was therefore had to coal-gas, which, although also
liable tocertain disturbing influences, yet yielded results, during an ex
tensive series  of experiments, exhibiting sufficient uniformity to render
them worthy of confidence.        The gas was in all cases passed through a
governor   to  secure uniformity of pressure in the delivery tubes.                 A
single jet of gas was employed as the standard of comparison, and
this was fixed at one end of       a   Bunsen's photometer, whilst the flame
to be submitted to various pressures,          and which     I will call the    expe
rimental flame, was placed at the other.               The experimental flame
was made     to burn a uniform          amount of gas, viz. 0'65 cubic foot
per hour in all the experiments.
   The products of combustion             were   completely removed,        so that
the experimental flame,        which      burnt with perfect steadiness, was
always surrounded with pure air, the supply of which was, however,
so regulated as to secure      a maximum         of illuminating     effect in each
observation.
   In all the following    series  of experiments, the illuminating power
given under each pressure         is the average       of twenty observations,
which    accord   with   each   other very closely.         In  each    serie?,   the
maximum illuminating         effect,   that is the light given by the expe
rimental flame when burning under the full atmospheric pressure,
is assumed to be 100.       The following is      a  summary of the results : —

    These numbers indicate that even the natural oscillations of atmo
 spheric pressure must produce            a considerable variation in the amount
 of light emitted by         gas-flames,     and it was therefore important          to
 determine, by a special series of observations,                this variation in lu
 minosity    within, or nearly within,            the usual fluctuations        of the
 barometrieal      column.       In order to attain greater delicacy in the
 pressure readings in these experiments,                 a water-gauge      was   used,
 but its indications       are   translated into       inches of mercury in         the
 following tabulated results, each of which represents,                as before,   the
 average   of twenty     observations.

    It is thus evident that the combustion of an amount of gas which
would give a light equal to 100 candles when the barometer stands
at 31 inches,      would give a light equal to only 84*4 candles                 if the
barometer      fell to 28 inches.

                                        uo
     An inspection of all    the above    results shows that the rarefaction
  of air, from atmospheric     pressure    downwards, produces a uniformly
*
  diminishing illuminating power until the pressure is reduced to about
  14 inches    of mercury, below which the diminution of light proceeds
  at a less  rapid rate.    The above determinations give approximately
  5*1   per cent.  as  the mean reduction of light for each diminution          of
  1   inch of mercurial     pressure   down to     14   inches.     The following
  Table    exhibits    the actually   observed    light,   compared with      that

   This investigation is in correction and extension of Plucker's
theory of transversals (System der Geometrie, § 3, art. 64), and is
                                                                       *

origin, and displayed in all the examples he has given, where the roots
 of /=0   are scalar.  This result is then applied to a simple case where
 some   of the roots of f=0 are clinant, and a result obtained in ac
cordance   with other considerations.
II. "A     Seventh Memoir on Quantics."                By Arthur Cayley,
       Esq., F.R.S.      Received February 28, 1861.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The present memoir relates chiefly      to the theory   of ternary cubics.
 Since the date of my Third Memoir          on  Quantics, M. Aronhold has
published the continuation of his researches on ternary cubics, in the
memoir "Theorie der homogenen              Functionen    dritten   Grades von
 drei Veranderlichen,"     Crelle, t. lv. pp. 97-191 (1858).          He there
 considers two derived contravariants, linear functions of the funda
 mental ones, and which occupy therein the position which the funda

                                                      143
mental contravariants            PU, QU            do in my        third memoir           ;   in the nota
tion of the present memoir these derived contravariants are
                             YU=3T.                     PU-4S.QU,
                             ZU = -48S,.PU+T.QU;
and for the canonical form x»+ya + za + 6lxyz, they acquire respect
ively the factor    (l+8f)s,             viz. in this case
              YU=(l + 8r)'|i                                                           3bt\
              zu= ( i + 8iy {(i+2P) (p                               + a .) +     1   m-ni } ,
The derived contravariants                   have with the covariants                  U, HU,       even a
more intimate connexion than have the contravariants                                    PU, QU       ;   and
the advantage       of the employment                       of YU, ZU fully             appears by       M.
Aronhold's memoir.
     But the conclusion          is,   not that the contravariants                PU, QU         are to be
rejected, but that the system                is   to be completed        by   the addition thereto
of two derived covariants, linear functions of U,                             HU      ;    these derived
covariants, suggested to me by                         M. Aronhold's memoir,                  are in the
present memoir called CU,                    DU    ;    their values are
                             CU=-T                .   U + 24S.HU

and for the canonical form a?                  +      ya+za   +    6lxyz, they acquire respect
ively, not indeed       (1   +  SP     )a,   but the simple power           (1    +    8P),    as afactor,
viz. in this case
       CU=(l+8f) |(—l+4f) (x?+y'+z')                                    +                 18teyt\

it   was   in fact by   means          of this condition             as to the factor           (l+SP),
that the foregoing expressions                    for CU,      DU    were obtained.
     The formulae of my third memoir and                            those   of M. Aronhold               are
by this means       brought into harmony and made                               parts of        a   whole   ;

embrace the former results, and the new ones which relate to the co-
variants    CU, DU      ;    and they are what                is   most important in the pre

sent memoir.             I   have, however,          excluded from the Tables, and                I   do
not in the memoir consider (otherwise than incidentally) the covariant
of the sixth order 9U, or               the contravariant (reciprocant)                FU.
     I   have given in the memoir a comparison                    of my notation with that
of M. Aronhold.                A short part of the memoir               relates to the binary
cubic and the binary quartic, viz. each of these qualities has a cova
riant of its own order, forming with it an intermediate aU+/3W, the
covariants whereof contain quantics in (a, /3), the coefficients                            of which
are invariants         of    the original quantic.          The   formulae which relate to
these cases are in fact given in my                   Fifth Memoir, but they           are repro
duced here in order to show the relations between                             the quantics in
(n, P) contained in the formulae.     As regards the binary quartic,
these results are required for the discussion of the like question in
regard to the ternary cubic, viz. that of finding the relations between
the different quantics in (a,                 /3)   contained in the formulae relating to
the ternary cubic.              Some     of    these    relations have been obtained by
M. Hermite          in   the memoir " Sur             les formes cubiques     a   trois inde'ter-
minces," Liouville,           t.   iii. pp. 37-40 (1858), and in that             "   Sur   la   Reso
lution des equation du quatrieme degre," Comptes Rendus,                                    t.    xlvi.
p. 715 (1858), and              by   M. Aronhold in his memoir already referred
to   ;   and in particular     I     reproduce and demonstrate             some   of the results
in the last mentioned memoir of M. Hermite.                             But the relations             in
question are in the present memoir exhibited in                        a   more complete           and
systematic form.

          Edward Sabinb, R.A., Treas. and V.P.R.S.                                      Received
          March     7,      1861.
 I       propose this communication to bring together and discuss four
                    in
determinations at different epochs, in which   have myself been either
                                                              I
directly or indirectly concerned, which have had expressly in view the
object which forms the title of the paper.
  Epoch of 1821. — The experiments on this occasion were made in
apart of the Regent's Park, then occupied as the nursery garden of
Mr. Jenkins        :     an unexceptionable locality              in   all respects,        and       far

                                         145
 distant at that time from buildings             or iron implements, railing, or
pipes.    The experiments,         ten in number, were made on six different
days, between the 3rd and 10th of August 1821 ; and all between
8 a.m. and 4 p.m. The circle employed was 11£ inches in diameter,
made   by Nairne,       a celebrated   artist in his day for instruments of this
description    :   the needle was made by Dollond            on Professor     Tobias
Meyer's principle, described in the Gottingen Transactions for 1814.
The size of the small spheres, or their distance from the needle, was
varied  in the different experiments,         so as to bring different parts    of the
axle to  rest    on the agate planes.        The mean of the ten experiments
was 70°   02,-9     N., corresponding     to the epoch 1821.65 : the extremes
being 70° 00'-      1  and 70° 05'*9.      The whole of the experiments were
made   by myself, and        are detailed in a paper in the        Phil. Trans. for
1822,   Art.    1.
   Epoch of 1838. — The experiments on this                occasion  were made on
different days in 1837 and 1838, in the course of the magnetic survey
of Great Britain, by Messrs. Robert Were Fox and John Phillips,
Captain (since Admiral) Sir James Clark Ross, Captain Edward
Johnson of the Royal Navy, and myself. The instruments employed
were those of Robinson, Gambey, and Jordan : the particulars are re
 corded in the 8th volume of the Reports of the British Association for
 the Advancement of Science (1839), Table 10, p. 64. The localities in
 which the experiments were            made were — I.      The   same spot     in the

 Separate determinations were made on             13 days between    May  30, 1837,
 and December 10, 1838, the mean epoch being 1838.3, and the mean
 dip 69°   1 7''3   N.   The   extremes    of all the  observers and   of all the in-
 struments were 69° 13'-3, and 69° 23'-9.
    Epoch of 1854. —The experiments on which this determination
 rests were made by the late Mr. John Welsh, of the Kew Observatory,
 and myself in August and September 1854, with two inclinometers
 made    by   Mr. Henry Barrow           (successor    to  Mr. Robinson), fitted
 according to the modern English construction with verniers and
 microscopes, and each having two needles.                 The localities selected
 were —  1. The station in the Regent's Park already named as that of
 the experiments in 1821, and of a part of those in 1838 ; and 2. the
 magnetic house        of the Kew Observatory.           The experiments had         a

                                          146
 double purpose, viz.       1,  to ascertain the difference,        if   any, in the
 dip in the Regent's Park and in the magnetic house at Kew                      ;  and
 2, to obtain a determination       of the dip in August        1854 which might
 be strictly comparable with the result obtained in          August 1821.         The
 experiments were made on five different days, and comprised eighteen
 determinations, ranging between 68° 29'*25 and 68° 33'-73                ; the mean
 being 68° 31'-13 N., corresponding to the epoch 1854.65.                         The
 mean     of eight determinations in the Regent's Park             was 68° 30,-55,
 and of ten determinations at Kew, 68° 31,-6           ;  the difference of either
 from the mean being 0'-52, which is within              the limits of probable
 error.      A detailed notice of       these experiments was         published      in
 1855    in an Editor's note       in p. 364 of the translation, edited by
 myself, of Arago's Meteorological Essays.
     Epoch    of 1859.5. — The dip corresponding          to  July   1, 1859    (now
 first discussed), is derived from 282 determinations                 made    in the
magnetic house at Kew on        121   different days between November 1857
 and December 1860 inclusive, chiefly by four observers,            viz.   Mr. John
Welsh, late Director of the Kew Observatory,               Mr. Balfour Stewart,
its present Director,      Mr. Chambers, Assistant in the Observatory,
and Dr. Bergsma, Director of the Magnetical                  and   Meteorological
Observatory of the Netherlands Government in Java.
    There were employed in these determinations, on different occasions,
twelve     circles and   twenty-four      needles,  all of the same form and
pattern    ;  the circles being   6  inches in diameter,      fitted with verniers
and microscopes,        and the needles       3| inches in length      ;  they were
all    made     by   Mr. Henry Barrow.              Every    determination        was
complete in the eight different positions of the circle and needle, as
described in Appendix 2 of the Article "Terrestrial Magnetism" in
the 3rd edition of the ' Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry.' The
individual results are shown in the subjoined Tables, whereof Table                 I.
contains 115 determinations comprised between November 1857 and
December 1858; Table          II.  96 determinations between          January and
December 1859        ; and Table    III.   71  determinations between January
and December 1860.          The results in       each year are reduced to the
1st   of July in   the same year, employing the proportional parts             of  an
annual secular change of — 2'*6       :  those which were obtained in the four
winter months, November, December, January, and February, have
also received a correction of — 0'-8, and those obtained in the summer

                                           147
 months, May, June,           July, and August,        a correction    of +0',8 in
 compensation for annual variation, agreeably to an investigation con
 tained in the sequel.        The Tables exhibit in        every case the date, the
 particular     circle and needle employed, the            azimuths in which the
 observations      w ere made, the name      of the observer,     the observed dip,
 the reduction to      a common epoch, the correction for annual variation,
 and finally, the corrected result.
    The opportunity afforded at the Kew Observatory, of testing the
 degree of accordance which may be expected in the results of different
 instruments constructed on the plan which has been for several years
 past approved and adopted at          Kew,  has thus been profited by, and the
 conclusions appear such as to merit the consideration of those who
 are desirous     to possess reliable instruments.           Several of the circles
 are the property       of foreign governments or of individuals,            at whose
request   they were provided subject to a verification at Kew.                     The
 observations      here   recorded were for the most part made for the
purpose of such verifications, and were entered              as they were made in
the books of the Kew Observatory, from which they are now taken.
No observation        has been omitted.       The circles    were distinguished by
the numbers 20, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 36; and two
unnumbered, one known as the Kew Circle, the other an inclinometer
employed by Admiral Sir James Clark Ross in his recent magnetic
survey of a part of England.         No.  20 was made for Professor Hansteen
of Christiania,      and is now   in his possession    ;   23 is the circle used by
the late   Mr. Welsh in his          magnetic     survey of Scotland       ;   27 was
                                         1          '
supplied to the Austrian frigate           Novara     for her voyage of circum
navigation    ;   28 was made for the Russian Government ; 30 was used
by myself in the recent magnetic survey of England,                  and has been
since supplied to the Observatory at the           "Isle Jesus" near Montreal
in Canada;       31 was made for Padre Secchi            of the Collegio Romano,
and is now at Rome ; 32 was made                 for the Rev. Alfred Weld of
Stonyhurst College, and is now in the Observatory of that College ;
34 was supplied to the Government            of the United      States of America,
and is now in the possession of Dr. Alexander Dallas Bache, Superin
tendent of the Coast Survey          ;  Nos. 35 and 36 were made for the
Netherlands        Government, one for Utrecht,           and one for Java       ; the
"Kew Circle"          was in regular use for the monthly determinations             of
the Dip at Kew, from the commencement                 of those   observations     until

                                                                          148
         August       1859,               when it was exchanged for No. 33, which has subse
         quently been, and is now, in regular employment for that purpose.
             Besides the four principal observers already noticed,                                  a few          determina
         tions were made,                        as is    shown in the Tables, by         Mr. Valentine Magrath,
         Assistant in the Observatory, by Captain Haig of the Royal Artillery,
         practising at Kew preparatory to his employment on the Boundary
         Commission between                                the United         States and the    British            possessions
         on the West Coast   of North America, and by Lieut. Goodall of the
         Royal Engineers, who attended at Kew to practise the manipulation
         of magnetical instruments.

   Showing an excess of        1' 5  in the winter months above the summer
months.
   The annual variation        at   Kew,  as it may    be derived from the 282
determinations in Tables         I., II. and  III.,   does not differ materially
from this conclusion.         There are in these Tables 87 results obtained
in the four winter months of the different years,                   and     93 results
obtained in the four summer months of those years.                      If we  collect
into separate      means     the results in the winter months of 1857-58,
 1858-59, and 1859-60, numbering them (1), (3), and (5), — and into
separate means the results         in the summer months of 1858, 1859 and
 1860,  numbering them (2), (4), and (6), — and if we compare (1)
and   (3) with (2), (3) and (5) with (4), (2) and (4) with (3), and
(4) and (6) with (5), (by which comparisons the effects of secular
change are eliminated), we find an excess of l'*7 in the mean dip of
the winter months over that obtained from the summer months.                      The
mean    of the two corrections, thus       separately   obtained at Toronto and
 Kew, is l'*6    ;    of which the half, or      0'*8, has been applied in the
Tables with the        —  sign to the results in the winter months, and with
the + sign to the results in the summer months.
   Probable error        of a single determination of      the  Dip. — It may       be
 desirable  to state the probable error      of a single determination as it may
 be derived from the observations in the Tables, before and after the
 applicatiou of the correction for annual variation.                It will   be seen
 that the probable error is diminished by the application that has
 been made    of   a  correction on this account,

   The probable error thus obtained               represents  all the diversities
Rscribable   to the employment of different instruments           (all of the one
construction), — to the supposed peculiarities of different observers,
— to the occasional presence of magnetic disturbance (for which no
correction has been attempted), — and to differences             due to different
hours of observation     ; — in addition       to what    may be more      strictly
viewed as     " observational errors."        It  may thus serve in some mea
sure as a guide to those engaged in similar researches, as to the degree
of accuracy which is attainable in such experimental inquiries, when
proper care is taken in the procurement of a reliable inclinometer
and   in its manipulation.
    For the purpose of comparing the probable error thus obtained
with inclinometers of the later English pattern with that of the
instruments of earlier construction, four of the latter were selected,
viz. a 9-inch circle by Robinson, a 9-inch circle by Barrow, and two
6-inch circles by Robinson,          all in good order.         Each circle was
furnished with two needles of the same length as the diameter of the
circle, and read by a lens in lieu of verniers and microscopes. Table           IV.
contains the particulars of 20 determinations made with these instru
ments    in 1860 by Messrs.        Stewart and Chambers.             Their   mean
result is 68° 20'-04 reduced       to the epoch 1860.5, and corrected            for
annual variation.     The    mean result      of   the 71 determinations at the
same epoch in Table      III. is 68°   19'-8.      There is therefore no notable
difference   in the mean results obtained by the two classes of instru
ments ; but there is a considerable         difference   in the probable error      ;
as  from the 20 determinations in Table            IV.  we obtain +3'-65 as the
probable error of    a single   determination with the instruments of the
earlier pattern, whilst +     1'*5 has been     shown to be the probable error
when inclinometers of the more recent pattern were employed.

     Between No.       1       and   No.      4 we have an interval          of 37.85      years, and
a mean annual secular                change      of — 2'-69       ; mean epoch,         1840.6.
     Between No.      and No. 2, comprising an interval of 16.65 years,
                       1
we have a      mean secular change of — 21,77 ; mean epoch, 1830.0.
   Between No. 2 and No. 4, comprising an interval of 2 1 .2 years, we
have a mean secular change of — 2'-63 ; mean epoch, 1848.9.
     Hence we may infer that the yearly diminution                                 of the Dip from
secular change, though very nearly uniform throughout                                      the whole
interval of 37.85 years, was somewhat greater                               in the earlier part of
the interval than in the later                    ;    and    that       the rate    of diminution
may admit of being more exactly represented                               by the introduction of
a second term.
     If then   we take the year 1840.0 as a convenient middle epoch=f8,
and call its dip 6,        ;    and      if   we further      call the observed          dip at the
several observational epochs tv tv t, and                         tt,   respectively 0„ 0„ 6„        6V
we shall have four equations of the form
and giving double weight to the equation furnished by the epoch
1859.5, inasmuch as                 it   is   derived from so much greater                a    body of
observations     than the results at the other three epochs, we obtain by
least squares,
         60=69° ll'-95;      *=-2'713;       y=+0'-00057.
     Hence we have the general formula for computing the dip between
the years 1820 and 1860,
             0=69° ll'-95-2'-713 (*-f0)-r-0'-00057                             (t-Qa,

    The progressive diminution of the Dip in London during the last
forty years has thus been traced                 and followed by the observations
recorded and discussed in this paper               ;  and the further progress of the
research     will now     devolve    on the systematic observations which are
made for that purpose monthly at the Observatory at                        Kew.
    The    rate of diminution in the last forty               years does not appear       to
differ materially from the mean rate in the preceding hundred years.
The experiments of Mr. George Graham                         between   March    and  May,
 1 723, recorded      in the Philosophical           Transactions for    1 725,  No. 389,
give a mean dip in London at that epoch                   of " nearly "  74° 40'.    Com
paring this with 69°        1 1 '-95  in  1 840.0,    we have a difference     of 5°  28'- 1
in 116-7years, equivalent to a uniform diminution of 2'-81 annually;
or  if the   formula
             6=69° ll'-95-2'-713             (*-f0) + 0'-00056 (t-t,)'
be employed,      it  gives the dip in     March 1723.3 equal to 74° 36'* I, being
a difference     of  less than 4'      from the result of Mr. Graham's experi
ments    ;   which    difference     is doubtless       less than the probable error
 of that gentleman's determination with                  the instruments then in use.
    An expectation appears to have prevailed in some quarters that the
 decrease of the Dip in London should have ceased, and its subsequent
 increase    have    commenced,         contemporaneously with the alteration
which took place in the secular                  change      of the Declination     in the
 early part of this century, when the increase                      of west   declination,
 which had been continuous in the British Islands for about two cen
 turies, ceased, and was succeeded               by a decrease of the same.            But
 this supposition        is by no means           in   accordance     with   that general
view and interpretation of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism
for which we are indebted to Dr. Halley, and which, since its pro
mulgation in       1 683, has received        so   much confirmation in various and
 distant parts of the globe.             In  accordance       with that hypothesis, the
                                                                           n2

                                       160
diminution of the Dip in London might he expected to continue until
the epoch should arrive when, by the easterly movement              of translation
of the minor magnetic system in the northern hemisphere, the dis
parity of the magnetic force prevailing in the European and American
portions of the hemisphere should have attained its maximum : — which
is certainly not yet the case.
    Is there then, in the secular        change     of the Dip, no feature in
which,    in conformity     with the Halleian        hypothesis,    an  alteration
might be expected to synchronize with the reversal in the direction
 of the secular    change   of the declination    ?    Assuredly there is    ; and
 the facts which recent investigations have brought to our knowledge
 manifest that such an alteration has taken place.              I proceed   to de
 scribe it.
    If we have   recourse to those extensive generalizations which, under
 the name of "Isoclinal Lines corresponding to particular Epochs,"
 present a connected view of the changes which have taken place from
 time to time in the magnetic lines of the Dip over large portions of
 the earth's surface, and enable us to anticipate with some degree               of
 confidence   the changes which may be expected to take place in years
 to come, we notice generally that the lines undergo two species                 of
 modification, or peculiarities of change, which it is necessary to keep
 separately and distinctly in view.      In the British Islands, for example,
 the Isoclinal   Lines for little less than two centuries past have been
 steadilyadvancing towards the north by         a  gradual movement of trans
lation.     This  is one  feature of the secular change        ;  but there is a
 second   feature,   which,  if not at first sight equally striking, is yet
 equally regular and systematic      in its operation    ; viz. the direction of
 the isoclinal lines as they pass across our country from the south-west
towards the north-east undergoes       a  small but sensible change from year
to year, by which, in the lapse of several years, the angle at which
they cut the geographical meridians is materially              altered.    By the
joint operation of    these two processes, the general configuration        of the
 lines over large portions of the earth's surface, as well        as their values
in particular localities, arc both subject to systematic alteration            ;  a
remark which is not limited to the isoclinal lines alone, but is the case
also in the isogonic and isodynamic lines.           Those who are conversant
with Dr. Halley's writings, will be aware that, — in correspondence
with his views, — between the epochs when the Dip in London should

                                            101
attain, respectively, the maximum and the minimum amount which
constitute its limits under the system               of  secular   change,    an inter
mediate epoch might be anticipated, when the isoclinal lines passing
across the    British Islands should attain their          least angle  of inclination
to the geographical meridian           ;  towards which they should have pro
gressively advanced,      and from which they would as progressively re
cede.     Now,   if we compare         the line of 70° of dip in the Isoclinal
Map of     1 780 of the Magnetismus          der Erde with that      of  1840 in     Mr.
Keith Johnstone's       Physical Atlas, plate 23, we may fix on                 a  point
in about 42° North Latitude and 30° West Longitude, in which the
Dip   has remained nearly stationary, and through which the line                  of  70°
of Dip passed, at both epochs        ;   and we may perceive that, in its easterly
course from that point or pivot, this line passed in              1 780   through the
middle    of France considerably          to the South     of Paris (where      the  Dip
was then between 71° and           72°)    ; whereas     in 1840 it passed        across
England considerably          to the north        of London (where       the   Dip had
diminished to little more than 69°).                Therefore in the sixty years
which had elapsed between the two epochs, 1 780 and 1 840, the di
rection of the lines       as   they impinged         upon Western       Europe had
become much less inclined to the geographical meridian                  (i. e. forming
a greater angle with the parallels           of latitude) in    1840 than in 1780        :
and   if we  consult still earlier maps, we find that a change in the same
direction had been progressive from             a  still earlier period.     The par
ticular year in which this feature           attained its limit, and an opposite
change commenced,         cannot now perhaps be precisely determined                  ; it
was probably somewhat          earlier than 1840.         But from   the comparison
of the magnetic surveys of the British Islands in 1836-37 and
 1857-58, it is certain that the change in the direction of the isoclinal
lines in this part of the globe has entered upon the contrary phase
to that which had previously existed.                The   observations    of the    late
Mr. Welsh in Scotland in 1857-58                   (Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1859),
when compared with those of the Scotch Survey made in 1836-37,
published in the British Association Reports for 1836, show, according
to Mr. Balfour Stewart's calculation, that an increase of several degrees
in the angle at which the lines cut the meridians in passing across
Scotland has taken place between the epochs of the earlier and the
later surveys. The same general conclusion follows from a comparison
of  the magnetic surveys       of England      at nearly the same epochs ; every

                                      162
where near the west coast of England the mean annual secular change
in the twenty years has been greater, and near the east coast less than
its mean value at Kew       ;  showing that the general direction of the
isoclinal lines more nearly approaches      a parallelism to the equator now
than it did twenty years ago.        The ascertainment of the      exact value
of the secular     change   at a particular    locality by a well-conducted
system   of periodical observations is the duty of a magnetic observa
tory i  the direction of the magnetic lines passing across a country
is supplied by magnetic surveys        ; which, for that purpose, ought to
be repeated from time to time, as they have now been in this country,
 at intervals  of perhaps twenty or twenty-five       years.
    It has been imagined that the secular changes          of the magnetic ele
ments may be due to some alteration taking place either in the dis
tribution or in the condition of the materials in the interior of the
 globe.   But the regularity and uniformity with which the secular
 magnetic changes continue through long intervals of time, together
with their sudden periodic reversals,        — and   their corresponding fea
tures in the northern and southern hemispheres, which add greatly
to the apparent consistency and systematic character of the whole as
parts of a uniform general system,
                                         — wear   more the aspect of effects
of some yet unascertained cosmical cause.           One of the British Colo
nial Observatories, St. Helena, having the advantage of both            a large
secular change     and   a small amount       of magnetic disturbance, has
afforded    a very striking example of the great regularity with which
the secular change       takes   place,  maintaining     a  steady uniformity,
traceable not only from year to year, but from month to month, and
even from week      to week   ; so that   it is not   too much to say that,
from observations made during a single fortnight, an annual secular
change which has existed almost without variation for more than a
century, may be ascertained         and measured      with very considerable
precision.     (Magnetic Observations at St. Helena, vol. ii. p. ix.)

 I. " On   the Relations of the Vomer, Ethmoid, and Intermaxillary
       Bones."      By John       Cleland, M.D.,            Demonstrator of
       Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh.                 Communicated
       by Professor    Huxley.       Received February 28, 1861.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author   commences    by describing the connexions of the vomer
in mammalia generally, and states that of these by far the most
constant in occurrence and invariable in its nature is one to which
he believes be has been the first to attract attention, viz. that by
 which it comes in contact with the lateral masses of the ethmoid.
 He  states that this connexion is effected       by the    alae  of the vomer
 being continued into two laminae which pass beneath the turbinations
of the ethmoid, and    are united to the framework      of   the lateral masses
at a point corresponding to the margins of the sphenopalatine fora
mina.     These laminae he calls the       " ethmovomerine laminae,"         and
for the sphenopalatine foramen he adopts the term              " nasal foramen
of the palate-bone,"    because  it is not  the sphenoid, but the ethmoid,
which completes     that foramen in cases where it is not quite encircled
by the palate-bone.
    According to the author, the connexion of the vomer, next in im
portance to that with the lateral masses of the ethmoid, is that with
the intermaxillaries, which is constantly found when the mesial palatine
processes   of the intermaxillaries   are developed, and is always      of such
a description that the groove formed by the superior margins            of these
processes is continuous with the vomerine groove, while their inferior
margins likewise form a continuous line with the inferior margin of
 the vomer.
    As to the connexion    of the vomer with       the central plate     of  the
ethmoid, the author considers it altogether of secondary importance             ;
for, while that with the lateral masses of the ethmoid takes place at
a  very early date, and is a connexion of continuity, i.       e. by the bones
lying  edge to edge, that with the central plate is        of late  occurrence,
and is one of contiguity, t.    e. by the surfaces     of  the bones    coming
accidentally in contact.      The connexions of the vomer with the
maxillaries and palate-bones are also considered          to be of secondary
importance.

                                       164
    In  reference  to the peculiarities presented      by the vomer and eth
moid in the human subject, the author endeavours              to show that their
relations are really in agreement       with those which he has described
as typical among mammalia.           He found the key to the interpretation
of the arrangement        seen in the adult, by examining the condition of
the bones in very early life, especially the sphenoidal spongy bones.
The last-mentioned       bones are described in young subjects          as consist
ing of hollow pyramids enclosing the sphenoidal sinuses, but origin
ally quite unconnected with the sphenoid.              They articulate on the
 one hand, edge to edge with the alae         of the  vomer,   and on the other
with the ethmoid and the palatals, and by their contact with the
orbital and sphenoidal processes of the latter, complete on either side
 the so-called    sphenopalatine foramen, and correspond altogether to
the ethmovomerine laminae and part of the ethmoid in other mammals.
    The human vomer         can be seen  in its perfection as a separate     bone,
and with all its connexions fully developed, in early life only              ;  and
 an explanation is offered     of the peculiarities of the human vomer and
ethmoid, by showing that they are consequences of the great curvature
of the cranial arch, the small development of the organ of smell, and
the prolongation of the face downwards for the sake of voice, instead
of forwards    as in other animals, for the sake       of prehension.
    The connexions of the vomer, ethmoid,          and intermaxillaries in the
various families of mammals are next examined in detail, and various
differences    of form, &c. peculiar to      genera    and orders are noticed.
 Attention is particularly drawn to the circumstance that in the camels
and other ruminant families the intermaxillaries are prolonged for
wards beyond the points of junction of their lateral plates and mesial
palatine processes,      so as to embrace       more or less completely the
anterior extremity of the septal cartilage of the nose, which between
these    prolongations     dips into the palate    ; and    that, similarly,    the
intermaxillaries meet above the septal cartilage in the Dugong, Manati,
and Tapir, in which they have no mesial palatine processes              : to these
forms importance is afterwards attached in comparing the intermax
illaries of mammals with those       cf birds, reptiles,    and fishes.
    The author    argues that the vomer,      lateral masses of the ethmoid,
and palate-bones      are members    of one segment     ; that the central plate
of the ethmoid      is the centrum   of the   segment behind      ; and that the
mesial palatine processes      of the intermaxillaries play the part       of  cen

                                        165
tram to the segment in front         of the vomer.         He considers the skull
to be   composed of seven segments         ;   that three of these are developed
for protection     of the encephalon, viz. posteriorly the occipital             seg
ment, then the parietal       segment,    to which belong the postsphenoid
and parietals,      and anteriorly the frontal           segment,      to which   the
frontal   and central     plate  of the ethmoid belong          ;   and that three
other segments       with   imperfect neural arches,          and each connected
with a special sense, alternate with          the first three, viz. the auditory,
optie, and    olfactory  segments,   the last-mentioned being the vomerine
segment     ; and that foremost of all is       a terminal seventh segment, the
facial segment, to which the intermaxillaries,             maxillaries, and nasals
belong.
   With    a special view towards determining the exact construction                of
the facial segment, he examines          the anterior portions of the skulls
of birds, reptiles, and fishes.        Taking     as his guide the constitution
of the vomerine        segment    as he     believes    he has    established it in
mammals,      he concludes that the vomer in birds, reptiles, and fishes
is the bone      described as such by Professor Owen              ;  that the lateral
masses   of the ethmoid    are the prefrontals      of reptiles and fishes, and are
absent   from the skull of birds     ;  that the central plate of the ethmoid
is represented by the interorbital           septum (whether ossified or not)
 of birds, reptiles, and fishes    ; and that in fishes the nasals are repre
 sented   by the nasal of Owen, which, however, usually contains an
 additional element, which plays the part of centrum, and corresponds
 to the mesial palatine processes      of the intermaxillaries of other       classes.
 His examination of the skulls of birds, reptiles, and fishes has con
 vinced   him that throughout the vertebrata the lateral plates of the
 intermaxillaries form the proximal part of a haemal arch, of which
 the maxillaries compose       the distal part, while the nasals are elements
 of the neural arch of the same segment             ;  that thus in mammals the
 ring of bone surrounding         the incisive foramina is the first haemal
 arch  ;   that the nostrils in all vertebrata are openings situated               be
 hind the facial and in front of the vomerine segment                 ; and  that the
 alar cartilages   of the nose are structures serially homologous with the

    In attempting to explain the        exact morphological         relations of the
 nasals,  the author enters into the embryological bearings of the con
 clusions at which he has arrived, and puts forward the hypothesis

                                      166
that the anterior segments of the skull tend to undergo fission in the
direction of the axis of the chain of segments,             and that the cleft
separating the maxillary lobe        of  the  embryo from the middle and
lateral frontal lobes is morphologically horizontal        —lying  between the
haemal and neural elements       of  more than one segment      ;  and in proof
of this view   a variety  of evidence is adduced.
II. "   On the Structure and Growth of the Tooth of Echinus."
       By S. James        A. Salter, M.B. Lond., F.L.S., F.G.S.
       Communicated       by Thomas       Bell,   Esq.     Received March 5,
       1861.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author     commences     his paper by stating that the researches
upon which it is based were made more than four years since, and
then without the knowledge that the structure had been previously
investigated by others.
   An abstract of     the  literature of the subject (contained in very
narrow limits) is then given.
   In 1841 Valentin, in Agassiz's Monograph               on the Echinoderms
 (Anatomie    des Echinodermes),        published    a description and many
good figures of the minute anatomy and growth of the Echinus-tooth.
   Professor Quekett, in his 'Lectures on Histology' (1854), referring
to the minute mature anatomy of the organ, states its ultimate struc
ture to resemble bone and dentine of vertebrata.
   Dr. Carpenter, in his work ' On the Microscope,'              speaks  of the
tissue of the tooth as essentially of the same nature as       the shell  of the
Echinidae generally (1856).
   Lastly, Professor W.C. Williamson describes the subject more fully
than his predecessors,     entering into the question of the development
of  the tooth both generally and        histologically (though apparently in
ignorance of Valentin's Essay), in a paper on the
                                                            " Histology of the
Dermal Tissues," &c., in the British Journal of Dental Science, 1857.
   The   coarse   anatomy and relations of the Echinus-tooth           are then
described,   and   the question is discussed       as   to how far the organ
resembles   and how far it does not resemble           the incisor  tooth of a
Rodent mammal, to which         it has constantly    been likened.

                                       167
    Some remarks then follow on the method            of investigation, which
the peculiar physical characters of the structure render very difficult.
    Before describing the histology        of  the mature tooth, the author
premises    some succinct remarks upon the          several   elementary parts
that are formed at its growing extremity, and by which its complex
structure is built up — showing how the shape and plan of these ele
ments determine the microscopical appearances            of the  several regions
of  the tooth as seen in different sections.
    These elementary parts are— (1st) the Primary plates, which con
sist of a double series of triangular sheets of calcareous matter, and
which constitute the physiological axis of the tooth, about which and
connected     with which the four secondary elements            are developed.
These latter are (2nd) the Secondary plates, lappets of similar cal
 careous sheets attached to the outer edge of the primary plates ; (3rd)
the Flabelliform processes, elaborate reticulations of calcareous fibres
 ending in fan-shaped extremities ; (4th) the Keel fibres, certain long
cylindrical rods with club-shaped ends of the same chemical nature,
 which pass towards the enteric region of the tooth in their growth              ;
and   (5th) the Enamel Rods, which are minute very short develop
 ments of the same character, and which are formed in the opposite
 direction.    Thus far a primary and secondary stage of formation are
represented    : a  third  stage, that  of consolidation, now occurs in the
 development of (6th) the Solderiny particles, multitudes of minute
 discs of carbonate of lime which appear over the whole surface of the
 previously-formed      elementary parts, and by which they are soldered
 together, the intervals between these (in a certain sense) constituting
 the tubular character of the mature tissue.
    The primary plates,      secondary   plates, and the proximal portion      of
 the flabelliform processes      are stated   to constitute the body      of the
 tooth —the   distal extremities of the flabelliform    processes the skirtings
 of the enteric region of the body of the tooth       ;  the keel fibres wholly
 form the keel    ; while the short enamel rods compose          the thin white
 layer on the dorsal surface of the tooth
                                                — the enamel.
    The histology of the tooth is remarkable as exhibiting apparent
 inconsistencies in different lines of section. A vertical section of the
 tooth presents the appearance       of vertebrate   bone, lacunae, canaliculi,
 and lamellae ; while a transverse section displays some regions resem
 bling dentine (the body of the tooth), and others having the             closest

                                         168
  similitude to an oblique section       of   the shell  of  some Mollusca,     such
  as  Pinna.
      The author then     proceeds to describe in detail and with particularity
  the form and progressive growth of the several elements of the tooth
  as they are met with       in examining the growing extremity and pro
  ceeding from     it towards   the mature structure, as long as the elements
  are susceptible    of isolation  and individual examination.         The anatomy
  of the soldering particles, and      their relation to the production of the
  cavitary structure of the tooth,      is specially dwelt upon.         The solder
  ing particles are supposed to be isolated at first, but           as  they enlarge
. they become connected         by a thin film from their upper and under
  faces.    This occurs before     the final consolidation       of the tissue, and
  before the soldering particles are indissolubly             connected    with, and
  themselves    indissolubly connect, the contiguous elements of the tooth.
  At this   stage these particles are    still susceptible of isolation, and they
  may be separated        en masse, being held in relative position by the
  films that connect them.         The soldering particles     and the connecting
  films thus constitute       a tubular system, which has an independent
  existence before the final consolidation        of the  tissue, and this tubular
  system is introduced between, and interpolated among the previously
  existing elementary parts of the tooth.
     The author     concludes    by expressing    a coincidence of opinion with
  Dr. Carpenter, that the minute structure of the tooth is essentially of
  the same nature as that of the shell of the Echinidae generally.

may be taken in it above                      which it dilates upwards, and below it
downwards.               The position of this line                        is determined by the consi
deration that,           if   the plate be imagined to be cut through along that
line, the thrust necessary to push the part above upwards must be
equal to that necessary to push the part below downwards.
     In like manner                a horizontal      line may be found above which the
plate contracts downwards and below                                 it,   upwards.

     When the plate is dilated, it is the longer portion which dilates
downwards            ;   and when             it    is   contracted, it is the shorter portion
which         contracts upwards.                      The lower            end      of the plate                  descends

Society.
     To verify the fact of the                        descent       of   a    plate of metal under the
conditions supposed,                a    deal board            9   feet long and          5   inches broad, was
fixed at an inclination of                     1
                                                   8^° against the wall                  of   a   house having                   a
southern aspect, and                 a        sheet      of lead       was placed upon                  it   one-eighth
of   an inch         thick       and weighing 28 lbs., and having its edges turned
over the edges of the board so as not to bind upon it.                                                           Near the
lower extremity              a    vernier was constructed, by which the position of
the lead on the board could be determined to the 100th of an inch.
Its position         was observed              daily between             7   and    8    in the morning and
6   and     7   in the evening, from the                       1   6th of February to the 28th of
June, 1858.

    A Table is   given showing the descent for every day of that period,
from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m.
     In the months when there was no sunlight from 6 p.m. to                7  a.m.,
there was no descent in that interval.            The    descents from 7 a.m. to
 6 p.m. were very different          on   different     days.    Sometimes they
amounted to a quarter of an inch in the day, and sometimes were
not appreciable.        The greatest descents were on sunny days, and
especially when with a warm sun there was                a cold wind.    The   least
were on days     of continual rain.      The    average daily descents were, in
inches, —
            February.     March.        April.        May.        June.
              10000        •13806      •16133        •21500       •21888
     These descents were not due to the extreme              temperatures of the
periods in which they took      place, but to the aggregate      of the variations
up and down during each interval.            The   difference  of the highest and
lowest temperatures in any interval may have been small, and yet the
changes    of temperature up and down may            have been many, and their
aggregate great.       It  is upon this aggregate that the descent depends.
     The dilatation of   ice was measured      in the   years 1845,   1846, at the
 Observatory of Pultowa, by Schumacher, Pohr, and Moritz                 ; and    the
particulars of their experiments were communicated to the Academy
of St. Petersburgh,       by  W. Struve, in 1848,           and published     in its
 Memoirs (Sciences Mathem. et Phys., ser. 6. t. iv.).                 By exposing
water to the action of the frost in a mould, Schumacher obtained a
 block of ice, which, after reducing it with the plane, measured                6  ft.
 3 ins. in length and   6 ins. by 6£ inches in section ; and he caused three
 thermometers to be frozen into it with their stems projecting above
its surface.    This block of     ice he carried out from a room, where             it
 had been preserved      at a uniform temperature of — 2° R. during the
 day, into the open air at night, and slung           it in  a horizontal position
from a beam       supported by tressles.           As its temperature fell he
 measured the distance        between    two steel points frozen into it near
 its two ends, by    a  measuring rod of dry wood (well-clothed), the di
 stances on which were referred to a standard measure on the wall                   of
 a  room of the Observatory which          retained nearly a constant tempe

 rature of — 2°       R.      His     measurements        had reference       to observed
 temperatures      of the ice varying from — 2°-3 R. to —22° R.                        After
 applying    the    requisite corrections, it resulted from them                  that the
 coefficient  of  expansion       of  ice is for 1°    R.

 which is nearhj twice         as great     as the coefficient     of dilatation of lead,
 and more than twice as great as that                of any other solid.
    We do not know the modulus of elasticity of ice, or the pressure
under which it disintegrates.
    If it were as elastic as slate and did not resist crushing                  more than
hard brick,    a  block of it placed wit!, its ends between two immoveable
obstacles, would crumble when its temperature was raised one degree
of Fahrenheit.         It  is its great dilatability       which gives to ice this ten
dency to disintegrate, when, not being free to dilate, its temperature
is raised*, even so slightly           as  this.
    If  the  block    of    ice   experimented on by Schumacher had been
placed upon       a  plank inclined at the same angle as that used in the
experiment with the lead was, and                  if its under   side had been coated
with lead-foil     so as to    give it the same friction          on    the plank as the
lead had, then, under the same variations of temperature                       os the   lead
experienced,     it could not but           have    descended     as   the lead did, but
twice as fast, because its dilatability             is twice  as  great.
    We may conceive such            a  block of ice to be made up of thin plates
parallel to its upper surface, such              as plates  of  glass would be,     if glass
were as dilatable as ice and            as  friable, and    if it   possessed    that pro
perty of passing from           a disintegrated into       a  solid state, which in ice
is called regelation.         If  we put the adherence           of   these plates to one
another in the place of friction, and conceive the variations of external
temperature (or the effects of solar radiation) to reach them in suc
cession, each one being dilated or contracted independently of the
rest, then each would descend by a motion proper to itself, and also by
reason    of the descents        of  those     subjacent to it.       The extremities of
the plates would under these circumstances overlap, and the descent
of  each, proper to itself, would be increased                 by the overlappings of
those beneath it.

     Each plate would under these circumstances

  the one beneath ; and supposing the adherence of

  the board to be the same as that of the plates to one another,

  any number of blocks similarly placed and subject to the like varia
 tion of temperatures, the thickest or deepest would descend,
                                                                                    at its
  surface, the fustest    ;  and if there   were a block     of different depths in
 different parts,     the deepest parts would descend the fastest.                    The  .
 differential motion thus set up would not be appreciable in a block
 of ice of different thicknesses in different parts if its dimensions
 were no larger than the block experimented on by Schumacher,
                                                                                      but
 in a glacier it would be appreciable.
     To bring Schumacher's block to             the proportions       of -a glacier, it
 must be converted into a slab twelve feet long, twenty inches wide, and
 two inches thick.        It would then represent on a scale of the 1500th
 part, a glacier 2500 feet wide, 250 feet deep, and 18,000 feet long,
 which are something like the dimensions of the Mer de Glace from
 2300 feet below Montanvert to the Tacul. If we suppose it to be
 placed at the same inclination of 18 V3 at which the lead was, its
 under surface     being coated with lead so as to have the same friction
 on board as the lead had, then           it may be calculated that           if it  had
 experienced    the same variations of temperature               as the   lead did, its
 average daily descent, measured         in inches, would       have been
           February.        March.      April.         May.          June.

the   Mer  de Glace,     which is about 5°, and its dimensions to become
actually those of that glacier, then, supposing the glacier to experience
the same elevations         and depressions      of temperature      as the   lead did,
its average daily descents in inches would be

actual rates of motion of the glacier          ;  showing that variations of the

descend as it actually does,       if the resistances   opposed to its descent were
twelve times greater than the resistances               opposed     to the descent of
 the lead — If its descent were resisted by a friction, for instance, having
 twelve times the coefficient of that of the lead on the board, or such as
 would cause it to rest without slipping on an incline having twelve
 times the tangent of the inclination of the board            ;  or  if the variations
 of temperature      were less and the resistance        greater in any proportion
 which would retard the descent twelve times                   as much.        So  that
 we may suppose in the case           of  the glacier a far greater resistance        in
 proportion      than that sustained by the lead upon the board, and
 variations of temperature far less, without passing the limits within
 which a probability is created by the experiment that the descent of
 the glacier is due to the same cause as that of the lead.
    In  the act of descending        on the board, the slab       of  ice of which   we
 have   spoken could not but be thrown into a state of extension in
 some parts and       of compression in another.           The conditions of the
 descent being     in other    respects given, the amount       of this   extension  or
 compression might be at any point determined.                   If at   any point the
 extension exceeded the tenacity of the ice, the slab would there sepa
 rate across its length      ; and   if at  any point the compression exceeded
 the resistance to crushing, it would there crush.
    Supposing it to be thinner at the sides than in the middle, the sur
face-motion of the middle would be faster than that of the sides, and
from this differential motion would result cracks oblique to the axis                of
the slab, the explanation of which,           as  they exist in glaciers, is one of
the most successful        attempts yet made at the solution of the me
chanical problem of glacier-motion.              These conditions of the descent
of the   slab, when referred to a glacier, explain the formation              of trans
verse and lateral crevasses,         and the fact of a glacier crushing itself
through     a  gorge.
    The Mer      de Glace moves faster by day than by           night*.       Its mean
daily motion is twice       as great during the six summer          as  during the six
winter months      t- It moves     fastest in the hottest months, and in those
months varies its motion the most, because in them the variations of
temperature are the greatest.              It moves most slowly in the coldest
months, and in those varies its motion the least, because                     in those
months the variations of temperature are the least.                These differences

     It    is,   however, impossible to do justice to the positive character                                    of
the evidence on which this conclusion has been founded by Professor

sphere       made         at the same               times     at the     Great St. Bernard               and    at
Geneva.            It   results from            it   that no change in the mean temperature
of    the atmosphere                is      unaccompanied by             a     corresponding change in
the mean motion                of   the glacier.
     The glacier          moves with different velocities at different depths, the
surface-motion being faster (probably two or three times) than that of
the deepest part. The motions at different depths cannot but be re
lated to one another                :       so that as the influence            of variations of         tempe
rature     is    felt on the surface,            it   cannot but be felt throughout the glacier.
     If    every change            of solar           heat    is   associated with       a     corresponding
change of glacier-motion,                       it     seems to follow that the two are either
dependent upon some common cause, or that the one set of changes
is   caused          by   the other         ;   and the former           of    these    conclusions being
inadmissible, we are forced on the latter.                                It   is   not necessary to show
how   it    is   that changes of external temperature penetrate glaciers.                                      Of
the power of the sun upon them there are, however, evidences in the
ablation of surface constantly going on and in the preservation of the
ice which          is   covered         by the stones of             a   moraine, which sometimes
forms an icy ridge from 50 to 80 feet high, and some hundred feet in
width.

      "The sun's rays,"                says      Tyndall*, "striking              upon the unpro
tected          surface    of the glacier,        enter the ice to a considerable depth ;
and the consequence is that the ice near the surface of the glacier is
always disintegrated, being cut up into minute fissures and cavities
filled with water and air, which, for reasons                             already assigned,        cause
the glacier when it is clean to appear white and opaque.                                      The    ice
under the moraines, on the contrary, is usually dark and transparent.
I have          sometimes       seen   it   as    black    as   pitch, the blackness being               a
proof of its         great transparency, which prevents the reflexion                         of light
from its interior.              The    ice under the moraines cannot be assailed                       in
its depths by the solar heat, because this heat becomes obscure be
fore it reaches the ice, and                as    such it lacks the power of penetrating
the substance.             It   is also communicated in great part by way of con
tact instead         of    by radiation.          A thin film        at the surface       of the    mo
raine ice engages all the heat that acts upon                             it,   its deeper   portions
remaining transparent and intact."
      It   matters not to the argument how little below freezing the tem
perature of         a    glacier may be.         So long as the ice exist* in a solid state
and        is   capable     of being     penetrated       by the solar heat,         it   cannot but
dilate and contract.               Its central portions, lying folded                in   ice 100 feet
thick above and below, may well, however, be conceived                                       to retain
some of the cold of the region from which they have descended. The
observations of Agassiz on the temperature of the Aar Glacier are not to
be relied upon, because the access                   of   damp external air to the borings
in which they were made, and of water percolating the disintegrated
ice    of the        surface,      was      not effectually stopped.                 The included
thermometers could not but under these circumstances show zero,
although the temperature of the surrounding ice was below it.                                       For
the water freezing on the walls of the boring, the latent heat thereby
given out, would raise the temperature of the air about the bulb to the
freezing-point, and this water being continually renewed,                                 the quick
silver would always be kept at that point.
  That glacier-ice              possesses no such properties                of viscidity or      com
pressibility        as    would cause       it    to descend         by   its weight along such
slopes as those on which some glaciers descend                              may be shown thus.
Let the Mer              de Glace be conceived            to be cut up by vertical sections
at right         angles     to one another, into blocks, whose                      bases are large
enough          to prevent them toppling                  over; and         let these      blocks be

imagined to be separated from one another.                                      Then (supposing it not
 to slip) each                block would stand in its place without the support of
 the neighbouring                 blocks       ;    for its vertical sides would be walls of ice
 needing no external support, like the ice-wall of the Glacier du Geant,
 141 feet       high          near the Tacul, described by                Tyndall*           ;    or that of the
 Mer       de Glace near the Augle,                        pictured by Forbes            f   .        Needing no
external support when thus placed asunder,they could need none when
brought again together                     ;       nor could they, by the fact of their being
so brought together, be made to exert any mutual pressure,                                                  or have
any more or other tendency to move than each block had separately.
If this reasoning be true, there is                         no physical property                 of   ice, whether
it   be    called viscosity or plasticity, which would cause it to descend by
its weight alone on any surface along which it would not slide.                                                  It   is
plastic no          doubt — Tyndall                has proved that by         the Hydraulic Press, —
but not        as   to any pressure created in                    a   glacier by the weight of the
glacier.          If     it   were,   or    if      it were semifluid, then under those enor
mous pressures which it is supposed to sustain, it would bulge out at
the ice-wall of the Tacul, and mould itself to the sides of its channel                                                ;
for it is the character of                     a compressible          substance,     not less than of a
semifluid, to yield not only in the direction in which pressure is ap
                it it,
plied to             but in every other.
      Nor     if         were sufficiently           a   fluid to flow     by   its weight alone, how
ever slowly, down slopes                       of   3° or 5°, could      it   descend otherwise than
as   a    torrent down slopes, such                   as   that of the Silberberg Glacier, of 40°,

theories of glacier-motion.                          They lie      on slopes         so steep that               it   is
scarcely possible to conceive the ice,                           if   solid, to be loosened from the
face of the rock, and not to descend in fragments                                    ;   or      if   viscous,    not
to become           a    torrent.

and especially  if the mercurial surface is in the form of a narrow
strip about ^th of an inch wide, strong vibrations occur ; and sym
metrical crispations of singular beauty, accompanied by definite
sounds, are produced at the mutual surfaces of the liquid metal and
electrolyte.
   In my experiments the crispations and sounds             were   readily pro
duced by taking a circular pool of mercury from              1  to 3 inches in
diameter, surrounded by a ring of mercury about -J-th or ^th of an
inch wide, both being contained in a circular vessel of glass or gutta
percha, covering the liquid metal to a depth of about          ^
                                                                  an inch  with
a rather strong aqueous solution       of cyanide of potassium, connecting
the pool of mercury by     a   platinum wire with the positive pole of a
battery capable of forcing   a rather large quantity of electricity through
the liquid, and connecting the ring      of mercury with the      negative   pla
tinum wire.     The ring of mercury immediately         became covered     with
crispations or elevated sharp ridges about -j^th of an inch asunder,
all radiating towards the centre of the vessel, and a definite or musical
sound was produced capable of being heard, on some occasions,               at a
distance   of about 40 or  50 feet.      The vibrations    and sounds ceased
after a short time, but were         always reproduced by reversing the
direction of the electric current for a short time, and then restoring
it to its original direction.       The loudness of the sound depends
greatly upon   the power  of   the  battery ; if the battery was too strong
the sounds did not occur.        The battery   I have used     consists   of   10
pairs of Smee's elements, each silver plate containing about 90 square
inches of immersed or acting surface         ; and  I have used with equal
success six Grove's batteries,    arranged either  as 2 or 3 pairs, each pla
tinum plate being    6 inches long and 4 inches wide.           If the  cyanide
solutionwas too strong, the sounds were altogether prevented.
    Being occupied in investigating the conditions and relations of this
phenomenon with the intention of submitting a complete account of
the results to the notice of the Royal Society,       I  refrain from stating
further particulars on the present occasion.

hard and soft iron of the ship, and partly on the magnetic dip and
horizontal force at the place.
  In all ships which                  have been examined,                  A    and       E   are so small that
they may be neglected                    ;    and,      if   the deviation be of such an amount

last term the "Quadrantal" deviation.
  The "semicircular"                          deviation         is,   on the plan proposed by the
Astronomer Royal, and extensively practised in the mercantile marine,

stance    of      the correction              is       sufficiently great, this correction may be
considered              perfect for the time and place at which                                     is   made       but

when this      is   not the case, errors are introduced, which                                         is   the object
of the paper to consider.
  Mr. Evans              observed            that the standard compass                          ot the         'Great

                                             180
 Eastern,' which had been corrected on              Mr. Airy's plan by Mr. Gray
 of Liverpool, had errors of           between 5° and 6° on some points.             It
 occurred to him that this error was caused by the length of the
 needle and the proximity          of the correctors, and to       test this he made
 experiments on the deviation produced on needles of different length
 by magnets and soft iron with the following results.
    With 3-inch single needles deflected by magnets, the deviations
 were nearly "semicircular;" but with 6-inch needles, and still more
 6trongly with 12-inch needles,           a  "sextantal" error of very consider
 able magnitude was introduced.
    With      soft  iron correctors deflecting a 7i-inch single needle,             in
 addition to the       " quadrantal"       deviation,  a considerable    " octautal "
error was introduced.
    When the       same experiments were made with an Admiralty standard
compass       card, constructed     as usual with four parallel needles, the ex
tremities of which are 15° and            4.5° on each side    of the extremities of
the diameter to which they are parallel, there was no appreciable sex
tantal or octantal deviation. And on investigating the subject mathe
matically, it appeared that this arrangement of needles, or the simpler
arrangement         of two   needles each 30° on each side         of the diameter,
produces a complete compensation and correction of these errors.
   The formulae are the following : — The diviation produced in a
single needle of length 2a by a magnetic particle M at the same level

So that     if a =30°, or if the    two needles be each 30° on each side       of the
diameter which is parallel to them, the sextantal term disappears.

ends   of  a diameter,     the sextantal term has a factor,

needles     reduces        to zero        the   octantal error introduced by the too
great proximity of the soft iron                     and further, the error introduced

     The conclusion of the authors                   that by the use of the Admiralty

the diameter parallel to them, the correcting magnets                                      and soft iron
correctors may be placed much nearer the compass than can safely be
done with        a   single needle            compass         card, and the large deviations
found in iron ships far more accurately corrected.
     Correction      of the Quadrantal Deviation. — It has long                                been known
that two compasses placed as in the common double binnacle, produce
in   each other a negative quadrantal deviation.                                 The discussion                 by
Mr. Evans of         the        deviations of all the iron-built ships in the Royal
Navy (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 337), showed that the quadrantal devia
tion in such ships  always positive
                               is    and as there   great difficulty
                                                          ;                          is
and inconvenience in the usual mode of correcting large quadrantal
deviation by soft iron,              it   occurred to         Mr. Evans that the correction
might be made by the reciprocal action of two compasses placed at
the distance of       18        to 24 inches from each other, as in the common
double binnacle.           .    The precautions to             be used are that the two com
passes must be        of       equal power, and as the correction                 is   inversely        as     the
earth's horizontal force at the place,                  if    great accuracy          is   required there
ought to be the means             of adjusting the distance of the two com
passes,    and the         method will probably be found inapplicable in very
high magnetic latitudes.
     The deflection            so produced by one compound compass                                 on   a    like

     In this arrangement therefore                  an octantal error           is   introduced which
may be avoided            by    the use    of two Admiralty standard                      cards, or cards
with two needles each 30° from the diameter which                                is   parallel to them.

I. " On     the Distribution of Aqueous Vapour in the upper Parts
       of the Atmosphere."                By Lieut.-Col. Richard Strachey,
       F.R.S.        Received March 25, 1861.
   The experiments of chemists having shown that any gas will flow
into a space occupied by another gas, and diffuse itself there as
though the space were              a    vacuum and the second gas not there, it
was suggested        by Dalton that the atmosphere might be considered
to be a combination of            as   many distinct atmospheres as it has gase
ous components,         and that the actions of each                of    these   might   be
treated    of   separately,   and irrespective of the others.             Meteorologists,
pursuing this idea, have proposed to separate                       the pressure of the
aqueous     vapour from the whole barometric pressure                        of the atmo-
phere, and thence to infer the pressure of the permanently elastic
portion,    or as it has been called, the Gaseous                     Pressure,     or the
Pressure    of the Dry Air.
  It     is my object to inquire how far the facts of the matter will
support Dalton' s suggestion of the possible independent existence of
an atmosphere         of   aqueous vapour, and whether we can in                  truth eli
minate the pressure of this vapour by subtracting the observed ten
sion from the total barometric pressure, in the manner that has com
monly been done of late years.
  And first       as to the hypothesis         of   an atmosphere    of   aqueous vapour
pressing only upon itself.               If
                                 there be such an atmosphere, the
general laws of pressure of elastic fluids will apply to as they do         it,
to the mixed atmosphere.    But in consequence of the small specific
gravity of the vapour, the rate of the diminution of pressure in the
upper strata of the vapour atmosphere would be much slower than in
the mixed atmosphere          ;   and irrespective of any variation in the law
of the    decrease    of temperature, the height to which                 we should have
to ascend in the vapour atmosphere to produce                   a   given diminution      of
pressure, would be to the corresponding height in the mixed atmo

the atmosphere,              the barometric pressure             is   found to be reduced one-
half  ;   and consequently           it      would be necessary to ascend to about                   -jj-   of
19,000 feet, or upwards of 30,000 feet, to produce                               a   corresponding
diminution of pressure in                 a   vapour atmosphere, or to reduce the ten

     Now let us compare this result with the observed facts.                                  This          is

      The     facts, as indicated by the long series                   of observations, of which
the Table contains an abstract, are altogether in accordance with the
results of my own observations                    ;   butI      have thought     it   better to rest
my conclusions on the facts observed by others.                             Further, the discre
 pancy between the observations and the hypothesis                               is   so great,         and

 tions are themselves so thoroughly consistent, that the conclusion is
 inevitable that the hypothesis is untenable.
    A    similar conclusion          as  to the entire incompatibility         of   the hypo
 thesis of    a separate        vapour atmosphere with the facts, may be drawn
 quite independently of any observation of tensions,                     from   a mere con
 sideration of the known laws of the diminution of temperature                           as we
 ascend.       An argument, something                to this effect,     will be found in
Bessel's paper on             Barometric Heights       * ; but its form being too ma
thematical to be generally intelligible,               I  shall endeavour to place the
matter in a rather more popular point of view.
    Let    us suppose,         then, that we are at a place at the sea-level where
the temperature of the air is 80°, the tension of vapour being '80,
which would make the dew-point 720-5 — a case that must be of con
 stant occurrence.              If, now,   we rose gradually above the earth's sur
face, the temperature              of the air would     be reduced at the known rate
 of about     3° for 1000 feet         ; while the tensions of vapour, and the cor
 responding dew-points, calculated upon the hypothesis of an atmo
sphere     of vapour pressing upon itself, would                be as follows     : —
                  ft.
                      0   . . Tension "80      . . Dew-point 72*5       . . Air 80-0

    Hence, up to about 3000 feet, the temperature of the air would
he found to be higher than the dew-point, and the supposed                            tensions
 might of course exist.               But the temperature of the air, it will                be
seen, diminishes much more rapidly as we ascend than that                               of  the
 dew-point      ;  and the former          will therefore    soon fall below the latter.
 Thus at 4000          feet, the air being at 68°, the theory demands                  vapour,
with a dew-point of 690,9, which is impossible                     ;  for any vapour, in
 excess    of that corresponding to the air temperature 68°, would be
instantly precipitated. In like manner it might be shown that, under
all conceivable         conditions of heat or cold, and of damp or dryness at
the surface       of the earth, we could always ascend to a height where

the diminution   of temperature would render the progression of the
tensions according to the presumed law impossible.  We may there
fore conclude generally, that the known diminution                         of temperature
in the atmosphere is incompatible with the                         existence of so large a
quantity of vapour in the upper strata                   as the    theory in question de
mands     ;   and, consequently, that the tensions                 observed       at the surface
are neither dependent on, nor balanced                   by, the pressure         of   the vapour
in the higher parts of the atmosphere (in the way in which the entire
barometric pressure depends on the weight of the whole superincum
bent column          of air), for this would           be insufficient to produce them.
To render         an independent vapour atmosphere possible would, indeed,
require       a   fall of temperature in the air of about               1°   for 1500 feet, or
less than a quarter          of that which really            takes place.
    It will       also follow that, as the tension            of vapour      at any point ex
ceeds the sum          of all    the pressures    of the vapour         above      it,   it   must in
part be due to the reaction of the air particles, which must therefore
press upon those            of vapour, contrary to           the   supposition with which
we started.          This    is,   in fact, equivalent to saying that the air offers
a   resistance      to the diffusion of vapour, instead of having no effect
whatever in obstructing             it;   and thus from an erroneous                assumption,
based     upon experiments made on very smnll quantities of air in
confined vessels, arises the fallacy of the theory                    I      have        been      con
sidering.
 I    am aware         of   no systematic observations relative to the actual
distribution        of vapour in the         atmosphere,        excepting (hose made by
Dr. Joseph Hooker,              and published in his Himalayan               Journals*.             He
found in his journeys in Sikim, which extended                       to heights          of 18,000
feet and upwards, that the quantity                    of vapour    was dependent              rather
on the temperature              of the air than    on anything else, and that                 it   was,
in fact, simply        a    certain proportion          of   the maximum quantity that
can exist in accordance               with the conditions of temperature at any
altitude, the relative quantity being pretty nearly constant through
out the whole column.                 These conclusions of Dr. Hooker are alto
gether corroborated by my own observations.                        In   the annexed Tables
I   have further       illustrated       this.    In Table II.     I       have    shown for         a

   In Table     III.    the results of Dr. Hooker's and my own observations
are given in more detail.
   The     accordance     between       the calculated and observed quantities of
vapour shown by these figures is so close, that we can have no hesi
tation in admitting that Dr. Hooker's                    conclusion will, in all proba
bility,   be found to afford the general solution                  of this problem.          The
relative quantity of vapour in the case of his observations having
been rather greater         in the higher than in the lower strata of the
atmosphere,       is a circumstance which cannot be held to affect the
general truth of our conclusions,              as   will  be perfectly accounted for by
supposing that the diminution of temperature with height was less
rapid in reality, than 3° for 1000 feet, on which my calculation is
based.      It is further worthy of notice, that the calculated proportion
of vapour at various altitudes             varies but little even with considerable
change of the surface           temperature, though there is a manifest ten-

   dency    for the upper strata to contain            a  rather higher per-centage
  with    a  high thiui with    n   low temperature        ; a  result likewise in ac
  cordance with fact, so far          as we are    able to judge from the compa
  rison of Dr. Hooker's Indian             observations with those made in En
  gland by Mr. Welsh.
     The     precise  determination of the entire pressure of the vapour
  thus shown by observation to be suspended                   in the atmosphere is a
  matter of some difficulty       ;   but an approximation may be made to it
  as  follows : —
     Let    us suppose   the weight     of  the -.v.pour to be measured,      as is often
  done in the case     of  the entire atmosphere, by the height            of a column
  of  the density observed     at the surface.        The height of    a homogeneous
  atmosphere of vapour, equivalent to an independent vapour atmo
  sphere,    on Dalton's hypothesis          would obviously be $ of the height
  of the homogeneous air       atmosphere, that is         f of 26,250 feet, or about
  42,000 feet.
     But    the vapour actually existing is much less than this.                 Taking
  the results     of Dr. Hooker's       observations, and considering the den
  sity at the surface to be unity, the mean density of the whole vapour
 below 20,000 feet will readily be calculated to be about -47                  ; so  that
 the whole of the vapour up to this height would be equivalent to a
 homogeneous         column of 9460 feet of density 1*0.              Now it may       be
 assumed approximately that the quantity               of vapour    above 20,000 feet
 will   bear the same relation to the entire quantity, as holds good be
 tween the densities      at that height and at the surface ; and as we see
 from the Table that the density at 20,000 feet is                ^ of what it is at
 the surface,     we may infer that this is the proportion              of the vapour
above that altitude, the remainder, or               t"jL, being below it. Conse
quently the       whole quantity of vapour, according to Dr. Hooker's
observations,       would be equivalent to a homogeneous column of
 X9460, or 11,260 feet.           Using     the balloon observations, the height
would be rather less than this, viz. 10,050 feet, so that we may infer
that the actual pressure of the vapour in the atmosphere is to that
represented      by the tension at the surface of the earth, as 10,500 to
42,000, or       as  about one to four        ; and this ratio would also subsist
between the actual pressures           and observed tensions at all elevations.
    The problem wight otherwise be solved, by comparing the dimi
nution of density as we ascend, according to Dalton's hypothesis,

                                               189
and the observations,            as  shown by the series of figures in Table            I.
This diminution, it will          be seen, takes place in all the series, approxi
mately in          a geometrical ratio,    so that the density is reduced nearly in
an equal proportion for each 2000 feet                 of   ascent, namely, from I'OO
to *96, that is by yf^, on Dalton's hypothesis                 ; from 1-00 to *84, that
is by      -J^g-,   according to Dr. Hooker        ;  and from l'OO to *82, that is
by    -j-'J^, according to       Mr. Welsh.       Now it follows, from        an obvious
mathematical law, that the entire quantities of vapour in these dif
ferent cases are inversely proportional                 to the constant reduction       of
 density      ; so    that the quantity on Dalton's hypothesis, which is that
represented          by the observed tension at the surface, is to the quantity
 according to Dr. Hooker,              as sixteen   to four, and to the quantity ac
cording to Mr. Welsh,               as  eighteen to four, a result nearly identical
 with the former.             The subtraction of the        observed  tension  of vapour
 from the total barometrical pressure, in the hope of obtaining the
 simple gaseous pressure, must consequently be denounced as an ab
 surdity       ;  and the barometrical pressure thus corrected,           as it is called,
 has no true meaning whatever.
     In     conclusion,     I  would remark that the consideration of the small
 quantity of vapour that is disseminated in the upper parts of the
 atmosphere,          shows us that inequalities       of level  on the earth's surface,
 which are insignificant when viewed                 in relation to the dimensions of
 the globe, become objects of the greatest                    importance in connexion
  with the atmosphere which surrounds it. Three-fourths of the whole
  mass       of  the air is within range      of the influence of    the highest moun
  tains     ; one-half of the air and nearly nine-tenths of the vapour are
  concentrated within            about 19,000 feet of the sea-level,             a height
  which hardly exceeds the mean level of the crest of the Himalaya                         ;
  while one-fourth of the air and one-half of the vapour are found be
  low a height of 8500 feet.              Thus, mountains even of moderate mag
  nitude may produce important changes                     in very large masses of the
  atmosphere,          as regards their movements,        their temperature, and their
  hygrometric state           ; and especially in those strata that contain the
  great bulk of the watery vapour, and that have the greatest effect
  therefore in determining the character of climate.

                                                (Abstract.)
      Since my last communication to the Society*,                                     I    have      succeeded
in obtaining the cyanide of ethylene in a state of purity by a slight
modification of the process                    I have    already given.               A detailed           account
of it will   be found           in the paper which                accompanies          this abstract.
     This   is,
             I      believe,         the first example of          a    diatomic cyanide.                    It    has
the following properties in addition to those                           I       have        already enume

        :
solid of    a   light-brown           colour, above that temperature                                  a   fluid oil.
Its    specific     gravity          at 45° Cent.            is   1*023.        It    has an acrid dis
agreeable         taste.        It   is   neutral to test-paper.                 It   is    decomposed               by
potassium, cyanide of potassium being formed.                                    Its solution                 water
                           by                                                                             it in
is   not affected               nitrate of silver.            Heated with nitric acid,                            gives
succinic acid and nitrate of ammonia.                              Heated with muriatic acid,                        it
yields the same acid and muriate of ammonia.                                          It    forms an inter
esting compound with nitrate of silver, which was obtained in the
following manner            :   — About three equivalents of crystallized nitrate
of silver    were rubbed up in                  a   mortar with one equivalent of pure
cyanide of ethylene and                   a   considerable quantity of ether.                         The ether
was then poured off, and the residual salt dissolved in boiling alcohol.
On cooling, the alcohol                     became       a    mass   of brilliant pearly plates.
Submitted to analysis, these yielded results agreeing with the for
mula C4H4Cya+ 4(AgO, N06). The crystals are soluble in water
and alcohol, insoluble in ether. When heated, they melt and explode
like gunpowder.                 They      do not detonate            on percussion.                   This        com
pound may possibly throw some light on the constitution                                                     of the
fulminates.
I      have also slightly modified the process                        I     gave           in my last note
for    succinic       acid.          The modified             process      is   very productive, and
yields the acid at once in                 a     of purity. From 1500 grains of

33 per cent.      It   gave on analysis 40*54 instead         of 40,07 per cent. of
carbon.
    We   are now enabled,       thanks to the researches of Messrs. Perkin
and Duppa      and     of M. Kekule*, to build up three highly complex
organic acids (succinic, paratartaric, and malic) from a simple hydro
carbon ; and, what is more important, we are enabled to do this by
processes every stage       of which   is perfectly intelligible.
    With the view of ascertaining whether or not the homologuei of
succinic acid could be obtained in a similar manner,                  I  have endea
voured to prepare pyrotartaric acid from the cyanide of propylene,
propylene being the radical of propylglycol.
    Preparation of Cyanide of Propylene. — A mixture of one equi
valent of bromide of propylene and two of cyanide of potassium, to
gether with a considerable quantity of alcohol, was exposed to the
temperature of a water-bath for about sixteen hours.                     The alcohol
was then filtered and distilled.          A liquid     residue was thus obtained,
which was dissolved in ether.              The body left       on evaporating the
etherial solution was then submitted to distillation.                   Almost the
 entire liquid passed over between 2G5° and 290° Cent.                  The fraction
 distilling  between     277° and 290° Cent. was collected apart and ana
lysed.     It gave 62*0 instead      of 63-8 per     cent.  of carbon.     This body
cannot be obtained purer by distillation under atmospheric pressure,
as  it suffers partial decomposition during the process.
    The properties of this cyanide very much resemble those of the
preceding.      It differs, however, in its physical state, which is that
of a liquid at the ordinary temperature of the air. It is soluble in
water, alcohol, and ether.          It  has an acrid taste.         It  is neutral to
test-paper.     It   is decomposed       by potassium, cyanide of potassium
being formed.         Its solution in water       does not precipitate nitrate     of
silver.    Heated with potash, it is resolved into an acid and ammonia.
    Formation     of Pyrotartaric Acid. —A mixture of                one volume    of
cyanide of propylene and about L£ volume of strong muriatic acid
was exposed in a sealed tube to the temperature of a water-bath
for   a few hours.       On cooling, the contents of the tube became a
mass    of crystals.       These were dried and dissolved in absolute
alcohol.     The residue obtained on evaporating the alcoholic solu-

tion was then twice crystallized            from water,   and finally   digested
with ether.      The hody left on distilling off the ether is the acid in
question. The numhers obtained on analysis agree very well with
the formula of pyrotartaric acid ; I got 44-6 instead of 45'4 per cent.
of carbon.      It  had also all the properties ascribed        to this acid by
 Pelouze and Arppe.          The crystals     were colourless, and very soluble
in water, alcohol, and ether.          It   had an agreeable     acid taste.    It
 became     semi-fluid    at   100°   Cent., and melted       completely a few
 degrees    above    that    temperature.       Long-continued     ebullition   in
 a glass   tube converted      it into an oil, which was insoluble in cold
 water, and no       longer affected     litmus-paper,    but which gradually
 dissolved in hot water, recovering at the same time its acid reaction.
 The following equation will explain the reaction which              gives   hirth
 to this acid  :
          C, He Cya+2 H Cl+8 HO = C»0H8 08+2 (N H. CI).
     It is highly probable that there exists a series of isomeric            acids
 running parallel to these, which may be obtained by similar pro
 cesses from the diatomic radicals contained in the aldehydes.               Thus
 from cyanide of ethylidene (C4 H4 Cya)              we may hope to        get  an
  isomer of succinic acid.
     I propose to    continue my researches in this direction, and to ex
  tend them to the cyanides        of the triatomic radicals.

                                   (Abstract.)
   The well-known theory of exchanges, which was proposed by the
late Prof. Prevost of Geneva, is built upon the fact that a substance
placed anywhere within         an enclosure      of   a constant temperature        will
ultimately attain the temperature of the enclosure.
   In his theory M. Prevost supposes that a constant, mutual, and
equal interchange     of radiant heat    takes place between             the body and
the enclosure which surrounds          it,   so that, receiving back precisely
that heat which      it   gives away, the former        is   enabled to remain at     a
constant temperature.
  With    respect to this radiation, which        is   thus supposed to be con
stantly taking place between substances               at the same temperature,       it
had until lately been conceived        of    as proceeding mainly,          if  not en
tirely, from the surface       of bodies —   a   very thin film or plate         of any

                                        194
substance    being supposed to furnish the maximum amount of radia
tion which that substance was capable of affording.
    It lately occurred to the author of this paper, reasoning from the
theory of exchanges,      that mere surface      radiation is not sufficient to
account for the equilibrium of temperature which exists between a
body and the enclosure which surrounds it.
   These theoretical conclusions have been amply verified by experi
ment, and the subject has been discussed in a paper published in
                                                                    '
the ' Transactions     of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the year
1858.      As the chain of reasoning by which this fact is deduced
theoretically from the law of exchanges,            and the experimental evi
dence upon which       it rests, are both     of  a very simple nature,      it has
been thought well to restate them here before proceeding further in
this investigation.
    Let  us imagine to ourselves       an enclosure    of lamp-black kept at a
constant temperature, and containing two pieces of polished rock-
salt similar to one another, except that the thickness of the one is
greater than that of the other.
    Now it is evident that       since the   thick  piece absorbs more      of the
heat which falls upon it from the sides of the enclosure            than the thin
piece, it must likewise radiate more in order that it may always re
main at the same temperature.              Here then we have the fact of in
ternal radiation in the case of rock-salt deduced         as a  theoretical conse
quence   of the law of exchanges     ; experimentally it is found that a thick
piece   of rock-salt radiates   very considerably more than a thin piece.
   The fact of internal radiation being conceded, it is               easy to see
that the amount of heat which a particle radiates must                be indepen
dent of its distance from the surface.           For   besides    that this is the
simplest hypothesis, the absorption, and consequently the radiation
of two similar plates of rock-salt placed with their           surfaces  together,
ought to be the same       as from   a  single plate of double the thickness       ;
and experiment shows that this is the case.
   It  being therefore supposed that the internal radiation of a particle
is independent of its distance from the surface, let us imagine              a  row
of particles A, B, C, D in the midst of         a substance      of constant   tem
perature which extends indefinitely on all sides of them.               There will
be a certain stream     of radiant   heat constantly flowing past any         such
particle   A to  go in the direction     AB.

                                          195
     Now, since the radiation is supposed to be the same for the different
  particles A, B, C, D, it follows that the absorption of the stream of
  heat by these particles must also be the same for each              ;  and in order
  that this may be the case, it is necessary that the stream which im
  pinges on one particle be the same in quantity and in quality                 as that
  which impinges upon another.            This consideration      leads us to a me
  thod of viewing internal radiation, which is wholly independent of the
 diathermanous or athermanous character of the body.                    For whatever
 be the absorption      of a particle for any description       of   heat, its radia
 tion must necessarily      be precisely the same in order that the stream
 of   heat  in  passing the particle may be      just   as much recruited by its
 radiation as it is reduced by its absorption         ;  in other words, we may
 regard the substance        through     which the heat passes           as perfectly
 diathermanous.
     We gain another advantage        by this method of viewing the subject            :
 for, in the law which is expressed by saying that the absorption of a
 particle is equal to its radiation, and that for every description of
 heat, the word description is used          to define and separate those rays
 of  heat which are absorbed       in different proportions by the same sub
 stance.     Therefore in any problem connected with this subject we
 may suppose that a separate equilibrium holds for every such ray.
    Now it     is well known that rays       of different wave-lengths         are ab
 sorbed    in different proportions       by the    same     substance.      We     are
therefore entitled to suppose          that a separate      equilibrium     holds for
 each wave-length.         The   advantage     of this   is obvious in problems
which admit of the application of optical principles.                   But we may
go even further.       For we know that in tourmaline, and in some other
crystals cut parallel to the optic axis, the ordinary ray is more ab
sorbed than the extraordinary         ; and the   experiments of Prof. Kirch-
hoff and the author have shown that in tourmaline the ordinary ray
is also radiated in excess.     It thus   appears that, in the case      of crystals,
we have not only a separate          equilibrium    for   each wave-length, but
for each of the two rays into which the incident ray is divided.
    The following method of comparing together             two streams     of radiant
heat has been       adopted — Consider
                             :                a square     unit of surface to be
placed in the midst of      a  solid of indefinite thickness on all sides, and
find the amount of radiant heat which passes across this square unit
of  surface   in unit of time in directions very nearly perpendicular to

                                          196
the surface, and comprehending an exceedingly small solid angle                 £<p.
Call this     heat   Rtty, then   R may      be viewed as the intensity     of the
radiation in this direction.
   Let    us now suppose        that we have a uniaxal crystal of indefinite
thickness bounded by          a plane   surface,    and that parallel to this sur
face, and separated      from it by    a   vacuum, we have a surface of lamp
black, the whole being kept at         a   constant temperature.
   Let us take      a square unit     of this     surface,  and consider the heat
from the lamp-black           which falls upon it through          an exceedingly
small solid angle in       a  direction not necessarily      perpendicular to the
surface.      Part of this heat will      be refracted into the interior    of the
crystal in two rays, the ordinary and the extraordinary.                There will
be thus two separate         bundles of refracted rays, the solid angle com
prised by the individual         rays of the one being different from that
comprised by the rays of the other              ;  the inclination to the surface
also being different for each bundle.
    Now, on the principle of       a separate     equilibrium for each ray, these
entering bundles of rays must respectively equal the rays of the same
kind which emerge from the crystal in the same directions.
    Hence     if we know the radiation        of lamp-black,     and the direction
in which the rays under consideration strike the surface of the crystal,
 as also    the angle which the latter makes with the optic axis, it is
 conceivable     that, by means of optical principles, joined to the fact of
 the equality between the entering and emerging bundles of rays, we
 may be enabled ultimately to ascertain the internal radiation through
 the crystal in different directions.
    A  little consideration, however, will show that this method of pro
 cedure presupposes       a certain mutual adaptation to exist between the
 optical principles employed and the theory of exchanges.                 For it is
 evident that the expression for the internal radiation in any direction
 may be obtained by operating upon terminal surfaces                 bearing every
 possible inclination to the optic axis.
    But the internal radiation,          if  the law of exchanges      be true, is
 clearly independent of the position of this surface, which is indeed
 merely employed as an expedient.              This is equivalent to saying that
 the constants which define        the position of the bounding surface must
 ultimately disappear from the expression for the internal radiation.
    The author then       endeavours     to show that such an adaptation does

                                        197
really exist, and that the expression          for the internal radiation is in
dependent     of the position   of the surface.
    For  the extraordinary ray, the internal radiation is found to be
where   R   is the radiation from lamp-black        ;
and for the ordinary,              R-= —     ;
where n denotes        the   axial and m the equatorial radius            of the
ellipsoid into which the extraordinary ray will have spread               in the
crystal in the same time that in vacuo it would have spread into a
sphere    whose radius     = unity    ;  and lastly,    r denotes  the radius of
this ellipsoid in the direction in which the internal radiation is mea
sured.
    The author concludes by remarking that                the fundamental    law,
which is intimately connected           with the theory of exchanges,         and
which renders an equilibrium            of temperature possible in the case
under consideration, seems to           be the law of the equality between
action and reaction in the impact of elastic bodies.
    He   also   considers that the law which is expressed              by saying
"That the absorption of         a particle is equal to its radiation, and that
 for every   description of heat,"      expresses    another law of action and
reaction which holds when the motion which constitutes radiant heat
is not conveyed from particle to particle without              loss, or when the
bodies under consideration are not perfectly elastic.
    These two laws of action and reaction are viewed              as supplement
ing each other,     so as to  render that equilibrium of temperature which
 is demanded by the theory of exchanges               possible under all circum
stances.

     Some     time ago*,    Principal James       1). Forbes    showed that two
slabs   of ice, having each a face ground tolerably flat, and being both
suspended       in an atmosphere a little above the freezing-point           upon a
horizontal rod of glass passed through two holes in the plates of ice,
so that the plates        might hang vertically        and in contact with one
another, would unite gradually so            as   to adhere    strongly together.
This interesting experiment Principal Forbes adduced as being in
opposition to the theory offered by mef of the plasticity of ice, and
of the tendency of pieces of thawing               ice to unite when placed in
contact.       He thought it showed that          pressure  was not essential       to
the union of the two pieces of ice.              I  pointed out, in reply    J,  that
the film of water between the two slabs, being held up against gravity
by the capillary tension or contractile force of its free upper surface,
and being distended besides against the atmospheric pressure, by the
contractile force of its free surface round its whole perimeter — except
for a very small space at bottom, from which water trickle* away, or
is on the point of trickling away, — exists under              a pressure    which,
though increasing from above downwards, is everywhere, except at
that little space near the bottom, less than atmospheric pressure                 : —
that hence the two slabs are urged against one another by the excess
of the external atmospheric        pressure    above the internal water press
ure, and are thus pressed        against one another by         a force quite not
able   in amount ; — that, further, the film of water existing          as  it  does,
under less than atmospheric pressure, has its freezing-point raised in
virtue of the reduced pressure         ;  and would therefore freeze even at
the temperature of the surrounding           ice, which    I took to be the free
zing-point for atmospheric pressure          ;  and would still more strongly

be impelled to freeze       by the joint action of this condition with the
cold given out in the melting by pressure of the ice at the points of
contact where the two slabs are urged against one another.
   To this explanation of Principal Forbes's experiment I still adhere
as  mainly correct, though admitting of some further development
and slight modification in reference to       a point to which      I shall have
to make further       allusion in what follows, and which seems to me to
be as yet rather obscure : — the influence, namely,         of   the tension in
the ice due to its own weight, which makes it not be subject in
ternally to simply atmospheric pressure : —and though I shall also, in
what follows, point out some additional conditions, almost necessarily
present in the experiment, which, under my general view of the
plasticity of ice, would act in conjunction with those already adduced,
and would increase the rapidity of the union.
   Professor Faraday, holding it in view to remove              the ground on
which my explanation of Principal Forbes's experiment was founded,
has contrived and carried out a set of new and very beautiful experi
ments from which the capillary action referred to has been com
pletely eliminated, and he has still found the union of the ice to
occur, and to increase with time, and has met with              a  curious addi
tional phenomenon of "flexible adhesion"*.             In these experiments,
when two pieces of ice, rounded so as to be convex at their points
where mutual contact is to be allowed, are placed in water, and are
either anchored so      as to be  wholly under water, or are placed floating
when    so  formed that they can touch one another only under water,
and that, at the water surface, there shall be         a  wide space between
them    so  that there    shall be no capillary action drawing them to
gether, he showed that the pieces of ice, in either of these cases,             if
brought gently into contact, will adhere together         ; unless indeed the
movement bringing them into contact be so directed              as to  introduce
forces capable of tearing them apart again by obliquity of action, by
agitation of the water, or by other disturbances.             He showed      also
that,  if  when the two pieces of ice have become attached at their
point of contact,    a  slight force, such as may be given by one or two
feathers, be applied, tending to separate         them, at one side of their
point of contact, they will roll round one another with a seemingly
flexible adhesion    ;  or that,  if the point of a floating wedge-shaped

the pieces be allowed to remain for a few moments                                      in contact, their
adhesion will become rigid, so that on a force being applied sufficient
to break through the joint, the rupture will occur with a crackling
noise, though the pieces may still continue to hold together, rolling
on one another with the flexible adhesion.                            He     made some other ex
periments nearly the same as these, but in which he showed the
flexible and rigid adhesion to occur while there is constantly                                   a decided
tensile force applied externally tending to pull the pieces asunder
instead of any external force tending to press them together.                                             He
thinks that the phenomena of flexible and rigid adhesion                                          " under
tension" go towards showing that pressure                             is not necessary            to " re-
gelation."             He then      gives    his own idea of the flexible and rigid
adhesion in the following words                  :   — " Two        convex        surfaces     of ice   come
together        ;    the particles of water nearest to the place of contact, and
therefore within the efficient sphere of action of those particles of ice
which are on both sides of them, solidify                       ;    if the       condition of things
be left for a moment, that the heat evolved by the solidification may
be conducted away                  and dispersed, more particles will solidify, and
ultimately           enough to form a fixed and rigid junction, which will
remain until a force sufficiently great to break through it is applied.
But   if   the direction of the force resorted to can be relieved                                  by any
hinge-like motion at the point of contact, then                          I think         that the union
is broken up amongst the particles on the opening side of the angle,
whilst the particles on the closing side come within the effectual
regelatiou distance            ;    regelation ensues           there and              the adhesion is
maintained, though in an apparently flexible state.                                     The flexibility
appears       to me to be due to             a series      of ruptures            on   one side of the
centre     of contact, and of               adhesion       on   the other, — the regelation,
which is dependent             on the vicinity of the ice surfaces,                           being trans
ferred     as       the place of efficient vicinity is changed.                          That the       sub
stance we are considering is as brittle as ice, does not make any                                        dif
ficulty to me in respect of the flexible adhesion                             ;    for   if   we suppose
that the point of           contact exists only at one particle, still the angular
motion at that point must bring               particle into contact (to
                                                       a second
suffer regelation) before separation could occur at the first ; or   as                                 if,
seems proved             by   the supervention of the rigid adhesion upon the

                                              201
flexible state, many particles are concerned                           at once,        it is not possible
that all these should be broken through                            by a force applied on one
side   of   the place   of    adhesion,      before      particles on the opposite side
should have the opportunity of regelation, and so of continuing the
adhesion."
  The interpretation thus put by Prof. Faraday                                     on his experiments
is not convincing to me               ;   but, on the contrary,                    I   think the experi
ments are in perfect accordance                   with my own theory, and tend to its
confirmation.        My view of the phenomena of these experiments is as
follows : — The first     contact of the two pieces of ice cannot occur
without      impact and consequent                 pressure        ;    and,       small      as    the total
force may be, its intensity must be great,                             as     the surface          of contact
must be little more than          a   geometrical point.                    This       pressure     produces
union by the process of melting and regelation described by me in pre
vious papers.         On the application of the forces from the two feathers,
at one side of the point of contact, tending to cause separation,
the isthmus of ice formed by the union of the two pieces comes to
act as a tie or fulcrum subject to tensile force                               ;   and consequently a
corresponding pressure will occur at the side of the isthmus, far from
the feathers     ;   and that pressure            will   effect the union                of   the ice at the
side where it occurs.           The       tensile force,      it       may readily be supposed,
tends to preserve the isthmus, internally at least, in the state                                          of   ice,
whatever may be its influence on the external molecules of the isth
mus, and to solidify such water as, having occupied pores in the in
 terior during previous compression, may now, by the linear tension
 or pull, be reduced          in cubical pressure or hydrostatic pressure, be
 cause the melting-point          of      wet ice is raised by diminution                          of   pressure
 of the water in contact with it*.                   The pull applied to the isthmus
   * How     the turface of a bar of ice immersed in cold water, as distinguished
 from the interior of the bar, may in respect to tendency cither to melt away, or
 to solidify to itself additional ice from the water, bo influenced by the applica
 tion of linear tension       to the bar,     I    am not quite prepared
                                                               to say positively.
 The   application of tension, whether linear, superficial, or cubical (that                                     is,
 whether simply in one direction, or in two directions crossing one another, or
 in three directions crossing one another), to piece of ice immersed in water at
                                                          a
 any given pressure, atmospheric for instance,    very distinct from the applica
                                                              is
 tion of what might bo called cubical tension, that                     is,
                                                       diminution of hydrostatic
 pressure, to the surrounding water.    In the former case the pressure of the
 water at the external surface of the ice will not be redueed by the application of
 the tension to the ice though that of the water in the internal pores may, or
                          ;

                                                     202
thus appears               to put it out of the condition in which my theory has
clearly indicated             a cause      of plasticity,       and   I   presume makes it cease,
or almost entirely cease, to be plastic.                          I   believe no plastic yielding
of   ice to tension has been discovered by observation in any case, and
I    think there           are theoretical reasons why ice should be expected to
be very brittle in respect to tensile forces.                             The isthmus then being
supposed          devoid      of plasticity at its extended                   side, ultimately breaks
at that side, when the opening motion caused by the feathers has
arrived at a sufficient amount to cause fracture, and the ice newly
formed on the compressed                       side comes now to act as a tie instead                 of
the part which has undergone disruption, and holds together the two
pieces      of    ice, or serves as a fulcrum under tension to communicate a
compressive            force to the points of the two pieces of ice immediately
beyond it          ;   and    so the rolling            action with       a   constant union at the
point of contact goes forward.                       It   is to be observed that the leverage
probably in many of them must, be so ; but in the second case, the diminution
of cubical pressure in the external water effects the same diminution of press
ure in the ice, and also in the water occupying pores                          in the ice.   The theory
and quantitative calculation which                   I
                                     originally gave (Transactions Roy. Soc.
Edin. vol. xiv. part 5. 1849, and Cambridge and Dublin Math. Journ. Nov.
1850)     of     the effect   of   increase     of   pressure   in lowering the freezing-point of
water, and        of course    also   of   the effect     of diminution of pressure in raising        it,
applied solely to effects of pressure communicated to the ice through the teater,
and therefore equal in all directions, and equally occurring in the ice and the
water but when changes of pressure in one or more directions are applied to
        ;
the ice as distinguished from the water, the theory does not apply in any precise
way to determine the conditions of the melting of the ice, or of its growth by
the freezing of the adjacent water to its surface.  There seems to me to be yet
a field open for much additional theoretical and experimental investigation in
this respect   but so far as
                  ;            have applied the principle of the lowering of the
                                      I
freezing-point of water by pressure in developing or sketching out a theory of
the plasticity of ice,   thinkI   have done so correctly.
                                           I                   perceived that theI
application of pressures tending to change the form of the ice must necessarily
produce volumo-compression in some parts of the mass, accompanied by the
occurrence of increased fluid pressure in the pores which might already exist in
those parts, or which would arise in them as        consequence of the pressure
                                                                  a                                   ;
and this  Ithought was a sufficient basis on which to rest the theory, even with
out precise knowledge of all the varying influences on the melting or freezing
of the ice or water, of all the possible varieties of pressures or stresses that
could be applied to the ice, and of fluid pressure that could occur in the water
contemporaneously with those stresses in the ice. Some additional develop
ments     of this part of the subject, which               have occurred       to me, may,
                                                                                         I    hope, form
the subject     of future paper.
                       a

                                          203
of the   forces   applied by the feathers is so great, compared with the
distance   from the fulcrum or tensile part of the isthmus, to the com
pressed   part in process        of formation      at the other side, as that the
compression may usually be considered almost equal to the tension :
and the tension in the extended part cannot be of small intensity,
being sufficient to break that side of the isthmus.                    In the experi
ments which gave flexible adhesion seemingly               under tension, it is not
to be admitted that tension was really the condition under which the
ice existed    at the places where the union was occurring.                    To apply
a simple disruptive force to the whole isthmus                   of ice,  it would   be
necessary    to take very special       precautions in order to arrange that
the line of application of the disruptive forces             should pass through
the point of contact of the two pieces.              If  that were done, and the
forces were gradually increased          till the  cohesive   strength of the isth
mus were overcome,         it is clear that the two pieces of ice would sepa
rate  altogether, and there would be no flexible adhesion                    ;  but the
flexible adhesion, when it occurs, is essentially dependent                     on the
existence    of  an intense     pressure at the side of the isthmus remote
from the line of the externally applied disruptive forces, or of the
single force applied in some of the experiments to one only of the
pieces, and resisted by the inertia          of the other.
   It is further to be observed        that tremors and slight agitations to
which the two pieces of ice united at their point of contact, may be
subject, arising from undulations imparted to the water in which the
ice is immersed, by manipulation               of  the  experimenter, — from the
tread of people on adjacent floors, — from the passage of vehicles on
neighbouring      streets,  — from    convective     movements       of the water, —
and from other causes, — will         be sources     of power or    energy operative
in bringing about an increase of adhesion with time                  ;  that is to say,
in changing gradually the flexible into the rigid adhesion.
   It will now of course be obvious that the conditions involved in
the explanation just offered           of Prof. Faraday's experiments must
also usually be     present in the experiment of Principal Forbes. Their
incidental    occurrence, however,        as   additional causes increasing the
rapidity of the union of the two slabs of ice, does not overthrow the
particular explanation of Principal Forbes' s experiment which                    I had
offered  as a   perfect answer to the objection raised by that experiment
 against my general view of the plasticity of ice              ;  and as indicating

                                          201
clearly and certainly the occurrence           of all the conditions required for
the union of the two pieces of ice           under my theory. The contingent
occurrence of the additional conditions now specially brought                   for
ward, was indeed from the first somewhat                familiar to my mind, but
was left out     of the explanation as being unessential and not perhaps
quite so    clearly apparent. Their occurrence has, however, now be
come     essential   to the explanation of Prof. Faraday's             new experi
ments    : —and    by it I consider these are shown not to militate against
my general        theory of the plasticity of ice, but to corroborate              it
strongly,     and   to confirm its application           to the various observed
 cases   of the union of two            pieces    of moist ice when placed in
 contact.

                                    in the Chair.
     Sir Andrew Scott Waugh           was admitted into the Society.
     The Croonian         Lecture was          then delivered by C.    E. Brown-
 Sequard, M.D., F.R.S., "On                   the Relations between Muscular
 Irritability, Cadaveric Bigidity, and Putrefaction."
     The object of this lecture is chiefly to try                 to establish   the
 following law : — The greater the            degree   of muscular irritability at
  the time    of death, the later the cadaveric rigidity sett in and the
  longer   it  lasts, and    the   later also putrefaction        appears and the
  slower it progresses.
      Many physiologists        have    already shown        that  in certain cases
  cadaveric    rigidity  appears    late and lasts long when muscular         irrita
  bility is powerful at the time of           death  ;  but the great generality of
  this result and its prevalence          as   a law, had not been established,
  nor had the general         relation of these        conditions  of the muscular
  system to putrefaction, as stated in the above law, been               enunciated
  before my first researches on this subject*.
     * In 1849 and 1850 I published a summary of some experiments the object
  of which was to prove the existence of the above law. In a paper read at the
   Academic des Sciences of Paris, and in 1857, 1 related some new experiments

                                              205
     The law      I  wish to establish is borne out by a great many facts,
 observed in the lower animals and in man, showing that every cause
 of  increase    in  the degree    of muscular irritability a short time before
 death,    may be      considered as a cause of delay of the setting in of
 cadaveric     rigidity and of the persistence         of that post-mortem       state  of
 muscles,     and also a cause of delay of the time at which putrefaction
 manifests itself in muscles, and an evident slowness of the process of
 putrefaction      ; while, on the contrary, every cause of decrease in the
 degree    of muscular irritability          some time before death,      produces the
 opposite effect on cadaveric            rigidity  and putrefaction.
    I   will    examine      successively        the   relations    existing    between
 muscular irritability, post-mortem rigidity and putrefaction in the
 various following cases : — 1st, in paralysed muscles ; 2nd, in muscles
 the temperature of which                 is diminished      before   death ;   3rd, in
 animals or men killed by lightning                or by galvanism     ; 4 th, in over
 driven cattle, in cocks after         a  fight, in men after over-exertion, and in
 animals hunted to death         ;  5th, in men dying in a good state of health
 or after prolonged disease          ;   6th, in men who have died of cholera,
 of   tetanus,    or after other          convulsive    diseases ;  7th, in men      and
animals killed by poison.
    1st.   Irritability, cadaveric rigidity and putrefaction in paralysed
muscles.    —I    have shown long          agot that during     a certain period after
the beginning of a paralysis, the paralysed muscles are endowed with
more      irritability than healthy muscles.               I  have   ascertained     this
fact in various ways       ; but the most decisive method consists in com
paring the duration of irritability in a paralysed muscle and in the
corresponding healthy one of the opposite side, while they are both
submitted to the same excitation.                   I have   often found in experi
menting in that way, that the paralysed muscle remained irritable
twice, three times, or even four times as long                as the healthy one.
    The following experiments, taken out of many of the                    same kind,
while they show that muscular irritability is increased in consequence
having the same bearing.        (See Comptes Rendus de la Soc. de Biologie, vol. i.
1849, pp. 39, 138, 154 and 173, and vol. ii. 1859, p. 194 ; also Comptes Rendus

of paralysis, show          also that in such conditions cadaveric            rigidity  sets
in late and lasts long, and that putrefaction                      also  appears late and
progresses      slowly.
    (1)   In   the muscles of the leg of a dog, paralysed by section of the
roots of the sciatic nerve, on one side, in the spinal canal, there was
an    excessive     irritability at the time of death (by asphyxia), five
hours after the section of the nerve-roots. In the paralysed muscles
irritability lasted ten hours ; cadaveric rigidity appeared nearly at
the time of the cessation of irritability*, and lasted nearly thirteen
daysf- Putrefaction was evident only on the beginning of the fifteenth
day, and it was not very much advanced                         on the seventeenth      day.
In the healthy leg muscular irritability                lasted but four hours, and was,
as usual, at once             followed by some degree of cadaveric                rigidity.
During nearly           five    days this rigidity lasted,         and  putrefaction was
evident     as soon as      the sixth day, and much advanced on the seventh,
at a time when the paralysed                    limb was still perfectly rigid.        The
temperature of the room during the fortnight the experiment lasted
ranged between             6° and      11° Cent.       (42°-8    to 51°-8 Fahr.)        The
 following shows at a glance the differences                   between the two legs :—
                                 Durat. of irrit.   Durat. of cad. rigid.  Advanced  putref.
 Paralysed muscles           . .  10 hours.               13 days.           17th day.
 Healthy muscles           ...      4 hours.                5 days.            7th day.
     (2)  I have     found that muscular irritability is very much increased
 in the paralysed limb of an animal on which a lateral half of the
 spinal cord has been divided transversely in the dorsal region.                          In
 this case,     as well    as   after paralysis from section of a nerve, cadaveric
 rigidity    sets in later and lasts longer, and putrefaction appears later,
 and proceeds          slower     in the paralysed hind leg (on the side of the
 section of the cord) than in the other.
     (3) A month after the section of a nerve we have another kind of
 verification of the law            : irritability   is then diminished      in the para
 lysed muscles       ;   and we find that cadaveric rigidity sets in sooner and
    * Usually    some muscles or some parts of a muscle are already rigid while irri
 tability still remains in other parts.        This was the case in a marked manner in the
 above experiment, especially in the paralysed leg.
    f  In dogs, cadaveric rigidity lasts longer than in most other animals.           I have
 seen it lasting twenty-six days in a healthy dog killed by asphyxia in midwinter
 in Paris.

  lasts  a less  time  ;   and that putrefaction appears          sooner and proceeds
  quicker in them than in the healthy muscles.
      2nd. Influence of a diminution of temperature of muscles before
  death upon their irritability, cadaveric rigidity, and putrefac
  tion. — I found many years             ago that all the vital properties         of the
  nervous centres, the nerves            and    the muscles, in adult as well        as in
 young warm-blooded animals, may be much increased in consequence
 of a diminution of temperature of               these organs.      The following      ex
  periments show that when muscular irritability is increased                    by that
 cause, the increase         has   the same influence upon cadaveric             rigidity
 and putrefaction        as  when it is caused by paralysis.
     In  two kittens three days old, and of the same litter,              I found    after
 death, (by asphyxia) the following differences               : one  of them had the
 temperature of 37° Cent. (98°-6 Fahr.) in the rectum at the time of
 death ; its muscular irritability in the posterior limbs gave way to
 cadaveric rigidity 3£ hours after the last effort at breathing                    ;  this
 rigidity   lasted   nearly three       days  ;  putrefaction began to be evident
 on the fourth day after death, and was much advanced the next day                        ;
 while in the other, the temperature of which was only 25° Cent.
 (77° Fahr.) at the time of death, muscular irritability lasted more
 than nine hours after the last breathing ; cadaveric rigidity began
 during the tenth hour and lasted nine days               ;  and putrefaction, which
began on the tenth day, was not much advanced until two days later.
     In many    other instances of newly-born cats, dogs, rabbits, and birds
 (especially ravens,        sparrow-hawks,        jays, and magpies),       I  have ob
 served similar differences          as those   observed    in the preceding experi
 ment, when       I noticed    the duration of irritability after death and its
relations     to cadaveric       rigidity   and    putrefaction,    according to the
 degree   of animal heat      at the time     of death.      As  a general  rule, when
there was      a difference    of    8° or 10° Cent.     (14° to 18° Fahr.) in the
 temperature of two animals of the same age and the same species,
muscular irritability and cadaveric rigidity lasted twice or three times
longer in the cooler animal than in the other, and putrefaction in the
former was much less rapid.
     I  have observed       the same differences also in adult               birds   and
mammals*.          It is thus clearly shown by experiment that when the

temperature of muscles is diminished before death, their irritability
lasts long after death, cadaveric                rigidity    sets in late and lasts long,
and putrefaction appears late and proceeds                      slowly.
    3rd. Influence of death by lightning and galvanism on cada
veric rigidity and putrefaction. — It is well known that J. Hunter
thought        that cadaveric          rigidity    cannot take       place   after   death   by
lightning      ;    but many facts have been recently published, showing
that in animals and men killed by lightning, cadaveric                           rigidity has
existed,     and there can indeed be no doubt                   of its occurrence in such
cases.      At      the   same    time there is reason to believe               that in some
instances      of that     mode    of death cadaveric rigidity has either not set
in, or has been of so           short a duration, that it has not been possible
to ascertain its existence.               It  appears difficult at first sight to recon
cile facts which            seem to be         so much in opposition one with               the
other   ;  but it will be seen that the contradiction is apparent only.
Death by lightning             may be the result of, — 1st, a syncope by fright,
or in consequence            of  a direct or reflex influence          of lightning     on the
par vagum         ;   2ndly, haemorrhage           in or around the brain or in the
lungs, the pericardium, &c.                ; 3rdly, concussion or some other altera
tion of the brain.            When       death by     lightning is    due to these     causes,
cadaveric rigidity may, of course, appear after death, and even last
long, much in the same way indeed                     as  when death results from these
causes     in persons         who have not been struck by lightning.                       But
lightning may kill in another way                   :  it  may destroy life as galvanism
does,     by producing           such a violent convulsion of every muscle in
 the body that muscular irritability ceases almost at once                         ;  and the
ensuing rigidity may then be of so short duration                       as to escape notice.
   The following             experiments show the             powerful influence of gal
vanism on muscular irritability, cadaveric                    rigidity, and putrefaction.
We will          at    first  give     the    results of the        galvanization     of   one
limb  : —

    In   experimenting on the whole body of an animal                   I have obtained
the most striking results.              I will only mention here the following ex
periments.          Five vigorous male adult guinea-pigs were asphyxiated
by the application of a ligature round the trachea,                   and four    of them
were galvanized immediately,              — the first with    a very powerful electro
magnetic        machine, the second with a weaker one, the third with a
still weaker       one, and the fourth by only a slight galvanic current ;
 the fifth animal was not galvanized.                 In the four galvanized animals
the conductors were applied one to the mouth, the other to the anus.

     As regards putrefaction, it already                appeared    in the first animal
 during the first hour after             death, and was much advanced             the next
 day   ;   its progress was slower in the four others, and successively
 slower in each         as  compared with the preceding one in the series.
 Considering that the power of lightning may be vastly greater than
 that of our galvanic machines,              we can easily understand that when
lightning strikes        a man   or an animal in the proper place, it must pro
 duce     a  much greater effect than galvanism, reducing the duration of
irritability to      a fraction of     a second,    and that   of  cadaveric   rigidity in
 a corresponding degree, so that no trace of it remains                   a few   minutes
after death, and in like manner hastening the access of the final pro
cess   of putrefaction.
    The results of the application of galvanism either to separate limbs
or to the whole body of animals, appear thus to show that when
lightning kills without leaving any             evident alteration adequate to cause
death, without the subsequent                appearance    of cadaveric rigidity, but
with early and rapid putrefaction, — the                 mode of action of lightning

                                         210
 is similar to that of galvanism, and consists           in a sudden and com
 plete exhaustion of the nervous and muscular tissues by over-action.
    I  have ascertained     that a galvanic current passing through a rigid
 muscle produces no change in the duration of cadaveric rigidity, and
 does not in any way hasten putrefaction.               It  seems very probable
 from this negative fact that the influence of galvanism on still irri
 table muscles is due to the contractions then produced, and not to
 some direct chemical action on the muscular tissue and on the fluids
 which surround the muscular fibres.           This probability   becomes almost
 a certainty when we know that any cause which produces muscular
 contraction acts in the same way           as  galvanism, as we have already
 seen, and as   will   be further shown in the course        of this lecture.
    4th. Influence of prolonged           muscular exercise     on cadaveric ri
 gidity and putrefaction. — It is well known that putrefaction appears
 very quickly in over-driven cattle and in animals hunted to death.
 I  had the opportunity         once,   in September 1851, near Dinan, in
 France, of observing the period of setting in of cadaveric rigidity in
 two sheep that had been over-driven to reach a fair. They were killed
 by the section of the carotid arteries.         In less than five minutes after
 death   rigidity was evident in both         of them,    and   putrefaction was
 manifest before the end of the day (in less than eight hours after
 death).
    As  cadaveric   rigidity  lasts only a short time in cocks killed      during
or shortly after a fight, and also in animals hunted to death,            J. Hun
ter was led to think that it does not come on after death in such cir
cumstances.       Mr. Gulliver     has shown this opinion to be erroneous.
He   states that fighting-cocks, as well as hares, stags, and other animals
of the   chase, become rigid at once after death          in the circumstances
referred to.     It  is well known that putrefaction occurs very quickly in
animals hunted to death,         so that every thing we know concerning
over-driven cattle, cocks after a fight, or animals hunted to death, is
in perfect harmony with the law that the exercise of muscular contrac
tion diminishes muscular irritability, and that diminished irritability
is followed by early cadaveric        rigidity, which, in its turn, promptly
gives way to a putrefaction which progresses rapidly.
    A great many      facts  seem to show that over-exertion acts           in the
same way in man as in the lower animals.               The accounts given of
soldiers slain on the battle-field, whose body and limbs retained the

                                          211
position they were in at the moment the individuals met their death,
are  doubtless to be explained on the supposition that, in consequence
of previous excessive exertion, rigidity came on at once.             In a  case of
a man    who kept his arms extended             for a long while to avoid being
drowned,     the arms after death were found rigid in the position they
had    before*.      I  was told by a military         surgeon that putrefaction
appears very soon in the corpses            of soldiers killed after the  over-ex
ertion   of  a prolonged        battle.   Thus all     we know concerning man
seems   also in harmony with the law            I  am endeavouring to illustrate.
    5th. Influence of nutrition of muscles on cadaveric rigidity and
putrefaction. — Nystenf has shown that when death occurs accident
ally in persons in health, in whom the state of nutrition of muscles
is very good, and in whom therefore these organs are endowed                 with a
high degree of irritability, cadaveric rigidity sets in long after death
and persists very long.           It is so, especially, in cases of death by de
capitation, strangulation,         asphyxia from non- toxic gases or submer
sion,   by sudden       haemorrhage      from a wound of a large artery, &c.
Nysten states that he has seen cadaveric rigidity beginning only six
teen or eighteen hours after death, and lasting six or seven days.              Dr.
 J.  A. Symonds, in an excellent article on ' Death i,' states that he has
seen   cadaveric rigidity eight days after death by hanging.              My own
 observations show that in the bodies of healthy persons decapitated
 or asphyxiated, cadaveric         rigidity does not appear sooner than ten or
 twelve hours after death, and that          it lasts more than a week when the
 weather is not extremely warm.              In the limbs of the two   decapitated
 men on whose       bodies    I  made experiments on the restoration        of mus
 cular irritability by injections of blood,          I found that there was some
 degree   of irritability thirteen or fourteen hours after       death, before any
 blood had been injected. Nysten has seen muscular irritability lasting
 twenty-six hours in       a decapitated    man, which is a fact clearly showing
 that cadaveric rigidity may appear only after twenty-six hours.
     The   reverse is seen when nutrition has been diminished for a long
 while before death.          In   a  man   who died at the Hdpital       du Grot-
  Caillou at Paris, in the summer of 1849, cadaveric rigidity became
 evident within three minutes after the last breathing, and while the

 heart was still beating twenty times in a minute, j.                 e. while the man
 was    still  alive,  iflife is considered    to persist so long as the heart beats.
 These beatings ceased only three minutes and                   a  half after     cadaveric
 rigidity had shown itself             everywhere.       A quarter of     an hour after
 wards there was no more trace of cadaveric rigidity, and in less than
 an hour after death signs             of putrefaction had    appeared      in the limbs.
 This man died of exhaustion after               a prolonged typhoid fever.
     It  seems quite evident from the above fact, and others                   of the same
 kind which         I have   not mentioned,       that the greatest     differences    exist
 as  regards cadaveric         rigidity and putrefaction in consequence              of the
 degree    of muscular irritability         at the time   of death.
     6th. Influence of convulsions            on cadaveric    rigidity and putrefac
 tion. —The law which it is my object to establish is borne out every
 day in cases in which death follows violent and prolonged convulsions.
 Sommer and other writers have seen cadaveric                    rigidity appearing so
 quickly      after   death   by   tetanus,  that   the spasmodic rigidity caused by
 the disease during life was followed by the post-mortem rigidity with
 out any interval of muscular relaxation between these two states.                       In
 a  strongly built woman, who died of hydrophobia after violent con
 vulsions,     I   found that cadaveric        rigidity had set in within the first
 hour after death, and that it ceased before the end of the tenth hour.
 In   1849     I  made many observations at the Gros-Caillou                  Hospital    in
 Paris, on corpses          of soldiers who died from            cholera,     the   general
 results of which are, — 1st, that            cadaveric   rigidity   appeared      late and
lasted long in those patients who died quickly, t.               e. before a prolonged
 alteration of nutrition         ;   2nd, that those muscles which had been at
tacked with violent and frequent cramps, became rigid very soon after
death, and remained so only a short time*.
    I  have often had the opportunity              of seeing rabbits dying from con
vulsions in cases in which the supra-renal capsules                      were     the only
organs found diseased,               and have     often  observed    in them that the
more      violent and frequent the convulsions, the earlier did cadaveric
rigidity      appear,     the sooner     it ceased, and the quicker also putrefac
tion occurred and proceeded.
    7th. Influence         of certain poisons      on cadaveric    rigidity and putre-
   * In   one ca.e cadaveric rigidity appeared in the calf of the right leg just after
death, and ceased in less than two hours; while the other muscles, which had had
no cramps, began to be rigid only five hours after death.

faction.
           —I    do not intend examining any other influence of poisons
 except   that which        is due to the production        of convulsions.       I  have
 made a great many experiments on this point, and the result has con
 stantly been in harmony with the law now under consideration.                        The
principal      poisons employed were strychnine, nicotine, picrotoxine,
 atropia, morphia, oxalic acid,             and the cyanide of mercury.           I have
 ascertained that when death is produced almost at once by these
 poisons,   there is hardly any effect to be observed on the time of access
and    duration of cadaveric rigidity and putrefaction ; but when con
 vulsions have existed for a long time before death,                   the influence is
 most remarkable.             I will mention the results of but        one experiment.
 Three dogs,        as much alike as possible,           and    apparently in perfect
 health, were poisoned by the acetate of strychnine.                       One of them
 had a dose     of   2 grains, another       half  a grain, and the third one-fourth
 of a grain.       The first    dog died at once, the second after 12 minutes,
 during    7  of which it had convulsions, the third after                  21 minutes,
 during    1 1  of which it had convulsions.

     In rabbits, guinea-pigs,          cats and birds,     as  well as  in dogs,   I have
  ascertained that when they are killed by poisons causing convulsions,
  the more violent and the more frequent the convulsions are, the
  sooner cadaveric rigidity sets in and the less is the time it lasts                ; the
  sooner also does putrefaction appear,              and the quicker is its progress.
     I corr.e now to the conclusion             of this lecture.     The    facts  I have
  mentioned show that when the degree of muscular irritability at the
  time   of death is     considerable,    either in consequence of a good state of
  nutrition,    as in persons       who die in full health from an accidental
  cause, or in consequence         of rest, as in cases    of paralysis, or   on account
  of the influence of cold, cadaveric             rigidity in all   these cases sets in
  late and lasts long, and putrefaction appears late and progresses slowly.
  The facts mentioned also clearly show that when the degree of mus
  cular irritability at the time of death is slight, cither in consequence
  of a bad state of nutrition,           or of exhaustion from over-exertion, or
  from convulsions caused by disease or poison, cadaveric rigidity sets

                                            214
 in and ceases soon, and putrefaction appears and progresses                  quickly.
  The   two distinct   series  of  facts  I  have adduced     seem, therefore, to
  bear out clearly the truth      of  the law   I have endeavoured        to establish
  on the relation between      the degree of muscular irritability and the
 period of setting in and the duration of cadaveric              rigidity, and also
 the time of appearance and the progress of putrefaction.
    The Society then adjourned          to Thursday,     May 30th.

 The reading of Dr. Edward                   Smith's Paper "On the Eli
         mination of Urea and Urinary Water, in their relation to
         the Period of the Day, Season, Exertion, Food, and other
         influences   acting on the Cycle of the Year," was resumed
         and concluded.
                                     (Abstract.)
    This communication contains the result of two principal                   series of
 inquiries which have been prosecuted by the author, viz. one upon
 himself, extending from January 1860 to March 1861, and compre
 hending 336 days      ; and the other upon four prisoners during the
 month of March 1860.
    The former      series   included     the   amounts of urea,         chloride    of
 sodium, and urinary water evolved              daily throughout       the seasons,
 and   their relation to period of the day, season, temperature, baro
 metric pressure, and also to the cycle of the week, excess of food,
and stomach derangement.             The author     also ascertained    the effect of
fasting from solid food and of drinking water, tea, coffee, and alco
hol, in the absence of breakfast and during a whole day's fast.                    The
net weight     of the body night and morning was ascertained                for many
weeks in the early part       of  1861, and      the amount     of fluid    and solid
food was recorded      during many months of the year.                During     these
inquiries the author lived in a moderate               and  regular manner, but
without      any prescribed dietary, and spent a part of August                    and

                                            215
  September        at the      sea   side.    He is     aet.  42, weighs      196 lbs.,
  and is in perfect health.              The experiments upon prisoners were
  made in Coldbath-fields           Prison, upon four prisoners in an average
  state   of health, but      below the average       weight.      The object     was to
  determine the effect of treadwheel labour.                  The prisoners worked
  the wheel three days, and pursued routine labour on other three
  days in each week, whilst they rested on the Sunday.                       Their diet
  was   good, and consisted of 20 oz. of bread, 6 oz. of cooked meat,
  8 oz.  of  potatoes,     1 pint of cocoa, and    1  pint of gruel daily, besides a
  regulated quantity of water, which they drank at prescribed periods.
 They     were under the immediate charge of an officer, and the greatest
 care was taken to ensure           accurate   results.    On treadwheel days the
 urine     was    collected     whilst   the labour was performed and before
 breakfast was taken, and at other periods of the day, in a defined
  manner.       The    faeces were    weighed, and samples of the         faeces,  urine
 and    food, were        kindly   analysed    by   Mr. Manning.          During the
 inquiry certain alterations of diet           were made       for periods of three
 days each, such as the administration               of extra    fat, tea, coffee, and
 alcohol, and the withdrawal of the chloride of sodium.
     The    analyses     for urea and chloride of sodium were made by the
 author, and Liebig's method was adopted.
     Both    series comprised more than 1200 analyses              for urea and 2000
 collections of urine.
    The following        are the principal results obtained        : —
     1.  The daily excretion of urea varied from 298 grs. to 748'5 grs.,
but on the average of the year was 519 grs., or 2*73 grs. to each
lb. of body weight.
    2. The extreme amounts of urine             were 24-5 fl. oz. and 92'6 fl. oz.,
with     a  total average       of 53*1 fl. oz.   daily.     The relation to body
weight was *28 fl. oz. to each lb.           There were noticeable daily altera
tions in the quantity, or the amounts proceeded in waves or arches,
or progressively increased or decreased in a striking manner through
a series    of days under the influence        of meteorological conditions and
the statics     of  the body.      The amounts derived from the cycle of the
year are almost identical with the average               of all recorded inquiries
made for short periods, and upon various persons,                    and show the ex
treme value of including the cycle of the year.
    3.  The    average quantity       of urea in   each oz.    of urine   was 9 *4 grs.

                                            216
   This quantity       increased   with increase of urinary water above, and de
   creased with decrease       of that fluid below the    average  ;  but the former
   in much higher proportion than the latter.
      4. The average hourly emission of urea               was on     the whole day
   21 -7 grs. ;   during the night 16-5 grs.        ; before   breakfast 20-3 grs.      ;
  and before midday 25-5 grs.               The   decrease   of the night      was 24,
   and of the early morning, or
                                         " basis quantity,"    6'4 per cent., whilst
   the increase       to mid-day was     1 1\ per  cent.    The   " basis   quantity
                                                                                       "
   was so much influenced by the amount               of urine   passed on the pre
   vious day, that it was not a good standard of comparison for its own
  day.
      The    greatest increase     of urea followed the breakfast, and the next
   followed the tea meal         ; whilst there was a considerable decrease at
  and after the hour         of the early dinner.       When    an examination was
  made      every   \ of   an hour, a maximum increase         of 54-6 grs. of urea
  and 21 oz.     of urine per hour      was found.
      5. There was        the same general      relationship of urinary water to
  the period of the day, but there was scarcely any increased evolution
  of that fluid in the afternoon.
      6. Water      taken several     times during     a day of fasting caused the
  same hourly progression in the elimination of urea and urine as
 occurs with food, except that the changes were more rapid and the
 decrease      at the end of the intervals was greater.              The maximum
 was 34*5 grs.        of urea, and 11 -5 oz.   of urine.
     7.   When water         was   taken thrice before      midday,     and   without
 breakfast, there was        a large  and rapid elimination of urea and urinary
 water    ;  but when bread, tea, coffee, and black draught were added,
 the elimination was retarded.           Alcohol with     water, taken once before
 breakfast, caused within two hours an increase of 38 to 108 per cent.
of   urea, and 246 to 554 per cent.          of urine.
     8.   With   a daily dietary    of bread and water, the hourly elimination
was the same as with ordinary food ; but when tea nud coffee were
added,      there was a less morning and a greater evening increase                 of
urea    ;  but the amount of urine was altogether lessened.
     9. There was the largest elimination             of  urea, carbonic acid, and
faeces    on the Sunday ; and on that day there was much more                    rest,
an increase      of  solid food, and a daily gain in weight      of from   1 lb. 6 oz.
to 2 lb. 3 oz.

                                           217
     10. The weight of the body was greatest              on the Sunday,       and
lessened      through      a week    of regular bodily exertion, but varied as
the food and           exertion varied.       There were variations of several
pounds recorded in each week.
     11.   The     average weight     of the solid ingesta during four months
 was 37 oz. in the week-day, and 41f oz. on the Sunday ; whilst the
 average weight of both fluid and solid ingesta was from 89^ oz. to
 95 oz., and 95f oz. at the same period.
      12. The largest average elimination            of urea and urinary water
 occurred from May to             October (viz. 5/0 grs. and 480 grs. of urea),
 and the excess of the maximum over the minimum was 46*1 and
  40-2 per cent.
      13.  The     effect  of temperature and atmospheric pressure was direct,
  and increased         the elimination of urea and urinary water ; but the
  former increase was commonly found on the succeeding                day.    When
  the two acted in the same direction, the common effect was increased ;
  but when they were opposed                they disturbed   the result.    Sudden
  increase    of temperatnre       lessened, and sudden cold increased      the eli
  mination of urea.
      14. Treadwheel labour caused an increased elimination              of  19 grs.
   of urea over that of        days  of routine labour, and    34 grains over that
  of the Sundays         ; but, in addition, the rate of elimination of urea to
   body weight was very high           ; viz. 4-39 to 4-74 grs. per lb.
      The labour of the treadwheel           was equal to lifting 354 to 413     tons
   through     1  foot per day, or to walking      about 29 miles daily.      Some
   times the effect upon the urea was deferred           until the following day.
       15.  Unusual and additional food always increase the elimination
   of  urea ;    and, with headache        and stomach derangement,      there was
   commonly a temporary diminution in the excretion.
       16. Tea, coffee, and alcohol, given to the prisoners, temporarily
   lessened the excretion        of urea and urinary water, tea having the great
   est effect     upon the urea, and alcohol upon the urinary water            ;  but
   this effect lessened after the first or second        day.    Tea increased the
   evolution of chloride of sodium, and alcohol decreased it proportion
   ally with the urine.
       1 7. When       f oz.  of chloride of sodium  was withheld from the food,
   the same quantity was absent iu the urine.
       18.  The amount of feces          was very large in the prisoners (8-55 oz.

                                       218
 average),    and contained 4 1*8 grs. of nitrogen daily.            It  was largest
 on the Sunday, and the faeces then contained an increase                of nitrogen
 equal to the quantity lost by the urine on that day.               Hence the assi
 milation was defective,      but it was increased by labour.
     The author then showed the relations of urea and carbonic acid,
 and their dependence       upon food, season, and period of the day, and
 discussed    the relation of urea to exertion and nutrition, showing that
 unless there be continued waste             of the nitrogenous       tissue,   there
 cannot be any important increase of urea from exertion.
    The paper     was accompanied by numerous explanatory tables and
 curves.
    The following communication         was read    : —
 "On       the   Theory     of   the   Polyedra."           By the Rev. T. P.
         Kirkman, M.A., F.R.S., and Hon. Member of the Lite
         rary and Philosophical       Society     of Manchester.          Received
         May 10, 1861.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The    complete   resolution of the problem of the polyedra embraces
the construction of all P-edra Q-acra, with an account of the symmetry
 of the solids when symmetrical.          Such construction being impracti
 cable from the magnitude of the task, it is desirable that a method
 should be found of classifying and enumerating the P-edra Q-acra, so
that from this knowledge of the inferior polyedra, the same can be
obtained concerning the higher, without any constructions, and with
out any tentative process.
    I  have found that all attempts to enumerate             a separate   and well-
defined family of the P-edra Q-acra, beyond that               I have  called ' The
                                  '
partitions of the It-pyramid        (Phil. Trans. 1858), have been fruitless,
and    that the simplest method of solving the problem is to solve it
entirely.
    It  is necessary first to have an accurate     classification of polyedra as
to symmetry.        This is —
                   1.  Zoned symmetry      ;
                   2. Zoneless axial symmetry         ;
                   3. Mixed symmetry, both         1    and 2 ;
                   4. Neuter symmetry, neither           1 nor 2  ;
                   5. Asymmetrical.

                                         219
   1.  Zoned symmetry — A polyedron may have zones of one, of two,
or of three configurations.          A zone divides the solid, when     it is  con
structed with the greatest possible symmetry, into halves, of which
one is the reflected image of the other.            Zoned polyedra are, —
            1.   Monozones      ;
            2. m-zoned      monaxines    ;
            3. Zoned triaxines ;
            4. Zoned monarchaxines, having secondary axes             ;
            5.   Zoned polyarchaxines, which have the axial systems
                   of the regular polyedra.
    The intersection of two zones is a zoned axis.
    The zonal signature        gives an account   of the number of zonal      sum
 mit faces and edges, whether polar or non-polar          ; but not of the num
ber of edges in the zoned features.
    2. Zoneless symmetry. — This is m-ple repetition of configuration, in
 revolution about     a zoneless axis.     An axis isjanal if two opposite eyes
 can read at the poles      configurations C C, which are either identical,
 or one the reflected       image of the other    ;  otherwise the axis is    hete~
 roid.    A  zoned janal axis is objanal when          C is  C  turned through
 two right angles.        A  zoneless janal axis is contrajanal when      C is thfl
reflected image of     C.      The polyedra of this symmetry       are, —
            1.   Zoneless heteroid monaxines ;
            2. Zoneless monaxine contrajanals          ;
            3. Zoneless triaxines      ;
            4.   Zoneless monarchaxine janals, having secondary axes              ;
            5.   Zoneless     polyarchaxines, having the axial systems of the
                   regular polyedra.
    3. Mixed symmetry. — In this there is both              a zone or zones and
 one or more zoneless axes.          The solids  are, —
              1.  Monozone monaxines         ;
             2. m-zoned       homozones,    having m zoneless axes.
    A  zoned janal axis is homozone when the solid has zones of one
 configuration only     ;  otherwise the janal zoned axis is heteroxone, i. e.
 the solid has zones of more than one configuration.
    4. Neuter symmetry. — There is neither zone nor zoneless axis, but
 the edges of the solid fall into pairs ab, a'b' diametrically opposite, of
 which edges one is the reflected image of the other.
    The polyedra of this symmetry           are contrajanal anaxine polyedra.

                                        220
    5. The asymmetric polyedra are the most numerous of all.
    The     data required for the enumeration       of the P-edra Q-acra    are
the following : —
    A.   A   table of the hexarchaxine, tetrarchaxine, and triarchaxine
P-edra Q-acra and Q-edra P-acra, both zoned and zoneless, with all
the zonal signatures, and an account of the terminations of their prin
cipal axes, and with the zonoid signature*.
    The zonoid signature in a zoneless or mixed symmetry            gives the
number of zoneless polar faces, summits, and edges.
    B.   A   table of janal poles, containing an exact account of every
polar feature      terminating a janal axis, with the repetition      if it  be
zoneless, and with the traces and zones         if zoned.
    C. A table of       poles,  containing an exact account of every polar
feature terminating         either a janal  or a heteroid axis, with zonal
signatures and traces when they exist, or with the zoneless              repe
tition.
    D. A table of        faces and summits having a diagonal trace        of  a
single zone, with the zonal signature.
    £. A table of objanal          monozone  faces and summits,    with their
zonal and zonoid signatures.
    F. A     table  of contrajanal anaxine pairs of     edges, with the faces
A B intersecting in them.
    6. A table of all       edges   (AB)   with their intersecting faces, the
polar edges with their zones, the monozone           zonal and epizonal edges
each   with its    zone.     An epizonal  edge is cut by a zone.
    These data being first obtained for the P-edra Q-acra and for the
Q-edra P-acra, the numbers of the following solids and faces and
summits        are exactly known      for both P-edra Q-acra and Q-edra
P-acra    ;  and we suppose that all the inferior polyedra are registered
in like manner : —
    a. The m-zoned         monarchaxines with their zonal signatures, and
       their principal poles     ;
    6.  The    zoned triaxines with their zonal signatures    ;
    c.  The    m-zoned homozones      with their zonal and zonoid signatures,
       and their exact principal poles ;
    d. The zoneless monarchaxine janals with their repetition and zo
       noid signatures, and their principal poles ;
    e.  The    zoneless triaxines ;

                                      321
   f.   The   monozone    monaxines with their zonal signatures and their
        poles ;
    g. The zoneless monaxine coutrajanals with their repetition and
        their poles   ;
    h. The OT-zoned monaxines       with their zonal signatures and poles         ;
     t.  The   monozones,   with their zonal signatures      ;
    j.   The   zoneless monaxine heteroids with their axes and repetition          ;

    And    these numbers being registered along with the data preceding
for all signatures, we have a complete classification and enumeration

    The difficulty lies in the obtaining of          the   data    A B C D E F G.
We begin with (C, D, and G).
   Analysis of a polar or     monozone summit      of a V-edron Q acron V.
    Let p'    be a polar or monozone     p-ace, which,       if  polar, is either a
zoned or zoneless termination      of an axis.    If ^-zoned     or of r-ple zone-
less repetition, there is a sequence    of configuration r       times read about
the pole.
    Any summit        m through which lies the triangular section p'mn of
the solid is    a deltotomous  summit about p'     ;   and  if  mn be an edge, it
is  & deltotomous edye, about p', or     o(p'.

     The summit p'             has e   (^0)           effaced effaceables.                 These can be re
stored in one way only, since each (mn) must complete a face                                               /which
has      no deltotomous               summit besides mn.                           Let them           be restored.
We have the perfect summit p'                           (i.     e.   a   summit which has no effaced
effaceables)         ofa

     The   process whereby the data                        C,   D    are obtained         is   the construction
in groups of all perfect polar p-aces and monozone p-aces having                                                      a
diagonal zonal trace, of all the (P-fe)-edra                                      Q-acra (V(), which can
be reduced           by   effacement        of   e   effaceables to           a   polar or monozone p-aoe
Of   a   P-edron Q-acron V.                   These polyedra                   V,   can be all constructed
about their perfect poles and registered                                 ;    for no result of effacement
is   small enough to be employed                            in   the construction               of    a   polyedron
(V(). Each perfect ^j-ace  constructed has E(^e) effaceables, which
                                            p'
are registered with the signatures of symmetry   so that all results                  ;
of effacing e(^0) of                  the   E        effaceables           about any registered                 perfect
^j-ace are      exactly known without repetition, and without enumeration
of   two summits,           of which         one      is   the reflected           imBge       of   the other.
     The   process        of this construction of                    perfect /j-aces       p'   is    the converse
of   the reduction     of p'.
     In   the   reduction of p',             we remove all the rays                       of    p',   whereby we
lay bare either            a   polyedron or            a    reticulation,           which has among its
linear sections the            E   effaceables          of p'.
     If the     effaceables      of    the reticulation                  are all secondary,
                                                                                                        it
                                                                                                        is      a   full
reticulation,         which     is    an agglutination                of polyedra cohering by those
secondary effaceables, which are linear sections,                                       and the only linear
sections,       of   the reticulation.
     If the   reticulation has no effaceables,                        it  is   aplane reticulation, being
simply     a    polygon partitioned                   by   certain        diagonals.
     If there     be one or more primary effaceables,                               we have         a   mixed reti
culation.
     The mixed reticulation always                         reduces in one way only                        by   sections
in its external primary effaceables, to                              a   subject reticulation, which                  is
either mixed or full or plane, or else to                                a   polyedron.         And, by conti
nuing this reduction, we always                            obtain finally           a   full reticulation,            a
                                                                 ri
plane reticulation,             or.   a     polyedron,                -zoned,       or of n'-ple               zoueless
                                                                 ^

     The primary            effaceables          of   a    mixed reticulation are the joints or

     seams by which it can be either taken to pieces or constructed, in one
     way only.             And the portions into which it breaks up by                        these joints,
.    are         either polyedra, or full reticulations,                 or plane reticulations, of
     which we have an account in our register.
         We        first   suppose given all plane and full reticulations, as well as
     the inferior polyedra, with all their signatures.                             By   means       of    these,
     imposed           as marginal charges             on a subject reticulation, we can con
     struct and register exactly all polar and monozone                                 mixed reticula
     tions,        with       their repetition and zonal signatures, and with                              their
    effaceables,           which are always edges that have been loaded with mar
    ginal charges.
         Every reticulation,                plane, full, or mixed, is registered with its
    marginal signature.
         The marginal signature exhibits                        to the eye all that is requisite to
    be   known either for the coronation of the reticulation by                                 a   p-ace p',
    whereby it becomes                 a   polyedron, or for the construction on it of higher
    reticulations.              The marginal signature to               be constructed can always
    be   exactly written          ;   and there is a given number             of ways of constructing
    it on the subject signature, which can be registered,                               and the number
    is   obtained by inspection of our signatures.                          We always     see   in a mixed
    marginal signature what is removeable                            by sections in the external pri
    mary effaceables,             and in a      full reticulation       we see what is removeable
    by external secondary effaceables.
         The rules for charging                a subject marginal signature, so as to con
    struct another signature upon                   it,   are   :—
         1   .   No primary           effaceable which      is      external in the subject          is   to be
    external           in the constructed;              therefore       the subject       compartment
    standing on every external primary effaceable must receive at least one
    charge, which charge will be                   a   compartment of the new signature.
         2. Solid charges              (polyedra or full reticulations)                 are imposed on
    plane marginal triangles of the subject.                            Plane reticulations, which
    give plane compartments, are imposed on solid marginal edges                                      of the
    subject by            a   marginal triangle of the charge,                 which     is   lost in the
    operation, or supposed to be cut away.                            Thus    a   marginal triangle          is
    lost by every charge imposed, whether plane or solid.
         We handle all           plane reticulations only              by   their marginal triangles,
    given         by   their signatures, and thus we escape the necessity of keep
    ing any account of their summits.
                                                                                         r2

                                         224
   3.  A  plane submargin of the subject is never charged.
   4. Every chargeadds         a   primary effaceable in       a mixed reticulation,
and may add any number of secondary effaceables,                    if a solid charge.
    5. If the   penesolid 402, which consists only of two marginal tri
angles,   is employed to form a compartment                   of  the new     signature
(which is the compartment (2)', or (2)             r  times    repeated in the r-ple
marginal signature), the resulting reticulation is closed to further
marginal increments,        and can only be crowned.
    The zonal    and zonoid signatures       of reticulations      give an account    of
all zoned and polar effaceables, so that after coronation of                a  reticula
tion we can always enumerate             the results     of  effacement,     with their
 symmetry and signatures.             Any   effaceable can be effaced independ
 ently of others.
     Asymmetric mixed reticulations are never constructed, unless such
 as can be   crowned by      a  line  ; we thus escape the construction           of the
 most numerous class of mixed reticulations.               And asymmetric corona
 tions, or asymmetric results of effacement,            are never registered,     unless
 the coronation be by a line, or the effacements be about a perfect edge.
     An  edge    is a 2-ace      summit which        has    always e( > 0) effaced
 effaceables   that can be restored        in one way only.            When they     are
 restored we have         a perfect 2-ace, which is to be constructed and
 registered,  whether symmetrical or not.
     The removal of      an edge lays bare in all cases either a polyedron or
 a penesolid, which may be either plane,             full, or mixed.
     A penesolid     is a reticulation     which can be crowned with a line,
 thus becoming       a polyedron.
     The order of the marginal features is not regarded in the marginal
 signature of a reticulation, as we keep no exact account of the faces
 about the crowning p-ace          ; but the marginal signature of          a penesolid
 is always so written that the exact faces of the crowning line shall be
 known by inspection of the signature.               A penesolid        may have    any
 number of effaceables         which are registered with the marginal and
 zonal or zonoid signatures.            The results of       effacement      about the
 crowning edges are the data C G, and these are exactly given by our
 methods.
    The marginal signatures of          penesolids   are   of  the form
                    [2a26],      r>26],       [8«4c],       [3aaAc],
                    [2aA*].       [AaB*].     &c.

                                         225
    The first has two marginal plane triangles and a +               b  submargins    ;
 the   second has one marginal          plane   triangle   ;  the third has none.
 The    fourth has     a + c plane submargins          and    a solid submargins.
 We see that polyedra are removcable           by the external primary efface
 ables   in the third, which      have a    (3-f l)-gonal      and a (4   + l)-gonal
 face ;   and that the fourth has been constructed by charging                    the
 plane marginal triangles       of a subject penesolid, one with a polyedron
 having a     3-fl-gonal     face, and    the other either with         a polyedron
 having an      (A+l)-gonal face, or with a full penesolid having the
 solid  margin A-       The edge that crowns the first is the intersection
 of an (a + 3)-gon and         a   (4 + 3)-gon.      The     edge that crowns the
 third may be the intersection          of an (a + 3)-gon and a (c+6)-gon,
 or of an (a + 4)-gon and a (c+5)-gon, &c.
    The polar summits being known for P-edra Q-acra And Q-edra
 P-acra, their reciprocal polar faces are         of  course known also.
    This may suffice     as an   account of the data (C, D, G), except that
 we  shall return to the construction of the plane and of the full reti
culations.
    We consider next the data B.
  Analysis     of the polar janal     summits    p'p(  of a V-edron Q-aeroM W.
    Let p' and p, be ir-aces terminating           a  janal axis.      The ordinary
 effaceables    of either summit, which        are what we have already consi
dered    about    a polar jj-ace,    can be restored      in one way only.       The
janal symmetry remains, though modified by such restoration.
    There are in faces about p'         a  certain number of triaccs collateral
with pt.      These are (w > 0) rhombotomous triaces. Let each be made
collateral with p\ and let the w similar triaces in faces about pt be
made     collateral with p' .     They   are now all rhombotomous         tessaraces,
sucb    ihat quadrilaterals p' p pt p, are drawn through pairs p p, of the
tessaraces. We have now a pair of janal jr'-aces perfect both in their
ordinary and their peripolar effaceables,              which is registered in our
table   of perfect janal poles.
    A peripolar effaceable is any ray drawn from                   a principal janal
pole to a rhombotomous           tessarace,   which is always collateral with
either pole, and may lose either of its effaceables.

                                          226
     If the  two polar summits be entirely removed,              there is laid bare
either a janal polyedron or         a  janal reticulation at either pole.           The
two opposite reticulations have the same marginal signature, which
differs in nothing that needs here be noticed from that of a polar reti
culation.      This is reducible       at either pole by the external primary
effaceables,     or  if it be a janal  full reticulation, by its external      second
ary effaceables, either to a janal polyedron, or to           a janal full reticula
tion, or to     a primitive,   or to a fundamental       janal reticulation       ; and
this reduction is possible in one way only.
     A fundamental janal reticulation is            made    thus: — Let     & primary
polar plane reticulation, i. e.          one which has no diagonals but the
bases of its marginal triangles,         and no summits besides those         of   those
triangles, be laid on a mirror, with the triangles              a  little raised from
 the mirror.        The reticulation   and its image form a fundamental           janal
 reticulation.
      If the  primary be turned in any way about an axis perpendicular
 to the mirror, while the image remains stationary, we have                a primitive
janal reticulation.          The  edges in the mirror, common to both polar
 faces, are the submargins         of the polar   faces, on which primitive sub-
 margins rhombotomous tessaraces can be planted at pleasure in janal
 coronation.
      The marginal triangles of the fundamental are all doubled, and the
 bases of the pairs are zonal effaceables.            Some only of the marginal
 triangles of the primitive are doubled, and the bases of the pairs are
 zonoid effaceables.
      There is only one way in which a given janal reticulation can be
  constructed on       a  fundamental or on a primitive.         The rules for       con
 struction differ little from the rules for polar reticulations, and we
  conceive    that the marginal charges are imposed alike in the opposite
  polar faces, thus preserving janal or contrajanal symmetry.                   Inspec
  tion of our signatures gives us the result in all cases.
      The janal reticulation is registered with its marginal signature,
  which of course is the same at either pole, with its zonal signatures,
  principal and secondary, and with its zonoid signature            if it have  second
  ary zoneless poles.
      An account is kept, in all constructions on a fundamental or primi
  tive, of primitive plane submargins, because it is on these only that
  rhombotomous tessaraces can           be deposited   in janal coronation.       These

                                              227
 are the submarginal           edges     (not in triangles) of the fundamental              01
 primitive.
   The symmetry of             a              is modified in various ways by
                                    janal subject
 marginal     charges,        by coronation, or by effacemeuts ordinary and
 peripolar.
   The modifications           are the following     :   —

   On the ri-ple           zoneless    monarchaxine janal subject we construct
     only r-ple monarchaxine janal results.
   On the ri-ple monaxine monozone subject we construct results, —
                     1.     r-ple monaxine monozone,
                     2. r-ple monaxine contrajanal.
   On the ri-ple monaxine contrajanal subject                     we      construct only r-ple
     monaxine contrajanal results.
   In all   these cases the constructions are given exactly by inspection
of our signatures for every divisor r of ri : and we can both complete
the table of perfect janal poles of (P+e)-edra Q-acra which we
require, and register the janal results of e ordinary effacements in every
possible way upon each of them, for every kind of symmetry.
   Having thus         registered  the results of ordinary effacement about
janal axes in    a   table of janal poles perfect only in peripolar effaceables,
we have next to register the results            of peripolar           effacement.
  The   effect   of    a    peripolar effacement         is,   that   a   rhombotomous tes-
sarace becomes       a     rhombotomous triace, and that the secondary                  zone,

                                           228
  if there is one, is destroyed, a different janal symmetry being intro
  duced.
      Our signatures      give us an exact account     of all rhombotomous       tes-
  saraces introduced       in coronation,    and we can readily enumerate        the
 results of peripolar       effacement by mere inspection      of those signatures.
     All fundamental and primitive reticulations             are given by general
 formulae,     as are also    the primary plane reticulations on which they
 are founded, in terms          of their marginal signatures, and of their zonal
 and    zonoid signatures.         Every kind of janal symmetry may be seen
 in   these fundamentals and primitives.
     Thus, on the supposition,         as before, that we have tables of inferior
 polyedra, and of the plane and full reticulations, symmetrical or not,
 we     can   obtain completely the data B for P-edra             Q-acra, and for
 Q-edra P-acra.
     The    data  E  are what the ^-zoned homozone polyedra become when
 r=2.        They   are given by the theory        of construction of the homo-
 zone poles for the general value          of r ; and each summit is registered
 with its zonal and zonoid signature and with its cffaceables            ;  and the
 results of effacement,        ordinary or peripolar, are accurately known.
     The    data  F  are what the r-ple      monaxine contrajanals become for
 r=l.      We    never descend so low as       r—  1, except in the construction
of   penesolids,    viz. contrajanal anaxine penesolids.        The janal anaxine
pairs which crown these and other penesolids              are data   F. They are
registered     as  perfect edges with their effaceables, and the janal results
of   effacement     are also data    F.
     The   data   A  are easily obtained.      Every polyarchaxine reduces in
one way only to a regular polyedron, on the principal faces                of which
it is constructed, always by its principal poles.
     The effaced effaceables of a polyarchipolar summit (which exists
either on a polyarchaxine or on its reciprocal) are all ordinary, and
can be restored in one way only.             We   conceive them restored about
all like archipoles.       These poles being removed,      a polyedron or a reti
culation is laid bare, which has a marginal signature differing in
nothing that needs here be noticed from that of              n polar reticulation.
By inspection of this signature, we can construct on it a given num
ber of polyarchaxine reticulations of given signatures, and the process
differs in nothing from the construction of a polar reticulation, except

                                               229
that we conceive it effected in all the principal faces of the subject.
We can crown,          and register all summits with zonal or zonoid and mar
                                                                  ™
ginal signatures and with cffaceables, so that the results of («    0)
symmetrical  effacements about all the principal axes are readily enu
merated.           These results are the data          A.
  It    remnins only that we return to the construction of the full and
plane reticulations, from which all our marginal charges,                                if they   be
not polyedra, are selected.
  The full reticulations            are reducible always          either to a nucleus line
or to a nucleus polyedron, by sections                    in their external effaceables.
The marginal signature              shows always the edges removeable                      by such
sections,      and construction          proceeds      by the rule that no external
effaceable     of the subject shall       be external in the result.               All   effaceables
are here secondary.
   The modifications of symmetry of polar                      monozone and asymmetric
subjects and constructions are expressed in general formulae, and the
results are always registered with all signatures without ambiguity or
repetition.
   *We never construct janal               full reticulations           except what have, as
the word janal implies, a symmetry:                         and such constructions                 are
always polar,          except the objanal monozones                     and   the contrajanal
anaxine full penesolids.              The only       difference    between these           full   con
structions and that of mixed reticulations                        is,   that no marginal tri
angles are handled or lost in the process              and that in the building of
                                                          ;
an r-ple repetition on          a   subject of n'-ple repetition, we descend to the
value    r=l,       which gives      the asymmetric full reticulations by the for
mulae for the general value of r.
   The plane reticulations              have lastly to be considered.
   All      plane r-gonal       penesolids      (rOf) having/— 1(=                   2)   diagonals,
symmetrical or not, are given                  by   general    formulae       in   terms    of their
marginal signature,
                                    ['2a2b],         (r=4     +   a+6),
 that   is,   in   terms   of (rfab).      The line which crowns this signature                      is
the intersection of         a   (3
                                +     a)-gon and      a   (3  +   A)-gon.
   All      polar plane reticulations and all monozones                        which have less
 than three epizonal edges in the zone,                     reduce      in   one way only to         a
 polar or monozone primary, which has no diagonals except the bases

                                     230
 of its marginal triangles-     On this primary     as  subject the reticula
 tions in question are constructed by one operation, by charging its
 marginal triangles with marginal triangles of inferior reticulations,
 whereby two marginal triangles disappear for every charge imposed.
 The number and the symmetry of the constructions are always given
 by inspection of our signatures.       The monozones which have more
 than two epizonal edges in the zone, reduce by section in the central
 epizonal or epizonals to two or to three inferior zoned reticulations.
   We construct, conversely,    a given  marginal and zonal signature thus
 in every possible way, the number of constructions being always given
 by inspection of our tables.     All polar reticulations having this     zone
 and marginal signature will be formed by the process.               The polar
being already registered, the monozones       are obtained by subtraction.
    Perhaps the greatest    difficulty in the theory of the polyedra is
the enumeration    of the M asymmetric plane reticulations which have
the marginal signature
                                 S=[2T»],
where 2T means simply 2T      ;   and where    T is the number    of the mar
ginal triangles, and  to that of the submarginal edges, of which no
two are contiguous.      The reticulations to   be found   will  be registered
                           ROF [2Tw]=M,
where
                           Y-l-T=d
is the number of diagonals which are not bases of marginal triangles,
and
                       R=2T+« + u,          =2T+w
is the number of the summits of the reticulation, of which          « only are
not summits in marginal triangles.        If we  erase the  d diagonals, and
also  the s diaces that they may leave        (summits of two edges), we
have a primary reticulation,
                     R'0/[2Tu],      (R'=2T + u),
which may or may not be polar or monozone.             If now   on the u sub-
margins of R'O/ we deposit s points (diaces) in every possible way,
and then draw in the
                  (R-T=)(T+ic=)(T            + M + *)-gon
enclosed by the   T marginal triangles d diagonals in every possible

                                                     231
   way, none crossing another, so that one at least                           shall pass through
   each   of the       « points, we shall construct the asymmetric ROF in ques
   tion among           the results      a  certain number of times,             namely, in every
   position       of ROF in which             erasure     of the d diagonals         and    of the     a
   diaces    will reproduce the primary R'O/; and                     if R'O/      be polar, there
   may    be many such positions of ROF for the                       same position         of R'O/.
   And it is evident that we shall construct equally every plane reticu
   lation    ROF of        every symmetry which can reduce by the same process
   of efiacement          to the same primary            R'O/.
       Nothing is          easier than to determine the number                      of asymmetric
   constructions thus obtained of ROF [2Tte],                     if the number of all            pos
   sible ways of drawing the d diagonals can be found.
       We have to employ in turn every possible partition of the * points,
   of which one is
                             «=o, + «9+                              =

       There is a given number of ways of depositing a, points on any
   one   of the       u submargins, a, points on any other, &c.
       All      that is difficult is to determine, when a disposition                          of the
   a, + a,     +   . . . + Om points       is made,     in how many      ways      d diagonals      can

 the asymmetric plane reticulations R0F[2Tu'] are given, whatever be
 the primaries R'O/) symmetric or asymmetric, to which they are re
 ducible by the above process of effacement.
   And with       these we have a complete                    solution, perfectly easy to cal
culate and register, of the problem of the classification and enumera
tion    of the P-edra Q-acra.
   The memoir, which                 I    have     the honour to present to the Royal
Society, contains all the general formulae of this solution.
   There is nothing to prevent our registering in all marginal signa
tures the exact order of the margins.                          If this   be done, we can crown
every      reticulation registered by a closed polygon A, made by con
necting margins so that no linear section                           shall remain.      The       faces
collateral with       A   would be at the same time constructed, and could
be registered     ;    that    is,   we could register all the faces collateral                  with
any face in their order.                  And iu crowning by summits marginal sig
natures so registered,              we could determine and register the faces                       of
every p-&ce      of the P-edra Q-acra in their order.
  The methods             above      given are applicable to this more laborious
registration of results.                 If this   more tedious process be adopted, the
construction of the P-edra Q-acra will be an easy matter.
I      am not aware           that anything has been printed on the subject
of this theory beyond what                       have attempted in the             Philosophical
                                                                               *

Society of Manchester,'                   except       a short attempt made          some three
years ago by      M. Poinsot              to sketch      a   beginning of the investigation,
which appeared          in    the '
                                         Comptes Rendus.'                The attempt      was    well
made, but the results given were not quite accurate.                          I    have   it   not at
land   ;   but
             I    know that there            is    a   defective   enumeration of the simple
solids there considered.
I   have enumerated            the polyedra of not more than 18 edges                       by   this
method, and      I    hope shortly to publish the classification and enume
ration of the polyedra of 20 edges and under.

    Dr. Friedrich Anton Kolenati, Professor of Natural History in the
 Polytechnicum of Briinn in Moravia, and Founder of the Bohemian
 Natural History Society 'Lotos,' is the author of upwards of 100
 memoirs on various departments of Natural History, Geology, Mine
 ralogy, and Crystallography,      containing descriptions of nearly 400
 species discovered by himself.       The limits of this notice forbid the
 recital of the titles of these memoirs, or of the names of the species
 therein described.       Some   of Professor Kolenati's      principal   works

 discovered by the author during          a journey    in the Caucasus and
Transcaucasian provinces of Russia in the years 1843, 1844, 1845,
 1846.     Also various Memoirs on Chiroptera, Arachnidn, and Insects,
 published independently or in the Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Aka-

   The first     five memoirs are devoted      only to the arrangement of
worms, Class "Turbellaria," which Ehrenberg named "Rhabdocoela."
 Subsequently the investigations are extended to the

    In No.    1 the general anatomico- physiological relations            of  the order
are for the first time established with scientific precision, and a series
of   species   are described       accordingly.      In No.     2 a very remarkable
deviation of the genus Dinophilus             is described.       No.   3 contains the
description of seventeen           Rhabdoceles, which are all new with the
exception of Contoluta            paradoxa.        In No.     4  are   described   nine
species    of Rhabdoceles from the Mediterranean, mostly from the
Bay of Naples, together with some other worms.                         No. 5 contains
the list and special        description of twenty species, of which ten are
new,    observed    in the neighbourhood            of Cracow.        The anatomical
descriptions embrace almost all the principal genera                 :  Vortex, Bero-
ttotnum,    Mesostomum, Prostomum.                Nos. 6,    7, 8  contain researches
respecting Turbellaria         dendrocoela.       The author      has described   most
of the freshwater      species existing in Germany, and some from Corfu.
    Professor Schmidt's investigations extend to eighty species of the
Turbellaria     rhabdocoela, and dendrocoela,             sixty-two of which were
discovered by himself.

    Since Quatrefages published his             Memoire sur les Planaries,' 1847,
and Dalyell published his observations on various orders of Turbel-
lariae  ('The Powers of         the Creator,'     1851,   1853), nothing has been
done either in France or England               to improve the anatomical know
ledge    of this  very attractive group.         Professor Schmidt declares that
 he  will consider it    a  reward for his own labours          if English zoologists
can be induced by means            of this notice to turn their attention to th«
Fauna to which it refers.
    The following notice of his           researches     has been furnished to the
Foreign Secretary by         M. Schrauf.
    Determination of the Optical Constants of Crystallized Sub
        stances.    (First and Second Series.)              By Alnert Schraot
       (Vienna).
    In the two hitherto published           series    of  these investigations, the
data    concerning the refractive and dispersive             powers of twenty cry
stallized substances       are communicated.
     Being    persuaded that crystallo-physics,             more     than any other
branch of physical science, is founded on quantitative calculation of
absolute     exactitude,     I   contrived to obtain first incontestable facts

                                             236
  connected     with the hitherto somewhat neglected               phenomena of dis
 persion and refraction.            Nearly 1000 substances have been crystallo-
 graphically investigated,          and about 200 have been made the object            of
  optical researches       ;   many of them, however,      have remained unknown
 as to their dispersive and reflective            powers,   which, representing the
 quantitative       and    qualitative action of any substance            on    the pro
 pagation of light, are of absolute necessity                for the construction      of
 any sound theory.
     It  becomes      every day a greater necessity         to obtain, within these
 extensive      dominions of human            knowledge,      a   certain    number    of
 general views, subservient to the explanation and systematic arrange
 ment of      a great    number of isolated       facts, as only a small portion       of
 the present investigation has led to the establishment of general laws.
 The    great problem         of crystallo-physics proposed for solution may be
 expressed by       the question, What is the causal connexion between che
 mical constitution and morphological and optical properties ?                      The
 phenomena of isomorphism,               discovered by Prof. Mitscherlich,          have
 indeed thrown considerable light on the mutual relation of chemical1
 constitution and morphological properties              ; yet little, if anything,   has
 been done to arrive at the solution           of the problem in its general form.
    As latterly      several    doubts have been expressed          as to the possible
existence      of such    a connexion, the purpose        of my investigations shall
be not only (as expressed             in their title) to fill up deficiencies in the
knowledge of facts, but also to propose several explanations indicating
the real existence of such a connexion, and the necessity of making
it  an object     of  earnest research.
    In    the   following      paragraphs     I  intend    only    to mention      some
theorems whose solution is already achieved.                   Another series of my
investigations,        to be published       subsequently,      is to afford general
demonstrations and applications of consequences                   in strict connexion
with duly stated facts.
    The most important of the theorems,               as far as they may be simply
enunciated,      are — .
    §  1.   The calculation, graphic representation,             and derivation    of all
the crystallographical            and  physical properties of the rhombohedral
system are possible          if three  rectangular axes are assumed        ;  the axis c
coinciding with the principal rhombohedral axis, and the axes a and
b  with the diagonals of the prism of 60°.

                                             237
    § 2. The following indices represent consequently the character
istic equations for the symmetrical crystallographic systems : —
                                    Rectangular Axes.
                        Tesseral           a :  I : c  =     1:1:1
                        Pyramidal                      =     1:1:/
                         Rhombohedral                  = "^3:1:/
                        Prismatic                      = h : 1 : /.
     § 3. The optical axes of elasticity, coinciding with the diagonal of
 the prism of 60°, are nearly equal to each other, and (a and (i
 being axes of elasticity and           a and b      crystallographical    axes)   if limit
                  '
 a
  r is supposed to be =           v3, then a=/3.
     § 4. Whenever         a   prism of 60° is extant in the prismatic system,
 the first median line         (" bissectrice    de Tangle    aigu")  is perpendicular
  to its diagonal*.
     § 5. Whenever a number of prisms of 60° are extant (110, Oil,
  101), the first median line stands perpendicular to the diagonals of
  one  of these prisms, and simultaneously to the plane                 of  cleavage.
     § 6. The first median line is generally perpendicular to the dia
  gonal  of prisms,    whose     limit may     be expressed by simpler proportions,
  as 1 : V2 : V3     : </5   : V7.
     § 7.  The dispersion of the optical axes in the prismatic                  system is
  dependent on the magnitude of the crystallographical                         axis,   with
  which the middle axis           of elasticity     is coincident.
     (A) If the crystallographical           axes (d2m being a crystallographical
 axis, with which coincides the             second     median   line dp, with this the
  medial axis of elasticity being coincident) are               to each other as      limit
  of the square roots of odd numbers, then 'for
                                     dp
                                        >,
                                           d2m    is p  >  v,
                                    dp  <  dim is     p <  v.
     (B)  If the same       axes are to each other as the square roots             of  even
 numbers to the odd, then the law of dispersion becomes the reverse"^
 of what it    was under the first supposition             (A).
    * The totality of the substances belonging to the prismatic system, as far as
 they have been hitherto objects of optical investigation, may stand in proof and
 as exemplifications   of the propositions    enounced here.

M    and   N remaining invariable quantities for every elementary sub
stance.     If M is made to signify specific power of refraction, and N
specific power of dispersion, their                       values may be found out by means
of the following equations : —

may be set          in   proportion to the density of the substances*.
     §11. Not        the elasticity, but rather the density                     is   subject to varia
tion (Fresnel's theory).
     §   12.   The       consequence      of     §    9    is,   that the propagation        of light
may be equally conceived                as   being independent of the luminous ether,
and only in dependence               on the substantial                 molecules.

Cauchy's       in    structure     is   thus obtained.

varieties of topaz, beryl, apatite, &c. and all the substances examined by Dale and

Gladstone may serve as evidences and exemplifications      of the above propositions.

to write
It must     be remarked that, in consequence            of the more or    less relative
mobility of the molecules, N must             have a different value for different
 substances.
     § 16. The elementary substances, according to Boedecker's theory,
 not entering into mutual combination with the same density and
 correlation of atoms       as they possess in the state of liberty, it may be
 admitted that they are probably compelled to form double molecules,
 or semi-molecules.         In the    second    case   of combination the specific
power of refraction would be the double, in the first only the half
  of what it was in the elementary substance, when still chemically free.
     § 17. The indices of refraction of chemical combinations and
 mixtures may be calculated on the supposition enounced in § 16.
 Absolute exactitude may be obtained for any extensive groups, of
 which some members,            and consequently the law of their chemical
  combination, are known*.
     The   general   law here is — Substances         with nearly equal powers of
  refraction may combine without alteration in them.                 If these powers
  are very different, and far distant from each other, they tend to
  become     homogeneous,       so that     the greater     power of refraction is
 halved, and the lesser is doubled (see § 1 6).
     § 18. The coefficient of dispersion of combined substancesf seems
 also to be derivable from the principles stated in §§ 9 and 16 ; as B
 being    dependent     on d1, must change        proportionally    to the square of
 molecular condensation (see § 16).
     § 19. In consequence of § 9, the lines of Fraunhofer (although the
 constancy of the lengths of undulation, to which they answer, remains
 unaltered), when refracting substances are condensed,                 must advance
 their centre toward the violet end, in analogy to the phenomena of
 absorptiony observed by Weiss (PoggendorfF's 'Annalen,'                 1861).     For
 this reason absorption must depend on              the length of the undulation.
    * Evidence is afforded by Dulong's, Dale's, and Gladstone's determinations, also
 by all other, especially organic, combinations, on account of the simplicity of their
 formulae ; also by Deville's, Grailich's, Handl's, and Weiss's determinations con
 cerning mixed substances.
    t Our knowledge of the coefficients of dispersion proper to chemical elements
being still very defective, it is impossible to bring this proposition to full evidence.
Sulphuret of carbon may serve for demonstration, and similar inferences may be
deduced    from investigations   concerning   mixtures.
                                                                      8  2

    These propositions, and some others of similar nature which            I  suc
ceeded in deriving, incomplete as they still may be in many respects,
prove at all events that, even in this department of human knowledge,
theoretical     points of departure exist from which,            by progressive
investigation, the real connexion of facts may possibly be traced.
My next purpose is to coordinate          as  much  as   possible whatever is at
present known of facts, bringing them under general points of view
as   materials for a future scientific theory.         I  intend to publish by
and by these       investigations as completely       as  possible, in constant
connexion with        the phenomena which they are suited to explain,
never leaving the secure foundation          of experimental research.
    Here   I  intend only to offer a    brief abstract of the facts obtained
                                                                            '
through the first two series of investigations, published in the Pro
            '
ceedings      of the Vienna Imperial Academy (vols. xli. and xlii.).
    These investigations took place in the Imperial Physical Institute
of Vienna, and could only           be effectually accomplished through the
liberal and kind assistance I       received   from the Director of the Insti
tute, from the Director of the Imperial Museum of Mineralogy, and
from the Superintendent of the Chemical Laboratory of the Imperial
Geological Institute
    In  these results are comprised — the exponent            of refraction, the
calculated axial angle,       the aperture of the cone of internal conical
refraction, the measure of the apparent axial angle, and crystallogra-
phical investigations.
    For brevity's    sake  I will only communicate the exponent of refrac
 tion for Fraunhofer's lines B and        H,  and the most important among
 the crystallographical      determinations.

II. "Liquid        Diffusion       applied      to   Analysis."       By Thomas
       Graham, Esq., F.R.S., Master of the Mint.                            Received
       May 8, 1861.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The unequal diffusibility of different substances in water appears
to present means of separation not unlike those long derived from
unequal volatility.       For   as regards    diffusion, there exists a    " volatile "
and also a    " fixed "   class  of substances     ; and these distinctions appear
to correspond with differences           in molecular constitution of a funda
mental nature.        Much      value   is attached to diffusion, as affording
the means      of bringing       out clearly, and subjecting           to numerical
expression, the distinctive properties of what appear to be two great
divisions of chemical substances.
    The first, or diffusive       class    of substances,     are marked by their
tendency to crystallize, either alone or in combination with water.
    When in      a state   of solution they       are held by the solvent with a
certain force, so    as  to effect the volatility of water by their presence.
The solution is generally free from viscosity, and is always sapid.
Their reactions are energetic and quickly effected.                 This is the class
of crystalloids.
    The other class, of low diffusibility, may          be named colloids, as they
appear to be typified by animal gelatine.                 They    have   little if any
tendency to crystallize, and they affect a               vitreous structure.       The
planes of the crystal with its hardness and brittleness are replaced in
the colloid by rounded outlines with more or less softness and tough
ness   of texture.     Water of crystallization is represented            by water of
gelatination.     Colloids are held in solution by a feeble power, and have
little  effect  on the volatility       of the     solvent.     They are also preci
 pitated from their solution by the addition of crystalloids.                The solu
 tion of colloids has always       a certain degree of viscosity or gumminess,
 when concentrated.          They appear to        be insipid    or wholly tasteless,
 unless when they undergo decomposition upon the palate and give
 rise to sapid crystalloids.        Their solid hydrates are gelatinous bodies.
 They    are  united to water with a force of low intensity ; and such
 is the character of the combinations in general between a colloid and
 a crystalloid,    even although        the latter may be a powerful reagent
 in its own class, such      as an   acid or an alkali.        In their chemical     re

                                           214
actions, the crystalloidal appears the energetic form, and the colloidal
the inert form of matter.            The combining equivalent of the colloid
appears always to be high, and it has a heavy molecule.                      Among the
colloids rank hydrated silicic acid, and a number of soluble hydrated
metallic peroxides, of which little has hitherto                   been    known   ;  also
starch, the vegetable        gums and dextrin, caramel,              tannin, albumen,
and vegetable and animal extractive matters.                   The peculiar structure
and chemical indifference of colloids appear to adapt them for the
animal organization, of which they become the plastic elements.
     Although the      two    classes   are widely separated           in their proper
ties,   a complete parallelism appears             to hold between        them.     Their
 existence   in nature appears         to call for a corresponding division of
chemistry into a crystalloid and            a  colloid department.
     Although chemically inert in the ordinary sense, colloids possess
a   comparative activity of their own, arising out of their physical pro
perties.     While the rigidity of the crystalline structure shuts out ex
ternal impressions, the softness of the gelatinous colloid partakes of
 fluidity,  and    enables    the colloid       to become       a medium for       liquid
 diffusion, like water itself.         The    same penetrability appears to take
 the form of a capacity for cementation in such colloids as can exist
 at a high temperature.            Hence a wide sensibility on the part of
 colloids to external agents.         Another eminently characteristic quality
 of colloids, is their mutability.           Their    existence   is a  continued meta
 stasis.    A colloid may      be compared in this respect               to water while
 existing liquid at a temperature below its usual freezing-point, or to
 a supersaturated saline         solution.       The solution of hydrated silicic
 acid, for instance,    is easily obtained       in a state of purity, but cannot be
 preserved.      It may remain fluid for days or weeks in a sealed tube,
 but is sure to gelatinize at last.           Nor    does the change       of this colloid
 appear to stop at that point.             For the mineral forms of silicic          acid,
 deposited from water, such          as  flint, are found to have passed, during
 the geological ages of their existence, from the vitreous or colloidal
 into the crystalline condition         (H. Rose). The colloidal is in fact a
 dynamical state of matter         ;  the crystalloidal being the statical con
 dition.    The colloid      possesses      energia.         It  may be looked upon
 as the probable primary source            of the force appearing in the pheno
 mena     of vitality,  as  living matter without form.                 To the gradual
 manner also in which colloidal changes                take   place   (for they always

                                          245
demand time as an element), may the chronic nature and periodicity
of vital phenomena be ultimately referred.
   For the separation of unequally diffusive crystalloids from each
other, jar-diffusion was had recourse to. The mixed solution was
conveyed   by means of a pipette to the bottom of              a column of water
contained in a cylindrical          glass  jar.    A kind of cohobation        takes
place,  a portion of the most diffusive substance rising and separating
from the less diffusive substances,          more and more completely,          as it
ascends.
   The separation of      a   crystalloid     from a colloid is more properly
effected  by a combination of diffusion with the action of a septum
composed of an insoluble colloidal material.               Animal   membrane     will
serve for the latter purpose, or a film           of gelatinous starch, hydrated
gelatin itself, albumen or animal mucus.                 But by much the most
effective septum used was paper, as it is metamorphosed by sul
phuric acid (Gaine).          It   is now supplied by Messrs. De la Rue,
and has become familiar under the name                of "                          "
                                                           vegetable   parchment
or "parchment-paper."             From sheet gutta percha a flat hoop is
formed, eight or ten inches in diameter by three inches in depth, and
one side is covered     by a disc of parchmeut-paper,             so as to form a
vessel like a sieve.     A     mixed solution, which may be supposed               to
contain sugar and gum, is placed upon the septum to a depth of half
an  inch, and the instrument then           floated upon a considerable volume
of water contained in       a  basin.      Three-fourths     of the sugar   diffuses
out in twenty-four      hours, and so free from gum              as  to be scarcely
affected by subacetate      of   lead, and      to crystallize on the evaporation
of the external water by the heat of a water-bath.
    The unequal action of the septum, which causes the separation
 described, appears to depend upon this : — The crystalloid sugar is
 capable of taking water from the hydrated colloidal septum, and
 thus obtains   a medium for diffusion          ;  but the colloid gum has little
 or no power to     separate      the combined water of the same septum,
 and does not therefore open the door for its escape by diffusion, as
 the sugar does.      This separating action of the colloidal septum is
 spoken of   as dialysis.
    Dialysis  was applied to the preparation            of various colloids.      The
 mixed solution obtained by pouring silicate of soda into water acidu
 lated with hydrochloric         acid,    was placed upon a parchment-paper

                                          246
dialyser and allowed to diffuse into water, the latter being occasion
ally changed.         After the    lapse   of  five days     seven-eighths of the
original silicic acid was found to remain liquid upon the septum,                 and
to be   so free  from hydrochloric acid and chloride of sodium as not to
give   a precipitate with       acid nitrate of silver.         The true hydrated
alumina, and also Mr. Crum's metalumina, were obtained soluble by
dialysing solutions of these oxides in the chloride and acetate of the
same metal.        So also the hydrated peroxide of iron, in addition to
the hydrated metaperoxide           of iron of M. Pean         de Saint Gilles,   and
the soluble hydrated chromic oxide.               The   varieties  of prussian blue
are  obtained soluble by dialysing their solution in oxalate of ammonia,
the latter salt diffusing away.           Stannic and titanic acids appear           as
insoluble gelatinous hydrates.

tion of hydrochloric        acid,  gave at once       the pure gummic acid of
Frerny.      Soluble albumen is obtained in            a state    of purity   by dia
 lysing that substance with an addition of acetic acid.
    Caramel of sugar, purified by repeated precipitation by alcohol and
afterwards by dialysis, contains more carbon than any of the cara-
melic bodies of Gelis      ; it forms    a tremulous     jelly when concentrated,
and appears decidedly colloidal.             Caramel, like all other colloids, has
a soluble and an insoluble modification.              The latter    has its solubility
restored by the action of alkali, followed by that of acetic acid and
subsequent      dialysis.
    Dialysis    proves    highly useful in separating           arsenious   acid and
 metallic poisons from organic fluids.             Defibrinated blood, milk, and
 other organic fluids charged with a few milligrammes of arsenious
 acid, and placed upon the dialyser, were found to impart the greater
 proportion     of  the arsenious    acid to the external water in the course
 of twenty-four hours.         The   diffusate was so free from organic matter,
 that the metal could be readily precipitated by sulphuretted hydro
 gen, and the quantity weighed.
    Ice  at or near its melting-point appears to be a colloidal substance,
 and exhibits a resemblance         to a firm    jelly in elasticity,   the tendency
 to rend, and to redintegrate on contact.
    The consideration of        the properties    of gelatinous colloids appears
 to show that osmose is principally an           affair of the dehydration of the
 gelatinous septum under influences having              a  catalytic character, and

                                           247
that the phenomenon is independent of diffusion.                       The colloidal
septum is capable          of hydrating itself       to a higher degree in contact
with pure water than in contact with alkaline solution.                       Colloidal
septa,   swollen in consequence           of contact with dilute acid or alkali,
appear to acquire increased            sensibility to osmose, in consequence          of
their unusually high degree           of hydration.
III. " On       some new Phenomena              of Residuary Charge, and the
        Law of Exploding Distance of Electrical Accumulation on
        Coated Glass."           By Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S. Re
        ceived May 17, 1861.
                                      (Abstract.)
     A main   object  of this paper     is to prove that residuary charge in the
 Leyden     jar, subsequent      to explosive discharge through an external
 interrupted     circuit,   as  in the case of discharge by        a  Lane's electro
 meter, is not the result of a spreading of the charge                  upon the un-
 coated part     of the    glass, or  of penetration within its substance, but
 arises from an      undischarged portion of the accumulation left as it
 were    behind, and still existing in precisely the same way and under
  the same conditions as the original charge.
      The author introduces his subject with sundry observations on
  Lane's discharging electrometer, and the law of explosive discharge,
  and adverts to the fact recorded by Nicholson in the Royal Society's
  Transactions for     1  789,   that   " although in     moderate    charges the ex
  ploding distance appears exactly, or very nearly, proportionate to the
  charge itself, yet for high intensity, the distance to which the charge
  is carried exceeds that proportion          :
                                                "   this the author finds to be the
  case generally,     and     quotes    an experimental example          showing     the
   amount of deviation from Lane's               law in that particular instance.
   He  further shows, that in order to obtain explosive             discharges at the
   increased distances agreeing with the calculated number of measures,
   the distances must be slightly increased by certain small quantities.
      The probable    sources     of these differences     are now adverted to, and
   the  common objections           to   Lane's    discharging     electrometer con
   sidered.    A  new and improved form            of this instrument    is figured and
   described.     One of its principal advantages            is a means    of changing
   the exploding points of the discharging balls, which are moveable on

                                                       248
axial centres,         so as to bring              a new point            of the circumference into
play, should abrasion                 or any other defect arise in the existing ex
ploding point.             The author             endeavours            to show that the apparent
irregularities         so frequently              observed        in the striking          distance    of a
charged electrical jar, do not arise from any defect in the quantity
measure,       or in the exploding electrometer when properly constructed,
but are altogether dependent on some peculiar conditions of electrical
accumulation on coated glass.
     One remarkable peculiarity of the electrical jar, is a disposition to
retain a portion of the charge notwithstanding                                   explosive discharge
has occurred through                  a   discharging circuit             ; we do     not discharge the
whole accumulation                ;   a   portion      is,   as   it   were, left behind.       The fact
itself   is   undisputed, but the cause or theoretical explanation does not
appear to have been very clearly comprehended.
     The author            here       introduces         some          interesting    quotations from
certain unpublished manuscripts of                           Mr. Cavendish, who investigated
so long        since    as   the years             1771       and 1772,         what he terms the
"charges  of plate glass and other electrical substances coated in
the manner of Leyden phials."       Mr. Cavendish found his experi
mental inquiries greatly embarrassed by the " spreading of the elec
tricity" on the glass;                it    is,   he says, faster on some kinds of glass
than on others         ;   besides the slow and gradual spreading, he observed
an instantaneous spreading, visible in the dark,                                     and extending to
about "07 of an inch beyond the edge of the coating upon glass '2
of   an inch thick,          and about '09 upon glass                       yjth of     an inch       thick.
Another source of inconvenience, observes                                Mr. Cavendish,      arises from
a certain amount of penetration of the charge into the substance of
the glass itself, equal to about ^ths of its thickness the space, he                   ;
says,    within    which the charge cannot penetrate                             is   not above     ^-th   of
the thickness, from which he concludes that the charge of                                       a   coated
electric will be different in cases in which this penetration of the
charge into the substance                   of the      glass varies, and infers that different
electrics are susceptible of different degrees of charge.                                  He examined
plates    of   glass    of various kinds,               as also        of gum-lac, rosin, bees-wax,
&c,      and found the capacity                   of   these substances         for electrical charge
different — phenomena recently explained by Faraday's                                      fine discovery
of Specific Inductive Capacity.
   This last celebrated philosopher                          also recognizes         the penetration or

                                        249
infiltration   of electrical   charge   within   the substance      of  coated    and
charged electrics,     and attributes it to   a  certain amount of conducting
power in the electrical substance.         All  substances,     he infers, are con
ductors of electricity in a greater or less degree, and thus admit of
infiltration of charge through their      substance.      In  the case  of charged
electrics, the infiltrated electricity subsequently returns upon its path,
and hence residuary charge.
    The author     has no disposition to question the experimental results
arrived at by either of these eminent men, but is of opinion that they
apply to a different case of electrical force than that of secondary and
 immediate discharge, supervening upon a primary discharge of an
electrical jar, through an external explosive circuit, which he thinks
can neither be referred to any previous spreading of the charge upon
the glass, or to any penetration of it into its substance,             or to return
 action   as described   by Faraday.      He   has found that     of  100 measures
 of .accumulated     charge on a jar with imperfect conducting coatings,
no less than 75 measures, or three-fourths nearly of the whole accu
 mulation, has been loft behind after explosive discharge.                 In   a  jar
 coated    with water,    full   14   measures   out of 100,        or about     one-
 seventh,    was left undischarged.        He thinks it difficult to reconcile
 such an amount of residuary charge as this, with any spreading of
 the electricity on the glass, or any possible amount of penetration
 into its substance.
    Although the deductions of Cavendish and Faraday may not be
 found to apply as solutions of the interesting problem of residuary
 charge, they still find their application in other cases, as in the case
 of the facts noticed by Nicholson already detailed.              The intensity of
 explosive discharge may apparently become increased                 by  a  penetra
 tion of the exploding electricity into the air separating the balls of
 the discharging electrometer,        in which case the measured           distances
 of discharge, according to Cavendish, would, for given measured
  quantities of electricity, continually decrease, and discbarge at the
 measured distances       between     the exploding      balls would appear to
 happen prematurely.          It  is now shown      by reference     to a Table     of
 experimental results, that at distances         1, 2, 3, 4,   taken in tenths of
 an inch, with quantities        of measured    charge also      as  1,2,  3, 4, the
 actual distances of explosion are nearly        as  'I, -214, '325, -445.        The
 author     hence   infers that,     supposing the penetration of the first

                                                      250
measures           very small and not of much value, the penetration of the
succeeding             measures may be taken as '014, -025, '045, that is *007,
•0125, '0225 upon each                   of the       opposed       exploding points, taking the
surfaces          of   the exploding balls as curvilinear                        coatings to the inter
vening air.
     If   any considerable spreading of the charge                                  upon the uucoated
glass should arise, that, as remarked by Cavendish, would be equiva
lent to an increase                of   the coating, and hence                    the tension        due to a
given quantity of charge would be less.  The effect would be greater
on the first measured quantity than on succeeding quantities ; hence
for explosion at             a   first distance, an additional two or three measures
might         be required, which,               as    the spread             upon the glass           became
satisfied,        might not be requisite in the same proportion                                  upon suc
ceeding        measured           distances,    in which case discharge would ensue
with a less number of measures than calculation determines according
to Lane's law, making it appear                        as   if,   according to Nicholson,               " the
intensity ran before the quantity."
     Both Franklin               and    Nicholson         have taken            a   sound practical and
theoretical view of electrical accumulation on coated glass, which the
author conceives                 to depend      on    a     play of opposite electrical forces,
either directly through the glass intermediate between the coatings,
or through the medium of an external circuit, or both.                                               He con
siders the terms             "free"       and        " compensated," or "latent" electri
city, perfectly admissible when correctly applied and limited by sound
definition.            All   the accumulated charge,                    up to the exploding point,
is   evidently not sensible               to the electrometer,                   and he thinks        it   con
venient to distinguish between                        that portion of the charge of which
the electrometer directly says nothing, and that portion to which its
indications are more immediately referable,                                    more especially as these
two, or conjugate portions, have important relations to each other.
Thus      a   double measured charge has twice the amount of free charge                                     ;
and the free charge,               as estimated         by attractive force,             is   as the square
of the accumulation.                    When the free charge explodes,                           the whole
accumulation, or nearly all, goes with                            it,   at least in common cases             of
metallic coated glass,                 and according to Nicholson                    carries    it   through
distances proportionate to the charge itself                             :     the terms       "free"      and
              "                                                          it,   " electricitedissimulee,"
"latent           electricity, or, as the French have
may not be exact or admissible,                      if   meant to imply            a   difference    in   kind

                                            251
 or mode       of action of electrical     force,  but they are by no means
objectionable when denoting different amounts of the same force in
this or that direction.
    In considering the nature of electrical accumulation                 on coated
electrics and the law of explosive discharge, we have to deal with                  a
simple question of physical force taken in the abstract, and not with
a theoretical electric fluid or fluids of high elasticity, subject to ex
pansion or contraction, changes           in thickness    of stratum,       tension,
density, and the like.        The    terms    "tension"     and   "intensity,"     so
commonly        applied to designate      degrees   of electrical   force, are con
venient and not inappropriate terms when legitimately applied and
limited by definition.       The   term intensity is well adapted        to express
the attractive force of the charge in the direction of the electrometer,
and which, in continually increasing according to a known law, ter
minates in explosion.       The intensity or attractive      force varies with the
          of  the charge.    The term " tension is
                                                      "   more especially appli
 square
 cable to the constrained state       of the dialectric particles sustaining      the
 induction necessary     to the charge,      and is equivalent to the reactive
 force of the particles in an interrupted circuit of discharge to break
 down or reverse the polarized state of the dialectric medium impeding
 discharge, as between the exploding balls of the Lani'f discharger :
 this is as the quantity of charge directly.         In employil       ihese terms,
 the author has not the least view to any specific changes in the quality
 or condition of the accumulated electricity,            as   relating to density,
  elasticity, and such like.      Whether       the tension and intensity       of   a
  charge,   as evidenced   by the electrometer,       be great or little,    he con
  ceives that the nature    of the force and its mode       of operation remains
  the same.      Viewing the process of electrical accumulation and dis
  charge in the Leyden jar as the result of certain powers or forces
  operating either immediately through the glass or through an external
  circuit, or both, we may readily imagine that at the critical             point at
  which the forces in the two directions become balanced, and at which
  poiut the equilibrium of charge is, at it were, overset on the side of
  the exterior circuit, then it is that residual charge ensues, either by a
  momentary revulsion of force between the coatings in the direction of
  the intervening glass, frequently causing fracture, or otherwise by a
  retention of some of the charge in that direction at the instant of
   explosion.     Some instructive and important experiments by              Mr. T.
   Howldy     are here quoted     in support of this conclusion, from              the

                                         252
                                                   '
pages    of the ' Philosophical Magazine             for the year 1815.         A ruptured
jar had the coatings removed from around the perforated part, so as to
admit of the jar receiving a given amount of charge. When explosive
 discharge took place in the usual way,               a spark was observed to pass at
 the same instant between the coatings through the perforation in the
 glass,    evidently showing an exertion of force in that direction.                     This
 spark is entirely independent of the discharge in the                          circuit,  the
 force of which remains the same             as  if   no such perforation existed,          as
 Priestley and other electricians, and            Mr. Howldy himself,             have   fully
 demonstrated.
    Considering the question of residual charge                as bearing materially on
 our views of the nature of electrical force, the author seeks to inves
tigate,     by new forms and kinds of experiment, the relation of the
residual quantity to the whole charge, whether accumulated on glass
coated with very perfect conductors such as the metals,                        or otherwise
with less perfect conductors,          as water,       or with imperfect conductors,
 such   as   paper,   linen and the like.            The instruments employed              are
now enumerated          and commented        on, and their experimental arrange
 ment figured and described.            They    consist of the electrical or Leyden
jar;      Lane's    improved     electrometer;           the hydrostatic electrometer
 as   recently perfected     ;  the thermo-electrometer             ;   quantity or unit-
 measure     ;  and battery charger and discharger.                The following is the
 course which the author pursued in his inquiries, through the medium
 of  these instruments.
    The quantity of       charge    being given,          its intensity is measured         by
 the hydrostatic electrometer          in terms      of attractive force      at a constant
 distance,     suppose   at distance    1  inch.        This is first    noted  :  the jar is
 now    discharged through         its exploding distance             by completing the
 circuit    through     the Lane's      discharger.           The hydrostatic        electro
 meter, being now made           perfectly neutral, is again brought into con
 nexion with the inner coating of tbe jar.                   The intensity or attractive
 force of the residuary or remaining charge is now noted, but as this
 force is necessarily small, it is taken with the attracting plates at a
 diminished distance from         '1  to  "3  of  an inch or more, as the case may
 require, and subsequently reduced                to the standard distance            of  one
 inch, taking the force to vary,           as  demonstrable by the electrometer,
 as          This being determined, the relative quantities of electricity
     jja.
 in the full charge and the residual charge will be                   as  the square roots

                                           253
of the   respective     attractive forces or intensities         ;   the total force, as
also demonstrable by the instrument, being as the square                          of the   ae-
cumulation.        Let, for example, the quantity of charge communicated
to the jar be 100 measures, and the attractive force, or intensity at
distance   one inch, be 144 degrees,          and suppose       intensity of residual
force at the same distance=*08.               In this     case we have          the simple
proportion      100 measures      : x  measures     : :   V 144   :  ^-08     : :  12  : '283
and   quantity of residual electricity          = 100 x    — '283 = 2-35           measures
nearly  ; so  that of the original 100 measures of charge communicated
to the jar, rather more than -jLth remains undischarged in this case.
   The author       here offers some explanatory observations on the rela
tive dimensions and extent of coating of the unit of measure                        and the
relative value of the measures            quoted, and he thinks            if   electricians
would agree to recognize         a  standard instrument of this description, it
would be attended with very considerable advantage,                     as in the case      of
other standard instruments.              The unit of       measure      he employs ex
poses about 9 square inches           of coating ; it is about        4 inches long, *8
of an inch in diameter,        and   -^yth of an inch thick           ; distance      of   ex
ploding balls '05 of an inch.              Similar observations were applied to
the thermo-electrometer, the ball of which is 4 inches in diameter,
and has a wire of platinum through it of -01 of an inch in diameter.
The dimensions of        the attracting discs      of   the hydrostatic electrometer
are also noted, which in these experiments were 4 inches in diameter                          ;
the suspended disc weighs 82 grains.               The    discs are carefully gilded          ;
5 degrees    of  the arc    of measure represents         a force    of  1  grain, that is
to say, a weight of         1  grain added to either side moves                   the index
5 degrees   of the   scale.    Having offered these preliminary remarks, the
author proceeds to the following experiments                 : —
   Experiment        1. — Variable     charges,    amounting to 50,               100,    150
measures,     were successively       accumulated on different jars, exposing
from two to six square feet of coating, and the residual charges due to
each noted     ;  these were found to be as the total charge.                      Thus the
residual charge for 100 measures             was in every case double that for
 50 measures.
   In  a succeeding        Table are noted      —measured           charge    ;   exploding

very nearly          ;   intensities     and thermo-electric                 effect    of discharge           as
square of the quantity or number of measure accumulated.
     The author finds that for               every metal-coated  jar, whether large or
small, of thick or thin glass,                  exposing from 1*5 to 6 feet of coating,
the residual charge or quantity left undischarged, varies between the
limits of    ^th and ^th of                 the total charge.
     Experiment          2 investigates the effect              of thickness of               glass.       Two
jars, exposing 2*5 square feet of coating, were employed, their rela
tive thickness being as                 1:2, that        is,
                                                               ^ths and           £>tha       of   an inch     ;
100 measures were                accumulated and discharged at their respective
exploding        distances.          The following results appeared: — exploding
distance     directly       as   thickness of glass intensity or attractive force in
                                                          ;
direction of electrometer as square of the thickness                             ;    residuary charge
in   each case the same, being about                 -j'jth part of the total             charge       ;   ther
mo-electric effect of discharge very nearly the same                               ;    so that whether
discharged from thick glass or thin, under intensities of very different
degrees     the same quantity of electricity produces the same effect.
The intensities in this               case were as   4   :     1,   yet the thermo-electric effect
did not differ more than one or two degrees, one being                                    1   2°, the other
13°.      The author finds, by numerous experiments                                on   a   series     of jars,
that the intensity indication has no influence on the force of discharge,
the quantity discharged being the same.                                 In   a   series   of jars of dif
ferent magnitudes, and in which the intensity of                                   a    given charge of
100 measures              varied between         the limits          of   100 and         1000       degrees,
there did not appear              a    difference   of   more than           a   few degrees amongst
the whole        ;   the effects varied between            8    and       1
                                                                          1   degrees.          Some       little
differencewill generally arise in favour of electricity accumulated on                                         a
small area of coated glass in consequence of the greater facility of dis
                                        ;
charge the accumulation has greater freedom of operation through the
external circuit,           as   is   shown by its greater, effect on the electrometer.
     A   celebrated        electrician, the late         Mr. Brooke of Norwich, in con                 a
ference with Cuthbertson about the year                             1   800, stated that           a   Leyden
jar    coated with strips             of metal Jths of         an inch wide, leaving intervals
of the     same width between the strips, was equally efficient as                                      a   full
coating in the ordinary way.                        Two        equal      and similar jars, about
1    foot in diameter and 19 inches high, were prepared accordingly;
one      fully   coated      to about       4   square     feet,        the other coated in strips

to about                     The author, although doubting this
                3*5 square feet.                                                                        state
ment in all its generality, still considered an investigation of                                  it,   more
especially coming from such men as Brooke and Cuthbertson, desi
rable, and        as   being calculated to throw further light on the pheno
mena of the Leyden jar.
    A     few preliminary             experiments              seemed     to accord with                 Mr.
Brooke's view           ;                of the two jars with
                            the exploding distance             given                              a
charge   did not appear extremely different.   The accumulated  elec
tricity spread upon the glass between the strips of metal, and thus
enabled the partially coated jar to receive                       a   larger accumulation, upon
the principle stated by Cavendish, than was really due to its extent
of actual coating.                Mr. Brooke, in the then               state   of practical electri
city, might have been therefore easily led to imagine that                                        a   partial
coating such            as he describes          was sufficient.           It   is,   however, shown
in this paper that the cases of the two jars are widely different.                                         As
the spread of the electricity becomes satisfied,    less charge             a                         is   re
quired for explosion, and the tension of                          a   given quantity increases.
The following               are   the results of experiments with                      100 measures
similar to the preceding             :—
                                          Full        coating.
    Exploding          distance                    *15           Intensity 100° at    inch.   1
    Residual measures                             2*45           Therm, electric effect 8°.
                                         Partial coating.
    Mean exploding distance              .   .     *25            Intensity 160°.
    Residual measures                             4-97            Therm, electric effect 3*5°.
    It   is   evident the two forms of coating are not equally efficient,                                 the
heating effect of discharge not being half as great in the partially
coated       jar, whilst     the residual charge          is   twice as great.        The experiment
so far shows           the spread     of electricity on the uncoated                      glass to be       a
source of absorption of charge to                     a   greater or less extent, and goes
far to confirm          the views     of Mr. Cavendish, relative to the spreading
of electricity on glass.
   The phenomena of metal-coated jara having been so far examined,
a similar course of experiment   followed with jars coated with less
                                                 is
perfect conductors, commencing with water coatings.                                     For this pur
pose     a   jar exposing nearly         5   square feet        of coating was prepared with
metal coating, and the results of                a    charge     of 100 measures determined
                                                                                      T   %

                                       256
and noted as before        ; the metal coating being removed,            the same   jar
had an equal extent of water applied to its opposite surface coating.
The method of effecting this is           described.     The author      states that  it
was so perfect as to shield the experiment from all interference                      of
vapour from the water surface,             so that the    jar completely retained
the charge     without any dissipation, and in no sense differed in this
respect from a metal-coated          jar.
    The results of this experiment are not a little remarkable. The
exploding distance of the 1 00 measures, whether with the metal or
with the water coating, did not materially differ, except in apparent
force,    being for the metal *22, for the water "2.                  The exploding
spark from the water coating, instead of the sharp ringing sound
attendant on the exploding spark from the metal coating, is weak and
subdued, and is often like the sound of fired damp gunpowder.                      The
intensity or attractive force is also in each case alike, or very nearly                ;
being for the metal coating 144°, for the water 142°.                  The residuary
charges    differed    considerably, being for the metal coating about 2-25
measures,      or about      ^th part of the total charge; for the water
coating 14-5 measures, or about the -fth of the total charge. The
residuary charge with a water coating is more than six times as great as
with     a metal coating.         The thermo-electric        effect  with the metal
 coating was      10°, with     the water coating nothing        ;  200 measures, or
double the charge, had no effect on the thermo-electrometer.
    In   this experiment it does not appear requisite that both the
 coatings should be water         ; one   coating may be metal,         as in the first
 forms of the electrical jar.          The author could       not, at least, discover
 any material difference in the results, and concludes that                 if the first
 forms of the electrical jar with an internal coating of water had been
 continued, we should have had but small experience of the effects of
 artificial electrical discharge on metallic wires.
     Imperfect conducting substances           employed     as coatings     to the elec
 trical jar have very similar but very exaggerated              effects.     "With coat-
'ings of paper we have         a striking example of retention of charge.             A
 jar exposing     5-5 feet   of  coated glass,   first coated with metal and sub
  sequently with paper,        gave the following       results under a charge        of
  100 measures.
     Exploding      distances, as in the former case, nearly the same, being
  •23  and '25     ;   attractive forces    or intensity also nearly the same,

                                       257
being 158° and 160°;        residual measures with the metal coating 2-5
measures, or about the-j^th      of the total charge; with paper coating, in
some experiments 80       measures, or about T87ths of the total charge, so
that the residual charges with metal and paper are as           1 : 32. Thermo
electric effect for metal coating 8°, for paper coating nothing.                 It
appears    from these and similar experiments, that the interposition of
imperfect conductors between the coating and the glass of the Leyden
jar must     necessarily  impair its efficiency, and change          its electrical
indications,    especially when of any considerable thickness.               Three
turns of common linen interposed between the outer coating and the
glass reduced the force      of discharge from     1 1° to 6°, nearly one-half,
whilst   the  residuary or retention of charge      is considerably increased     :
 this question,  as  bearing in some degree on the retention of charge by
 the electric cable, may not be undeserving of further investigation.
 IV. " On     the Bromide of Carbon."        By Arthur C. W. Lennox,
        Esq.    Communicated by Dr. Hofmann. Received May 24,
        1861.
    The compounds of carbon with bromine have as yet received but
 limited attention. The tetrabromide of carbon, CBrt, of the methyl-
 series is altogether unknown.        Kolbe failed in obtaining this com
 pound by submitting disulphide of carbon at a high temperature to
 the action of bromine, and I learn from Dr. Hofmann that the action
 of pentabromide of antimony on the disulphide gives no better result.
    The bromide of carbon, Ca Br4, has been obtained by Lowig*, who
 procured this substance by the action of bromine on alcohol or on
 ether, when it is formed according to the equations—
                C,H, 0+4Bra=           G,Br4+4HBr-|-Ha0.
                C4 H10 O  + 8 Bra= 2 Ca   Br4 + 8H Br + Ha O.
    These processes appear, however, to be attended with difficulties ;
 at all events, Volckelf, who repeated Lowig's experiments, failed in
 obtaining the substance      described  by that chemist.
    A simpler   method for obtaining this bromide of carbon appeared to
 present itself in the perfect substitution      of bromine for     the hydrogen
 in defiant   gas.

   The brominated derivatives of ethylene            have been chiefly examined
by Regnault       and by Cahours, and more recently by Wurtz and by
Sawitch.
   The following terms        have been obtained      : —
         Dibromide of Ethylene.                    Monobrominated Ethylene.
               C^Br,.                                      CaHaBr.
     Dibromide of Monobrominated                     Dibrominated Ethylene.
                 Ethylene.
                                                          CaHaBra.
            Ca  (HaBr)Bra.                          Tribrominated Ethylene.
  Dibromide of Dibrominated Ethylene.                      CaHBr,.
            Ca(HaBra)Bra.
  Dibromide of Tribrominated Ethylene.
             Ca(HBra)Bra.
    It thus appears that the whole 6eries has been obtained with the
exception of the tetrabrominated ethylene and its corresponding dibro
mide, the former of which would be the bromide of carbon obtained
by Lowig in the reactions above indicated.               Of the brominated deri
vatives   of ethylene, dibromide of ethylene, monobrominated ethylene
                                                                               have
 (bromide of vinyl) and dibromide of monobrominated ethylene,
as yet been best investigated.            In re-examining    these substances,   in
 transforming      dibromide of ethylene by the action of an alcoholic
 solution of potash into monobromiuated ethylene, and the latter by
 treatment with bromine into the corresponding dibromide,                  I had an
 opportunity      of tracing    step   by step the observations of my pre
 decessors.
                             Dibrominated      Ethylene.
    The action of     an alcoholic solution      of potash upon the dibromide
 of monobrominated ethylene yields, together with secondary products,
 a comparatively small quantity of the oily compound Ca Ha Bra, which
 is still further diminished by the extraordinary property exhibited by
 this substance of undergoing a molecular transformation similar to
 that of dichlorinated        ethylene as observed        by Regnault*, and       of
 monobrominated ethylene more recently examined by Dr. Hofmann                    f.
 Dibrominated ethylene having been lately the subject of a minute

  close  examination of this body, but have at once, by the renewed
  action of bromine, converted it into the
                   Dibromide    of Dibrominated Ethylene.
     Bromine    attacks the dibrominated         ethylene with      the greatest
 energy;    heat is evolved,    and the bromine disappears.            When the
  bromine was no longer fixed, the orange-yellow liquid thus produced
 was treated with a weak solution       of   potash,   washed with water, and
 ultimately distilled with precaution.      It boils  at about 200°   C,  but not
 without partial decomposition      ; white fumes containing hydrobromic
 acid being given' off during ebullition, which powerfully and persist
 ently attack the eyes.
     The bromine-compound is insoluble in         water, but dissolves readily
 in alcohol and in ether.       When     exposed    to a freezing mixture,       it
 solidifies to a white crystalline mass.         It  was found impossible to
 purify this  substance   for analysis by distillation     ;  a current    of per
 fectly dry carbonic acid gas was therefore passed through the liquid
 heated   in a water bath to about 75°.           After   a time  it   assumed    a
lighter colour, and no longer gave off hydrobromic acid           ;  it was then
found to contain
                                   CaHsBrr
                          Tribrominated     Ethylene.
     The dibromide previously     described is powerfully acted upon by an
alcoholic solution of potash,
              Ca Ha  Br4+K H 0=Ca H Br, + K Br+Ha 0.
    Addition of  water to the alcoholic solution~precipitates         the tribro
minated ethylene      as an oily substance     boiling at 130°    C,    which by
digestion with chloride of calcium and        subsequent   careful distillation,
may be obtained sufficiently pure for analysis.
    The results obtained in    the analysis   of this compound prove it to
be represented by the formula
                                   CaHBr3.
    Tribrominated    ethylene, like the other substitution-products            of
ethylene, is apt to furnish        an  isomeric     solid, readily    soluble in
alcohol and in ether, from which it crystallizes in colourless plates.
On slowly evaporating     a solution  of  the oily modification   in alcohol or
ether, the crystalline solid is likewise obtained.

                 Dibromide     of Tribrominated Ethylene.
   To obtain this compound, tribrominated ethylene            was introduced
into a retort, and cautiously distilled into      a receiver  containing bro
mine.    Combination took place with considerable evolution of heat.
The orange-red liquid thus produced was washed with weak potash,
and ultimately with water. Thus purified, this bromine-compound is
a yellowish   red oil, soluble in alcohol and in ether, and solidifying
when exposed      to a frigorific     mixture.    I  have   not succeeded    in
preparing this substance in      a state   of sufficient purity for analysis.
But the nature of this body is clearly established by the facility with
which it is transformed into
          Tetrabrominated Ethylene or Bromide             of Carbon,
by the action of an alcoholic solution of potash.
   Addition of water to the alcoholic             solution   precipitates  this
compound     as   an   oily liquid,    which,   when slowly      deposited  by
spontaneous   evaporation from its solution in alcohol or ether, separates
in beautiful crystalline plates      of  an agreeable    aromatic odour and
burning taste.     One or two recrystallizations render this substance
perfectly pure.    It is heavier than water, fuses at 50° C, sublimes at a
higher temperature, and is not attacked by the mineral acids.
   These properties identify        this compound with       the bromide     of
carbon obtained by Lowig in the action of bromine upon alcohol and
upon ether.
   For analysis,  the substance was dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo         ;
the formula
                                     C.Br,
was established by the determination both         of carbon   and  of bromine.
The tetrabrominated ethylene is generated by the action of an
alcoholic solution of potash upon the dibromide of tribrominated
ethylene, according to the following equation         : —
             CaHBr, + KHO = CaBr4+KBr+H,0.
   The experiments which form the subject of this              note were per
formed in the laboratory of Dr. Hofmann.

V. " On the Action of Dibromide of Ethylene on Pyridine." By
   John Davidson, Esq.                Communicated by Dr. Hofmann.
   Received May 24, 1861.
   Pyridine,    as  is well known, has been obtained in the destructive
distillation of coal, of certain varieties of sbale, and of animal sub
stances.      The   specimen    with which      I   worked was obtained from
coal-tar, and separated        by distillation    from the picoline    :  it boiled
constantly at 118°-5C.
   A mixture of pyridine           and   dibromide       of ethylene gradually
darkens, and at last becomes brown           ;  no crystals, however,       are de
posited   ;  on the other hand, the reaction proceeds with rapidity at
100° C.       After   the lapse  of three hours       the   mixture is converted
into an almost black crystalline mass, from which, by successive
treatment with cold, and crystallization from hot, alcohol, a beautiful
bromide, crystallizing in silky plates, is obtained.            In preparing this
bromide, it is advisable      to add to the mixture of the anhydrous sub
stances about one-fifth       or one- sixth of its volume of alcohol, and to
digest in sealed tubes.        The whole liquid solidifies in this manner
into a silky crystalline mass, which is only very slightly coloured.
   The crystalline bromide is extremely soluble in water              ;   I did not
succeed     in getting crystals from the aqueous            solution.    It is very
soluble in boiling, but dissolves         only slightly in cold alcohol       ; the
boiling alcoholic solution solidifies on cooling into a pearly crystal-
hue mass.       Larger and transparent crystals may be obtained from
dilute solutions, but in no case were their forms sufficiently perfect
for determination.        The simplest    expression     arrived at in analysing
the bromide is the formula
                                  C.H7NBr*;
but the mode of formation of the new compound unmistakeably shows
that this expression must        be  doubled, and that the composition and
weight of its molecule is represented          by the formula
                                  CuHuNaBra.
   Pyridine,     then, imitates triethylamine        and triethylphosphine        in
their deportment with dibromide of ethylene,              the new bromide being

The constitution of pyridine itself is but imperfectly                         made out.            All
we know is that this substance               is   a   tertiary monamine           ;   the nature     of
the radicals which replace the hydrogen is                    as    yet uncertain.          Pyridine,
in    accordance    with our present knowledge, may be represented                                  by
the expression
                                      (C.H,)»'N,
and the molecular construction           of       the new bromide may be expressed
by the formula

The composition of        the bromide is confirmed by the analysis                              of the

The solution of     the dibromide, when mixed with freshly precipitated
oxide of silver in the cold, furnishes                  a   transparent colourless and
powerfully      alkaline liquid which contains the corresponding                                base,

The   existence    of this compound in the solution                     is   readily proved by
saturating with hydrochloric acid, and adding dichloride of platinum,
when the pale       yellow platinum-salt               previously mentioned                is   preci
pitated.     This salt   was submitted to analysis.

   The hydrates of the diatomic pyridine-derivatives               are far less stable
than Professor Hofmann's ethylated bases in the nitrogen- and phos
phorus-series.       Even at the common temperature, much more                   so  by
ebullition,    the solution of the free base becomes              pink, violet, and
finally   ruby-red,     and deposits after some           time a brown powder,
a peculiar odour like that        of the heliotrope being         at the same time
evolved.     I  have    not examined more minutely the changes                 which
the pyridine-compound thus undergoes.
   The   above experiments were performed in                Dr. Hofmann's labora
tory.

three equivalents of hydrogen in the original compounds.
   In continuing my experiments              on the replacement         of hydrogen
by nitrogen in organic bodies generally,               I have not only succeeded
in producing similar compounds from nearly all the basic derivatives
of aniline, but have also obtained corresponding products from
toluidine    and    anisidine.    The following          equation represents        the

 VII. "      Reproduction of Non-Nitrogenous              Acids from Amidic

         Hofmann. Received May 24, 1861.
     In  several   previous communications       I have  pointed out the exist
  ence  of  a  peculiar double acid,
                                    CuHnNa04,
 formed by the action of nitrous acid on amidobenzoic acid.                This
 acid, which       I  have   designated   as  amidodiazobenzoic    acid,  when
 again submitted in the presence             of hot alcohol to the action of
 nitrous acid, is changed according to the following equation         : —
CuHIINa04 + 2CaH60 + HNda = 2C,He0a+2CaH40                        + 2HaO+4N.
 Double acid.      Alcohol.    Nitrous    Non-nitroge-  Aldehyde.
                                 acid.     nous acid.
     The non-nitrogenous acid thus reproduced exhibits the composi
  tion of benzoic acid     ; it differs, however, in its properties essentially
  from that acid. Since the publication of Kolbe and Lautemann's ex
  periments on salylic acid,      I  have found that the acid in question is
  identical with the latter.
     Salylic acid may be much more readily obtained by submitting an

                                                    267

 exhibit        a similar      deportment, furnishing               a   non-nitrogenous         acid
 isomeric or identical with the acid which, by conversion into a nitro
 compound and subsequent                   reduction, had given rise to the formation
 of the amidic acid.                 In the following           cases I  have    experimentally
 established this transformation.

both from toluic acid and the homologue of salylic acid. — P. G.

        Communicated         by Dr. Hofmann. Received May 24, 1861.
     The action of cyanic acid          and  of the cyanic ethers on the mona-
 mines    gives   rise   to the formation of the substances known as the
 compound ureas.          By substituting diamines for the monamines in the
 above reaction,     I  have succeeded in producing a series           of compound
 ureas   of a higher order, which are remarkable for their well-defined
 properties and for their characteristic decompositions.
    Dichloride of etbylene-diammonium is readily attacked by cyanate
 of silver. On evaporating the solution, separated from the chloride
 of silver, a new substance       crystallizing in prisms is obtained, which        I
 designate    as  ethylene-urea.          This body      is soluble in water and
 alcohol  ; it contains
                                            (CO),"

two molecules      of cyanic    acid.
    Ethylene-urea      fuses  at 192° C.         It dissolves   easily and without
decomposition in hydrochloric or nitric acid, without, however, com
bining with these acids       ;  the acid solutions, when evaporated         to dry
ness, leave the pure ethylene-urea.            When boiled with      a very concen
trated solution of potassa, this body assimilates the elements of water
and splits into carbonic acid, ammonia, and ethylene-diamine,

     Ethylene-urea    combines with dichloride of platinum and trichlo
 ride of gold.

 tion

    The analysis of    these compounds fixes the molecular value      of the
 new urea.     It  deserves   to be noticed, that this body, although de
rived from four molecules of ammonia, exhibits nevertheless            in its
combining power the character of but one molecule of ammonia             ; it
is a monacid tetramine.

    When    cyanate-   of silver is  treated  with dibromide of ethylene-
 diethyl-diammonium,       a reaction perfectly analogous to that observed
between    cyanate   of silver and dichloride of ethylene-diammonium is
accomplished.       The solution, when separated from the bromide of
silver and evaporated, solidifies on cooling to a crystalline mass. The
new    substance may be easily purified by dissolving        it in  absolute
alcohol, from which it is deposited in the form of colourless needles,
exceedingly soluble both in water and alcohol.         The diethylated  urea

    This urea   fuses at   124°, decomposing, however,     partially at this

and a gold-salt    of very little stability, which could not be analysed.
    Cyanate of ethyl acts most energetically on ethylene- diamine.         If
the cyanate be poured into ethylene-diamine, each drop hisses like
red-hot iron plunged into water.         The mixture solidifies into a mass
of  needles, which, when recrystallized from water or spirit, furnish the
    VOl. Xi.                                                   V

new compound in a state        of purity.      The  substance    thus obtained
presents   the same composition       as the product of the action of dibro-
mide of ethylene-diethyldiammonium            on cyanate  of silver, viz.
                                C8H„N40a.
   The two    ureas, however, are far from being identical.           The urea
obtained by combining cyanate            of ethyl with ethylene-diamine is
easily soluble in boiling water, difficultly soluble in cold water, even
less soluble    in spirit, and  almost insoluble in absolute alcohol.        It
fuses,   without    decomposition, at 201°, solidifying        again at 185°.
This body is altogether indifferent.         I did not succeed in obtaining a
platinum-salt or a gold-salt of this      urea, while the isomeric substance,
derived from ethylene-diethylamine, furnishes both salts without diffi
culty.
   The non-identity of the two        bodies is thus sufficiently established,
but the absolute difference in their construction is most conspicuously
manifested in the products of decomposition, which they yield under
the influence of the alkalies.       Treated with potash, the urea, derived
from ethylene-diethyldiamine         and cyanic acid, yields ethylene-di-
ethyldiamine      and the products       of decomposition of cyanic acid,
carbonic acid and ammonia        :
        C8  H,6  N40,+4K H 0=2Ka C0a + 2Ha N + C6                 H,6  N,.
 The   urea,   on the other hand, which          is formed by the action     of
 ethylene-diamine on cyanic ether, splits into ethylene-diamine and the
 derivatives of cyanic ether, carbonic acid and ethylamine          :
       C8  H,6 N4 Oa +4 K H 0= 2 K, C 0a + 2Ca H7 N + Ca H„ N„.
    Tt is thus evident that the two individual groups of elements, the
 union of which gives rise to the two different ethylated ethylene-
 ureas, remain as such unaltered in these compounds.
    The observations which       I  have   recorded render it very probable
 that   many of those       substances    known as compound          ureas, and
 hitherto supposed to be identical, might on closer examination prove
 to be isomeric only.
    Diethylurea, obtained by treating cyanate of ethyl with ethylamine
 or with water, differs indeed most conspicuously in its properties
 from diethylurea, produced by the action of cyanic acid on diethyl-
 amine.    Under the influence of potash these two bodies split, the one
 into carbonic acid and ethylamine, the other into carbonic acid, am
 monia, and diethylamine.          Even the ethylurea, prepared by cyanic

                                                 271
acid and ethylamine,              differs in some of its physical properties from
the ethylurea obtained by the action of ammonia on cyanic ether,
although         both      substances      yield under       the influence        of chemical
agents      exactly the same products of decomposition, viz. carbonic
acid, ammonia, and ethylamine.

laboratory.

         Isomerism of Diatomic Compounds.                              By A. W. Hofmann,
         LL.D., F.R.S.                Received       May 24, 1861.
  The experiments which Dr. Volhard has described in the previous
Note, remind me of some analogous observations which I made some
time ago in the case of oxalyl-derivatives.
   While        engaged      in   experiments on the separation of the ethyl
bases by means             of oxalic      ether, which       I   have    had the honour of
laying      before      the Royal Society *,            I   had collected a considerable
quantity of diethyloxamate of ethyl,
which is formed by the action of oxalic ether upon diethylamine.                              I
have studied the deportment                   of this compound under the influence
of several       agents.
  When          digested with alcoholic ammonia in sealed tubes, diethyloxa
mate of ethyl is rapidly converted into a crystalline compound, which
on analysis was found to contain

  The      new compound then has the composition                         of diethyloxamide,

formed      by   the action of oxalic ether on ethylamine.                   It   differs from
the latter      in   many of its properties, being in fact much more soluble

        It  is thus seen that the isomeric diamides in general exhibit the
    relation which Dr. Volhard has          so   well developed for the ureas.      The

in addition, a new      class of organic bases of a higher order, containing
both ethylene and oxalyl.            The examination of           these bases, which
are not represented         among the monatomic compounds, will be the
subject of a later communication.

crystalline compound into which the liquid solidifies on cooling                                           is   no
longer the original urea.
  The principal product of this reaction difficultly soluble in cold,
                                                            is
but easily soluble in boiling water. The solution in hot water de
posits on cooling beautiful white scales of silky lustre, which, by an
additional crystallization, may be obtained in                        a   state   of perfect purity.
     On analysis, this substance was found to contain
                                          CTHuN403;
and   it   is   thus seen that urea, instead of combining with one molecule
of   cyanate      of ethyl, as     is   suggested      in the above equation, fixes two
molecules        of this ether,

     The   new substance         is   readily soluble in alcohol and ether                           ;   it   like
wise dissolves       in dilute acids, but not more than in water                                 ;   it   is   also
soluble in cold potash.                Addition of        an acid to this solution repre-
cipitates the original body without                   change      ;       ebullition with potash,
on the other hand, destroys the substance,                        the products               of      decompo

interest in revealing the diatomic character of urea, which, uniting
generally with           one     molecule of an           acid,       fixes       in     this        case two

and becomes in a measure analogous to some of the ureas of diatomic

   The latter compound differs from the crystalline substance pro
duced by the action of cyanate of ethyl on urea by the presence
of the diatomic molecule    Cs H4, in the place     of  the diatomic mole
cule CO.
   The formula of  the new compound represents        also the ammonium-

   The  substance, however, is not an ammonium-salt proprement           dit.
Acids   separate  no diethylcyanuric     acid; the alkalies in the cold
evolve no ammonia    ; dichloride of platinum produces no precipitate
in the aqueous solution.
   The mother-liquor, from which the new compound has been de
posited, contains cyanurate of ethyl and ethyl-urea, the formation of
which substances requires no special explanation.

      Derivatives of the Phenyl-Series.           By A. W. Hofmann,
      LL.D., F.R.S.       Received May 24, 1861.
   Some years ago    I pointed out the existence of       a peculiar class of
bases, which are formed by the union      of  the aromatic ammonias with
cyanogen.     Only two of    these  compounds, cyaniline       and dicyan-
melaniline, have  as  yet been more particularly examined.         I have  of
                           * See previous notice.

                                           276
late had occasion     to return to the study         of these bodies, and to make
an observation which           I   beg   leave  to communicate to the Royal
Society.
     The product which is formed by the union of one molecule of
melaniline and one molecule of cyanogen, the compound known as
dicyanomelaniline,
                      C,aH,3N» + (CN)a = C,5H,aN5,
has feebly basic     properties ; it dissolves in acids, and          may be repre-
cipitated from these solutions without change.                It   cannot, however,
remain in contact with acids without being entirely altered.                 After  a
 few minutes the limpid solution becomes turbid,               and deposits    an in
 distinctly crystalline body containing
                                     C,5  H„   Na Oa,
 an ammoniacal salt remaining in solution,
        C,5H,aN5 + 2Ha0 + 2HC1 =                  C,5 Hn   Na Oa + 2H4    NCI.
     I have  described   this substance        as melanoximide     ; it may  be con
 sidered   as  the primary oxalate of melaniline minus 2 molecules                 of
 water, which are capable of being assimilated again under the influence
 of the alkalies, oxalic     acid and melaniline being reproduced.
     Dicyanomelaniline,       when submitted in alcoholic solution to the
 action of acids, undergoes         a perfectly different change.        The boiling
  solution deposits on cooling splendid needles of an            indifferent body of
  the composition
                                     C,5H,0N,Oa,
  an ammoniacal salt, also in this case, remaining in solution,
       C,5H,aN5 + 3HaO + 3HCl =                   C,5 H,0 Na 0a   + 3H4 N CI.
      Melanoximide, occupying by its composition a place between di
  cyanomelaniline and the new compound crystallised in needles, is
  likewise readily converted         into the latter substance.         When boiled
  for  a short time with a mixture of alcohol and hydrochloric                  acid,
  melanoximide furnishes         a  solution, which, on cooling, solidifies to       a
  mass   of beautiful  needles,
         C,5HnNa0,+Ha0 + HCl = C,,HKN,0,+H4NC1.
      The  new   compound is insoluble in water, but dissolves easily in
  alcohol and ether    ;  it  is decomposed       by boiling with potassa, giving
  rise to the formation      of  a carbonate    and an oxalate with reproduction
   of phenylamine,
        ClJH,0NaOa + 4KHO = K.CO. + K.C, 0,-1-20, H7N.

                                          277
    By this transformation the          substance      is characterized as the dia
tomic ammonia-derivative of phenylic alcohol, carbonic and oxalic
acids, as carbonyl-oxalyl-diphhenyl-diamide,

    The new      substance,    both by composition and transformation, is
closely allied to some compounds already known.                        The action of
oxidizing agents on alloxan, and even on uric acid, has furnished to
Liebig and Wohler         the substance     known       as parabanic acid,
                                         (CO)

which, by the action of alkalies, is converted into a carbonate,                     an
oxalate and ammonia.
    At  a later period Stenhouse and Rochleder, when examining the
products of decomposition of caffeine under the influence respectively
of nitric    acid   and of chlorine,        observed       a  crystalline   compound
(nitrotheine, cholestrophane),

which, under the influence of alkalies, yields methylamine*                    together
with   a carbonate     and an oxalate,     and may be viewed as dimethylated
parabanic acid.
    The compound which forms the subject of this Note, accordingly
may be considered as diphenylated parabanic acid.
   The transformations of dicyanomelaniline have suggested to me the
study of the action of cyanogen upon some compounds having a com
position somewhat analogous to that of melaniline.                    Thus   the action
   * According   to Rochleder, this compound,   when boiled with potassa, yields am-
moniacal vapours, in which he suspects the presence of ethylamine.          The formula
of the substance also represents an ethyl-compound,

in this case ebullition with potassa should disengage a mixture of ethylamine       and
ammonia.     But the fact that caffeine, when boiled with an alkali, evolves methyl
amine, renders   it more probable that the caffeine-derivative   is a methyl-compound.
Experimentally the question remains undecided.

     Cyanamide         is,   in fact, capable of fixing the elements of cyanogen,
being converted              into   a   yellowish amorphous powder, which, when
heated with acids, furnishes                     a    beautiful crystalline compound, diffi
cultly soluble in water,                and deposited              from the boiling solution on
cooling in long slender needles.
     Cyanamide being very prone to molecular changes, when submitted
to the action of chemical agents,                     I   have not yet been able to procure
a   sufficient quantity of these crystals for                      a   more minute examination.
In their properties they entirely differ from parabanic acid.

       Diagnosis             of Diamines.                 By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D.,
       F.R.S.          Received May 24, 1861.
     In former parts of this inquiry                   I   have had repeated          opportunities
of discussing       the features            of distinction         between      the monamines and
diamines.    I      have shown that the study                          of the   genesis and   of the
transformations of an ammonia, and the observation of its boiling-
point supply most valuable data for the elucidation of this question                                 ;
and that the most reliable inferences                         may be drawn from the deter
mination of its vapour-density.
     In continuing my experiments upon this subject,                             I   have been led
to the discovery of           a     class   of   salts, the formation        of which    decides the
question in an equally satisfactory manner.
     Let   us imagine an ammonia                      of uncertain origin, the composition
and degree        of substitution of which                    has been       experimentally deter
mined.       It   is   obvious that              as    long   as    the boiling-point,    and more
particularly       the vapour-density,                   remain unascertained,           it   is   left
doubtful whether               the      molecular value of the new compound                          is
represented       by
                                                  or

                                        279
    Nor  is this doubt removed by the formation             of ammonias of         more
advanced      substitution.      I have    never succeeded          in limiting     the
substitution to one equivalent of hydrogen in the case of diamines                      ;
the residual hydrogen           in each of the linked ammonia-molecules is
invariably affected in the same manner.              Thus the action of iodide
of ethyl upon the ammonia under consideration will produce two
volatile bases, —

 sufficiently well established       by their origin, and by the determination
 of their boiling-points and vapour-densities ; so that the examination
 of non-volatile bases, retaining one equivalent of unreplaced hydrogen,
 is not necessary        for the elucidation       of their atomicity — affording
 simply additional evidence         in favour of facts otherwise satisfactorily
 proved.    But it is obvious how, in the        case  of compounds of uncertain
 origin, which may be easily decomposable              or difficultly accessible, the
 formation of this class of salts must facilitate the diagnosis of the
 diamines, and may, under certain conditions, become the principal
criterion for ascertaining the atomicity of an ammonia.

        F.R.S.       Received    June 13, 1861.
    In  former investigations         I have    pointed out the existence          of a
group of monacid bases containing three equivalents of nitrogen, the
principal    representatives    of which, cyandiphenyldiamine              and cyantri-
phenyldiamine, were formed by submitting                    aniline     to the   action

                                         diamine.
    I have   lately met again with this group of bases in              a new   reaction
which    I beg   leave to submit to the Royal Society.
   When examining several years ago            f the action of ethylate of sodium
upon cyanate of ethyl, I. observed the formation of triethylamine, but
in subsequent      experiments!      I could not    reproduce this compound by
                *  11 = 1 ; 0=16; C=12, &c.
                t  Proceedings  of the Royal Society, vol. viii. p. 489.

                                      282
  this method, the reaction assuming a totally different form.            I have
 not yet been able to elaborate the circumstances which determine the
 two different actions, but    I have ascertained     the nature    of the  sub
 stance which is formed instead      of triethylamine.
     Cyanate of ethyl, when allowed to flow in       a  slow stream upon per
 fectly pure ethylate of sodium, is powerfully           acted  upon   ; heat   is
 evolved, which volatilizes a portion    of the cyanate    of ethyl j by far the
 larger portion, however, is converted into cyanurate of ethyl, which
 may be obtained with all its properties, simply by exhausting the dry
 cake in the retort, after cooling, with cold water.
     On submitting the mixture of cyanurate of ethyl with ethylate of
 sodium to distillation at gradually increasing temperatures, ethylene
 gas is abundantly evolved, while a powerfully alkaline liquid condenses
 in the receiver, consisting of alcohol, an oily compound easily soluble
 in alcohol and difficultly soluble in water, ethylamine, and lastly, a
powerfully basic oil, which boils at a very high temperature, at which
it is partly decomposed.
    The basic oil forms a series of  saline compounds, amongst which the
splendidly crystallized     iodide, the beautiful platinum-salt, and the
gold-salt deserve to be mentioned.         The two latter,    on analysis, were
found to contain respectively,
                Platinum-salt  ....   C7 H»7  N„ H CI, Pt CI,.
                Gold-salt             C7  Hn N„ H CI, Au CL,.
    The composition of the     base, such as   it exists in combination with
acids, is thus seen to be represented by the formula
                                 C7H„N,.
    In  the free state, however, this substance retains with great perti
nacity one molecule of water, being in fact
                       C7H„N30     = C7H,7N3, Ha0.
    It  owes its origin to the gradual action on the cyanurate          of ethyl
of   the hydrated alkali, which is produced by the           decomposition of
the ethylate of sodium under the influence of heat,
      C8H,N3Q3 +                      =

       Cyanuric ether.                                          New base.
    The interpretation of this     new compound presents         no difficulty.

                                       283
A  glance at the formula shows that         it  represents  in the ethyl-series
the body which in the phenyl-series          I had   previously formed by the
action of tetrachloride of carbon on aniline.          I have  pointed out that
the latter may be referred either to two or to three molecules of am
monia, and presents itself respectively        as cyantriphenyl-diamine     or as
carbotriphenyltriamine,
       C„ H,TN3=(C N) (C.        H5)3   HJNa=C          (C.  H5)3 Ha}N:
   In  a similar manner the new ethylated compound may be regarded
as cyantriethyl- diamine or carbotriethyltriamine,
       C, H,T  Na
                   = (CN) (C,    H5)3   H ,} Na=C " (C, H,),       Ha} N..
   The latter formula would         illustrate in some        measure  how the
three ammonia-molecules are linked together in these compounds.
   Whatever view may be taken of these bodies, whether they be re
garded   as  diamines or triamines, they claim some interest on account
of their well-defined characters and the numerous            processes in which
they appear to     be formed.
   Methyluramine,      the base discovered       by M.   Dessaignes  among the
products of oxidation of    creatine, belongs      to the same group of bases,
and perhaps the most interesting term of the series, guanidine, has
been lately obtained by    M. Strecker by       the action  of oxidizing  agents
upon guanine.       Referred to three molecules of ammonia, the several
bases which     I   have  mentioned are represented by the following
formulae   : —
               Carbotriamine (Guanidine)
               Methylcarbotriamine      (Me
                  thyluramine)

                                                          N3.
   The perfect analogy of       these    several    compounds is beautifully
                                                                                  r

                                         284
 illustrated by the parallelism of their products of decomposition.
 Thus guanidine, when treated with nitric               acid,  is transformed into
 ammonia and urea,
                         CH,Na Ha0=HaN + CH4NaO.
      In  a similar manner the triethylated compound, when submitted to
 distillation, splits into ethylamine and dietbylurea,
         CHa (C, H,), N„ Ha O = (C, H.) Ha N + C Ha (C,              H5)a Na  O.
     The transformation of cyanuric ether into the new base presents
 additional interest, inasmuch as it exhibits the passage of this sub
 stance into ethylamine under a new aspect.                MM. Habich and Lim-
 pricht have already pointed out that this transformation is by no
 means accomplished in one bound, an indifferent intermediate com
 pound being formed, which from its products of decomposition was
 found to contain
                        C8HnNa0a=CaHa(CaIIa)aNaOa.
     The    same oily compound accompanies        the new base which is formed
 by the action of ethylate of sodium upon the cyanurate of ethyl.
 This     substance     stands   midway between the ethylated base and cya
 nurate of ethyl, and it is thus seen that the latter passes through
 two intermediate stages before it is converted into ethylamine, the
 transformation         consisting  in the   successive     assimilation of three
 molecules      of  water, which determines     the gradual elimination       of the
 carbon of the cyanuric acid in the form of carbonic              acid :

     In  the transformation       of cyanuric acid into ammonia, obviously
the same succession         of  changes must be distinguished.           In fact the
intermediate products are well known, although they have not as yet
been obtained directly from cyanuric acid.               The first product is the
compound discovered            by Wiedemann      among the products of the

                                          .285
 action of heat upon urea (cyanuric acid), and described by him as
 biuret  ;  the second       is the guanidine     of M. Strecker.       A   glance at
their  formulae,

shows that these substances are similarly related to each other                as the
derivatives      of cyanuric      ether,  and appropriately      selected    methods
will not fail     to arrest the reaction at the intermediate stages.
    Even now       the cyanogen     group is particularly rich in examples          of
serial transformations, accomplished under the influence of success
ively assimilated water-molecules.              Liebig's    celebrated    researches
have shown that melamine before it is converted into cyanuric acid
undergoes a series of changes.             Fixing water and losing ammonia
in the   same proportion,         melamine is successively converted into am-
melide, ammeline, and cyanuric acid.               The latter, fixing water       and
losing carbonic acid        instead   of ammonia,     passes   through     the inter
mediate stages, which          I have endeavoured     to trace, and is ultimately
resolved into carbonic acid and ammonia.
   The equation
                   CaH6N6 + 611,0 = 6HaN                     +   3CGa

represents the final result of the decomposition of melamine under
the influence of the hydrated alkalies, but the water which figures in
this equation is fixed, molecule after molecule, and the ultimate pro
ducts are preceded by not less than five intermediate compounds, the
successive    formation and decomposition of which is illustrated by the
following    series   of symmetrical     equations  : —

         Sulphuretted Derivatives of Triethylphosphine.                                 By A. W.
         Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                        Received May 24, 1861.
   In the former Notes of my                   researches   on the phosphorus-bases,                  1
have repeatedly alluded to the beautiful red crystals,
                             C7 H,5     P SJ=(Ca Hs)a P, C           S^,
which are formed by the action of disulphide of carbon on triethyl
phosphine.            I   have   pointed out that the facility and rapidity with
which they are formed, render disulphide of carbon a most valuable
reagent        for the phosphorus-bases (triraethylphosphine                          exhibiting      a
perfectly similar deportment), since neither the monarsines                                nor the
monostibines are in any way affected by this substance.
   On the other hand, triethylphosphine                     may be employed with the
greatest advantage           as a test for disulphide           of carbon.            There    is,   in
fact, no test for this substance which in delicacy could be compared
with triethylphosphine.   By its aid the presence of the disulphide
in the most volatile fractions of coal-tar-benzol  readily proved          is                        ;
even the exceedingly small quantity                    of disulphide of carbon diffused

   In describing in         a    previous Note the formation and composition of
the disulphide-of-carbon-compound,                  I    have    already mentioned the
peculiar transformation which this substance                         suffers     under the in
fluence    of   water,     being converted under these circumstances into the
sulphide of triethylphosphine.
  1   have      of late minutely examined this remarkable reaction.
  The transformation              is   most conveniently studied                by   digesting the
disulphide-of-carbon-compound                   with water in sealed tubes.                   After
three or four days' exposure to 100°, the red crystals have disappeared,

compound         is   accompanied by several             other products, the nature of
which varies according to the duration of the reaction.                                In the first
stages    of   the process       considerable quantities of disulphide of carbon
are separated,        which in the latter stages may be traced in its products
of decomposition, carbonic acid                  and    sulphuretted         hydrogen.         The

mother-liquor of the sulphide of triethylphospine is distinctly alkaline,
and yields, after the necessary operations, on addition of dichloride of
platinum, the well-known octohedral platinum-salt of methyl-triethyl-
phosphonium.       On further evaporating the liquid from which these
crystals had been obtained, the six-sided tables of the platinum-salt
of oxide of triethylphosphine were deposited.
   The principal products of the action of water upon the red crystals,
then, are sulphide of triethylphosphine, oxide of triethylphosphine,
hydrate of methyl-triethylphosphonium,         and disulphide of carbon,
which may be partly or entirely converted into sulphuretted hydrogen
and carbonic acid.      Four   molecules    of the disulphide    of carbon-
compound, and two molecules of water, contain the elements of two
molecules of the sulphide, one molecule of the oxide, one molecule of
the hydrated phosphonium,        and three molecules of disulphide         of

   Whilst  engaged with the experiments involved in the elucidation        of
this subject, I observed  occasionally small well-defined yellow crystals
disseminated among the mixture of white and red needles, which
were deposited   when the digestion-tubes were allowed to cool before
the transformation was terminated.        The yellow crystals appeared in
greater quantity towards the close      of the operation, but were even
under the most favourable circumstances obtained only in extremely
minute quantity.
   These crystals are almost insoluble in ether, and may therefore be
readily separated from the sulphide of triethylphosphine         with which
they are contaminated.      Crystallization from boiling absolute alcohol
furnishes them in a state of perfect purity, occasioning, however, a
certain loss, which may become        very considerable   if   ebullition be
continued for some time.     This  substance   is decomposed at 100°, and
had therefore to be dried for analysis, in vacuo, over sulphuric acid.
   The yellow crystals   were found to contain
                               C8 H,7  P  S3.
   The formation of    a compound      of this formula by     the action   of
water upon the red crystals is easily understood,      if we   recollect the

separation,    during the principal phase of this process, of disulphide
of carbon, and therefore, in          consequence    of  a secondary reaction,       of
sulphuretted      hydrogen which,          more especially during         the latter
stages   of  the operation, is apt to accumulate to a very considerable
extent in the liquid.           Three molecules of the red disulphide-of-
carbon-compound, and one molecule of sulphuretted                   hydrogen con
tain the elements of one molecule           of disulphide of carbon, two         mole

           Red crystals.                    Sulphide.          Yellow crystals.
   That    the formation      of the yellow crystals       is actually due      to the
action of sulphuretted hydrogen is unequivocally proved by a syn
thetical experiment.         The red disulphide-of-carbon-compound, when
digested    at 100°     in sealed tubes with a saturated solution of sul
phuretted hydrogen, is rapidly converted into the yellow crystals.                    I
have   thus succeeded        in preparing       considerable quantities of this
substance,     of which,   as  long as   it was only obtained as a secondary,
I might almost say accidental, product of the reaction,                 I  had great
difficulty in procuring       a  sufficient quantity for analysis.
   The constitution of the yellow crystals, like that of the red                  com
pound from which they originate, is rather obscure.                  I have already
pointed out on a former occasion              that the red compound may be
viewed    as the primary triethylphosphonium-salt               of sulphocarbonic

    The view which   I am taking    of the constitution  of the yellow cry
stals is supported by a remarkable transformation which this substance
undergoes under the influence of boiling water.
    I have already mentioned that this compound cannot be recrystal-
lized from boiling alcohol without loss.        The   substance  is likewise
readily soluble in boiling water, but the solution contains no longer
the original   compound,      and   no crystals are deposited either on
cooling or on evaporation.       During ebullition the yellow compound
is entirely destroyed,  disulphide of carbon being abundantly evolved.
The residuary liquid exhibits a faintly alkaline reaction, and yields
with acids well crystallized saline compounds. The finest of these
salts is the iodide which,      being very soluble in boiling and only
sparingly soluble in cold water, may easily be obtained in long well-
formed needles of perfect purity.
    Analysis has proved this substance to contain
                C7H,8PSI = [(CH,S)(C,H,),F|I.
    This formula  represents   the iodide of a sulphomethyl-triethylphos-
phonium,    the derivation   of which from   the yellow compound may be
readily traced.    One molecule of the latter and one molecule      of water
contain the elements of one molecule of disulphide of carbon and one
molecule of hydrate of sulphomethyl-triethylphosphonium,

    I have not been able to eliminate the hydrate again from the iodide.
When treated with oxide of silver, this compound loses its iodine, but
not without its sulphur being likewise attacked, the last traces of
which are separated, however, only after protracted ebullition.         Con
siderable quantities  cf triethylphosphine   are evolved during ebullition,
and the liquid filtered off from the black precipitate, consisting of
sulphide and iodide of silver mixed with metallic silver, contains the
 hydrates of argento-triethylphosphonium        and methyl-triethylphos-
phonium, together with the sulphates of these bases.

       of Triethylphosphine          on   the  Substitution-compounds         of
        Marsh-Gas.       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                    Re
        ceived May 24, 1861.
    The formation of diatomic       bases by the action of triethylphosphine
dn dibromide      of ethylene,  very naturally suggested the idea of study
ing    the   deportment     of the phosphorus-base with the numerous
brominated derivatives of the ethylene-series discovered by Cahours,
and lately examined       again by    A. Lennox.     All  these compounds act
indeed with extraordinary energy upon triethylphosphine              j the pro
ducts, however, of these reactions are far from exhibiting, with regard
to the compounds from which they originate, the simplicity and inti
macy of relation which theoretical speculation, based on the obser
vation of the action of dibromide of ethylene, might lead us to expect.
Most of      the  brominated substitution-products       are apt to lose either
bromine or hydrobromic         acid, the bromides respectively     of triethyl
phosphine and of triethylphosphonium            being formed, together with
secondary phosphonium-compounds of subordinate theoretical interest
which    I have   not investigated in detail.
    It  still remained to study the deportment of the phosphorus-
bases    with chlorine- and bromine-compounds of simpler constitution.
 Hoping    to obtain more characteristic results in this direction,    I was led
to submit the compounds which are formed by the action of triethyl
phosphine on some of the substitution-products               of marsh-gas to   a
 more minute examination.
    The action of chlorine upon marsh-gas          has been the subject    of an
 important investigation by Regnault, who has shown that the gradual
 substitution of chlorine for hydrogen gives rise to the following series.
 Marsh-gas                                 CH4       Tetrahydride of Carbon.
 Monochlorinated       marsh-gas     ....   C H, CI Chloride of Methyl.
 Dichlorinated marsh-gas                    C Ha ClaDichloride of Methylene.
 Trichlorinated     marsh-gas               CH Cl3 Trichloride of Formyl.
 Tetrachlorinatcd     marsh-gas      ....   C    CI4 Tetrachloride  of Carbon.
     I was   anxious to ascertain whether these four chlorinated deriva
 tives, when submitted to the action         of triethylphosphine, would fix
 respectively    1, 2, 3 and 4   molecules of the phosphorus-base, giving

                                         291
 rise to the formation     of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-phosphonium-com-
 pounds, the composition of which was pointed out in advance by
 theory.
     Some   of the products which are         generated     by the action of the
 chlorinated substitutes of marsh-gas          are already known.           Chloride
 of methyl fixes one molecule of triethylphosphine, giving               rise to the
 chloride of methyl-triethylphosphonium,

years ago by Cahours and myself.
     The product which       is generated     by the action of chloroform on
 triethylphosphine    is likewise known.         I have   shown that chloroform
 is capable   of fixing three molecules of phosphorus-base, producing
 the trichloride of formyl-nonethyltriphosphonium,

A    short account of this substance has been already communicated to
the Royal Society*.
     It remained therefore only to examine the deportment of triethyl
phosphine      with the second,       and likewise with         the fourth    of the
chlorinated     substitution-products.         Dichloride      of methylene, the
product obtained by the action of chlorine on                 chloride of methyl,
acts with considerable energy on triethylphosphine.                   Digestion of
the mixture for a few hours at a temperature of              1 00° in sealed tubes,
suffices   to accomplish the reaction.        The products vary considerably,
according to the proportion           in which the two agents           are mixed.
One molecule       of dichloride of methylene and one molecule of tri
ethylphosphine give rise to the formation of the beautifully crystal

 I        have    not succeeded      in seizing     the dichloride in       a    state fit for
analysis, since this compound cannot be brought in contact with
water without          undergoing immediate decomposition;                      but   I    have
been able to trace the diatomic compound in its products                           of   decom
position.         The solution of the dichloride             is   not precipitated           by
dichloride of platinum, but, on evaporation, orange-yellow, well-deve
loped octohedra are deposited, which are the platinum-salts of methyl-
triethylphosphonium.              The mother-liquor of the octohedra furnishes
the six-sided tables         of the platinum-salt of triethylphosphine.
  The following equation represents the transformation of the di
chloride of the diphosphonium under the influence of water,
     It   is   thus seen that the diatomic compounds of the methylene-
series undergo, even in the form               of   salts and at the common tempe

   Di-iodide of methylene (obtained by the action of heat upon iodo
form) imitates in every respect the deportment of the chlorine-com

which      is    formed    by   the action    of bromine upon the di-iodide,               acts
in   a    perfectly different manner.        I      propose to examine this reaction
in   a    subsequent      communication.
     The action of tetrachloride of carbon,             C   Cl4, on triethylphosphine
gives rise to changes resembling in many respects the transformations
which     I    have described.       On submitting tetrachloride of carbon to
the action of triethylphosphine,   was surprised to find that the

                                        293
 most powerful agents, is attacked with tremendous energy.                 A drop
 of triethylphosphine     falling into tetrachloride of carhon hisses like
 water poured upon red-hot iron.          It  is necessary to operate in vessels
 filled with carbonic acid gas, to prevent the inflammation of the phos
 phorus-base, and to accomplish the mixing gradually by using a drop
 ping apparatus.      Or  the    force of the reaction may be diminished
 by employing the two liquids dissolved in anhydrous ether.                  Here
 also the relative proportions in which the two compounds are brought
 in contact,   influence in    a  measure    the result of the reaction     ;   the
 presence   of moisture likewise is apt to        change materially the nature
of   the transformation.
     Obtained in presenee or in absence of ether, the product of the re
action is   a white crystalline exceedingly deliquescent        substance.    Sub
mitted to the action of water, the crystals dissolve with powerful evo
lution of heat, giving rise to an intensely acid solution.             On adding
dichloride of platinum to this liquid,          a  crystalline precipitate, very
difficultly soluble in water, but soluble in boiling concentrated hydro
chloric acid, is thrown down, which, on analysis, was found to be the

The existence of the hydrogenated radicals (C H) and (C Ha CI) in
the solution of the products of the action of C Cl4 on (Ca H5)3 P,
unmistakeably shows that these substances              are only secondary      pro
ducts,    which owe     their origin    to the action of water           upon the

     compounds formed directly by the union of triethylphosphine                                         with
     tetrachloride of carbon.                The chemical action of the water is proved,
     moreover,        by the disengagement                of heat to which        I     have   alluded,
     and by the existence             of    a large quantity     of   free hydrochloric             acid in
     solution.
        I have       not succeeded in obtaining the direct product of the action
     of tetrachloride of carbon                   on triethylphosphine        in a state fit for
     analysis    ;   the extraordinary deliquescence of the product, and the im
     possibility of touching it with a solvent without decomposing                              it,   have
     frustrated my efforts.                But    here again, exactly as in the              case    of the
     diphosphonium-compound,                      the study of the products of decomposi

        The experiments           described           in this Note, together with those which
    I   have communicated to the Royal Society on                      a   former occasion, prove
     that the         number of molecules of triethylphosphine                          which, under

                                        295
favourable circumstances, can be fixed by the chlorinated derivatives
of marsh-gas, is determined by the number of chlorine-equivalents
which these substances        contain.     These bodies need not, however,
assimilate the maximum quantities of triethylphosphine                  represented
by these numbers.        Thus dicbloride of methylene is capable of fixing
either one   or two molecules of phosphorus-base, the formation of the
ephemeral diatomic base being invariably               preceded    by that of the
more stable chloromethylated monophosphonium-compound.                       Similar
phenomena are observed        in the action of chloroform and tetrachloride
of carbon.     The compounds which           I have  described   as  resulting from
these reactions, are not the only products           ;  by changing the relative
proportions of the agents, a number of chlorinated phosphonium-bases
are formed so much resembling each other, that                   I  have failed in
 separating them.      Nevertheless, by determining the amount of chlo
 rine and platinum in the mixed platinum-salts               obtained from these
 mixtures,  I  had no difficulty in recognizing the principle involved in
 their formation.     These substances stand to the final products of the
 reaction of the triphosphonium        and tetraphosphonium-series in rela
 tions similar to those which obtain between               the chloromethylated
 monophosphonium and the ephemeral diphosphonium-compound.
     The results of  these inquiries may be- condensed          in a few formulae.
     The chlorinated   derivatives   of marsh-gas exhibit, in their deport
 ment with the phosphorus-bases, the characters of hydrochloric acid.
 The monochlorinated        product has the saturating capacity of one
 molecule   of hydrochloric    acid, the dichlorinated product        of one or two
 molecules,   the trichlorinated of     1, 2   or 3 molecules,     the tetrachlori-
  nated product, lastly,   of  1, 2, 3  or 4 molecules:

I. " On      the  Lunar Semidiurnal Variation of the Barometer."
       By John Allan Broun, Esq., F.R.S., Director of the Tre-
       vandrum Observatory.           Received     May 30, 1861.
    The results obtained hitherto for         the lunar diurnal variation     of
atmospheric pressure have been received with some doubt              ; the range
of the variation has been found to be small, and the proximity to the
sea   of the stations for which the discussions          have been made, has
given some value to the idea that the variation is due simply to the
tidal rise and fall of the sea, the base of the atmosphere.               It has
even been suggested       that the barometer should be incapable of show
ing an atmospheric tide, because the gravity of the mercury is dimi
nished by the lunar attraction, as well         as  that of the atmosphere      ;
this suggestion, however, omits all consideration of the integrating
means by which a tide is formed.
    I  have   considered the question at two stations in the following
manner.       Simultaneous observations of two standard barometers of
the same construction, with boiled tubes 0*65 inch internal diameter,
were made hourly during fifteen months            (April  1857 to   June 1858)
at two observatories       ; one  at Trevandrum       200 feet above    the sea-
level and three miles distant from the sea, the other on the summit
of the Agustier peak of       the South  Indian Ghats, 6200      feet above the
sea, about 22 miles from Trevandrum,            25 miles from the sea on the
west, and 40 to 60 miles from the         sea on   the south and east.       The
means of all the observations give the following results.
    At    Trevandrum.    — The lunar diurnal variation of atmospheric
pressure has two nearly equal maxima, occurring almost exactly at
the moon's passages of the upper and lower meridian, the minima
occurring six hours before and after these epochs.
    At   Agustier (6200 feet). — The law is nearly the same as to epochs,
the maximum for the inferior passage occurring, however, about one
hour later,    and each minimum        occurring about one hour nearer the
upper passage.
    The chief    difference  in the two results is that between the relative
values    of the maxima and minima.          The oscillation occurring while
 the moon is below the       horizon, or between the meridians of 6h and
 of  18h, has  the same amount at Trevandrum             (height 200 feet) and
 at Agustier (height 6200 feet)       ; but the oscillation     occurring while

                                       298
the moon is above the horizon, has twice the amount at the           lower
station which it has at the upper station.
   This curious result, which it is difficult to explain by any theory
depending simply on the attraction of gravitation, whether acting on
the sea or the atmosphere, agrees remarkably with the conclusions
for the solar diurnal       oscillation  obtained from the discussion    of
hourly observations       made    simultaneously   during a month at five
different stations, four of these       being on the Agustier   mountains,
rising gradually from 1200 to 6200 feet, the fifth station being at
Trevandrum.         From   these   observations (an abstract of which will
be found noticed in the Report of the British Association for 1859,
Trans. of Sect., p. 46), it appeared that the solar semidiurnal oscilla
tion between      9  p.m.  and   9   a.m. was nearly the same at all the
stations;  while the day oscillation,       9  a.m. to 9 p.m., diminished
with the height, being at 6200 feet little more than half the amount
of  the oscillation at 200 feet.
    These facts might be put into the following general form      : —When
the heavenly body (sun or moon) is below the horizon, the semidiurnal
oscillation of the barometer within the tropics has the same value at
all heights up to 6200 feet      ;  but when the body is above the horizon,
the oscillation at 6200 feet has only half the amount of the oscillation
at the level   of the sea.

       Variation      of  Magnetic      Declination   near the   Magnetic

    The discovery by Dr. Lamont of a "decennial" period in the
range of the solar diurnal variation of magnetic declination, naturally
leads to the question whether a similar law may not exist for the
lunar diurnal variation     ; the question is also of importance in con
nexion with the theory of the cause of these variations.       The follow
ing results for the range of the lunar diurnal variation were obtained
from the discussion whose conclusions were given in the Proceedings
of  the Royal Society, vol. x. p. 475.

   It  appears from these values that, the range                  of the lunar diurnal
period varies from year to year according to the same law (nearly)                      as
the range of the solar diurnal period               ; and we may conclude that the
range    of lunar diurnal variation         obeys the
                                                           " decennial" law.
   It  is well known that the declination needle obeys two diurnal laws
due to the solar action ; the first             of  these governs the movement          of
the north end of the needle from east to west and from west to east,
the second      determines a superposed               movement resulting from the
relative   amounts of displacement of the needle from its normal posi
tion at each hour       ;   the latter is usually termed the diurnal                law of
disturbance.      In order to obtain this law and                the values   of  the dis
turbance, the quantities           d0,  dv d%   ....   (Proceedings, vol. x. p. 477)
are summed for each hour and the means are taken.                          No similar in
vestigation, as far       as  I  am aware, has as yet been undertaken for the
lunar diurnal variation.
    I have now arrived at the following conclusions in the discussion
for this object of six years' observations of magnetic declination made
at the Trevandrum           Observatory.

 were taken    ;   these differences,   as  in the case of the similar investiga
 tion for the solar laws, represent the disturbance at each hour-angle
 of  the moon    ;   and when the means      of the second differences are taken,
 the law of the lunar diurnal disturbance will be obtained,           if any  such
 law exist.
    The small      range   of the regular lunar diurnal variation, and the de
rangement produced by the larger disturbances, the effects of which
cannot be eliminated in short series of observations, would render
identical results from different groups of years improbable, especially
if the   range    of  the variation to be determined be small.        The follow
ing conclusions, however, seem sufficiently confirmed by the discus
sion   of different groups of observations to be accepted.
    There is a lunar-diurnal law of disturbance which, from the             mean
of six years' observation, consists of a
    Principal maximum           5 hours before      the moon passes the upper
meridian.
    Principal minimum         near the moon's passage     of the lower meridian.
    Secondary maximum           6 hours after the passage of the upper meri
dian.
    Secondary minimum           1 hour after the passage of the upper meri

    When the results for        each year are compared, the principal maxi
mum and minimum are always shown distinctly; but the values and
epochs of the secondary           maximum and minimum vary, and that so
irregularly, that in the mean for the three years 1857-59 the exist
ence   of either    is doubtful, only the principal maximum and minimum
being well-marked.
    In order to determine if      the law varied with season, means     of groups
for quarters of       the year were obtained      ; means also for the groups of
half-years, October to March and April to September,              were taken.   As
the results for the quarters forming each half-year agreed with each
other, and that for the half-year which contained them, the following
conclusions may be accepted          as  probably true.

                                      301
                      Half-year October        to  March.
   Principal maximum,       5$ hours before        the moon's passage           of the
upper meridian.
   Principal minimum,      3 hours before the moon's passage           of  the lower
meridian.
   Secondary maximum,         5| hours after the moon's          passage        of the
upper meridian.
   Secondary minimum,       1  hour after the moon's passage of the upper
meridian.
                     Half-year April       to September.
Maximum, 4^ hours before the moon's passageof the upper meridian.
Minimum, at the passage of the lower meridian.
   In  the case of the half-year including        the  June  solstice, the secon
dary points disappear    ;  this also is the case for each of the quarters
forming the half-year.       It may be due to this and the preponderance
of the disturbance in    one    half of any given year, that         the mean for
the whole year shows distinctly or indistinctly          the secondary points          :
the question, however,    of the secondary points will       be considered here
after in another discussion including       a  longer series of observations.

that the mean lunar disturbance obeys the same law            as the mean    solar
disturbance, and that the former is probably dependent upon the
latter.
III. " Experimental         Researches on the Functions of the Vagus
       and the Cervical Sympathetic         Nerves in    Man."      By Augus
       tus Waller, M.D., F.R.S.               Received     June 6, 1861.
   The offices of      these   two nerves    in the animal economy         are   of
such importance as to render it a matter of practical                interest to
the physician,     as well as to the physiologist, to obtain        as  clear   an
insight as possible into their functions.         It  would be impossible to
point out any nerves presenting so many questions of daily importance
to the practitioner      as these,   which govern the innervation of the
stomach, the heart, the lungs, and the liver.
    Hitherto   we have been restricted to their investigation in the lower
animals, and from the results which have been thus furnished, we
have judged     of what obtains in man.         It  is almost* needless for me
to point out that, although such inferences           are generally correct as
regards    the motor phenomena of life, our evidence             respecting the
sensory    functions of the nerves       is necessarily more uncertain and
inconclusive.
    My object    at present   is to describe some results obtained by irri
tating the vagus and cervical sympathetic in man, in such a way                  as
to ascertain   their functions, not only in a state of health, but also
their condition in disease,      and in various functional derangements          to
which they are subject.
   The    means   which    I adopt for this purpose are the same          as  that
which    I  have used in the case     of  the ulnar nerve and     of the retina,
t. e. mechanical irritation      by simple pressure       on the trunk     of  the
nerve.     I generally apply pressure of the fingers at the highest point
of the  neck behind the ramus       of the lower jaw.       A moderate amount
of  pressure  applied in this manner is usually sufficient, in the course
of  about a minute, to produce symptoms which are at once easily re
cognized as originating from the irritation      of the  vagus and the sympa
thetic nerve.

                                             303
     Generally the first sensation experienced              is that of want of breath,
 which is followed by deep and laboured inspirations                     :  this dyspnoea
occurs      in healthy persons in about a minute or two.                     While    these
symptoms are occurring, we observe                a  considerable disturbance of the
heart's action.         At first there     is increase in the number          of its pulsa
tions, with decreased power, as may be easily ascertained                    by the pulse.
To this      supervenes    a retardation of the heart's action of about              4 to 5
beats a minute         of its initial number,         at the same time there being
decrease      of  the force   of the pulse.         These motory affections of the
heart are frequently accompanied by slight uneasiness                       over the pre
cordial region.
    At the next        stage the heart's action may              become     so much en
feebled as to produce syncope.
    The stomach symptoms which                  are produced by irritation           of the
vagus are marked by uneasiness               over the stomach,        in some cases in
creasing      so as to cause a sensation        of  nausea.
    I  have not hitherto observed any motor effects on the stomach, but
in the intestines borborygmi occur,                as after   irritation    of  the vagus
on animals.          I  am unable at present          to state whether any glycose
urine is produced.
    On the ear corresponding to the side compressed                     are felt tingling
and heat, which often last upwards               of half  an hour after the removal
of pressure.
    In only      one instance have       I  been able to detect any influence on
the pupil.        It  at first became       dilated, and subsequently contracted
after the pressure        was removed.
    All   the above symptoms quickly disappear after the removal                     of the
irritating cause, leaving, however, a degree of lassitude, fatigue, and
lowness      of spirits, which    may last for some hours.
    It  is easily ascertained      that the symptoms above described                are not
owing to compression of the carotid artery,                 as  they may be produced
without obliterating the calibre of the artery            ;  or, vice versd, the course
of  the blood may be completely interrupted in the artery without pro
ducing any of the symptoms enumerated.
   On another opportunity             I intend to show the applications which
this mode of investigating the condition of the vagus presents in a
practical point of view,           for the diagnosis of various functional de
rangements        or diseases   of  the vagus.

him in 1850, and of his transformed form (say 1la=0) obtained in
1856.   The method in the memoir itself (Mr. Salmon's method)

paragraph, and it is here reproduced                 ; and  I  reproduce also Hesse's
demonstration of the equivalence               of  the two forms      n,=0and na=0.
 V. "Notes on the Atmospheric Lines of the Solar Spectrum,
        and on certain Spectra of Gases."                       By Dr. John Hall
        Gladstone, F.R.S. Received May 30, 1861.
    In  the paper       of Sir David Brewster and myself ou               the Knes  of the
 solar spectrum *, attention was drawn to the following                      among other
 phenomena        : —
    1st.    "  When      the sun descends          towards the horizon and shines
 through      a rapidly increasing depth of air, certain lines which before
 were little     if at all visible, became       black and well defined,        and dark
 bands appear even in what were formerly the most luminous parts                         of
 spectrum."          These we termed          " atmospheric lines."           We did not
 wish to express by that term anything beyond the fact above men
 tioned   ;  yet we threw out the idea that these lines may have their
 origin
          " in   the air that encircles       our globe."
    2nd.    In  the case     of those artificial  flames whose spectra
                                                                             " consist of a
 series  of luminous bands         separated by dark spaces .         . . these luminous
 bands sometimes           coincide with the dark lines of the solar spectrum."
    About the same time Kirchhoff                 f   published his theory that this
 remarkable coincidence is due to the presence in the atmosphere of
                         * Philosophical  Transactions,   1860, p. 149.

the sun       of    the    substances        which emit these luminous bands,                            and
their appearance               as    dark lines is because                  "the spectrum of                 an
incandescent         gas becomes            reversed,        when    a source        of light of suffi
cient intensity, giving a continuous spectrum, is placed behind the
luminous gas."              It      also appears         that     " sodium vapour          at a tempe
rature much below that at which it becomes                                    luminous, exerts               its
absorptive power at exactly the same point of the spectrum                                              as    it
does at the highest temperatures which we can produce."                                     It    is,   how
ever, as yet an undetermined                      question at what temperature below
that at which         it   becomes       luminous,           a   gas ceases to absorb       ;     though,
from the close connexion which has been shown to exist between
emission      and absorption, there can be                        little doubt that such          a     limit
would be arrived at.
     This theory of             the origin       of Fraunhofer's             lines, and the uncer
tainty just alluded to, suggested                      the desirableness             of comparing        the
" atmospheric lines " of absorption with the luminous                                      bauds which
make their appearance                 in the linear spectra of the light emitted                             by
the different constituents              of   the atmosphere when sufficiently heated.
If    all the rays emitted                  by   these       different constituents should be
found to coincide with the "atmospheric                                   lines,"   it   would show at
once the origin            of    the lines, and          prove       that gases at the ordinary
temperature will absorb rays of the same refrangibility                                   as those      they
emit when themselves glowing.                          If,   on the contrary, they should be
found not to coincide,                 it   would prove              by   an extreme       case   (for       we
operate' thus upon many milesof oxygen and nitrogen gases at least)
that this connexion between absorption and emission either does not
extend      to these elements,              or   is   confined within those narrower limits
of temperature which theory                      seems to require.              It   was also conceiv
able that the atmospheric lines might coincide with the rays emitted,
not    by   all, but      bya       portion of the constituents of the atmosphere.

other compounds are decomposed                ;  but it occurred to me that the
oxyhydrogen flame must consist partly,                 if not entirely, of glowing
steam, since      it is only when      the two elements      combine that the heat
is evolved    ;  and that similarly the flame        of carbonic oxide burning in
air must contain the light emitted from glowing carbonic acid.                        I
therefore subjected these two flames to prismatic examination.
   The result of      the comparison has been that not one             of these obser
vations shows any accordance              between     the luminous      bands due to
the gas, and the dark lines that make their appearance                    in the solar
spectrum when the sun is shining through                     a  great depth of air.
Hydrogen        alone   is inconclusive.       Neither    is there any accordance
between     these luminous bands and the more               prominent lines of the
ordinary solar spectrum.
   This shows that oxygen             and   nitrogen, and perhaps other gases,
though in enormous quantity, do not absorb at the ordinary tempe
rature rays of the same refrangibility            as those   they emit when heated
by the means specified.
   It  would not be legitimate to infer from this that the atmospheric
lines have not their origin in the absorbent power of one or more of
the common constituents            of  the atmosphere.        It is well known that
some gases when placed             before a continuous spectrum produce lines
of absorption      ; among these are bromine and iodine vapour               ; yet the
dark lines caused by these two halogens * do not coincide with the
bright lines into which Pliicker found the light of Geissler's tubes
containing bromine and iodine to be resolved                    by the prism     ; nor
have   I succeeded     in reversing them by bringing these substances into
a very    hot but little luminous flame.             Bright lines    were discerned,
but in other positions.            In connexion with this subject, it          may be
worth noting that         a  prismatic examination of the sun's rays passing
through      three   inches of mercury vapour at above 300°               C,   did not
afford the least indication of the reversal               of the bright rays that
appear when that metal is rendered              incandescent.

band S has been observed        during    a shower,        and the most prominent
lines during a fog, it has been sometimes supposed                     that the aqueous
vapour in the atmosphere is the cause of them.                              Yet this     can
scarcely be.    They     seem not to be due to little vesicles               of  condensed
vapour; for the sun's rays when passing through the edges of a cloud
do not exhibit them, unless, of course, near the horizon.                         And they
seem not to be due to gaseous           water     ;  for they appear near sunset
when the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is reduced to a minimum
by frosty weather, though they are not seen when the sun is higher
up in the heavens on      a damp   warm day.            From Sir David Brewster's
notes, it appears that February      1 0, 1 1 , 1 2,  and    13 of the year 1 838 were
frosty days   ; yet the lines were well seen              :  5, i, ij, C 6, C 15, C 16,
and D are specially mentioned.           On the       1 3th,  when the thermometer
stood at 23° F.,   t  is said to have been the most prominent.
   In  the paper     referred to at the commencement,                    we,   in  common
with most of those who worked on the subject before the appearance
of Kirchhoff    and Bunsen's      paper*, ascribed a bright line coincident
with D to other spectra       than that of soda.            This was no doubt owing
to the almost universal trace of that substance.
   The electric lights produced       between charcoal points by Professor
Holmes's     magneto-apparatus,         and      by a        galvanic        battery with
If.  Serin's lamp, were found to be identical, when subjected to pris
matic analysis. Each exhibited a continuous spectrum, and not
those variations   of bright    and dark which other observers,                  as  well as
myself, have    noticed in electric lights from charcoal points of but
inferior quality.    The spectrum      extended at both ends beyond that                  of
ordinary direct sunlight, and the only lines which                I could     discern were
bright ones in the violet or lavender region.                The following refractive
indices were determined       for the magneto-electric light              ;  and they are
compared with the refractive indices of the nearest principal                          dark
lines of the solar spectrum as determined with the same prism.                         The
relative position of these bright rays and the dark lines in the laven
der part of the spectrum, which are only visible in the sun's light
under the most favourable circumstances, must not be relied on as
accurate,  since it was determined by measurement,                    and not by direct
comparison.      Possible    inaccuracy      of adjustment will render the

            Winter."           By   J.    J.    Murphy, Esq.                Communicated by

      It   might be expected that the climate of the Arctic Regions during
winter, in the absence of the sun, must be almost                                   a   dead level       of
intense cold         ;   but so far       is   this from being the case, that there                 is   no
other place           and time where such great                  and    rapid       fluctuations of
temperature have been observed.
  This phenomenon       thus mentioned in the appendix to Wrangell's
                                    is
account of his expedition to the Siberian coasts of the Polar Sea —                                 :

causes the temperature to rise suddenly from —24° to                                 +   25°, or even
-4-32°: previously to this, the barometer sinks as much as four-
tenths of an inch in the course of eight hours.                             The S.S.E. wind          has

depth of winter, when all nature has long been frozen, and the sound
of falling    water   has long been forgotten,           rain will fall in torrents     ;
and as rain in such a climate is attended with every discomfort, this
is looked upon       as   a most unwelcome phenomenon.                 It is called the
warm south-east wind.             Now,   if the Greenlanders        at Upernavik     are
astonished at a warm south-east wind, how much rather must the
seamen, frozen up in the           pack, be astonished at a warm north-west
wind   !   Various theories have been started to account for this phe
nomenon     ;  butit appears most probable that a rotatory gale passes over
the place, and that the rise of temperature is due to the direction from
which the whole mass of air may come, viz. from the southward,
and not to the direction of the wind at the time*."
    The  cause here assigned         appears to me quite insufficient : the rise
of the thermometer that           we have to account for sometimes             amounts
to 70° or 80°, which is equal           to the difference       between     very warm
summer weather and very hard frost in our climate                   ; and   it is unex
ampled, and       I think inconceivable, that any motion of              a mass   of air
from warmer latitudes should produce                so great an effect on the tem
perature   ;   certainly the cyclones that come from the West Indian
Seas and pass over our islands have no effect in the slightest degree
approaching to it.
    What     I  regard   as the   true cause of the phenomenon is suggested,
though not distinctly          pointed out, in Dr. Kane's            Narrative,    from
which    I will make a few extracts : —
    " January     29.   A dark water sky      extended in a wedge from        Littleton
 to a point north    of  the Cape.      Everywhere else the firmament was ob
 scured by mist.       The height of     the barometer continued as we left it at
the brig, and our own sensations of warmth convinced us that we were
 about to have a snow-storm. * * * We were barely housed before
 the storm broke upon             us.   Here,     completely excluded from the
 knowledge of things without, we passed many miserable hours.
 We could keep no note of time, and, except by the whirring of the drift
 against the     roof of our kennel, had no information of the state of the
 weather.     * * * We then turned in to sleep again, no longer heedful
 of  the  storm, for it had buried us deep in with the snow.                     But in
 the meantime, although the storm continued, the temperatures under
 went an extraordinary change.              I was awakened        by the dropping of
    * The writer in the  '                    '
                           Cornhilt Magazine    prints this second paragraph in inverted
 commas, but does not state whence he has quoted it.

                                         311
water from the roof above me          ;   and upon turning     back my sleeping
bag, found    it saturated by the melting of its previously               condensed
hoar-frost.     My eider-down      was like a wet swab.       I afterwards     found
that the phenomenon of the warm south-east had come unexpectedly
upon us.     The thermometers       at the brig indicated + 26°, and, closer
as we were to the water,      the weather was probably above the freezing-
point.    *When we left the brig — how long before            it was we did       not
know— the temperature was —44°.                  It had risen at least seventy
degrees.
           *   *  *   In the morning — that is to say, when the combined
light of  the noon-day dawn and the circumpolar moon permitted our
escape — I   found, by comparing the time as indicated by the Great
Bear with the increased altitude of the moon, that we had been pent
up nearly two days."
   It  appears   from these extracts, that although            Dr. Kane did not
see open water,     he was made      aware     of its neighbourhood by the in
fallible sign of a       " Water Sky."       A rise of temperature to a few
degrees above frost would be quite insufficient to produce open water
by melting through the fields of ice in forty-eight hours            ;  but, on the
other hand, the breaking up of the fields of ice by                a   storm is an
adequate cause for a great rise         of temperature ; for the water imme
diately below the ice is at     the temperature of sea-water at its freezing-
point, which is +28°; so that when a storm comes and breaks up
the ice, the water comes into contact with air 70° or 80° colder, and
warms the air.
   There is no doubt of the power of a storm to break up the ice.
Sir James Ross       speaks   of " the almost magical power of the sea in
breaking up land-ice or extensive floes of from twenty to thirty feet
thick, which have, in a few minutes after the swell reached                    them,
been broken up into small fragments by the power                 of the waves."
The theory that     these sudden rises     of temperature   are caused by storms
breaking up the ice and exposing the comparatively warm water below,
also harmonizes with the fact that the warm winds, as mentioned by
                       ' Fox,' in different parts of Baffin's Bay
the officer  of the                                                      come from
different points of the compass         ;  while on the same coast they come
from the same point.         Thus Wrangell,      as quoted above, mentions that
in the part of the Siberian coast which he explored, a S.E. by E.
wind sometimes raises the thermometer upwards of fifty degrees, while
a  S.S.E. wind    has no effect on the temperature at all.             This   proves
that the rise of temperature cannot be due to the transport of a mass

                                             312
 of  warm air ; but        it may   be easily accounted    for by supposing that
 the form     of   the coast enables the warmth-producing           wind to act at
 a special     advantage        in breaking up or driving away         the ice, and
 liberating the heat of the waters.
     These extraordinary fluctuations of temperature appear to be com
 mon to the whole of the Arctic regions.                  Sir John Richardson, in
 his recent work on the Polar regions, states that             " in Arctic America
 the phenomenon of warm winds (teplot                   weter of Wrangell)        also
 occurs, and makes the month in which they happen, whether Decem
ber,    January, or February, warmer than the other two. The same
warm wind was probably the cause of the rain which the Russian
sailors observed in Spitzbergen in the month of January."
    Rain implies       a temperature several degrees above         + 28°, which      is
the temperature of the stratum of sea-water                immediately below the
ice.     But   we know that in the         Polar regions the temperature of the
sea increases       in descending,    until a stratum is reached of the invariable
temperature of +39°; and we may suppose that in these storms the
warmer water of the deeper               strata is brought to the surface,        and
warms the air sufficiently to admit of rain.              We know that powerful
winds are able to produce temporary local currents, and it is easy to
see   that such a current, when produced in           a  limited space free of ice,
will give rise to this kind of vertical circulation,            or interchange be
tween strata        of different depths.
    Such storms        as these   must be eminently favourable to the produc
tion of rain     ;   for the air that becomes warmed by contact with the
comparatively warm water will, of course,               take up watery vapour,
and when it comes into contact with other masses                 of air that retain
their usual intense           cold, the vapour will be rapidly condensed        ;  so
that we cannot wonder at heavy rains being a general concomitant of
these storms.
    Wrangell, in the passages           I have   quoted, says the warm wind in
Siberia is preceded          by a fall of the barometer.         Dr. Kane,    on the
contrary, noticed        a  rise before the storm above described      ; it stood at
"the extraordinary height of 30*85."                I cannot suggest any expla
nation of these facts.
    I  believe  I    have now stated the true cause        of what is certainly      a
very remarkable phenomenon — fluctuations of temperature of enor
mous magnitude, occurring             in a very short time, and in the absence
of the sun.

               fessor    W. Thomson, F.R.S.                         Received           June 6, 1861.
         Part       I. New          Electrodynamic           Balance      for        resistances    of short
                                                     bars or wires.
       In measuring                 the resistances         of short lengths of wire by Wheat-
 stone's           Balance *,        I   have often experienced considerable difficulty in
consequence               of   the resistances         presented        by the contacts between the
ends          of   the several connected               branches or arcs.                This difficulty may
generally be overcome                          by soldering or amalgamating the contacts,
when allowable                  ;    but even with soldered                   connexions there is some
uncertainty relating to the dimensions of the solder itself, when the
wires tested are very short.                           When soldering                 was not admissible,          I
have avoided being led into error, by repeating the experiment several
times            with slightly           varied connexions          ;   but      I    have in consequence
sometimes               altogether failed to obtain results by either Wheatstone's
or any other method hitherto practised, as for instance in attempting
to measure the electric resistances of a number of metallic bars each
6 millimetres long and                        1   millim. square section, which were put into
my hands by Mr. Calvert of Manchester, being those of which he
and Mr. Johnstone determined the relative thermal conductivities in
their investigation published in the Transactions of the Royal Society
for March               1858.        I   have thus been compelled to plan a new method
for measuring electric resistances                             in which no sensible                    error    can
be produced by uncertainty                           of the connexions,                even    though      made
with no extraordinary care.
  Let AB and CD be the standard and the                                       tested conductors respect
ively.             Let the actual standard of                 resistance         be the resistance         of   the
portion of             AB   between marks             f   S, S' on      it,   and let    it    be required to
find         a   portion       TT' of CD which                has   a    resistance        either equal,          or
bearing            a   stated ratio, to that standard.
      Join BC either                     by   direct metallic contact between                      them, or by

any ordinarily good metallic connexion with binding screws or other
wise    ;    andjoin the two electrodes of a galvanic element to their other
ends,        A, D. Let GPH and KQL be two auxiliary conductors,
which, to avoid circumlocutions,                         I   shall call the primary and the
secondary           testing-conductors respectively, with their ends applied to
the marked points S,               T',   S',   T. Let P and Q be points in these
conductors to which the                  electrodes of the galvanometer are to be
applied.
   It       is easily seen, and will be demonstrated below, that                        if   the re
sistances           of the testing-conductors                be similarly divided in    Q and P,
and     if        their ends be in perfect conducting communication with the
marked points of the main line to which they are applied, the con
dition that the galvanometer indication may be zero is that the ratio
of the        resistances   of   the standard and tested conductors must be the
same as that            in which the auxiliary conductors                      are each divided.
Further, it is clear that by making the testing-conductors of incom
parably greater resistances than any that can exist in the connexions
at S, S',           T, T', which    can easily be done                if   these   connexions are
moderately good, the error arising from such imperfections as they
must present             may be made                as   small   as   is required *.     To de-
  * This method may be readily applied to Siemens's mercury standards (sec
                                      '
PhiL Mag. Jan. 1861, or Poggendorfi's Annalen,' 1860, No. 5), by introducing
platinum wires through holes in the glass tube near its ends, as electrodes for
the testing-conductors, and wires or plates of platinum at the ends, as electrodes
for one pole of the battery and for connexion with the conductor to be compared
with        it,
         respectively.  It will then not be the whole line of mercury from end
to end, but the portion of between the two platinum wires first mentioned, that
                                   it
will be the actual standard.     The objection against the use of mercury as a
standard of resistance, urged by Matthiessen, that the amalgamated       copper

 monstrate the above and to form an accurate idea of the operation of
 this method, it is necessary to investigate the difference of potentials
 (electromotive force) produced between Q and P, when a stated dif
 ference         of potentials, E, is maintained              between S and           T'.
    Let SS',            TP     denote     the resistances         between      the marks, on the
 standard and tested conductors respectively.                             Let GPH, GP, PH,

    When high accuracy is not required, the two " testing-conductors"
 may be made of wires stretched straight in parallel lines, and the
connexions for the galvanometer electrodes may be applied to them
by means of a slide on a graduated scale — as in one of the common
 forms of Wheatstone's balance, with sliding contact on single test
 ing-conductor.         This form       is very objectionable, however,           whether
 for Wheatstone's balance or the method                  I  now propose    :

 friction of the sliding contact which it experiences                      in use*     ;  (4) be
 cause,    in even       the      hastiest experiments,           provided        a   rationally
 planned galvanometer is used, a far higher proportional                              degree     of
 accuracy is easily attained in measuring electrical resistances against
 a standard       of   resistance      than can be at all attained,               without very
extraordinary         precautions and            the assistance     of   a microscope,           in
measuring        lengths       under      a   yard or two against a standard                     of
 length.
     When     the    highest accuracy is required,              I always use for         primary
 testing-conductor         the bisected         conductor     which I described            to the
 British Association           at its Glasgow meeting in 1855.                  This     consists
 of  a fine,  very perfectly insulated wire, doubled on itself and wound
on    a  bobbin, with very stout terminals soldered                    to its ends, and an
electrode soldered to its middle, for joining to the galvanometer elec
trode.      The two terminal              and    the middle electrodes          thus attached
to the testing-conductor,               I   have    generally hitherto        made       flexible,
either of thick wire, or strand of wires like the conductor of a sub
marine cable        ;   but, for many applications,               it is more         convenient
 to make      them solid metal blocks, with binding screws,                            insulated
rigidly upon         the    bobbin which            bears   the   conductor.          The two
halves into which the conductor is doubled must be very accurately
equalized      as to   electric resistance when they are wound on the bobbin,
and before the terminals are finally attached.                         This     I  find can be
done with great accuracy             ;  and when, after the terminals are soldered
on, the electric bisection is once found perfect, it seems to remain so,
without sensible         change,      for years.        The   close juxtaposition          of  the
two branches of the testing-conductor on this plan ensures an almost
absolute equality of temperature between them in all circumstances,
    * This   defect   I have     remedied      by frequently putting in a new wire for
testing-conductor in working         with    a  shding-scale Wheatstone's balance.

                                          320
and thus renders easy a degree of accuracy in the measurement                           of
resistances       quite unattainable with any other form of Wheatstone's
balance.         In the   new method which        I  now propose for low resist
ances,     I   make    the secondary conductor on exactly the same plan,
and generally of about the same dimensions,                  as the     primary.      The
bisected       testing-conductors     are only available when the resistances
of  the standard and        of the  tested conductor can be made equal ; and
with them the method which has been described above seems to be
the most accurate possible for testing            a  perfect equality of resistance
between two conductors.
    The      same    plan of testing-conductors         seems     still  the best,   even
when testing by equality cannot be             practised, — with only this differ
ence, that the two branches              of  each   testing-conductor, instead          of
being made of equal resistance,              must be adjusted to bear to one
another very exactly the ratio which the tested resistance is to bear
to the standard.           By proper     care, to prevent the         bobbin of either
testing-conductor from getting any non-uuiform                    distribution of tem
perature, great accuracy may still              be secured      ;  but it is scarcely
possible to maintain          so very close      an   agreement        of temperature,
and     therefore so constant a ratio of resistances,                as when the two
 branches are equal lengths of one wire coiled side by side.
    The     use   of this plan of conductors divided in        a  fixed ratio, whether
 for the single testing-conductor in Wheatstone's balance, or for the
primary and secondary            testing-conductors in the new method now
proposed, requires that either the standard or the tested conductor
can be varied so as to adjust the resistance              of  one to bear        precisely
 that ratio to the resistance of the other.               In certain      cases this may
 be done        advantageously by shifting         one or other         of  the   contacts
 S, S', T, T' along the standard or the tested conductor, as the case may
 be.     If, for instance, T or T' can be shifted conveniently, the object
 of the    measurement       may be to find by trial on the tested             conductor
 a portion TT' from mark            to mark, of which the resistance               bears a
 stated     ratio to the fixed standard SS' from mark to mark.                     But by
 far the easiest working, and in most cases the most accurate also, is
 to be done by means of a well-arranged                   series   of standards with
 terminals adapted for combining them in such a manner                       as to give to
 a minute degree          of accuracy whatever        resistance     may be required.
 In   a   future communication on standards of electric resistance,                       I

                                               321
intend to describe           plans for attaining this object through                   a wide
range      of magnitude (resistances from 105 to 10,a British                         absolute
 units of feet per second on Weber's iuvaluable system).                                In the
mean       time    I   shall merely say that           I  have      formed a plan which         I
 expect      will prove very       advantageous         for low resistances,       and which
 consists     in combining the standards, whichever of them are required,
 in multiple       arc  (or "parallel"       arcs, according to an expression             some
 times used),        so as   to add their conducting powers*, — instead of in
 series, as in        all  arrangements       of   resistance       coils hitherto used,      by
 which the resistances of the component standards are added.
          Part   III.    General Remarks on Testing by Electro-dynamic
                                            Balance.
      I  shall conclude by remarking that the sensibility of the method
 which       has been explained,          as   well as of Wheatstone's balance,                 is
  limited     solely by the heating effect             of the current        used for testing.
  To    estimate      the amount of this heating effect, let                  e and  /   be the
  parts of the whole electromotive force, E, which act in the standard
  SS', and tested          conductor     TT' respectively         ;   so that, in accordance
  with the notation used above, we have
  of its    substance.        Following Weber,           I  define the resistance      of   a bar
  or wire one foot long, and weighing one grain, its specific resistance.
  It   is much to be desired that the weight-measure, rather than the
   diameter or the volume-measure,                   should be generally adopted for
   accurately specifying the gauge of wires used                      as electric conductors.
      With     reference    to either SS' or       TT' (the first, for instance), let          us
   use the following notation           :—
                         I its length in     feet  ;
                        w its mass per foot in grains             ;
                        * the specific heat       of its   substance      ;
                        a the   specific resistance        of its   substance.
      * The reciprocal of      the resistance   of   a " conductor"      or "aro"  I call its con
   ducting power. The conducting power of a bar or wire of any substance one
                                           I
   foot long and weighing one grain, call the specific conductivity of iU substance.

                                          322
Thus, since we have taken SS' to denote its actual resistance, we have
                                              to
    Now, Weber's system of absolute measurement                    for electromotive
forces    and for resistances       being followed,       I have shown* that the
 mechanical value       of   the  heat generated per unit             of  time    in any
fixed conductor      of uniform metallic         substance   is equal to the square
of   the electromotive       force   between      its extremities, divided         by  its
                 This in   the present case is equal to
                                          «
 resistance.
 and   if J denote    Joule's mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit,
 we therefore have
                                          <?w
 for the rate per second at which heat is generated in SS'. This will at
first go entirely to raise its temperaturet-                Now wl     is its mass in
grains, and therefore wis is its whole thermal capacity                     ; and   if we
 divide the preceding expression          by this, we find
for the    rate per second at which        it commences      to rise in temperature
 at the instant when the battery is applied.               If we  call  j    the electro-
 motive force per foot, we may enunciate              the result thus     :
    The rate at which a linear             conductor     of uniform metallic         sub
stance commences rising in temperature at the instant when an elec
 tric current    commences passing through            it, is equal to    the square     of
 the electromotive     force per unit of length divided by the continued
product of Joule's equivalent into the specific heat of the substance,
 into the specific resistance       of the   substance.
    Let   us suppose,     for example,      that the conductor in question is
   * In   a paper   " On   the Mechanical Theory of Electrolysis,"          Philosophical
Magazine, Dec. 1851.
   t As   soon  as it has risen sensibly    in temperature    it will begin to give out
heat by conduction, or by conduction and radiation, to the surrounding matter ;
and   the rate at which   it will go on rising in temperature will be the rate ex
pressed by the formula    in  the text (with the true specific resistance, &c., for each
temperature), diminished by the rate of loss to the surrounding matter.

copper of best electric conductivity.                       Its specific resistance will be
about     7   x   1 06,     and its specific heat       about . 1 . The value we must use
for Joule's equivalent will be 32*2 times                            the     number      1390, which
Joule found for             the mechanical value in foot-grains                 of    the thermal unit
Centigrade, since the absolute            unit of force, being that force which
acting on a            grain of matter during a second of time generates 1 foot
per second of velocity, is                         of the weight of             a grain        in middle
latitudes of Great Britain.                  Thus       we find
                                              J=44758.
Hence the expression for the rate in degrees Cent. per second, at
which the temperature begins rising in                         a    copper conductor, is

 I    have found the electromotive force                       of   a    single cell   of Daniell's to
be about 2*3            x   10"   British absolute units*           ;    and   if   we suppose           -!-   of
this to go to each foot of the conductor in question, we shall have
                                          2-3axl0"            5-29xl0,a
                                                                    n'
and therefore the expression for the rate of heating becomes
                                               ,        100

     Now,         by   using   a   sufficiently large         single cell, we may make the
electromotive force,                 E,   between    S    and T', be           as   little short     as we
please of the whole electromotive force of the cell.                                  We might then,
in testing by equality, with                  a    standard and          a   tested   conductor each
three inches or so long, and using   single cell, have nearly as much
                                                        a
as half the electromotive force of one cell acting per quarter foot of
these conductors, or two cells per foot.                             Hence      if    either   is   of   best
conductive copper, its temperature would commence rising at the
rate of X 169° or 676° Cent. per second.
              4                            It would be almost im
possible to work with so high      heating effect as this.
                                                    a                                          But   if        we
use only -ji^th of the supposed electromotive force, that        to say £th              is
of   a   cell per foot of the copper conductor, the rate of heating will be
reduced to             j^,    that   is   to say, will be 60,76 per second.                     By using

only very brief battery applications, it would be possible to work with
bo   high a rate of heating          as  that, without having the results much
vitiated by it.        But    ^     of  a cell per foot     will  give   only '0676° of
heating effect per second, and will be quite a sufficient battery power
to use in most cases.           In   the case we have supposed,            for instance,
of conductors only three inches long, the electromotive force on each
would then be about                of the electromotive force of the cell. 'What
we denoted above by e and              f in   equations (7) would therefore each
have this value.         Hence, by equation (4), we see that the effect of a
difference     of  yoVo* between        SS' and   TT' would       be to give     q-p the
value j-oTunnr of the electromotive force of a single cell.                     Now one
of the light mirror*            galvanometers,        which    I  commonly       use,    re
flecting the image of          a gas    or paraffine lamp to a scale 25 inches
distant, would,       if  made     with  a coil   of   50 yards     of copper wire of
moderate       quality, weighing       5  grains per foot, give a deflection of
half    a division    of -j^  of  an inch on this scale, with an electromotive
force of TjnAnro'       o'  a   single cellf . Hence by using such a galvano
meter,      and primary       and secondary conductors of sufficient resist
ances to      fulfil the condition      of doing     away   with   sensible error from
imperfect connexions in the manner explained                       above,    but yet of
resistances      either lees than or not many times greater than the re
sistance     of the galvanometer coil,        it is  easy to test to xT^iJ           resist
ance     of  a copper wire or bar not more               than 3 inches long.           The

inch in diameter, silvered in the ordinary manner ; and a small piece of flat file
steel of equal length, attached to its back by lac varnish, constitues the
                                                                                   " needle"
 of the galvanometer.      The whole weight of mirror and needle amounts to from
 1  to 1$ grain. It is suspended inside the galvanometer coil by single silk fibre
about £ inch long. It is necessary to try many mirrors thus prepared, each
with its magnet attached, before one is found giving a good enough image.                   I
am much indebted to         Mr. White, optician, Glasgow, for the skill and patience
which he has applied to the very troublesome processes involved.
    + In this state of sensibility the needle is under Glasgow horizontal magnetic
force of the earth alone ; and, with its mirror, it makes a vibration one way in
about '7 of a second.       In many uses of my form of mirror galvanometer, both
for telegraphic and for experimental purposes,           I find it convenient to make its
indications still more rapid, though, of course, less sensitive, by increasing the
directive force by means of fixed steel magnets.                                 I
                                                          On the other hand, use fixed
steel magnets to diminish        the earth's  directing force and make the needle more
 sensitive,  when very high sensibility is wanted ; but this would be inconvenient
 for the application detcribed in the text, because effects of thermo-electric ac
 tion would be made too prominent.

                                            325
current we have found to be sufficient for this object would only
produce a heating effect of -14° in two seconds, which, with good
apparatus, is more than enough of time, as I shall show presently.
The influence of this heating                 effect   may be regarded as nearly
insensible, since even as much                as  '2° only alters the resistance        of
copper by about
      In all  measurements      of electric     resistance,   whatever degree of gal
 vanic power is used, a spring "make and break" key* ought to be
 placed in one of the battery electrodes,                  so that   the  current may
 never flow except        as long as the operator wills            to keep   it flowing,
 and presses the key.           I introduce      a second similar spring key       in one
 of    the galvanometer electrodes            (that is     between   either Q or    P and
 the galvanometer coil),          so    arranged that the pressure          of  the ope
 rator's finger on      a little block of vulcanite attached           to either spring
 shall first make the contact of the first spring (completing the bat
 tery circuit), and when pushed a little further, shall make the con
  tact of the second         spring and complete the galvanometer circuit.
  The    test forthe balance     of resistances will then      be that not the slightest
  motion of the needle is observable              as a consequence     of this action   on
  the part      of the   operator.       The sensibility of the arrangement              is
  doubled by a convenient reverser                 in the galvanometer circuit, by
  which      the current,    if  any, may be reversed           easily by the operator
  while keeping the two connexions                    made    by full pressure     on the
  double spring        key just described.             Another convenient         reverser
   should be introduced into the battery circuit, to eliminate effects of
   thermo-electric action       if sensible.
       It  may often happen, unless            the galvanometer is at an inconve
   niently great distance from the conductors tested, that its needle will
   be directly affected to a sensible extent by the main testing- current                   ;
   but with the arrangement           I  have proposed the observer tests whether
   or not this is the case by pressing the double spring-key to only its
    middle position (battery contact alone made), and watching whether
    or not the needle moves perceptibly.               If it does not move   perceptibly,
    he has nothing more to do than immediately to press the double key
    home, to test the balance            of  resistances.      If the  needle does move
    when the key is pressed to its middle position, he may, when in
       * Morse's original telegraph key, which instrument-makers have " improved"
    into the in every respect worse        form in which it is now commonly made— a
    massive contact-lever   urged by a spring.

other respects       allowable, keep the current flowing by holding the
key in its middle position till the needle              comes   to rest, or at least
till it shows the point towards which its oscillations converge, and
then press home to test the balance of resistances.                      When the
very highest accuracy is aimed            at, or when,    for any   reason (as,   for
instance,    extreme shortness      in the standard or tested conductor), only
the shortest possible duration of current is allowable, the position of
the galvanometer,        with reference to the battery and the other portions
of circuit, must      be so arranged that its needle may show no sensible
deflection when the key is pressed to the middle position.                 Ignorant
or inadvertent operators are probably often led into considerable
mistakes in their measurements              of   resistance   by confounding de
flections due to direct electro-magnetic influence of battery, bat
tery electrodes,       or standard, tested,       or testing- conductors, on the
needle     of  the  galvanometer,      with    the proper influence       of a  cur
rent through its own coil, — a confusion which               can only be resolved
 by making or breaking the galvanometer circuit while the battery
circuit is kept made, for which there is no provision in the ordinary
plans of Wheatstone's           balance.     We may, however,         suppose   that
 most experimenters will be sufficiently               upon their guard against
error from such         a source.     But there is another       and a much more
 important advantage         in the double-break arrangement which            I now
 propose.       Electro-magnetic inductions will generally be sensible* in
some or in all       of the different branches of the compound circuit,
and cannot,        except   in very special      cases, be exactly balanced        as
 regards    electromotive force between         P   and  Q with   the arrangement
which makes an exact balance of resistances.                Hence, at the moment
 when the battery contact is made, there must generally be an electro
 motive impulse between Q and P, which will drive a current through
the galvanometer coil, and make an embarrassing deflection of the
needle    if the  galvanometer circuit is complete at that instant (as it is
in the common plans of Wheatstone's balance), and will require the
 observer    to wait until the needle         comes to rest, or until he can tell
   *  I make   them as little sensible  as possible  in my coiled testing-conductors,
and in sets of coiled standards of resistance, by either doubling each coil or each
branch of each coil on itself, or by reversing the lathe at regular intervals in
winding on any single coil on a bobbin, —a plan which has also the advantage of
rendering the direct electro-magnetic     action of any coil so wound very small or
 quite insensible  on any galvanometer    needle in its neighbourhood.

                                         327
precisely to what point its oscillations converge,           the current being
kept flowing all the time, before he can discover whether the balance
of  resistances    has   been    attained or not.     This absolutely precludes
very refined testing,        since, whether by the heating and consequent
augmentation of resistance of some part of the balanced branches, or
by thermo-electric reactions consequent on heating and cooling effects
at junctions     of dissimilar      metals when the branches       of the  balance
are not all   of  one homogeneous metal, or last, though not least, by
the eye losing the precise position where the galvanomer needle or
indicating    image     rested,   it is not possible to  use the   full sensibility
of  the galvanometer for testing a zero          if its needle is allowed to re
ceive   such   a shock in the course of the weighing.            Embarrassment
from this source is completely done away with by using the double
spring key described above, and             giving time, from its first to its
second    contact, to allow the electro-magnetic induction             to subside.
An extremely small fraction of         a second is enough in almost all cases      ;
and the operator may therefore generally press the key home almost
as sharply as he       will or    can.    But when there is    a  large "electro-
dynamic capacity"* in any part of the balance-circuit, as, for ex
ample, when the coil of a powerful electro-magnet with soft ironf
core is the conductor whose resistance is tested, it may be necessary
to keep the key in its middle position for a few seconds before press
ing it home, to avoid obtaining what might be falsely taken for an

Currents" (Phil. Mag., June 1858), to designate what for any electric current
through a given conductor is identical in meaning with the " simple-mass equi
valent" in the motion of Attwood's machine as ordinarily treated.         A rule for
calculating the electrodynamic capacity is given in that communication ; also

variation in the strength of an electric current (precisely analogous to the effect
of inertia on a current of common fluid), — which it seems quite certain must be
owing to true inertia (not of what we should at present regard as the electric
fluid or matter itself flowing through the conductor, but) of motions accom

netic force in the iron, air, and other matter in the neighbourhood of the con
ductor, and continuing unchanged as long as the current is kept unchanged.

indication of too great a resistance            to conduction (or "frictional"
resistance,    as  I have elsewhere called it*), being a true indication of
resistance    or reaction of inertia to the commencement                of  the current
in the electro-magnetically-loaded branchf.                 In such     cases   it is im
possible, either by electrodynamic balance or in any other way, to
obtain   a measurement       of  resistance    without keeping the battery ap
plied for the few seconds           required      to produce       sensibly its final
strength of current undiminished              by inductive      reaction, over and
above the time required to get an indication from the                   galvanometer.
But,   as already remarked, in all ordinary cases, the inductive reaction
becomes      insensible after    a very small fraction of a second, and the
operator may press the double key home to its second contact almost
 as  sharply as he pleases.         With such       a galvanometer       as   I have de
 scribed, he need not hold it down for more than                •

time of the simple vibration of the needlej) to test the balance of
resistances.      The order of procedure will therefore generally be this :
—The       operator will first strike the key sharply, allowing it to rise
again instantly, adjust resistances         in the balance-circuit according to
the indication       of the  galvanometer       ;  strike the key sharply again,
readjust resistances      ; and so on, until the balance is nearly attained.
He will     go on repeating the process,            but holding        the key down
rather longer each time.           At   the last he    will  press    the key gently
down, hold it pressed         firmly for something less than a second of
time, and let it rise again      ; and   if the   spot  of light   reflected from the
mirror of the galvanometer does not move sensibly, the resistances
are as accurately balanced as he can get them.

    t It is probable that a Wheatstone's balance, perfectly adjusted for equili
brium of resistances to conduction, and used with the galvanometer circuit con
stantly made, so as to show the whole effect of the inductive impulse, may afford
the best means for making accurate metrical investigations on electro-magnetic
induction, and especially for determining " electrodynamic capacities

    % The mirror galvanometers       commonly used in Germany have all much
longer periods (ten or twenty times as long in many cases) for the vibration of
 their needles, and want proportionately longer contacts to obtain full advantage
of their sensibility, — in each case a contact during a time equal to that of the
vibration of the needle one way being required for this purpose.

VIII. "On        the Heat which is developed at the Poles of a Voltaic
        Battery during the passage of Luminous Discharges in Air
        and in Vacuo."         By John P. Gassiot, F.R.S. Received
        June 12, 1861.
    1.  When the wires attached to the terminal plates of an extended
series   of  a voltaic battery are brought into contact with each other,
the circuit    of  the battery is completed ; and          if in this state the ends
of the wires       are   separated   from each other, the usual luminous
or arc-discharge is produced, the length of the arc depending on
the number of the cells of which the battery consists.                  If  this lumi
nous discharge is continued for           a few seconds,       the metallic positive
pole or anode becomes           red-hot, and will ultimately be fused, while
the negative remains comparatively cool.                This experiment was ori
                                        '                                 '
ginally described by me in the            Philosophical Magazine of Decem
ber 1838, p. 436.         In the  same periodical      of June    1840, p. 478,     Mr.
Grove suggested         as an explanation, that this effect          " might     be due
to the interposed medium, and that, were there any analogy between
the state assumed         by voltaic electrodes       in elastic media and that
which they assumed in electrolytes, it would follow that the chemical
action in the positive electrode           in atmospheric air would be more
 violent than at the negative, and that,        if the chemical action were        more
violent, the heat would necessarily          be more intense."
     2. Since that time     I am not aware that any other explanation rela
 tive to the heating of the positive pole of the voltaic battery has
 been published.        Mr. Grove merely        gives   it  as a suggestion    ;  but as
 it is immaterial whether either or both poles                are  of copper, alumi
 nium, platinum, or any other metal, or of coke, as in either                 case  it is
 the positive that is heated,        the phenomenon cannot arise from any
 effect  of oxidation, but must        be due     to some action       in the battery
 circuit hitherto unexplained.
     3.  In the Bakerian Lecture for          1858,   I  have stated     that, "when
  the   discharge from an induction coil is taken in air or in vacuo with
  thin platinum wires, the negative           terminal becomes        red-hot, and      if
  the discharges are continued the wire will be fused."                 This heating
  of the    negative   terminal, provided the wires are thin, always takes
  place whatever may be the length            of  the discharge or the medium
  through which it passes.
                                                                      2   B

                                        330
   4.  That this heating of      the negative terminal in the discharge               from
an induction coil had some intimate relation to the heating                        of the
positive pole of the voltaic battery was very probable                   ;  but why in
the one case the heat should be evolved at the negative,                    and in the
other at the       positive terminal,      appeared       extraordinary        and well
worth further investigation.          The result of        the experiments         I  have
made with this object forms the subject            of the  present communication.
   5.  After verifying     the fact that the heating       of  the negative terminal
of an induction coil is always        obtained either in          a  carbonic acid va
cuum, in rarefied gases, or in air, provided the terminal wire is thin,
but not   if thick,   I proceeded    to examine with greater precision than
formerly the nature and character of the luminous discharges in vacuo
as obtained from my water-battery,            as  well  as  from the 400 insulated
cells of the nitrie-acid battery (Proceedings, March 15, 1860) ; and
for this object I had several small vacuum-tubes constructed, about
3 inches long and       1 inch diameter     ;   in each of these, two metallic or
carbon balls, about £ of an inch in diameter, were attached to the pla
tinum wires, hermetically sealed in the tube about one inch apart.
                                       Fig.    1.
Each wire is protected by        a glass tube as     far  as the    ball  ; the vacuum
is obtained by means        of carbonic acid      absorbed     by caustic potassa, as
described    in my former communications.
   6.  The    discharges   in these tubes from an induction coil or from my
water-battery      present    nearly the      same appearance,         viz.   a   brilliant
luminosity surrounding         the negative      ball, generally without (fig. 2),
but sometimes with (fig. 3)         a  minute stratified discharge              from the
positive.
             Fig.  2.                                            Fig.  3.
   7. When the vacuum-tube is introduced into the circuit                      of  4 00  in
sulated cells of the nitrie-acid battery, the discharge at first always

                                          331
assumes the form represented         in fig. 2. This discharge,          as well as those
from the induction coil and the water-battery, when examined, is found
 to be very perceptibly intermittent, and will generally continue for some
 time after the circuit has been completed.              As    the action    of  the bat
tery improves, the luminous glow round the negative metallic ball
gradually      increases  in size, and in       a few seconds         the ball becomes
red-hot.      This result    I  repeatedly obtained       ;   and in two instances
with tubes in which balls of aluminium,               \ inch     diameter,    had been
inserted, the negative dropped from the wire into the tube in a molten
state, but leaving the positive ball with its original metallic lustre.
                                       Fig. 4.
    8.  The preceding experiments, so far from assisting me in explain
ing the cause of the heating of the positive pole of the voltaic battery,
rather tended to complicate the inquiry            ;  for experiment now showed
that in carbonic acid vacua the heating effect was elicited at the nega
tive pole, whether the discharge was made from a voltaic battery or
form an induction coil      ;  but as experiment also showed that heat is
always evolved from the latter at the negative, whether in air or in
vacuo, and that from the battery           it always in air      appears at the posi
tive,  it was evident the media         through which discharges             were made
afforded no explanation for the elucidation of a phenomenon of which
hitherto the more it was examined by experiment the more difficult
appeared     the solution.
    9.  My next experiments       were made in vacuum-tubes in which balls
of carbon were inserted in lieu of metal. With              these   I at first obtained
the usual heating of the negative, but in one            instance I observed that
both balls were at the same time exhibiting red heat                ;  in this instance,
either from some alteration having taken place in the vacuum, or from
some other cause which        I had not time to      examine, the discharge from
the carbon balls became so uncertain            as to afford me little information
worth recording, except        as  to the fact     I   have     stated    of both balls
being heated      : the cause  of this   I  was subsequently enabled            to deter
mine.
    10.   In two of    the vacuum-tubes hollow brass               balls had been at
tached to the platinum wires.          In the first of     these the negative        very
                                                                      2 n 2

                                              332
soon became heated by the discharge.                      As the discharge of the battery
continued, a sudden flash of light was visible in the vacuum, and the
glass instantly became coated with metal.                        On examining the tube,        I
ascertained       that one-half of the negative ball was separated from the
other, and partly fused            :   the intense        heat   had vaporized the silver
with which the two hemispheres forming the ball had been soldered,
and it was this vaporized metal that was deposited                         on the sides        of
the tube. The positive ball remained much tarnished, as                          if it had also
been heated.
   11.   I    then introduced            the second         tube,   having similar hollow
brass balls, into the circuit            of the battery.          In this tube   the negative
also was at first heated to redness             ;   when in this state, a sudden bril
liant stratified discharge took place, as fig. 5.
                                             Fig.    5.
   The evolution of nitrous acid fumes in                        the battery denoted its in
tense action.       This discharge from the battery continued for about two
seconds, the       negative ball instantly losing its luminosity, the positive
becoming red-hot.
   12.    This experiment appeared to offer an explanation as to the
cause    of the heating of the poles ; but on attempting to repeat the                   it,
tube was unfortunately fractured                by   the heating of the platinum wire,
as were also two tubes with coke balls                :    the result I  had obtained was,
however, too interesting to me not to repeat the experiment                          ;   and   I
had six vacuum-tubes prepared, each of the same dimensions as
already described,          two with coke balls, two with iron, and two with
copper, all solid      :    the best and most conclusive results were obtained
with the copper.          The experiments which     now proceed to describe

were made on          the 27th of last May, in the presence of the Rev. Dr.
Robinson and Professor Stokes.
   13.    In the first tube            the negative       ball very soon became red-hot,
when suddenly the brilliant,                 clearly defined,         conical stratified dis
charge       as   in fig.   5   appeared,    continuing for three or four seconds.
On breaking the circuit of the battery, we ascertained                     that the negative
ball, or that attached to the zinc terminal of the battery, had,                     as before,
entirely lost its heated appearance,                while the positive, or that attached

                                           333
to the platinum end of the battery, remained at a dull red heat, which
it retained for two or     three seconds after the circuit     of the battery had
been broken.
    14.  A  second tube with copper balls was then introduced into the
battery circuit   ; in this   I also obtained the usual luminous          negative
glow discharge surrounding the ball attached to the zinc terminal of
the battery   ; this glow, as before, gradually enlarged, and in a few          se
conds the ball became red-hot           ;  the circuit of the battery was then
instantly broken, the negative            ball retaining its red heat for several
seconds.    In this experiment it will        be observed that the circuit  of the
battery was broken before the sudden brilliant discharge, previously
 described, had appeared.        These results fully confirmed my original
experiment (1 1) of the alternate heating of the positive and negative
terminals of the voltaic battery, when the discharge is made in vacuo.
     15.  The result of my previous experiment (11) having been thus
confirmed, the explanation of those that preceded it became easy of
solution.     When both coke terminals (9) were heated to redness, the
 continuous or arc discharge had only lasted for an instant, evolving
heat at the positive terminal         ;   but the negative     during this short
interval retained the luminosity it had previously acquired, and con
 sequently at the time of the disruption of the circuit, both coke ter
minal balls exhibited red heat.             Again, in the first experiment with
 the brass balls (10), the arc discharge was also only momentary, a
 disruption of the circuit having been caused by the partial fusion of
 the negative ball    ; but the duration of this discharge was sufficient
 to tarnish the positive terminal       ;  while with balls of aluminium (7), a
 metal that fuses at     a  very low temperature, the negative was melted
 by the heat evolved in the intermittent discharge            ; and we ascertain
 that under this condition the positive terminal is in no way affected,
 for the metal retained its original lustre.
     16. The voltaic discharge of a battery of 400 insulated                  cells,
 charged with nitric      and sulphuric       acid, when observed     in these va
 cuum-tubes, at first assumes precisely the same appearance as that of
 one   of nearly 4000 cells charged with rain-water, as it is also similar to
 that of the discharge from an induction coil (fig. 2) ; but the action of
  the nitric acid so far differs from that of the water-battery, that while
  the discharge   of  the latter   will remain for    several weeks   (or until the
  water in some of the cells has evaporated) of nearly the same form

                                            334
and appearance       (figs. 2 or 3), the        discharge from the nitrie-acid
battery quickly alters      : as the action    of the battery improves, the glow
round the negative terminal enlarges, heat in that portion of the tube
is sensibly developed,      as can be ascertained       by touching the tube with
the hand, and in a few seconds the negative                 ball becomes    red-hot.
During this time no apparent sign of chemical action                  takes place in
the cells of the battery ; the heating effect appears to             be mainly due
to the elevation of tension      ; for  if the  copper wires attached to the ter
minals rest on gold-leaf electroscopes,           the leaves    continue expanded
until   the arc discharge takes place, when they instantly collapse,              and
heat is evolved at the positive terminal.
   1 7.   In vacuo,  as  long as the intermittent discharge continues, resist
ance apparently takes place at the negative              terminal  ; and this is not
only evinced by the heat which is evolved,               but by the disruption of
the   metal which is separated         from this pole in minute particles, and
deposited     in a lateral direction on the sides of the vacuum-tube.
   IS. As      soon   as  the action of the battery becomes              sufficiently
energetic,    so as to cause the continuous or arc discharge to pass, an
entirely new effect is developed        :  the discharge itself becomes intensely
vivid, the stratifications assume            a conical form with     their apex di
rected towards the negative          (fig. 5), and heat is instantly perceptible
at the positive terminal, while the negative            as instantly cools.
   19.    It is beautiful and interesting to        observe the suddenness       with
which the red heat of the negative terminal ball disappears,                and the
equal suddenness        with which the heat is at the same instant elicited
in the positive, when the brilliant arc discharge takes place.
   From the result* obtained by these experiments,                I infer that    the
development      of heat, either at       the positive or the negative pole      of a
voltaic battery,      is entirely due to the amount           of resistance which
takes place in that       part of   the battery     circuit.

    IX. "Contributions              to   the    Physiology         of the Liver. — The
          Influence of an Acid in producing Saccharine                        Urine." By
          F. W. Pavy, M.D.               Communicated by Dr.             Sharpey.           Re
          ceived    June 13, 1861.
       In  1854   I  conducted an experiment to determine the effect of de
   priving the blood of its natural alkalinity.                I  then wished to       see  if I
   could influence the presumed destruction of sugar in the blood during
   its transit through the lungs.                 Phosphoric acid (Pharmacopoeia
  strength),     to the extent        of 1\ fluid drachms, was injected into the
  jugular     vein   of a dog,    and the blood of the arterial system became
  strongly charged with sugar.               Since this experiment was performed,
  it has been ascertained          that there is not the difference           during life in
  the blood on the        two sides of the lungs that was formerly supposed
  to exist   ;  and it has become evident that it was not to arresting any
  change in the lungs, as          I at first supposed,      that the result      I  obtained
  was due.       The fact of     the blood being rendered saccharine,               led me to
  infer that a saccharine state of the urine might also be occasioned                           ;
  and in order to settle this point             I  undertook the experiments that
  form the subject of my present communication.
      In  seven instances      I  have tried the effect          of injecting phosphoric
 acid into the general circulation.                 I find that it is an experiment
  which     requires     to be performed            with   the     greatest    nicety   :   the
  animal withstands the introduction of the acid to a certain extent
 without manifesting any disturbance, and it may even, at first, be in
jected pretty rapidly        ;  but when      a  certain amount, varying in different
 instances according to the size          of  the animal, has been introduced, the
 further introduction          requires to be made most slowly and with the
 utmost care, attentively watching its effects                 ;   otherwise destruction
 of life will     be occasioned.        I  have    found this to occur in one case
 after one ounce had been employed, and in another after 10 drachms                           :
 in both of      these cases the animals were            of  a   smallish size.       In two
good-sized      animals the injection of an ounce did not thus lead to im
mediate death, and did not produce any alteration in the state                         of  the
 urine as far     as regards     sugar.      Having carried the experiments fur
ther, however,        I find that when the injection is pushed to the fullest
extent that the animal will safely bear,              a saccharine      state  of  the urine
is the result.        I will give the particulars of two experiments in which

                                            336
this occurred.           I  may  mention, in passing,       that where       I  have had
occasion     to give chloroform after the injection            of an acid into the     cir
culation,    I   have found the animal most easily killed by a very small
dose, and artificial         respiration not of its usual avail in restoring ani
mation.
    A good-sized healthy dog which had not                  been fed the day        of the
experiment        :  the urine withdrawn gave no indication             of  the presence
 of sugar     :  11    ounce   of the Pharmacopoeia phosphoric acid diluted
 with    an     equal      quantity of water injected slowly into one of the
jugular veins.           The injection     was made so slowly that           it occupied
 half an hour in being effected.              In  one hour's time from the com
 pletion of the injection,          the urine was highly charged with sugar,
 giving a copious orange-red reduction with the copper solution.
    A  large and strong terrier- dog, not fed since twenty-four hours pre
 vious to the experiment          :  2 ounces and 2 drachms         of phosphoric acid
 diluted with an equal quantity of water, introduced slowly into one
 of the   jugular      veins.    This    was as much as the animal would bear
 without seriously endangering its life.                The urine, twenty minutes
 after the completion of the injection, was slightly charged with sugar,
 and one hour and three quarters afterwards pretty                   highly so.
    It  is thus evident that when a            sufficient quantity of acid is intro
 duced into the circulatory system, the operations                 of life  are so altered
 that sugar appears in the blood to such an extent                    as   to occasion    a
 strongly marked saccharine state of the urine.                   From all that     I have
 seen,   it appears to me reasonable           to conclude that this result is due
 to a perverted condition           of  the processes belonging to the fiver.          The
 unnatural state of the blood occasioned                by the presence of the acid
 seems to induce the change            of amyloid substance into sugar. It seems
 to promote that change,            the result of chemical action, which occurs
 with such activity after death, and which must be held in abeyance
 under natural circumstances during life, sugar                   being found in the
 system to so scarcely          an appreciable extent.
    When the quantity of acid used has been large, the blood nearly
 loses its power        of coagulating.       In some    of my experiments,         also,  I
 have noticed that such a morbid state has been induced as to lead to
 an escape       of blood from        the vessels during      life.    I have met with
 ecchymosis         of the liver and stomach, an accumulation of blood in the
 stomach and intestine,          and the presence      of blood in the urine.

                                             337
     Looking upon       the effect     of  the acid injection as due to an action
upon the liver, it occurred to            me that this organ might be much more
directly influenced by injecting the acid into a branch of the portal
system instead of the jugular vein. It happens, however, that a cir
cumstance occurs to render this mode of experimenting unsuccessful.
Although I have never found the acid lead to a solidification of the
blood in the vessels when introduced into the general circulation
(indeed,     as I have  mentioned, the effect is the reverse of this), yet when
injected into the portal          system    it  causes the blood belonging to this
system to solidify and the vessels to become                  so plugged up that the
circulation of portal blood           is completely stopped.          I have   made    five
experiments in this way          ; and    in all but one the effect referred to has
 occurred.       In three of     the cases the acid was used undiluted, but in
jected very slowly into one of the mesenteric veins; and, in each, under
 an ounce was used        :  in the fourth,      6 drachms of the acid diluted with
 1  2 drachms     of  water formed the injection employed.                  All  the dogs
 died in less than one hour and            a half, and the trunk of the portal vein
 with its larger divisions in         the liver was found plugged up with solidi
 fied blood,     so as  entirely to check the circulation.             The  tissue  of the
 liver   was in places white and hard, as            if it  had been chemically acted
 upon by the acid.           There was no sugar to be detected in the urine                ;
  and the liver, submitted to an ordinary examination after death,                      be
 haved in the usual way.            From     one experiment      I learnt that the effect
  produced by the acid in solidifying the portal blood instantly occurred
  on the first portion of the injection being made                ;  so that the portal
  circulation was at once stopped,             which would account for the absence
  of any sugar in the urine.
      In  the experiment where the circulation remained free,                  | an ounce
  of the acid    was used diluted with           2 ounces     of water.   The injection
  was slowly made.          The urine in       an hour and a     half's time    was found
  to contain    a  slight amount of sugar.            Two hours after      the injection,
  when life was destroyed, the liver was perfectly natural in appearance,
  and all the vessels were free.            There was therefore no engorgement
  of  the spleen nor blackening          of the intestine from congestion,          as was
  the case in the other experiments.
      Finding this      mode     of experimenting proved unavailable,               I  next
  tried the effect       of introducing the acid into the alimentary                  canal
   instead  of directly into    the portal system.         Injecting it into the stomach

                                              338
   was  of  no use, for    it very    soon induced vomiting and was rejected.
  Half an    ounce   of  the phosphoric acid injected through a tube passed
  down     the    oesophagus      I  found     rapidly     to  occasion      repeated   vo
  miting efforts,      the   stomach      having been previously            empty.      Re
  sorting to the use of chloroform,            I therefore introduced the acid into
  the duodenum, or some other portion                of  the small intestine.
     I have   the record before         me  of the   five experiments         of this kind
 that   I   have   performed.        They in     the   most striking       manner show
  that an excess of acid in the system occasions               the production       of sac
 charine urine.        The following        are the leading points belonging to
  these experiments.
     No.   1.  In  a medium-sized dog, which had not been fed for twenty-
 four hours, 2 ounces of phosphoric acid were injected into the upper
 part of the small intestine in £-ounce portions at intervals of half an
 hour.      Half an hour after the last half ounce had been injected, the
 life of the animal was destroyed.              The bladder       was found distended
 with urine, which gave a strong reaction of sugar.                  It had    been ascer
 tained that it was previously free from this principle.                   The liver pre
 sented an ordinary appearance             and behavour. There was no plugging
 up of the portal vessels       ; indeed the blood, which was collected during
 the post-mortem examination, scarcely possessed any coagulating pro
 perty.
     No.  2.   Fourteen drachms of phosphoric acid were introduced into
 the duodenum        of  a largish dog which had not been fed since the day
previous.       In  an hour and a        hairs time there        was a large quantity
of urine in     the bladder, and       it presented     a strong reaction      of sugar.
     No.  3.  A   medium-sized dog three hours after food                :   10 drachms
of phosphoric acid injected into            the duodenum       ;  urine in two hours'
time gave an orange-yellow reduction with the copper solution.                        Ten
drachms more were now again injected, and two hours afterwards the
life of the animal was destroyed.                 The urine      gave a    still stronger
reaction    of  sugar,   namely, an orange-red reduction with                 the copper
solution.      The liver      presented      a natural appearance.            The blood
collected from the heart had undergone no coagulation whatever by
the following day.
    No. 4. A small dog         five hours after food      : 4 drachms of phosphoric
acid injected into the duodenum.               In  one hour and a       half the animal
was killed.       The urine did not contain any sugar.                The liver looked

                                             339
natural, and behaved in the ordinary manner.                     The blood underwent
its usual coagulation.
     No. 5.     A   medium-sized dog that had not been fed for twenty-four
hours    :    30 drachms       of phosphoric acid injected into the duodenum,
and two hours afterwards the life          of the animal was destroyed. There
was no urine found in the bladder.                 The intestine looked black,              as     if
in a state of mortification.           Some    of the large       venous trunks            in the
liver were plugged up with coagulated blood.                      The liver,        examined
a   short time after death, gave only a moderately strong reaction of
sugar,       and none    of   the presence   of amyloid       substance.
     It will   be observed      that in the first three experiments saccharine
urine was produced by the influence of phosphoric                       acid introduced
into the intestine.           In the fourth,       no sugar    was found ; because,                I
apprehend, the quantity of acid employed (4 drachms) was too small.
The fifth is incomplete, on account of there having been no urine to
test ; but this experiment is             of interest, in showing that                 a    large
quantity of the acid injected into the intestinal                   canal    may produce
the same       kind of   effect, as regards plugging up the larger veins                   of the
liver,   as   when introduced directly into a branch of the portal system                           .
     From a consideration of all that has been brought                      forward, it is
evident that the presence of an acid in sufficient amount in the system
so perverts the normal processes of life as to occasion a considerable
production of sugar, which, passing into the blood, escapes by the
urine.   Such is the fact ; and, as            I
                                    have already stated, consider it            I
to be caused by an effect of the acid upon the liver.                       The chemical
disposition of the amyloid substance                  to transform into sugar                is,
                                                                                              I
conceive,       allowed to come into play from the unnatural state of the
blood, and thus the result occurs.
     In former communications to             the Royal Society,     I      have mentioned
that destruction of the superior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic
occasions      a   temporary diabetes, and that this diabetes              is   prevented        by
the previous introduction            of   carbonate    of   soda into the circulation.
In    accordance      with what might be expected, the injection of the acid
and the operation on the sympathetic produce conjointly                         a   saccharine
state    of    the urine, as either does separately.              In   one case where         I
analysed the urine,      I     found 7-3 grains of sugar per ounce, an hour and                    a
half after      the operation on the nerveaud theinjection had been effected.
 I      consider    it
                     a   point of interest (which, however,         I      merely mention

                                        340
 at present     without any comment upon it), that        I  have  observed       a
jaundiced condition produced by the operation on the sympathetic
with the injection of the acid.        The urine has  been deeply tinged with
bile, and has given the characteristic play of colours upon the addi
tion of nitric acid.     In the experiments with the injection      of  the acid
alone,   it has been a matter     of constant observation that   a flow    of bile
has been excited into the duodenum and towards the stomach, the
pyloric extremity of which has been highly tinged of a yellow colour.
    Although     a diabetic state  of  the urine may be thus artificially      in
 duced, apparently by the direct chemical agency          of an acid upon the
liver, yet    I  am   not prepared to say that, beyond the addition             of
another significant fact to our knowledge upon this matter, any at
present available assistance      has been gained towards unravelling         the
nature of the diabetic disease.       Possibly in some cases an insufficiently
alkaline state of the portal blood may be the cause of a temporary
slightly saccharine state of the urine     ; but from the observations     I have
conducted upon diabetics,       I  certainly am not permitted to think that
such is the cause of the well-marked diabetic disease.         The immediate
cause    of the production   of sugar in idiopathic diabetes, and in diabetes
artificially produced by operations upon the nervous system (the sympa
thetic and cerebro-spinal), still remains an open point for discovery.
    Usually in my experiments with the acid injections the liver has
been found fairly charged with amyloid substance; but in a few instances
an absence    of this principle   has been observed,   although only     a  short
time has elapsed between the injection and the period of destruction
of life.

                                   (Abstract.)
   This communication         embraces    the first portion of an elaborate
physical and chemical investigation, in which the author has been and
is still engaged, upon the scientific conditions involved in the success
ful agriculture of the cotton plant.         To this train of research he ht&

                                        341
brought peculiar advantages, holding his professorial chair in the great
cotton-growing      State of Alabama (North America), having been the
editor of the  Government Geological Report of that State, and having
had placed at his disposal (for experiment and comparison) by the
Indian Government, a magnificent collection, specially made, of the
various cotton soils and plants of India,        as well  as  the like from other
Powers.
   The author remarks that, although          an examination     of the conditions
under which the cotton plant may be cultivated with success is one
of much interest both in      a scientific and economic      point of view, yet it
is strange that science, botanical, chemical, and climatological, should
as yet have supplied so little information with respect              to this plant,
the most important source of the clothing of man. That, while other
cultivated species, many of them of far less general value, have been
the objects of careful experimental research          — their botanical relation
and improvement by hybridization            settled— the character and extent
of their  demands     for atmospheric and mineral food ascertained            —the
soils upon which they thrive or fail analysed         — the climatal conditions
which favour or impede their growth observed,              the culture of cotton
under favourable circumstances         has, as an art, been advanced         in one
great locality almost to perfection, but without the scientific princi
ples upon which the art is based, and by the application of which
alone success or failure in any new attempts elsewhere and under new
conditions can be predicted.         He    shows that the immediate cause        of
this neglect of the science of cotton-culture has been the facility with
which the vast and growing demand of the world for cotton has been
met    by the vast surface of fertile and virgin soil and other favour
able conditions     of the southern       states  of North America, yielding
wealth to the planter too readily to incite him to inquire much                  as
to the conditions of his success.
   Although much virgin soil remains in               the   southern states un
touched by the cotton-planter,         the author states that it needs but
slight knowledge of the country to discover the vast extent of
                                                                           " worn-
out" cotton    fields already existing even in the most recently settled
states,  or to predict      a  time when the        growing demands        for the
staple   must compel, there and elsewhere, the attention of the eco
nomist to the scientific aspects of the problem of cotton-cultivation.
To fix with   exactness    the conditions under which the cotton plant

                                           342
 thrives, how far it can be brought to bear unfavourable circumstances,
 and   by what means the latter may be modified to suit its require
 ments,  — such    are the    "fruit-bearing"        objects of the author's          re
 searches   ;  he remarks, however,         that in the purely scientific aspect
 of his subject it is difficult to       overrate   the interest that attaches         to
 every question touching the sure production               of  a  material that, in its
 husbandry, manufacture, and consumption, closely concerns                       so  im
 mense    a proportion     of the human       race.     In the    present paper, that
 branch of the subject which relates to the soil is taken up.
    The author in commencing              gives a careful summary         of all such
 experiments on American cotton soils             as have been      recorded prior to
 his own labours.        These are not numerous.
    The   second chapter describes,         by the aid of     a  large geological and
 climatological map, the precise geographical boundaries of the regions
 of American cotton-culture,           the geological or agronomic, climatal,
 and meteorological and general            superficial conditions of these great
 surfaces, and the relations      of  each   of these to the growth and culture
 of the  several    varieties or staples,      such   as   " Sea Island
                                                                          "  or  " long
                            " or " short                        The latter sort, con
staple," and "upland                         staple," &c.
stituting the vast bulk of the crop, and bearing, in 1858, the ratio of
eleven   hundred and six and            a  half millions     to only about twelve
million    pounds of the
                              " Sea Island,"       the author deems         worthy of
prior investigation.       In  the first instance,    limiting himself to this, he
discusses     carefully in his third and fourth chapters, the choice of
district from which the most typical and important soils for examina
tion should be collected, and decides upon the selection of                 " fair  nor
                    of prairie  soil
                                      "  and its underlying subsoil, and to exa
mal specimens
mine them "as minutely and accurately                as  possible," believing that
thus   a clue   would be more readily found to the causes of fertility as
dependent      on soil  (for which this region is remarkable), than by a
less  careful examination of many specimens from this or that locality
over so vast a surface.          This method, without teaching all that               we
may want to know, is certain most readily to show us the                  right direc
tion in which to push further inquiry.               Seven specimens       of soil and
subsoil were      finally selected      for comparison and           analysis, mainly
from that class      of " prairie    land
                                           "  known     as
                                                             " canebrake    land," in
Marengo, County Alabama, in lat. 32° 35' N., long. 87° 36' W., the
points being marked upon the map accompanying the paper.

                                              343
    The characteristics of this very peculiar soil, its prevailing weeds,
and most       important       Silva and Flora, its average depth, nature of
surface,    effects upon      it of rain   and     of drought,   the form    of its water
courses, and general conditions affecting the cotton plant are carefully
described,     and their bearings on the subject discussed.                  The exami
nation of these         soils     was   twofold — physical       or chemico-physical,
and    purely chemical or analytical.                The methods employed in each
are detailed     ;  and in the former, those            of Schubler and of Schulze,
with modifications by the author, were principally employed, atten
tion being also given           to the methods and results           of Liebig's    recent
experiments, and those of others, on the power of withdrawal by soils
of   saline   and other substances             from their solutions.        The external
characters of the soils examined                    are then described    ;   the real   or
true     specific     gravity,      and     the     weight   of   a  given     volume    in
known conditions of moisture and dryness — the contraction in volume
on drying from a determinate extreme of wetness — the cohesion of
the soil, or adhesion of its particles (in known conditions as to
moisture) to each other, are all determined, the last by a method
believed     new.      The     adhesion     of    these soils to the surfaces      of iron
implements, as ploughshares, hoes, &c., was ascertained                      in the state
of " maximum moisture,"              as  proposed by Schubler, of whose method,
however,      the author expresses some disapproval.
    The next physical condition determined is the absorption of                       heat
 from the sun's rays,             with tabulated results, both for the absolute
maximum temperature attained                  ;   and the rate at which the increment
takes place.        The results indicate the importance of noting the latter,
and    prove that the statements of Malaguti and Durocher, in opposi
tion to Schubler,         that mineral composition has               a more     important
influence than colour upon the thermo-absorptive capacity, and that
of   sand is greater than that           of  clay, must be accepted with consider
 able limitations.       Conversely, the author has determined the relative
 retentive    powers of these soils for heat, having intimate relations
 with the rate at which they lose heat after the sun has become                         ab
 sent,   and tabulated          his results, which         differ considerably,      as  he
 notices,   from those of Schubler in analogous cases, — the discrepan
 cies remaining after           repetition, by the author, of his own experi
 ments.      He points out         some   of    the probable causes    of this.
     He then       proceeds      to the power of absorption and retention of

                                              344
water, with tabulated results.              The extreme tenacity with which the
best cotton soils retain a very        large proportion of their water of satura
tion after lengthened periods of exposure                  to dry air is remarkable,
and the importance of this in the hot climate of cotton-culture
is pointed out.          In immediate connexion with this point, their per
meability, or the rate at which water percolates                through these various
soils was ascertained,         the relations of which to partial rain or dews,
and to the desiccation          of  one mass and        species  of land in   times  of
drought by others          adjoining are important and obvious; and again,
in the     same    relations, the capillarity,           or rate at which water      is
drawn through and upwards in the soils from deep moisture below,
was determined.            In this part of his labours the author considers
with some exactness            the nature and measures           of the true capillary
power of soils, refers to the recent interesting researches of Jamin on
the capillarity    of porous      bodies, and describes       some new and peculiar
apparatus by which he has determined this for the soils in question,
the results being given in several              tables.    These indicate strikingly
one   of  the remarkable properties due to the extremely fine state                  of
division of these       " best   cotton soils," on which, in part, their fertility
depends,     viz. that they draw up moisture from the subsoil with im
mense power, and            therefore from great depths, but yet do so with
great slowness       ;  so that in a    torrid climate      the subsuperficial supply
of   water    fluctuates but little, and           is slowly supplied and long in
being exhausted          in drought     ;  while other soils pump it up rapidly,
and    as  rapidly     waste    it.   This property        becomes    more important
as the distribution        of rain, both in       season and in space, is more      un
equal naturally.
    The hygroscopic power, or power of absorbing                      aqueous   vapour
 from the atmosphere,          is next experimented upon, and the results are
tabulated, and also represented              graphically by curves,     as are  several
of  the other numerical results.
    The author then          proceeds     to the   highly important subject of the
 absorptive power of the soils for gases directly or indirectly affecting
 the growth of plants.
    Tabulating      the     results for oxygen, carbonic acid, and ammonia,
 the most striking          result here exhibited is the prodigious power of
 absorbing ammonia possessed                 by the dry canebrake soils.          This
 soil condenses        52 volumes     (equal to its own) of ammonia, and its

                                        345
  subsoil 64 volumes.      It will  be remembered       that De Saussure found
 that the most impalpable          powder of boxwood charcoal              only ab
 sorbed 90 volumes       equal to itself.      Another    cause  of   the extreme
 fertility of these soils is thus brought into evidence.
     From this the experimenter proceeds           to the determination of ab
 sorption or withdrawal      by the soils of inorganic substances           in con
 tact with them, and in solution        ;  experimenting on ammonia, chlo
 ride of ammonium, sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of potass, phosphate
 of   soda   and silicate of potass,      and determining       the    proportions
 both of acid     and  of  base withdrawn.        The methods by which he
 proceeded     are described  with reference      to each of the above salts.
 In  several cases the acids and bases are not absorbed            in the propor
 tions in which they constitute the salts.             These very curious and
 suggestive    results are graphically given       as well  as  tabulated.      The
 labours of various other chemists in this direction are referred to
 and discussed    in reference to those of the author.
    Professor Mallet then refers to what he denominates the mechanical
 analysis of the soil, pointing out the necessity, in all agronomic deter
 minations, of finding, by methods admitting               of comparison with
 distant soils, the texture, coarseness, or fineness,      &c. of the constituent
 particles.    These results are given in eight consecutive            comparable
 tables.    Each   soil was separated      into six solid portions and the
 remaining water making up its total weight — viz. into the material
 passing through sieves respectively offering 36, 100, 400, and 1600
 meshes    to the   square inch,    and   into suspended      matter of two de-
 can tations.
    The proportion of impalpable material         is very remarkable, amount
ing in the best soils to more than 70 per cent. of the whole.                Not  a
pebble or particle almost, exceeding         J-0th of an inch in diameter, is
to be found in those best cotton soils whose comminuted state per
mits the free pushing out of root-fibres in all directions.
    The purely chemical part of the investigation is then proceeded
with.     The methods employed for the chemical analysis of the soils
are given under the heads       of   water, organic matter, inorganic         mat
ter soluble in water, inorganic matter soluble in hydrochloric                acid,
inorganic matter decomposable          by strong sulphuric       acid,   and   that
not acted on by this acid.       And the results follow in eight tabular
statements,    but are of too detailed      a   character to be brought into
    vol. xi.                                                      2 c    »

an abstract, and without such the discussion that succeeds would not
be   sufficiently intelligible     to be useful.       It  may be interesting       to
state   that measurements        have   shown that the average           mass  of soil
interpenetrated      by the roots of each cotton plant                in Alabama     is
about 5 cubic feet     ;  within    this bulk of soil      a   sufficient amount     of
inorganic constituents for the plant must be found naturally, or be
artificially transferred to it.
    Professor Mallet compares his results with the analyses of Indian
soils made by Dr. Forbes Watson, pointing out both similarities and
differences.
    In concluding his      analyses     of  the soils and      subsoils, the author
gives    also one   of the so-called       "  Rotten    Limestone,"      and of the
" Bored Rock," both        calcareous    rocks of a very friable character that
underlie the Cane Brake soils.            He concludes his elaborate research
with some general deductions from his examination of Alabama cotton
soils, and with an appendix, in which he describes the mechanical or
agricultural methods employed in that State in the treatment of the
same.      These are given     as  follows in the words of the paper.
   General Deductions from the examination              of Alabama Cotton-soil.
    In order to draw any useful conclusions from experiments such                   as
the above, upon a soil, the plant to be cultivated must be noticed, as
well   as some   of the   modes in which       it is affected by climate.
    A  few remarks upon the cotton plant and its climatal peculiarities
must therefore be made here in anticipation of a future part of the
paper.
    Annual cotton,     as  cultivated in America, is         a plant which attains
its principal growth in about four months, although it continues to
 develope seed and fibre for a much longer period.
    The   extent to which     its roots penetrate       the soil has been noticed
above, and from this some imperfect idea may be formed                  of the power
 which it possesses of drawing upon the earth for nourishment, although
no measure is thereby obtained,           I  think, of the capacity of the earth
to   yield nourishment*,      as  is shown by the experiments upon capilla
rity   and saline absorption.        Nor,   indeed,   do we even obtain any cer-
   * On the assumption of Liebig — that mineral food is taken
                                                                     up only by direct
contact with the roots — the surface exposed by the latter does become a measure
of the capacity of any particular soil to yield such nourishment.

tain knowledge of the power with which the plant takes up its food
from the soil, unless, by microscopic examination, and by experiments
such    as   those   of Hales,    some estimate be formed       of  the combined
effects  of capillary   and osmotic action in drawing up liquids         of various
composition.
    The    special   mineral food required by the cotton plant, and the
amount of this food, remain to be examined by analyses of the ash,
which will form another part of the investigation.              Some statements
with regard to the nature of the mineral constituents have been made,
drawn from the results of Dr. Jackson's analyses, and all these sub
stances needed       by the plant have been seen to exist in the soil.            As
to the extent to which they are withdrawn from the soil by cultivar
tion, it may be remarked generally that cotton is by no means an
exhausting crop under proper management.
    The    great   mass    of  the plant — root, stem,     branches, leaves, and
emptied     boles — remains      upon the field, and is ploughed into the soil,
which is enriched by the rapid decay of the organic matter.               Nothing
is removed except the fibre and seed, and             a large proportion, if not
the whole      of the latter, is by judicious        planters * returned to the
land  ;  cotton seed is in fact almost the only material used           as manure
in the cotton region of America            ;  a large amount is added        to the
soil by the ordinary mode of planting, the seed being thickly strewn
by handfulls in      a  continuous row, upon which,         after thinning, but     a
few plants are allowed to remain.            The cotton fibre, which constitutes
the saleable product, and is absolutely carried off from the land, must
be looked upon as a very           light crop   ; a bale   of 400 or 500 lbs.      to
the acre is sometimes         obtained under favourable circumstances, but
this is much above the average for upland cotton.                The fibre yields
 I or 1 J per cent. of ash, so that at       the most 1\ lbs. of mineral matter
per acre will be removed from the soil annually.
   According to Johnston (Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry, p . 2 1 C ),
a  crop of wheat of 25 bushels to the acre removes from the soil,
in the grain alone, about           1 7'65 lbs. of mineral matter     ; a  crop of
barley of 38 bushels carries off, in the grain, 46-98 lbs.            ; a  crop of
oats   of 50 bushels, in        the grain, 58-05 lbs.       According    to Liebig
   * The practice of selling cotton-seed from the plantation is one to be strongly
deprecated ; it is beginning to be common in some districts, owing to the increasing
manufacture of cotton-seed oil and exportation of the cotton seed-cake to Europe-.
                                                                2 c 2

(Letters on Modern Agriculture,                        p. 41), an average crop               of potatoes
removes from each acre about 1G3 lbs.                                of mineral matter;          and one
of   beet about 458 lbs. (leaves included).
     With     respect to climate, cotton needs a high summer temperature                                    ;
although not properly a tropical plant, it produces fibre in diminished
quantity, though of improved quality, when removed from                                      a   southern
locality to one further north                     ;   it   never seems to be directly injured
by the most intense midday heat                        ;   when other crops, including even
Indian corn,            are drooping under a blazing sun, the large                           succulent-
looking leaves of a cotton-field will but seem to enjoy the congenial
temperature.              As is    said by the writer                 of   a pamphlet published by
the Cotton Supply              Association — " cotton                   is decidedly a sun-plant."
     The proper supply of moisture is                        a       point of at least equal import
ance with temperature, and here appears undoubtedly to lie the main
difficulty hitherto            experienced            in attempts           to extend the culture          of
cotton into new regions.                     Published           statements      differ greatly as to
the effect of moisture or dryness upon the plant, some writers saying
that    a wet season is            ruinous to cotton and that drainage is of the first
importance          ;    while others, especially many of those treating of cul
tivation in India, iusist that irrigation is more necessary than anything
else.        Dr. Royle* well              says, "such* terms as moisture and dryness
are so entirely comparative, that in one country we hear the cotton
plant described             as one       requiring moisture, and in another we find it
stated that no plant requires so little                          ;   the fact being, that the plant
can bear both great heat and considerable want                                 of   water,   provided it
is growing in a not over-dry atmosphere."
     The last           sentence        states   an important              part of the truth, but,         I
think, not the whole                ;    it draws a distinction               between two forms in
which moisture may be supplied to the growing plant, whereas                                               it
would seem that four should be separately noticed.
      1°.    The atmosphere may contain a greater or less amount of water
in the       state of vapour, up to the point of so-called saturation.
       The atmosphere may
     2°.                                         be supersaturated, or in other words,

— such   water as is rapidly absorbed from the air by artificially dried
soil, and can afterwards be expelled only by the application of a high
temperature.                This   water does not render the soil moist to the touch.
It   can accumulate in a particular                          soil to a certain extent only, and
this limit may be called the point of saturation of the soil.
     4°.    The soil         may be supersaturated, that is to say,                       liquid   water,
evident to the senses                  as   such, may mix with the earth and render                     it,
in the common sense of the term, moist or wet.
     Now        it   would seem that the larger the relative amount of water in
the 1st and 3rd of these forms taken up                                    by   the cotton plant, and
the smaller the quantity received in the 2nd and 4th forms (at least
during the greater part of its period of growth), the more favourable
will   be the result.
     In water-soaked soil.                  i.   e.   holding water in the 4th condition men
tioned, cotton will not thrive.                            The following statements are borne
                                                                                           *
out        by   the general        experience              of planters. "The tap-root of the
cotton plant will not strike down into wet soil                                           On wet land
the cotton plant grows small, looks sickly, or scalds in the hot sun,
and bears but little raw cotton, and                          it   takes twice the labour to cul
tivate      it,   as the grass          usually grows the faster, and              is   much more dif
ficult to kill out."               Such soil will obviously be benefited by draining.
On the other hand,           of things demanding artificial irrigation
                                   the state
— very necessary probably in some parts of India — would seem to be
simply the absence of water in any one of the three other conditions
noticed.
     In    the early stages             of growth          the plant receives      a   moderate    supply
of rain,        i.    e.   water in the 2nd condition                      named, with      advantage   ;
but even then heavy rains are very injurious, and later in the season
they are absolutely destructive                        ;   the bolls do not open, but fall off, or
rot upon the               branches —       a     surface     growth of grass and weeds accu
mulates so rapidly                 as    to choke the crop — the boll worm and other
destructive insects make their appearance                            — and      the cotton from bolls
already open hangs out in trailing locks, draggled, dirty, and matted
together.  Dry years are emphatically those of the largest and best
crops.
     Yet, like all other plants, cotton must                         be supplied with moisture          ;

this even seems to      be needed     in considerable quantity, judging from
the extensive      leaf-surface from which           evaporation      is carried on.
Aqueous vapour in the air, as suggested by Dr. Royle, and abundant
hygroscopic moisture in the soil itself, as I would add, seem to be
decidedly the sources from which this requirement is to be met.
     The great   advantage    derivable from a soil of high capacity for ab
sorbing and retaining moisture will be, that it will enable the plant
 to withstand vicissitudes of weather and season                ; in damp weather
hygroscopic water will be condensed, to            be stored     up in the retentive
 soil until required in the midst of drought            ; in August or September,
 when seed and fibre are to be formed, and when therefore diminished
 leaf-activity is desirable, the roots will gradually draw up             a supply of
 this water, limited*,     but sufficient to maintain healthy life.
     These remarks no doubt apply also to the absorption of gases, and
of mineral matter withdrawn from solution,                as has been noticed in a
previous part of the paper.           The power of steadily accumulating and
 gradually dispersing seems        to be one of the well-marked and beau
 tiful provisions of the " economy of nature."
     The soil of the prairie region of central Alabama fulfils the              above
 conditions admirably, and to this fact should,              I  believe, be in large
 measure    attributed the success with which cotton is cultivated upon it.
     To  sum up the results      of the examination of this fertile cotton        soil,
it   is shown to be a   stiff aluminous clay, containing moderate amounts
of organic matter and of the mineral substances needed by the plant
as food — of great uniformity,           and iu an exceedingly fine state of
 division — above all, possessing a very high capacity for absorbing and
retaining heat, moisture, gases, and soluble mineral matter.

power ; it is penetrated   by sandy strata, through which water can readily flow,
and hence it is not at all inconceivable  that supplies of moisture may even through
this be drawn up from the depth of 20 or 30 feet, at which the first
                                                                          sandy bed is

ment of the way in which this soil is usually cultivated, which may
easily be done in a few paragraphs.
   As early in the winter as the weather is favourable and the con
dition of the ground suitable, i. e. when not too wet*, the preparation
for the crop commences             by "bedding"            the land.           This is     done by
running a narrow plough called             a
                                               " bull-tongue"            at regular intervals
across the field, the common distance                   being four feet between                the
rows.         In very rich alluvial land the           distance         is sometimes        five or
even six feet, and in thin poor land not more than three feet.                               Upon
the furrow thus produced the                      "               "
                                         ridge or          bed        is made by ploughing
to it on either side with a turning plough, called                       a
                                                                             " Carey "     plough,
drawn by two mules or horses, until the space between the rows has
been      ploughed out.           The whole field          is in this way thrown               into
ridges, which should run horizontally                   round any elevated portions
of the plantation, so that heavy rains may not wash away the soil.
   When the time for planting arrives — about the beginning of April —
a furrow is run along the top of each ridge by a narrow plough, and
in this furrow         the cotton seed is pretty        thickly strewn by handfulls
as the labourer goes along the row.                   It   is then covered           with earth
by   a heavy      wooden    block, which       a   mule or horse draws along, so                 as
not only to cover up the seed, but to press the earth firmly upon it.
     If the    weather be favourable for the germination of the seed, it
 omes up in ten days or a fortnight,                 and soon afterwards the culti
vation commences by thinning out the cotton with hoes,                             so as   to leave
but a few stalks together at intervals of eight or ten inches, removing
also any grass or weeds which                  may have grown with the cotton.
The     space between the rows is at the same time ploughed to make
the earth light and mellow, and to destroy grass and weeds.                                  Great
skill    is shown by trained negroes           in the use of the plough and hoe, —
the former is often run within two inches of the cotton, and the latter
used to cut out a weed within an inch or even                          half an inch, without
in either       case   injuring   the cotton itself.         The        process      of working
the crop with plough and hoe is continued at                                 intervals of three
weeks, and at each time             of thus going          over       the field the cotton is
thinned out, until it is brought to a
                                                   " stand," that        is,   reduced to single

stalks 12 or 18 inches apart upon the rows.                       Early in July the plant
has usually acquired sufficient size to shade the ground and prevent
the further growth of grass, and the crop is then
                                                                           " laid by."        It   is
of the first importance that the land should have been kept perfectly
clear of weeds up to this time, and in a hot climate the task is often
a   difficult one.
     Simultaneously with the cultivation                   of cotton, the cultivation of
Indian corn,          sweet potatoes,        &c,   proceeds,     in order to furnish food
for the negroes of the plantation, for the mules or other draught
animals, and for a sufficient number of hogs to yield meat for the
labourers.
      In middle Alabama           the cotton plant usually commences                     flowering
early in June, and continues to bloom until frost kills                            it,   bolls con
tinuing therefore to form during several months.                            The    earliest   bolls
open,          in ordinary    years,        from the 10th to the 15th of August,
when the            " picking "   season commences.            This    lasts until the cotton
is    all gathered— until January or even February,                        if  a   full crop       be
 made.   The bolls continue gradually to open long after frost has
 prevented the formation of any more. In picking the cotton from
 the boll, surprising manual dexterity                is   shown      by   negroes accustomed
 to the task from early youth.
         The   seed cotton, as    it   is   collected into large baskets by the pickers,
 is      carried to the "gin-house" of the plantation, and                      "ginned;" and
    when enough of the clean fibre has accumulated,                        a   day or two     is   de
    voted      by a   part of the hands to pressing              it   with the large wooden
    "screw" into         bales ready for shipment           by   river to the sea-port.

tural earthquakes, through the stratified and highly convoluted, lami
nated, and shattered slate and quartz rocks            of the neighbourhood of
Holyhead, where the recurrent explosion of very large mines of gun
powder in the Government quarries (for the obtaining of rock for
construction of the Asylum            Harbour)    afforded a valuable opportu
nity in the production of the requisite impulses for generation of the
wave.
     The author had previously determined experimentally (at Killiney
 Bay, in Ireland) the transit velocity of such waves in wet sand, and
 in highly-shattered       and more solid granite      ; media presenting, pro
 bably, the extremes of slowness and of fastness of wave transit.                   It
 was     still desirable to determine this for rock, not only minutely
 crystalline, but also stratified, convoluted, and generally highly per
 plexed and heterogeneous          in internal structure.       The instrumental
 means employed were generally similar to those               adopted previously
 at    Killiney Bay, with suitable modifications consequent upon the
  great charges of powder fired, which at these quarries have reached
  as much as nine tons at a single blast or mine.                The seismoscope
  (see Trans      Brit. Assoc.    1851,   Second Report on Facts of Earth
  quakes,      R. Mallet, p. 277, &c.)       was placed upon a levelled table
  of solid rock      at a suitable station (shown on the map          and sections
  that accompany the paper), and with it the chronograph                    and    gal
  vanic apparatus,        by which,     on making     contact,    by the author's
   pressing his hand upon the lever of the latter instrument, the mine
  at the quarry, distant in all cases about a mile, was ignited, and the
   time that elapsed between the starting of the elastic wave from the
   impulse of the explosion to its arrival at the observer and visibility
   in the field of the seismoscope        was recorded.      This   registered    time
   was subject to three principal corrections, the respective             coefficients
   of which     are also determined experimentally.           The instruments       ad
   mitted of time determinations to within nearly              j-Jw    of  a second.
   The    range over which      the wave traversed    was accurately obtained in
    length for each separate experiment.           A constant    distance   from the
    observing station      = 4584*80      feet, up to    a  fixed point near        the
    quarries, was obtained with precision,       in the first instance, by trigo
    nometrical operations, upon a          measured base of 1432 feet.             The
    distance   of  the mean centre   of  each mine or heading was subsequently
    measured     in  a right line to this fixed point, and the angle made by

                                                   354
the latter with the former line determined, whence the direct distance
between      the mean centre             of    each      particular
                                                                            " heading,"          or mine,
and the observer's station, was trigonometrically deduced.
   The following table               gives    part of the results obtained from six
 good experiments.

   One very remarkable result is at once apparent on inspecting this
table  — viz. that       the transit rate tends               to increase in velocity with the
increased     quantity of powder fired                 ;  in other words, that the loss of
velocity in the same rock is less in some proportion                                 as     the    force of
the originating        impulse is greater, and so its amplitude greater at
starting.       This     is seen      if the experiments be arranged in the order
of  increased     weight of powder.

    Experiment         No.     1   forms the only apparent exception, and even
there the departure is not large.
    This    fact,   now for the first time (so far                   as   the author knows) ex
perimentally        proved, appears              remarkably in coincidence with the
theoretical researches of Mr. Earnshaw.
   The general         mean       transit velocity derivable from all the experi
ments      taken together gives              1176-407 feet per second                     for the rate.
The results, however, obviously form two groups — viz. Nos.                                         1, 2, 3
 and   6  from the smaller, and Nos. 4 and 5 from the greater charges
of powder.         The     mean        from the first four is                 1 088*5597          feet per
second; that from the two last                        1352-1015 feet per second;                         and

                                    355
taking    a mean   of  means   from both, we obtain    1 220*3306    feet per
second as the mean transit velocity of propagation, in the rocks expe
rimented on, of wave pulses due to the impulse of explosions of
not exceeding     12,000 lbs. of powder.
    The first mean from the smallest charges is that which must be
compared with the Killiney Bay experiments.           It  thus appears that
the wave velocity in    highly contorted   and foliated rock is very low,
and is intermediate between the transit rate in wet sand and in dis
continuous granite, or
    In wet sand = 824*915 feet per second.
    In contorted and stratified rock, quartz, and        slate  =  1 088*559
feet per second.
    In discontinuous granite = 1306*425 feet per second.
    In more solid granite = 1664-574 feet per second.
    The   general  mean   obtained, 1220*33   feet per second, or 13*877
statute miles   English per minute, co-ordinates, as might be expected,
with the    carefully made deductions of Noggerath and of Schmidt
from the actual earthquakes of the Rhine and of Hungary, as well
as with    those   of the author from the great Naples earthquake of
 1857.
    In experimenting with     these great explosions the author was en
abled    to observe, by means of the seismoscope,      that the advent of
the great wave of impulse (which      was sometimes      sufficient to make
the mercury sway visibly in the trough       of  the instrument) was pre
ceded by rapidly      augmenting tremors, quite like those        which very
generally precede the great shock in natural earthquakes.
    The   wave transit in these experiments     was made     partly in slate
rocks and partly in quartz formations, which, though lithologically
and    geologically distinct, are nearly identical in wave propagative
 power (as this author has shown by a train of special experiments
 at the conclusion    of the paper), differing not  more than in the ratio
 of  0*576 for the slate to 0*558 for the quartz.    The author concludes
 by pointing out several deductions having interest to general physics,
 and some of the special relations of the results to Seismology and
 Physical Geology.

     Procure        a 60-element           Pulvermacher's       bath battery, excite it with
ordinary vinegar, and hang it up free in the air by a piece of cord.
Attach conducting wires to                    the terminal hooks, and to the wire from
the copper or positive pole connect                       a moistened       sponge-conductor,
which tie round the neck, so that the sponge may rest upon the skin
over     the middle cervical vertebra.                    To    the wire, from the zinc or
negative      pole, attach        a   conductor of smooth metal.
     Upon placing the metal conductor upon the skin of the arm or
back of the hand the burning sensation                           is unbearable for a single
moment.
   Upon placing it upon any portion of the skin of the palm, or under
surface of the fingers, no pain is experienced, nothing but the touch
of the conductor.
     There     is,   however,         a    line running   down the side of each finger
nearer      the back than the palmar surface,                       where   painful sensation
commences.            This line        is   also to be traced round, between the thumb
and    first finger, along the back surface of the thumb and the limit
between the skin         of the palm and             the wrist.      This line   can be easily
detected       by   the eye   ;                          of the palm being in
                                  the smooth papillary skin
sensible,     whereas     the hairy, polygonally reticulated skin of the back

     The skin on the back of                  the first phalanges    is   insensible, and also
a   part of the way down the second, varying in different persons.                            If

held there with gentle pressure for                       a   minute or two, the idea con

being thrust through the palm, until the pain becomes                            unbearable   ;
but there     is   no sensation of burning, pricking, or stinging.                  The   same
laws are discovered           to hold good in respect to the foot.

        Thomas's Hospital.           Communicated by            John Simon, Esq.
        Received     June 18, 1861.
                                     (Abstract.)
   This paper, itself       a summary    of   a   long series of observations, may
be briefly abstracted as follows        :—
  The peculiar dimorphous structure possessed by the tubes of                          the
cardiac and middle parts of the stomach in the Dog, exists in                          the
whole Vertebrate class ; about sixty species of which are cited by the
author from his notes.
   Many of       the variations    of the stomach throughout the Vertebrate
class are essentially oesophageal           developments, having         a    mechanical
office.
   The     more essential contrasts    of   the vertebrate      stomach refer to the
above dimorphous structure ;          which diminishing, even in Man, to less
than twice its thickness in passing from the cardia to the pylorus,
is in most animals altogether deficient here, either with or without
a great    shortening of the columnar-celled tubes.
  The dimorphous cell-growth is always the source and exponent of
the pepsinous or digestive power of the stomach on protein-com
pounds     ;   which power is absent where this structure is deficient, and
present (as tested by careful comparison) in the degree in which the
mucous membrane contains the dimorphous cell-growth.
   Of     those alternatives respecting the gastric juice suggested                 by va
rious experiments — namely ( 1 ) the              secretion    of   pepsine    by the di
morphous cell-growth, and acid by the columnar        or (2) the per;
fecting of the secretion (itself perhaps owing these two constituents
to its two kinds of cell respectively) in the open ends only of these
tubes   — the latter    is,   on the whole, preferable.
   The protection of the stomach from its                own    secretion     is   effected
mainly by the salivary and other secretions               which enter        it   from the
oesophagus       and duodenum.
   The living stomach          decomposes     a   neutral or alkaline blood so           as
to set free an acid     ;     but though transfused blood undergoes                this de

                                                   358
 composition,           a saline   solution not only fails to evoke                   it,   but injures
or destroys the gastric powers.
     There        is     of any exhaustion of the pepsinous consti
                       no evidence
tuents of the gastric mucous membrane at any period of digestion.
   As regards other variations of power, age seems to exercise but                                        a
 moderate         influence on the gastric mucous membrane                        ;   species, again,
has       a   subordinate effect       ;   genus   is   much more influential.               For units
of mucous membrane, Fishes                    seem to have the most powerful gastric
digestion.
      The influences of                temperature, analogous in all animals, van-
exceedingly            as   regards the absolute heats which respectively favour,
accelerate,         and destroy the powers              of the   stomach      ;   so that the same
heat which             is   practically necessary for the function of this organ in
a    warm-blooded Mammal, annihilates the efficacy of the pepsine of
many Fishes.
     The action of the gastric juice                is   a   transfer, to albumen, &c., of                a
molecular change going on in the gastric juice                              ;   pepsine      and    pep
tone being essentially analogous to each other                          in    properties.
     The formation of peptone          hydration of albumen,
                                              is
                                              a                                              as shown
 by   various collateral circumstances of the process.
                                             Addenda.
     1.   The pancreatic juice, or pancreatic infusion, which                                 converts
albumen into            a   substance akin to peptone,           and   in   proportions not very
unlike those which would be obtainable by using certain parts of the
mucous membrane of the stomach of some animals, and which does
this by       a   process so far sui generis, as that            it    is   no way shared          by   the
salivary organs most               analogous to itself in structure and function,
is   yet distinguishable from the gastric juice in regard to the process
and the product              of this   change.      The change          is,   indeed,   an incident
of putrefaction only,           and therefore not         a   function of the healthy living
organ.
     2.   The intestinal juice, or           the secretion       of    the intestinal tubes,             is
neither capable of converting albumen, &c. into peptone, nor of con
verting starch into sugar. The offices of these tubes are therefore,
probably, chiefly of absorption and of excretion.

cessarily exposed in the course          of my anatomical investigations, I

a few months, a complete memoir                          on   the same subject, with the
necessary       illustrations.
   In my memoir of the " Medulla Oblongata," it                             is shown that the
post-pyramidal ganglion, or grey substance  of the posterior pyramid,
is developed from the posterior grey substance on each side of the
posterior median fissure.  At the point of the calamus scriptorius,
it is intimately        connected        with the pyriform            nucleus of the vagus
nerve, each receiving a process from the other.                         Between these two,
and apparently developed                  from the substance            of both, which        are
intimately blended with            it,   there arises     a   convex and somewhat trian
gular mass, which becomes                     the principal      nucleus of the auditory
nerve.     In    a    transverse       section
                                                   it
                                                   is     triangular,       one   of its   angles
projecting forwards into the root of the caput cornu posterioris, or
expanded extremity of the posterior horn.                         It   is   interspersed with
numerous large nerve-cells, which are round,                           oval, triangular,       or
otherwise irregular, and of considerable size, the largest measuring
the 800th of an inch in diameter.                      Another portion of the auditory
nucleus    is   in contact with the outer side of that just described, and
with the inner side of the restiform body.                       It   consists    of the outer
part of the posterior pyramid in the form of                      a    remarkable network,
enclosing in its meshes longitudinal                     fasciculi, and containing large
nerve-cells with branched and                      exceedingly long processes,             which
contribute to form the network.                     From both     these parts       of the nu
cleus the posterior division             of   the auditory nerve takes its origin, and
winds outward as          a    broad convex band over the restiform body.                      In
this course     it   contains, at first,       a   few small cells, elongated in the di
rection of its fibres      ;   but as      it   proceeds,     its cells become gradually
larger and more numerous, until at the anterior border of the resti
form body    enlarges into
                it          pyriform ganglion, which
                                         a                 crowded                  is

                                        360
 with nerve-cells      similar in appearance   to those of the inner nucleus.
 The     nerve   is also reinforced by fibres radiating from the centre of
 the restiform body as it winds round the latter.             The anterior divi
 sion    of the auditory     nerve  consists of two portions : the principal
portion      penetrates    the medulla    beneath    the restiform body, and,
 running along the outer side of the caput cornu, enters               both parts
 of   the   auditory nucleus     ; the other   portion   runs backward along
 the npper border of the restiform body, which it accompanies                 over
 the superior peduncle to the inferior vermiform process of the cerebel
 lum.      The outer portion of the auditory nucleus, consisting of            the
 posterior pyramid and its vesicular network, is also ultimately thrown
 backward into the cerebellum, part of it arching over the fourth ven
 tricle to the opposite side, while the rest extend outward to the corpus
 dentatum.        The corpus dentatum     is grasped, as it were, by an expan
sion of the restiform body, which bends backward after entering the
 cerebellum.
    It   would be useless in this place to attempt an intelligible descrip
 tion of the complicated course of the fibres in the human pons Varolii           ;
 but    I may observe, that at its lower portion         T  find  a  structure in
 every sense homologous with that which in Mammalia is called the
 trapezium.        It is not, however, situated below, but within the pons,
 of which it forms the most posterior of         the transverse   fibres.   These
transverse     or arciforin fibres proceed out of the restiform bodies and
auditory ganglia, and sweep round the extremity of the caput cornu
to the back of the anterior pyramids to decussate             across   the raphe.
 As they pass the ganglion, or auditory nerve, they receive fibres from
 it. On each side, where, in animals, it forms a rounded projection,
it contains a very peculiar vesicular nucleus, which has a convoluted
appearance       and structure, resembling another olivary body.            These
nuclei, which were first pointed out by myself in 1857 (Proceedings
of Royal Society), and subsequently by Prof. Schroder V. der Kolk,
first make      their appearance      much lower down in the medulla, at
the point where the other olivary bodies begin to diminish,                as two
cylindrical     columns of large nerve-cells     with bundles of longitudinal
fibres.     On reaching the trapezium, the cells become much smaller,
and are arranged in convoluted laminae.             They  are larger in animals
than in Man, and are particularly developed             in the Cat.      Through
the    trapezium the facial nerve        passes   transversely backward       and

                                        361
inward beneath the root of the trifacial nerve and the caput cornu,
to a group of large multipolar         cells, which lies near the surface of
the fourth ventricle, on each side of the median furrow, and which
gives origin also to the sixth nerve.
    The   transverse  fibres of the pons Varolii are an extension of the
arcifonn     fibres of the medulla oblongata.           The grey     substance   of
the pons is Arranged in a peculiar manner.              Its cells   are generally
round, oval, and fusiform, of about the            1500th of an inch in dia
meter, and are so connected with nerve- fibres, in chains or bundles,
as to form a complete network.         The principal chains of this network
have, in general, a longitudinal extension, and follow the course of
the longitudinal fasciculi of the anterior pyramids, from the sides of
which they send off processes across the transverse bundles, in which,
 as well as around the longitudinal        bundles of the pyramids, the cells
are at intervals collected    into groups of variable size and shape.
    The trifacial or fifth     nerve   originates from a somewhat           conical
eminence     of grey substance,    which is situate immediately behind the
 fossa where the anterior fibres      of the pons   Varolii   meet the point     of
 the fillet, at the upper edge of the middle peduncle of the cerebellum.
This grey      mass consists  of three distinct nuclei in       close apposition.
Its outer portion is     the caput cornu posterioris, or dilated extremity
of  the posterior cornu, and is composed          of  several groups      of small
 round and oval cells, of about the 1500th of an inch in diameter, to
 gether with      numerous longitudinal       bundles of nerve-fibres.         The
 posterior portion of the grey       mass overlies,   and is continuous with,
the root of the caput cornu.         It is the upward extension       of the inner
nucleus of the auditory nerve, and contains many cells of a larger
 kind.     The inner  side  of  the mass consists    of  an oval group     of large
 multipolar cells of the same shape and size         as   those   of the anterior
 cornu of the medulla spinalis.          The large root of the fifth nerve
 may be divided into three parts, two of which originate in the conical
 mass just described ; of these two, the larger arises from the caput
 cornu posterioris, while the fibres of the smaller may be traced back
 ward to the continuation         of the auditory     ganglion, which overlies
 the cornu. These latter are probably the fibres which go to form
 the gustatory branch of the fifth nerve         ;  for it was formerly shown
 that   the commencement          or lowest part of the        auditory    ganglion
 was the principal origin of the glosso-pharyngcal nerve.                The third
     vol. Xi.                                                      2 d

                                       362
division of the large root of the fifth descends towards the medulla,
not, as has been believed, in the restiform body, but, as              I  formerly
showed,    in the very substance        of  the caput     cornu posterioris, of
which it constitutes many of the longitudinal bundles.
    The small, or motor root of        the fifth   arises from the same emi
nence by three or four parallel bundles, a little anterior to the larger
root, being separated from it only by a small process               of the middle
peduncle coming from the upper portion of the pons Varolii.                      Its
bundles pass obliquely to the inner side of the caput cornu, and
spread out their fibres through         the oval group      of large    multipolar
cells already mentioned.         Some   of the fibres of the fifth       nerve de
cussate with those     of the opposite side through the raphe.
     Some of the fibres which form the point of the fillet,              as well as
others coming from the anterior border of the pons Varolii, are con
 nected with the grey eminence        of  the fifth nerve.
     In tracing the caput cornu towards the brain, it            is found to ex
 tend obliquely outwards from the angle in the floor of the fourth
 ventricle, beneath the superior peduncle : the deep portion of the
 superior peduncle, before it reaches the corpora quadrigemina, passes
 from the side of the fillet transversely       inwards in front of the caput
 cornu to the middle line, where it decussates with the corresponding
 part of the opposite side.       Part of the grey substance         of  the caput
 cornu becomes imbedded in the fibres of the fillet, and ascends with
 them   ; while the rest extends more and more backward along the under
  part of the superior peduncle, until it arrives at its inner border at
 the side of the valve of Vieussens.          Across the thin posterior edge
  of the superior peduncle it     sends numerous grey processes outwards,
  to meet similar processes from the grey substance            in the fillet   ;   so
  that the longitudinal fibres of this part of the peduncle are formed
  into small bundles by      a  network of grey substance         ;  the testis, or
  posterior portion of    the corpora quadrigemina,          on each side, rests
  upon this structure   :  it is continuous with, and apparently developed
  from it.
      While   these  changes    are in progress,    the nucleus of the motor
  root of the fifth nerve gradually disappears,            and is replaced by a
  group of cells deeply coloured with pigment, and constituting what
  is known    as  the substantia   ferruginea     ; at  the same time the grey
   substance   which forms the floor of the fourth ventricle on each side

                                                      303
of the median furrow                increases       gradually in depth, and includes the
substantia ferruginea.                   It   is developed          in the tract which is con
tinuous with the nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve, of which it is the
analogue.           Anteriorly, on each side of the raphe, there is gradually
developed          within it a considerable group of large multipolar cells,
which becomes               the nucleus           of the third cerebral           nerve.         At its
outer and back part it adjoins the tract which forms the side wall of
the ventricle, is continuous with                          the auditory nucleus, and lies at
the base       of   the caput cornu posterioris.                    This latter tract,        on reach
ing the corpora quadrigemina,                             becomes   continuous with its fellow
of   the opposite side to form the                    roof of the iter      a tertio ad quartum
ventriculum.              Here it becomes gradually broader and more trans
parent,       and, in the form               of an arched lamina, supports                 the   lateral
lobes        of the corpora quadrigemina, with which,                         at its border,              it is
intimately blended, and which communicate over it by a transverse
band     of fibres.         It     contains a multitude              of small cells of various
shape        and    size,   and is interlaced in every                    direction by very fine
nerve-fibres        ;    but of the latter there are two regular sets, which run
longitudinally           and transversely, and which increase in number from
behind forwards,             so    that they are much more numerous beneath the
nates    ;    the transverse            fibres radiate in straight            lines towards the
surface through the lobes                    of   the corpora quadrigemina.
     Structure          of the Corpora Quadrigemina. — The lateral                        lobe   of   each
testis is an oval or almond-shaped mass, which rests on the convexity
of   the transparent arch                just described.            It   contains a considerable
number of small and uniformly scattered cells of various shapes, and
of   an average           size    of about        the      2400th of an inch, together with
oblique, transverse,               and longitudinal            nerve-fibres   ;   the longitudinal
fibres form         a   denser layer at its inner and still more at its outer side.
The     transverse        fibres       form two sets, one extending over the arched
lamina to the opposite lobe, and derived chiefly from the fillet                                      ;   the
other radiating, as already stated, from the substance                                of this lamina
beneath,       towards the surface,                 and becoming continuous, at least in
part, with the first set,               as   well   as    with the longitudinal.
     The structure of             the nates         is,   in general,     similar to that of the
testes   :    their cells are nearly of the same nature, but smaller                             ;    their
lobes    are shallower, but longer                   ;     and the arched transparent lamina
on   which they           rest    is   broader and more transparent. Both the trans
                                                                                  2   d   2

verse and longitudinal            fibres are much more numerous. Those which
extend    transversely from side to side decussate                  in the middle line,
 and, through the under              half of the    lobes, form a dense layer       of sepa*
rate bundles      ;   between       these bundles, and at        right  angles    to them,
the other set of transverse             fibres radiate from the arched transparent
substance      beneath,       and     after penetrating       to various     depths, turn
round to become continuous partly with them and partly with the
longitudinal fibres which run chiefly along the superficial half of the
lobes.     The      same     system      of latero-transverse bundles        is continued
in front of      the nates        to form the posterior commissure.                 A  large
proportion      of    the optic nerve           is connected     with the nates.        The
optic tract, on reaching the back of the thalamus opticus, divides into
two parts     :  one      of   these,    after bending suddenly downwards and
somewhat inwards, enters the corresponding lobe of the nates, spread
ing amongst its cells, and forming its longitudinal                     as  well   as  some
of its  transverse       fibres   ;  the other division       of the optic tract winds
inwards and somewhat backwards over the thalamus, which it enters,
diverging, between            streaks     of longitudinal      fasciculi, in a series of
separate    bundles, which, in their turn, diverge and distribute                      their
fibres in every direction amongst a dense collection of cells.                          The
cells are various in size and shape                  ;  a considerable proportion         are
round, oval, or fusiform in the direction of the bundles which                          first
enter.     Some      of   the fibres     of   the optic tract are connected       with the
corpus geniculatum internum, which is crowded with cells of a me
dium or rather small size, and for the most part round or oval.
   Structure      of    the   Pineal Gland. — The structure             and relations      of
this body are of great interest, and deserve close attention.                          It   is
attached by its base to the posterior commissure.                     The   arched trans
parent lamina which forms the roof of the canal, or iter, beneath the
corpora qundrigemina, decreases in thickness or depth                    as it approaches
the anterior extremity of the canal,                   beyond   which it is reduced        to
the   epithelial      layer      which      lined it.     This epithelium       is now re
flected round the front           of  the posterior commissure, and from thence
under the base of the pineal gland.                    When carefully examined,         it is
found, along its border, to be composed of narrow fusiform cells, in
termixed with round and oval granular nuclei, of which the average
diameter     is about the           2800th of an inch.           From     both    kinds of
these   cells   or nuclei fibres proceed and cross each other in every

                                                        3G5
direction        ; so   that they form a considerable layer around the commis
sure, through which, by numerous fissures,                                      they radiate to its oppo
site surface.            This fibrous             and   inner layer is crowded with round
and oval nuclei like those found at the border.                                       Now when the epi
thelium is followed to the pineal gland, the substance of the latter is
seen to be composed                     of   elements       which resemble              it    so closely, and
are so uninterruptedly continuous with                                it,   that one can scarcely ques
tion the probability that the two kinds                                of structures          are only slight
modifications              of    each        The pineal gland consists of fibres,
                                         other.
nuclei, and the               well-known brain-sand. The fibres are arranged in
two ways         ;    throughout the gland they form, by peculiar subdivisions
and communications, an intricate                             network, in which the nuclei are
lodged.           Some          of them      are exceedingly fine,                  others rather coarse,
but bear no resemblance                      to what we are accustomed                         to call nerve-
fibres. They are frequently crooked, and apparently jointed or dilated
at intervals, where they give off branches which bear nuclei                                         ;   in other
places the nuclei are surrounded by flat riband-like fibres. Here and
there the fibres of the network go off to form straight bundles, which
unite into larger trunks, and have chiefly                                 a   transverse    direction.      The
reticular structure bears                    a   decided resemblance                 to the epithelium         of
the olfactory mucous membrane,                              and still more to what             I     have   else

 size, but are generally    small    ;  the diameter of the largest of the
spherical kind being about the 2000th of an inch.                 The two bodies
are united across the middle line by a transverse            commissure of fibres

    The author has concluded his experiments upon this subject ; and,
in addition to the details of the results which have already been
briefly mentioned in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society'*, com
municates the following     : —
    Although   the rate  of burning of          candles  and other similar com
bustibles, whose flames       depend     upon the volatilization and ignition
of combustible matter in contact with atmospheric air, is not per
ceptibly affected by the pressure of the supporting medium, yet this
is not true of all combustibles.          The rate of burning of self-support
ing combustibles, like the        time-fuses of shells, depends essentially
upon the pressure of the medium in which they are deflagrated.
Attention was first called to this fact by Quartermaster               Mitchellf ,
who found that the fuses of shells burnt longer at elevated stations
than when ignited near the level of the sea.                  The results of   the

    There are here evident indications of the rate of retardation being
somewhat greater at low than at comparatively high pressures                            ;  but,
neglecting these indications, the above numbers give 1-043 second
as the average        retardation in        a   six-inch or thirty-seconds fuse for
each inch     of mercurial      pressure     removed.       This result     agrees closely
with that obtained by Quartermaster Mitchell, if                        we except         those
fuses which he burnt at the greatest                   altitude     ; and in reference       to
which     some     error must obviously have                crept in.      The following
table shows       Mr. Mitchell's results uniformly with                  those in the last
table.     The   fuses which        he employed were fifteen-seconds                 or three-
inch ones, and their times of combustion have therefore been multi
plied by two in order to bring them into comparison with the six-
inch fuses which were used in the author's experiments : —

    Here, omitting the last determination as abnormal, we have the
average retardation, in the combustion of a six-inch fuse, for each

                                             368
diminution       of one-inch mercurial            pressure,    equal   to  1 -007   second,
which coincides almost exactly with the number (1*043) deduced
from the author's experiments.
    The results of both           scries  of observations may therefore be em
bodied in the following law:              —  The increments in time are propor
tional to the decrements in pressure.                      For all practical purposes
the following rule may be adopted : — Each diminution of one inch of
barometrical pressure causes a retardation                   of one  second in a     thirty-
seconds    fuse ; or,      each diminution         of atmospheric pressure to the
extent    of   one   mercurial inch increases the time of burning by one-
thirtieth.
    This retardation in the burning of time-fuses by the reduction of
atmospheric pressure will probably merit the attention of artillery
officers.     Up to     the present     moment these fuses have been carefully
prepared so       as   to burn, at Woolwich,           a  certain number of seconds          ;
but such time of combustion at the sea-level is no longer maintained
when the fuses are used in more elevated localities.                      Even the ordi
nary fluctuations of the barometer in our latitude must render the
time   of the combustion of            these fuses liable to a variation          of about
ten per cent.         Thus     a fuse driven to burn          thirty  seconds when the
barometer stands at         31  inches, would burn thirty-three seconds                if the
barometer fell to 28 inches.                Even      the height      to which      a   shell
attains in its flight         must exert       an appreciable influence upon the
burning of its time-fuse          ;  to a still greater extent, however, must the
time of combustion          be affected by the position          of the  fuse during the
flight of the shell.        If it   precede the shell, the time of burning must
obviously be considerably shorter than                   if it follow in the compara
tively vacuous space behind the shell.
    The apparently opposite conclusions to which we are led as
regards the influence of atmospheric pressure upon the rate of com
bustion, by the experiments upon candles on the one hand and upon
time-fuses on the other, are by no means irreconcileable                      ; in fact, an
examination        into the conditions of combustion in the two cases
scarcely    leaves room for the expectation               of any other result.        In the
combustion of         a candle,      the author proves          that, at all pressures,
there is    a  sufficient supply of melted combustible matter kept up at
the base      of the    exposed      portion of the wick         : the capillarity of the
latter is not affected         by pressure      ;  and    as  the temperature of the

                                          369
flame is also      proved to remain practically           constant, effecting the
evaporation of the same amount of combustible matter under all
pressures,    it follows that the      rate of consumption of a candle must
be nearly or quite independent of the pressure of the surrounding
medium.        In the deflagration of time-fuses, the conditions are obvi
ously very different.         Here the- combustible matter never comes into
contact with atmospheric oxygen until it has been ejected from the
 fuse-case.    Unlike the      candle,  the composition contains within itself
 the oxygen necessary for combustion, and a certain degree of heat
 only is necessary to bring about chemical combination.                 If this  heat
 were applied simultaneously to every part              of the   fuse composition,
 the whole would burn almost instantaneously.                  Under ordinary cir
 cumstances,     however, the fuse burns only at           a disk perpendicular to
 its axis ; and   the time occupied in its deflagration necessarily depends
 upon the rapidity with which each successive layer of composition is
 heated    to the temperature at which              chemical combination        takes
 place.     This    heat,  necessary     to deflagration, is evidently       derived
  from the products of the combustion of the immediately preceding
  layer of composition      ; and the amount      of  heat thus communicated to
  the   next unburnt layer must depend,            in great measure,       upon the
  number of particles of these heated            products which come into con
  tact with   that layer.       Now,   as a large proportion of these products
  are gaseous,   it follows that,   if the pressure   of the surrounding medium
  be reduced, the number          of ignited    gaseous     particles in contact at
  any one moment with the still-unignited            disk of composition will also
  be diminished.        Hence the slower rate of deflagration in rarefied air.
      With regard     to the effect  of atmospheric     pressure   upon the light of
  gas-flames,   the author thus expresses          the conclusion arrived at       : —
   Of  100 units    of light emitted by a gas flame burning in air at a
 pressure of 30 inches of mercury, 5'1 units are extinguished by each
   reduction of one mercurial inch of atmospheric pressure.               Hence the
   decrease   in illuminating power is directly proportional              to the de
   crease in atmospheric pressure.
      This law is    also proved to apply to gas, the illuminating          power of
   which has been doubled by naphthalization            ; and consequently     it may
   be regarded as applying to all flames in which             hydrocarbons are the
   source  of light.
      The investigation       has also been     extended     to the effect   of com

                                         370
 pressed  atmospheres      upon the light of comhustion.               Great diffi
 culties were experienced in this branch of the inquiry,              as gas   could
 not be used, and recourse must therefore be had to other combus
tibles, which, as already pointed out, are liable to certain irregularities.
 Owing   to  these  and other difficulties,         satisfactory determinations
 could only be made between            one and two atmospheres.             In these
 determinations, the lamp which replaced the experimental gas flame
was supplied with amylic alcohol — a liquid which, whilst                 affording
an appreciable amount       of light under one-atmosphere           pressure,     was
found to burn under two atmospheres without smoke, although at
a  somewhat higher      pressure it began to evolve unconsumed carbon.
The results obtained approximate closely to              those indicated by the
above law, deduced      from the corresponding           determinations in rare
fied atmospheres,    as will   be seen from the following        table, in which,
the mean of eleven observations is given under each experiment                  ;  the
column headed      " calculated " containing the numbers            deduced from

    Further determinations, in which the illuminating power               at three-
and four-atmospheres pressure was compared, yielded results differ
ing widely from this law, and indicating a much more rapid increase
of light; but as the liability to errors increases greatly at these
higher pressures, little confidence is placed in the numbers.                     The
lamp was fed with     a  mixture of five parts of vinic alcohol and one
part of amylic alcohol       ;  it had    no appreciable illuminating          effect
under ordinary atmospheric pressure          :—

     In  tracing the cause of this variation of light under different
atmospheric         pressures,  the author calls        attention to the conditions
upon which the light of ordinary flames depends.                     He shows that it
is derived almost exclusively from the separation of carbou particles
within the      flame, and that it is increased       by the augmentation of the
amount of carbon thus precipitated, and by an increased temperature
in the    flame   ;  whilst it is diminished by the separation            of   less carbon
and by a reduction of temperature. The temperature of flame is
not materially altered by the rarefaction of the'supporting medium ;
and hence the loss of light cannot arise from                 a reduction of tempera
ture.      On the other hand, the separation of carbon                         particles is
greatly augmented          by increased pressure      ;  thus candles evolve much
smoke when burnt under            a pressure  of two atmospheres            ;  whilst even
a small alcohol flame, which burns with             a   pure blue light at ordinary
pressures, becomes         highly luminous in air four             times      compressed.
 Flames which          smoke at ordinary      pressures         become     smokeless      in
 rarefied air, and undergo more complete combustion.                     Whilst,     there
 fore, the light of flames is due to the separation                of carbon particles,
 the latter owe their momentary existence to the                  absence of sufficient
 oxygen      for their combustion       ;  consequently any influence which
 causes the more rapid interpenetration          of the     flame gases and exterior
 air, must reduce the amount of precipitated carbon, and consequently
 also the luminosity of the flame.              Rarefaction exercises             precisely
 such an influence by increasing,            as   it is well known to do, the
 mobility of the gaseous particles, and thus causing the access of a
 larger amount of oxygen to the region of the flame where precipitated
 carbon produces luminosity.
     An analysis of       the  gases evolved     from      a   candle   flame,     burning
 under    a  pressure of only eight mercurial inches, proved that                     there
 was perfect combustion even at this low pressure.
      In conclusion, the influence of atmospheric                  pressure      upon the
  phenomena of combustion may be thus summed up.
      1. The   rate   of burning of   candles and other similar combustibles,
 whose flames         depend    upon the volatilization         and ignition of com
  bustible matter in contact with atmospheric air, is not perceptibly
  affected by the pressure of the supporting medium.
      2. The   rate   of burning of self-supporting combustibles, like time
  fuses, depends upon the rapidity          of fusion of the combustible com

                                         372
position, which rapidity of fusion is diminished               hy the more rapid
removal     of the    heated   gases   from the surface     of the composition.
Hence the rate       of burning of combustibles of this        class depends upon
the pressure, of the medium in which they are consumed.                     In the
 case  of  time-fuses,   the increments in the time of burning are propor
tional to the decrements        in the pressure of the surrounding medium.
    3.   The luminosity of ordinary         flames   depends    upon the pressure
of the supporting medium;           and, between certain      limits, the decrease
in illuminating       power is directly       proportional   to   the decrease in
atmospheric pressure.
    4.  The variation in the illuminating power of flame by alterations
in the pressure of the supporting medium depends chiefly, if not en
tirely, upon the ready access of atmospheric oxygen to, or its com
parative exclusion from, the interior of the flame.
    5.   Down to a certain minimum limit, the more rarefied the atmo
sphere in which flame burns, the more complete is its combustion.

        Part   II.      By  J.  S. Bowernank, LL.D., F.R.S., F.L.S.,
        &c.     Received     June 17, 1861.
                                     (Abstract.)
   This paper       is a continuation      of the first division of    the subject
published in the Phil. Trans, for 1858.
    In the second part of this division the author treats             of the kera-
tode or horny substance         of the skeleton,    as regards both its physical
and chemical characters, with           a  view of establishing the animal na
ture of that substance.
   In the third part the membranous               tissues  are described under
two heads : —
    1st.  Simple membranous tissues analogous to those of the base
ment membranes         of the higher    classes  of animals  ;   and
   2nd. Compound          membranous tissues.          These structures consist
of  simple membranous tissue combined with primitive fibrous tissue.
Their most simple forms exist in the membranes lining the intersti
tial cavities of the sponge and in the dermal membrane.

                                              373
    In   the fourth part         the fibrous tissues      are described    as   consisting
of   three principal divisions.
     1st. Primitive fibrous tissue.              These structures are exceedingly
minute, and form an important                   element in the construction of the
compound membranous tissues of the animal.
    2nd division. The fibres of the skeleton are described under the
following       heads    : —
     1st. Solid simple keratose fibre.
     2nd. Spiculated keratose fibre, in which the keratode is                     the pri
mary element.
     3rd. Multispiculate          keratose   fibre  ; the   spicula being the primary
element, and         the keratode the secondary or cementing medium.
     4th. Inequi- spiculated          keratose     fibre.      Consisting    of  skeleton
 fibres constructed of numerous spicula irregularly                 dispersed,   but con
 gregated into a round or oval massive fibre.
     5th. Simple        fistulose  fibre.    A  keratose    fibre having   a  continuous
 simple central canal.
     6th. Compound fistulose fibre.                A   keratose  fibre with a continu
 ous central canal, from which secondary small canals branch at about
  right   angles to the primary one.
     7th.     Regular arenated keratose fibre.             Constructed of solid cylin
  drical    fibres,   in the centre of which there is a series of grains of
  sand or other extraneous           matters.
     8th. Irregular         arenated    keratose    fibre.    Consisting   of grains of
  sand or other extraneous            matters cemented together into a continu
  ous cylindrical fibre.
     In   the third division the siliceous fibrous tissues are described as
  solid cylindrical structures, similar in form to the solid keratose fibres
  of the second division, but consisting of pure silex in place of kera
  tode.
     The fifth part contains descriptions of the cellular structures.
     The sixth and last part of this division treats of the physical cha
  racters    of  the sarcode or semi-gelatinoid substance            lining the interior
  cavities    of  sponges.
                     Part II. — Organization           and Physiology.
     The author treats this portion of bis subject under the following
  heads   : —

                                            374
    1st.  The     skeleton.      Its   general  structure and component parts.
Under this head the physiological               purposes of the various forms of
spicula, treated of in the first part of the paper, are described,               and
their peculiar offices in the sponge pointed out.
    2nd. The sarcodous            system   is considered by the author as the
homologue of the mucous lining of the stomach and intestines of the
higher tribes of animals, and probably            as the equivalent of the nervous
system also.
    3rd- The interstitial         canals   are considered as the equivalents       of
the stomach and alimentary canals of the higher animals.
    4th. The intermarginal cavities, situated immediately beneath the
surface,    and    receiving the incurreut streams from the pores, are be
lieved by the author to be the organs for the secretion of the vital
fluids of the animal.
    5th. The dermal membrane,               enveloping the whole of the sponge,
and in which            the inhalant and cxhalant orifices of the animal are
situated.
    6th. The pores or inhalant orifices.               These organs are not per
manent     ;  i.  e.   they are opened and closed at the will of the animal,
and when once closed seldom occur again in precisely the same spot.
    7th. The oscula or excurrent orifices, usually permanent organs,
and capable       of being     opened or closed in accordance        with the neces
sities   of the animal.
    8th. Inhalation aud exhalation.              Two    modes   of  these operations
are described        ;   one as occasional or intermittent, but very powerful
for the imbibition of nutriment;             the other gentle aud continuous for
the purposes         of the aeration of the vital fluids,       and for the ejection
of  digested     matters.
    9th. Nutrition.          The   modes   of imbibition  and periods    of digestion
are treated       of, aud     the author describes     a series  of contrivances by
which some sponges             are in possession     of peculiar   organs which en
able them        to prey upon annelids or other soft creatures              that may
crawl over their surface or intrude within their cavities or canals.
     10th.   Cilia     aud ciliary   action.    The  accounts    of the cilia  of the
 gemmules        or ova,    as  described by Dr. Grant and other writers, are
referred to by the author            ;  and the same organs in situ in       Grantia
 cotnpreasa are pointed out as the powers on which inhalation and ex
 halation are dependent.

                                          375
     1 1th. Reproduction, gemmules,          &c. Under this head the ovaries,
ova,    and     gemmular modes of propagation, are described under five
heads : —
     1st.   Ova without an ovarium.
    2nd. Ova generated within ovaria.
    3rd. Gemmules secreted within the sponge.
    ,4th.    Gemmules produced externally.
     5th. By spontaneous division of the sarcode.
    The remaining portions of the paper, consisting of observations on
the generic characters, the specific characters, and on the mode
of   examination, will form the subject of        a  future communication.
 XVII.        " Further   Observations      upon the Nebula;, with practical
          details relating to the Construction of Large Telescopes."
          By the    Earl   of Rosse, F.R.S.         Received    June 5, 1861.
                                    (Abstract.)
     In this paper      the processes which were        found best to answer in
 casting specula of 6-feet aperture have been described at some length            ;
 and the precautions which were taken             to prevent accidents      during
 the progressive      stages of manufacture.
     Some      information,  which may perhaps be useful, has also been
 gathered from the memoranda             kept on each occasion when the spe
 cula were ground and polished          ;  and the results of   a long experience
 iu the different manipulations        have been    put together in a practical
 form,     so   as best to enable   the civil engineer     to uudertake the con
 struction of large telescopes      as a   matter of business.
      A  few hints have been given on figuring and repolishing large sur
  faces, which the astronomer may find useful should his services be
  required in distant countries.
      An attempt     has been made to define      the extreme      limits to which
  telescopic vision may be pushed in this country, in answer to the
  question whether instruments of greater             dimensions might not be
  advantageously constructed.
      The peculiarities in the mounting of the large telescope are slightly
   noticed,    and their advantages     and disadvantages      explained,   as they
   have been brought out by experience.
      This is followed by    a selection    from the observations made during

                                        376
 a period   of six  years, accompanied by drawings       of the more remark
 able objects.
    The principal results seem to be a large addition to the list of ne
 bulae  with curved or spiral branches, and many new double and
 multiple   nebulae.     A variety of objects    have   been also pointed out
 upon which the labour of a careful scrutiny will probably be amply
 repaid, with   a similar instrument, even in this climate.      A still larger
 number have been marked off, which to save time may be passed
 by, unless some new views on Cosmogony should suggest                sufficient
 motives   for reobserving them.         A record  has been made, which, to
 some extent,     will  be available hereafter for comparison        with    the
 heavens,   and   a few    cases of   suspected  change   have  been noticed,
 where the evidence, however, is by no means conclusive.

       of the Quadrumana, with            a Description of the Brain of        a
       Galago."       By William II. Flower, Esq., Demonstrator
       of Anatomy at the Middlesex Hospital.              Communicated        by
       Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.             Received  June 20, 1861.
                                   (Abstract.)
    After referring    to the present     state of our knowledge upon the
 subject, and especially to       the descriptions recently given of the
 " posterior   cornu    of the lateral ventricle "       and  " hippocampus
        " in the
 minor              Orang-Utang      by Dr. Rollcston, in the Chimpanzee
 by Mr. Marshall, and in Ateles by Mr. Huxley, and the statements
 of M. Gratiolet, that the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle or
 " cavite ancyrdide"      obtains an enormous development in Monkeys,
the author proceeds       to detail his own observations (which are illus
trated by drawings and photographic representations) upon the con
dition of these parts in the brains of animals belonging to the three
families of the order Quadrumana.
                          Family   1.   Catarrhina.
   Orang-Vtang (Pithecus satyrus). — An account is given of the
examination of the brain of a young female of this species, preserved            -
in the Middlesex       Hospital   Museum.       The posterior    lobes  of  the
cerebral hemispheres were so far developed            that they completely
covered the cerebellum, although not prolonged backwards to quite

                                               377
  so   great an extent as in the human brain.                   To  examine      the interior,
   the right hemisphere         was removed       to the level     of   the inferior surface
  of   the corpus callosum, and then                 further portions were carefully
  dissected away, so         as   to expose the lateral ventricle, with its three
  cornua      and   their contained structures.              It  is to be observed         that
  brains which       have    been long in spirit         are in some respects           not so
  well   adapted      for dissection      as  when in       a recent       condition, as the
  distinction     in appearance        between the white and              grey substance      is
  lost, and the contiguous walls of cavities, which in the natural                        state
 would have fallen apart, have now become hardened in such                                close
 contact, that their real nature may readily be overlooked.                            In this
 way only        can the     statements      of Tiedemann          as   to the    absence or
 rudimentary         condition      of  the   posterior       cornu     in the Simiae        be
 accounted for.          However, the brain of         this Orang is sufficiently well
 preserved to        show that its ventricular cavity presents                   almost the
 exact counterpart           of that in      the human subject.               The posterior
 cornu extends          quite   as   far backwards as in an                average   example
 in   man, its apex being but            § of  an inch              of   the entire length
 of the hemisphere) from the occipital extremity of                               the   hemi
 sphere    ;   and its direction well answers              to   the description " back
wards, outwards, and then inwards."                      Upon the inner wall of the
cavity is the hippocampus minor, which will bear comparison with
a very well- developed           specimen    of this structure         as met with in the
human brain, where, as is well known, it is subject to great variations
in   size    and   form.                       f
                              Its length is inch, its breadth at the base
inch.        The portion of the wall of the ventricle situated oppo
site the junction of the descending and posterior cornua (called
eminentia collateralis           or pes accessorius) corresponds in configura
tion and relative size to the similar part in the brain of man. The
hippocampus          major has no distinct digital marks                 ;  these are, how
ever, indicated by a nodulated appearance                    in the expanded termina
tion.     The remaining portion of               the    ventricle presented          nothing
requiring      special    remark.       In order    to verify these observations            by
an examination         of  the corresponding parts            of the opposite       side, the
upper part of the left hemisphere was also removed, and a very
good view obtained of the ventricle, with its posterior cornu,                         It was
precisely similar to that just described,                the two sides        exhibiting in
their internal structure a perfectly symmetrical appearance.
V0l. Xi.                                                                        2 E

                                          378
    Cercopithecus. — Four examples           of this   genus   which have      latelv
died at the Gardens of the Zoological Society were examined while in
a recent      condition.      The first    was   C.   pygerylhrus (the Vervet
Monkey).         In order that the brain might          be examined in situ, the
right   side  of  the cranium was removed in the following way.                First,
a longitudinal       incision was made with the saw a quarter of an inch
to the right      of the middle line, from the supraorbital ridge to the
foramen magnum ; then with the bone forceps the whole of the cra
nial wall thus marked out, was carefully cut away down to the base,
as were     also   the  right halves of the three upper cervical vertebrae.
The dura mater being then                removed,     a photograph      was   taken,
in which the relative position of the different parts of the brain are
well seen.      The posterior    lobes   of the cerebrum project      to the extent
of  ^  inch beyond the cerebellum, covering it more completely than
in the Orang, and nearly,         if  not quite,  as   much  so as  in man.      The
upper part of the remaining portion of the calvarium was now re
moved,     a section     made   across    the hemispheres at the level of the
lower surface        of the corpus callosum,          and  the lateral ventricles
 opened    out on both sides.           Although in     general form and in the
 arrangement of the structures composing their walls these cavities
 present   a great    resemblance      to those of the human brain, one re
 markable      peculiarity    immediately      strikes   the observer,     viz.   the
 great development of the posterior cornu, with the contained hippo
 campus     minor.      It extends   from the commencement         of the   descend
 ing cornu to near the apex of the well-developed posterior lobe, is
 of considerable vertical depth, being curled round the voluminous
 projection of the hippocampus minor, and is directed at first some
 what outwards and backwards, then directly backwards, and finally
 takes a considerable sweep towards the middle line, — the characteristic
 form which has obtained for this part in man the name of                    " digital
  cavity."     The hippocampus minor is formed, as in the human brain,
  by the deep involution of a layer of superficial grey cerebral matter,
  covered internally by a layer of white substance, which is so thin
  that the surface of this prominence had           a  darker look than the other
  parts of the ventricular wnlls.          It differs from   a  typical example of
  the corresponding part in the human subject in its great relative
  size, both as to length and as to the extent to which             it projects into
  the ventricle.       The hippocampal sulcus (well marked             on the inner

                                            379
surface of the posterior lobe of all apes) is not only very deep, but
has concealed within it a convolution of considerable size, in the form
of a longitudinal       eminence attached to the floor of the fissure.             The
eminentia collateralis is prominent.                The hippocampus major is
smooth upon the surface.               The anterior cornu is of the same form
and extent       as in the human braiu.
     In   the brains of C. aabmtu, C. mono, and C. ruber                a  similar dis
position of      these parts was found.          In the last named,      the posterior
lobe    of   the cerebrum   is even more        prominent, and the hippocampus
minor of still greater        size, as  it tapers less towards its termination ;
in fact this      eminence   is here actually larger than the hippocampus
major,      to which its true relation can be better studied in these apes
than in man.
     Macaeus. — In a monkey of this genus               (M.  erythraeus)      the pos

     In Cebus apella, the ventricular cavity           resembles      in all essential
 particulars that of Cercopithecus.              There is the same extent of pos
 terior cornu and the same complex arrangement of anfractuosities,
 producing the very protuberant hippocampus minor.
     It  is among the members of this family (e. g. Saimiris) that the
 projection backwards of the posterior lobes of the cerebrum attains
 its greatest extent.

     The    cerebral  anatomy     of the Lemurs is Kill       imperfectly known        ;
 therefore a detailed description is given in the paper of the brain of               a
 species    of Galago, the    most important part        of which    is the following
 note upon its internal structure            : — " A horizontal      section   of both
 hemispheres was made at the level of the corpus callosum, and the
 lateral ventricles laid open.           A broad and very distinct posterior
 cornu extends backwards almost to the extremity of the hemisphere,
 occupying nearly the whole of the posterior lobe.              Its floor and inner
 wall are raised into      a  prominence, having distinctly the characters
  of  the hippocampus minor as found in man and the higher Quadru-
 mana, and corresponding with the bottom               of the sulcus     before noted
  on the under surface     of the  lobe.    The form of this eminence is some

direction, so that the axis of the cavity that contains                                it,   though
directed generally backwards, has first an outward inclination, and
finally turns somewhat                   inwards.     The anterior or broad            end       of the
eminence    is       concave, being adapted to the curved posterior margin
of the hippocampus major, from which      separated by    deepit   is                        a
groove. The length of the hippocampus minor        of an inch,                 is

    As   none    of the authors who                 have written upon the brains                 of the
Lemuridae            describe       a     hippocampus        minor,      as    Vrolik expressly
states that      it   is   absent        in Stenops, and      as   Burmeister alone assigns
a  posterior cornu to the ventricle (in Tarsiut),   seemed desirable,     it
after the results of the observation of these parts in Galago, to re
examine the brain              of   some other members         of the family.          Two       speci
mens in spirit  of Loris (Stenopt) Bengalensis, placed at the author's
disposal for this purpose by Dr. Grant, afforded distinct evidence of
the existence of    well-developed posterior cornu and hippocampus
                           a
minor, though unfortunately in neither instance                               were the brains in
sufficiently good preservation to allow of                         a   satisfactory description
or figure of the parts being made.
   Galago and Stenops being generally considered as not very elevated
forms in the Lemurine family, we can have but little doubt as to
the presence of the posterior cornu and hippocampus minor through
out the different members of the group, and hence   most important            a
character   is       supplied for determining the affinities of these interesting
animals.        It    indicates          as    decisively their position among the Qua-
drumana,        as   it   separates           them completely from the Insectivora, in
which order some naturalists have placed them.
  Many links are still wanting in the chain of evidence required to
determine the true history and classificatory value of the posterior

horn of       the lateral ventricle, and the peculiar disposition   of cerebrai
substance constituting the hippocampus minor, but the conditions
in which they have been found at so many distinct points of the
series, appear to lead almost irresistibly to the following conclusions : —
      1 . That   these parts, so far from being (as has been stated by some
anatomists) peculiar to the human brain, are common to man and
the whole of the Quadrutnana, including even the lowest forms.
      2. That they attain their maximum of development in species
which do not belong to either extremity of the series.
      3. That in the lower forms their diminution takes place chiefly
 in the antero-posterior direction, corresponding with the reduced
 length of      the posterior cerebral lobes, the greater part     of which    is
 occupied      by them.
      4 . That in    the higher   forms they are narrower in proportion to
  their length,     and  bear a smaller ratio to the surrounding       mass    of
  cerebral substance.
      5. That     the extreme   of  the last condition is met with     in man,
  where     these parts are also characterized by their variability in size
  and form, want of symmetry on the two            sides, and frequent rudi
  mentary condition, or even entire absence.
  XIX. " On         Liquid Transpiration in relation to Chemical Com
          position."     By Thomas Graham, Esq., V.P.R.S., Master
          of the Mint.      Received    June 20, 1861.
                                     (Abstract.)
       In  accordance with the analogy of the transpiration of gases, the
   passage    of liquids under   pressure  through a  capillary tube is spoken
   of as liquid transpiration. The subject owes the development which
   it has already attained chiefly to the investigations of M. Poiseuille.
    The precision of the    mode    of experimenting pursued by that phy
   sicist has been remarked on by every one who has engaged              in the
   inquiry.       The same method was accordingly         adopted   with   little
   variation in the present investigation.
       The isolated observation made by        M. Poiseuille, that alcohol di
   luted to different degrees is most retarded in passing through          a ca
   pillary tube at that degree of dilution where the greatest        condensa
   tion of the mixed liquids 'occurs, was understood by the author as
    indicating that the definite hydrate of alcohol containing six equiva

                                      382
lents of water (or three equivalents of water with the formula of
alcohol taken as Ca H3 Oa), was the most retarded in transpiration.
The   rate   of transpiration     appeared    here to depend       upon chemical
composition, and to afford an indication of it.             A  new physical pro
perty may thus become available, like the boiling-point and others,
for fixing the chemical constitution of substances. The same feature
was recognized in methylic alcohol, although the six-hydrate                here is
not remarkable for condensation of volume             ; and the inquiry was then
extended     to the hydrated acids, and to other substances.           The results
appear    to establish the existence of     a  relation between transpirability
and composition.
   The time of     passage   of equal volumes of different liquids under the
same pressure and         at the same temperature, may be termed their
transpiration times, and be referred to the time of water as unity.             The
transpiration of nitric acid, NHOc, with and without water, at 20° C.
 was as follows    : —

   The transpiration time       rises with successive additions       of water,  till
the proportion       corresponding to three equivalents         is reached,   when
the time is 2-1034, and has attained its maximum.                 Diluted beyond
this point the nitric acid begins to pass more freely, and the trans
piration    time approaches       again to that of water.            The hydrate
named,     NH084-3HO, having            sp.   gr.   1-4,  possesses   the highest
boiling-point,    and the character    of definite composition.         It is what

                                           383
  I  have elsewhere     spoken of as the "constitutional" hydrate of nitric
  acid.
      Iu acetic acid, the constitutional hydrate, C4 H4 04 + 2              HO, is indi
  cated hy transpiration with equal precision.               The transpiration time
  rises  from     1-2801, the time of the basic              hydrate,     C4 H4       to
  2*7040,     the time of the hydrate first referred to          ; falling again after
  wards   as   the water is increased.     Butyric     and valerianic acids present
  the same character, although slightly modified.                Formic acid, on the
  other hand, departs entirely from the acetic type in transpirability,               as
 it  does in the density     of its combinations with water,           and in its indis
 position to form basic salts.          It  is curious that liquid formic acid,
 although an acetic acid by derivation, should more resemble hydro
 chloric acid in physical characters.                   •
     The transpiration time of sulphuric           acid is 21-6514, a high number,
 as   might be expected from the viscosity of the liquid.                 But the time
 rose   still further with the addition of          water,  till 1 7*5  parts of water
 were    added to 100     of oil of vitriol, when the number             was 23* 7706.
 The proportion of        water    stated   approaches closely to 18-36           parts,
 which represent      1 equivalent. Here again          a well-known constitutional
 hydrate is indicated, SHO. + HO.
     In hydrochloric acid the only sensible               retardation observed was
 with the hydrate represented          by HC1+ 12 HO.            This is the hydrate
 which possesses least volatility at         the low temperature of the expe
 riment (20°      C).
     It was supposed     that glycerine, as a triatomic alcohol, might affect
 combination with water iu the proportion C8 H8 08 + 18 HO. But no
such compound was indicated by transpiration of the aqueous solu
tions of glycerine.
     The transpiration of pure acetone         is remarkably rapid, and is greatly
retarded     by the addition of water.           The time    rises from 0-401, that
of anhydrous        acetone,    to P604, the time of the twelve-hydrate,
taking the equivalent of acetone as               C8 H8   0a, or of the six-hydrate
with the equivalent       C3  H3 O.
     The transpiration    times and boiling-points         of three alcohols     are as
follows : —
                                           Transpiration time.        Boiling-po

         Valerianic ether                   0 827                 133 5
   Judging from    these last observations,   the order of succession of in
dividual substances in any natural series will be indicated by the in
dividual transpirability of these substances, as clearly       as it is by their
comparative volatility.    Transpiration    and boiling-point observations
may come thus to claim an equal interest.           In carrying out the in
quiry, it will probably be found advantageous        to transpire the liquids
at a fixed temperature which is somewhat         elevated.    A large number
of  substances  are liquid at 100°  C, of    which the transpiration times
could easily be obtained.      Slow transpiration      and low volatility     ap
pear to go together, and both to be connected          in a general way with
a heavy molecule.       So also the annexation     of constitutional water to
the hydrated acids and alcohols appears to impede the transpiration
of  these substances.

       the   Secondary     Electromotor Power of Nerves,                 and   its
       Application     to the Explanation of certain Electro-Physio
       logical Phenomena."         By Professor C. Matteucci. Com
       municated       by General      Sanine, Treas. and V.P.R.S.
        Received June 2, 1861.
                                 (Abstract.)
     The object of this paper is to show by experiment that when a
 nerve is traversed by an electric current, it acquires in all its points
 a secondary    electromotor power, and consequently becomes capable
 of producing in a conducting homogeneous circuit, whose extremities
 touch any two points of that nerve, an electric current in an opposite
 direction to that of the original current.       This result is independent
 of the vital properties of the   nerves, but is affected in greater or less
 degree by their physical      condition.    A  similar effect indeed is pro
 duced by the passage of an electric current in all porous substances

                                             385
imbibed with           a conducting     liquid, and the phenomenon has been
studied in its generality by other physicists               ;   but the purpose of the
present paper is          to determine    the conditions of the secondary electro
motor power of            nerves, in order to make a due application               of these
conditions        to the explanation      of  the phenomena        exhibited by nerves
on the opening of a voltaic circuit which has                  traversed   them.
      Having explained the object of his memoir,              the author, before giving
 an account of his          experiments,    proceeds to describe certain improve
 ments he        has lately made in the instruments he employs for electro
 physiological         researches,   whereby he is able more easily and effec
 tually to avoid        the risk   of disturbing currents liable to          be produced
 in the apparatus itself.
       The   fundamental experiment on which the main position of the
 memoir        rests is performed as follows        : — The sciatic    nerve taken from
  a   frog,  a  fowl, or some other recently killed animal, is used for the
 purpose. The operator first assures himself that no sign of current
  is manifested on simultaneously touching with the galvanometer two
  points of      the nerve      equidistant from its cut extremities.             The dis
  turbing      effect   of the electric current naturally           generated    in nerves
  may also       be eliminated by placing two nerves,               or two portions of
   nerve, in such relative position that their natural currents shall be
   opposed      in direction and mutually            neutralize their effects       on the
   galvanometer.         To   the nerve or piece    of nerve thus tested are applied,
   at some distance from its extremities, the electrodes of                a pile of eight
   or    ten elements, and the exciting or pile-current is allowed for a
   short time       to   pass   along the included part of the nerve.                 When
   the nerve       is now put in communication with the galvanometer,                    the
   needle deviates, and indicates that the nerve is traversed, in the por
   tion which had        been included between the electrodes            of the pile, by   a
    current    the direction of which is opposite to that of the current of
    the pile, and which lasts for a certain time.                    Signs of secondary
    current are also obtained by applying the galvanometer                    to the parts
    of the   nerve which have not been traversed               by the pile-current, that
    is, the end-parts between the extremities of the nerve and the points
    touched by the electrodes of the pile ; but the secondary currents in
     these  end-portions of the nerve           are   in the     same    direction as the
     pile-current, and therefore opposed            to that   of  the secondary     current
     developed in the part included between the electrodes                  and traversed

                                           386
  by the pile-current.        It    is further   observed,    that of the two end-
  currents the one adjacent to the point of application of the negative
  electrode  is stronger than the other.
     It is to be noted that the secondary current endures for some time
 after the cessation of the exciting current            ;  hence  it is evidently not
 caused by induction.        The author thus explains its production              : — At
  the points of   a nerve   which have been acted on by the electrodes of               a
 pile the products of electrolysation are accumulated, and thence spread
 through the tissue more or less, according to differences of its structure
 and chemical disposition        ;   conditions,  persistent for a time, are thus
 established for generating a current when the circuit is completed
 between two different points          of the  nerve.     The   same thing happens
 when a strip of paper or flannel, moistened with a weak saline solu
 tion, is first subjected to the current of           a pile and then tested with
 the galvanometer, or        if    such a strip is so tested after having been
 simply wetted      at one part with acid and at another with                  alkaline
 solution, to represent     the effect of electrolysation by an exciting cur
 rent ; and in either case the direction of the secondary              current in the
 moistened strip, both in the part included between                    the points of
 application of the electrodes         and in the excluded parts at the ends,
 corresponds with that iu the nerve.
     The experiment     succeeds perfectly in the entire nerve         of a living ani
 mal, such as the sciatic of a rabbit or a fowl.              But the result is inde
 pendent of the vital condition of the nerve, for the effect is found to              be
 equally great four days after death as at the moment an animal is killed.
     The author next      gives the results      of experiments      made to deter
 mine the influence of various physical and chemical conditions on the
 secondary    electromotor power of nerves.              The method      he generally
 followed was by comparing the secondary currents caused by the same
 pile-current in a natural and iu an altered nerve.               He had previously
 ascertained    that when the same pile-current is passed through two
 nerves   at once    they are equally affected, and give when placed in
 opposition no differential deflection of the galvanometer, although
 singly each might give a secondary            current of 40° or 50°.          Now by
 sending the same pile-current           simultaneously through two nerves or
 portions of nerve, either before or after the one of them has been sub
jected to the particular conditions to be tried, and finally placing the
two in opposition in connexion with the galvanometer, the occurrence

                                             387
   or absence of differential deflection of the needle will show whether
  any or what degree of effect has been produced on the secondary
   electromotor power of the altered nerve.                    In this   way   the author
   found that both the cold of a refrigerating mixture and                       a heat   of
  from 50° to 60° Cent. caused             a great       diminution of the secondary
  current in the nerves            of a  fowl.       It is greatly weakened        also by
  crushing the nerve, or by keeping the nerve long immersed in di
  stilled water     ;   immersion for a few seconds has no appreciable effect.
  Immersion        for a few minutes in alcohol, or in a solution of potash
  of  Yihsis strength, entirely extinguishes the secondary                 current.    Two
  nerves     subjected     to the same exciting current, the one fifteen or
  twenty minutes after the other, show no difference in their secondary
  currents.       If    an exciting current is passed through a nerve, first in
  one direction and         then for an equal time in the opposite direction,
  the secondary current produced is weaker than                   if the pile-current had
  been in one direction only.            The   secondary      current increases, within
 certain limits, with the duration, and also with the intensity of the
 pile-current.          Neither the size nor the number of the nerves           (if united
 by superposition) exercises any influence.                   Four similar    nerves were
 subjected to the same pile- current             ;  three of these nerves superposed
 were     then placed       in opposition to one        as  a  differential pile, but no
 differential current was produced.                Portions of nerve of equal length
 from     a   frog,   a  lamb, and a fowl, were subjected to the same pile-
 current, and when afterwards opposed                    successively,    the one to the
 other, gave no differential current           ;   yet singly each gave a secondary
 current of 40° or 50°.             A  decided     effect, however, is produced by
 the length of the nerve          ;  when pieces of different lengths were com
 pared,     a strong differential current was constantly found to corre
 spond with the longest portion of nerve ; the author remarks that
 this result cannot be understood, unless we admit that the secondary
electromotor power, which is originally greatest in contact with the
electrodes,      extends     successively   to all the parts of        a nerve  traversed
by the pile-current.
     The author then          comes   to the fact which he conceives             to be of
greatest importance,          in the application of the doctrine of the secondary
electromotor power of nerves to the explanation of certain electro
physiological         phenomena.       It is expressed       in the following proposi
tion   : —

                                         388
    " The secondary electromotor power
                                                  of a nerve is not equal in all
parts of the nerve, being much stronger in the portion of the nerve
near the positive electrode,       than in that near the negative electrode ;
and this difference is greater in a nerve which has been traversed by
the current in the direction contrary to that of its ramification, than
in a nerve traversed by a current in the same direction as                 its rami-
f  cation."
    The unequal intensity of the secondary current and its maximum
near the position of the positive electrode, is shown by catting an elec
trolysed nerve into two or more equal lengths, which are then severally
opposed to each other in connexion with              the galvanometer,      and the
greatest differential current is found to be produced by the               part near
the situation     of the positive electrode.        Again, the greater effect of
a pile-current passed inversely to the direction           of the ramification of
the nerve, is shown by opposing two nerves which have been                       tra
versed in different directions by the same current             ;  or by dividing a
 nerve    and   opposing its two equal halves after they have been tra
 versed in opposite directions by the same current.
     The application of     these facts respecting the       secondary    current in
 nerves    to the   explanation of the phenomena which take place in
 nerves    on the opening      of  a circuit, is treated    of in the concluding
 part of the paper, which we give             with slight abridgement in the
 author's own word      s: —
     " The   object of these researches," he observes,
                                                                " was not to study
 the production     of secondary electromotor power in           nerves rather than
 in other porous and humid bodies of various structure and chemical
 composition.       Under this point of       view   it is evident that the phe
 nomenon      is complex and its analysis difficult.          In the present    state
 of   science, therefore, we are       unable    to account for the differences
 presented     by a nerve in its different points, according to their prox
 imity to one pole or the other, and           the direction in which the nerve
 is traversed by the current.           It is possible that similar differences
 will  present themselves      in other bodies not organized nor taken from
 living animals.      It is  sufficient for my present object to have proved
  that the secondary       electromotor power of         a nerve    requires for its
  development     the integrity of structure of the nerve itself, not, how
  ever, the excitability    of  the living    animal   ; and to have determined
  rigorously the differences      of this power which     have led me to ground

                                                   389
the explanation of               the electro-physiological       phenomena which take
place on the opening of the circuit,                  on a fundamental physical fact.
   " If in     a frog prepared in the usual way for electrical experiments
a continuous current is passed up one hind limb and down the other,
for 1 5, 20, or 30 seconds, according to the force of the current, it is
known       that the opening of the circuit is accompanied                  by violent con
tractions of the limb traversed by the inverse current. These con
tractions depend, as I showed many years ago*, on a particular state
of the nerve ; and in fact the contractions are obtained and continue
when the circuit is interrupted by cutting the nerve near the spine,
but they are no longer produced if the nerve is cut near its insertion
in the muscles of the leg.
   " My      object in this memoir has been to prove that the particular
state of the     nerve above described              consists in secondary     electromotor
power, that       is,   in   a   well-known    physical phenomenon.             The course
of the secondary current, which               is   downward or direct in the nerve that
has been      traversed          by the upward or inverse pile-current, explains,
according      to the well-known            laws of electro-physiology, the effects
produced by      it     on that nerve on the opening            of   the circuit.
   " The               of electromotor power found in various points
              differences
 of the electrolysed nerve, the prevalence of this power in the part of
 the nerve near the positive electrode, very probably also the different
 degree of this secondary              electromotor power in the various strata
 which     compose      the interior and the envelope             of the    nerve, are cir
 cumstances which seem to explain the secondary current which takes
 place in the nerve at the opening of the circuit, and which                        is   direct
 and most intense in the nerve which has already been traversed                             by
 the inverse current, most intense also in the vicinity of the positive
 electrode.
    " In   order, therefore,         to explain the phenomena          which accompany
 the opening of         a    circuit, we must henceforth have recourse to the
 fact of the development             of   secondary      electromotor power in nerves
 and the laws according to which               it   manifests   itself."

   The first of the two Papers referred to                         is entitled      "A     Sketch of
hu Analysis and Notation applicable to the estimation                               of the value of
Life Contingencies."                   It   is especially devoted to the explanation                of
a new     notation and a new mode of analysis applicable to the subject.

determining Life Contingencies,"                     treats, in its first part,         of the   equa

have been living at some given common previous age, in which d, g, q
may be considered                constant quantities through a long series of years,
and    the equations              to   give   the real rate of mortality                during    that
period within           a   very satisfactory approach to coincidence, say, for
instance,       from the age ten to the age sixty                  ; a   theorem from whence
the number living at an assigned                      age may be derived,               by what the
author calls the vital rule of three, from the number living, for in
stance, at the age twenty, forty, and sixty, given in a table                                of mor
tality.     But the author              observes that though the above formula with
suitably determined constant values of d, g,                        q appears       within a great
approach of the observed                      result, to agree with the tabular                   data
through     so    long a period, still that actually d, g, q are not constant
quantities, as every different selection                      from the table of the living
to which the formula is applied, for the purpose of determining the
three constants contained in                   it,   even   if   that table throughout           were
an accurate           representation of the law of mortality, which no table
based on obtainable data can be expected                          to be, would give different
values     of    d,   g,    q,   as they are not really absolutely constant, but
slightly variable throughout, because the formula                              hz=d Tg^i«         does
not represent          perfectly the law of mortality,               if   d,   g,   q   are perfectly
constant    ;    and the author complains                   of its misinterpretation in this
respect     by   a    subsequent        writer, who lays claim to discovery on this
subject.

     Ti»e other part of the Paper of             1825 is devoted   to a mode with
accompanying            tables,  to enable a calculator with any given       table  of
mortality to calculate the value of an annuity                 on any number        of
joint lives to within any degree of accuracy at                pleasure  ;  provided
the periods,        if long,   are divided into parts.
     The present supplement, written             so many years after the original
 papers were communicated to the Society, appeared to the author to
 be called for in order that he might further illustrate the subject, and
 add his later speculations and improvements.                The supplement       the
 author commenced writing about two years ago from collections of
 his manuscripts, but was prevented by continued ill-health from pro
 ceeding with it        ;  but having received an invitation last year from the
 International       Congress to assist in their meritorious labours, and being
 unable from indisposition to attend the Meeting,              as he stated   to the
 Congress,       he offered to send them some hints respecting his recent
 labours,      the results of which he intended to present to the Royal
  Society,     if his  health should permit him to finish the papers.            The
  hints which       he gave, which were honoured by a place in the Reports
  of the Congress,         were, he believes,  deemed interesting, but he thinks
  they were sufficiently separated from the strictly mathematical part
  of the subject, and also from the most important portions of the
  result, to allow him to consider the present paper           a new  work, or suf
  ficiently     new,   to be thought worthy         of presentation  to the    Royal
  Society, and especially         because since the notice above alluded to was
  furnished,      the author has been able to introduce important improve
  ments.       The original     formulae give one uniform law     of mortality from
  birth to the utmost limit of the            table ; but in the case of the table
  presented to the Congress, and            of  the present further improved for
   mulae,   if  a comparison be made, for instance,        with the Carlisle table
   from birth to the age of         1 00, and even from birth to one month, to
   two months, to three months, to six months, and to one year, where
   the tables appear to be so irregular, and formed on no law, the result
   appears    to show that a law really exists and is available.
      The author       shows the vast use and applicability      to solutions   of all
   intricate inquiries of life contingencies of his present deductions.           He
   gives  a   theory, which he believes         to be quite new, which      he calls
   special,   single,     and   specially influenced    contingencies  ;   a subject
   which he states he had not lost sight of when officially engaged in

                                                   392
the science of assurance,               as he     considered that all cases of connected
lives, where         there    might be a connexion of any sort, of influences
acting with respect               to the probability of co-existence,                 all questions
solved       without        reference    to such influence, were faulty, and                     might
be importantly              faulty.     He       states a striking     instance       with respect
to this observation as follows               :   — If it   be required to assure a sum on
the joint lives of           A   and B, that       is,   to pay the sum on the first of the
death       of   A   and    B, whichever may              be that first, and      if       in another
case   it   were required to assure the sum on the death                          of   B     in parti
cular, provided he should die in the lifetime of A,                         it   is    evident that
ifA    and       B   are   of the     same age, and not subject to any influential
connexion, that             if   they are both subject to the same uninfluenced
mortality, the price of the first assurance would be exactly double the
other.       But     if    the assurance were for        very short time, for instance,
                                                           a
in the time          a   ship was passing         from Dover to Calais, and they were
both going in the same ship together, the risk of the ship being
wrecked would affect them both equally, and the chance                                       of their
separate         escape would depend               on circumstances,        for instance,             one
being    a   better swimmer than the other                  ;   but there would be          a    chance
that neither of them                could escape, and as far as that chance                      is   con
cerned, the assurance on one                 of the two, whichever          it    might be, who

longest      of their      lives during that voyage would be all              of      equal value       ;
and the method the author has adopted                             for all uninfluenced con
tingencies would be available in all cases of influenced,                          by the intro
duction of certain formulae which the author regards                                  as    of   a    very
interesting nature.
     In addition         to the above particulars, the author presents                      a    theory
of   sickness,       which appears        to him to be           a   near approach to actual
statements        of     sickness occurring among Friendly               Societies.
  The Society then adjourned over the Long Vacation, to Thursday,
November 21.

      The following investigation, which contains a correction and

extension of that in Pliicker's ' System der Geometrie' (§ 3. art. 64),
is a direct application of the theories in the writer's paper                               "On Scalar
and Clinant Algebraical Coordinate Geometry"                               (Proceedings, vol. x.
pp. 415-426), to which                  reference       must be made for an explanation
of the notation            and terminology.

to    x,/=0          has n scalar      (possible) and 2m clinant (imaginary)                       roots,

clinant roots, then, we have              F,=0, and F,= 0 ; whence we find, by
alternately eliminating * and r, Fa(x, r)=0, and F4(x, *)= J.
    Now describe the loci of the points R and S, where
                   OR=x . 01 + r . OB,                   F,(x, r) =0,

Then from the nature of the clinant roots, which will be in pairs of
the form r, + i.*,,        if   we produce       PQ    to cut these    curves,   for every
point R' in which it cuts the first there will be two points S',, S'a, in
which it cuts the second.                 If, then, from the point R' we draw
R'M'^i.PS',         and     R'M'a=i . PS'a, two corresponding clinant roots
of the   equation    will   be                       so that

   4. Next suppose that the origin of the coordinates be altered to
O', so that    OT=OI,          and     OT,    when produced, passes through Q.
This will    be equivalent to putting             y + b instead of y, and the result
will  not disturb the coefficient         of   y"+2m.     Also since one of the radical
loci for the scalar values remains unaltered, and the others (which
are the axes) are parallel to the former, the points M,, M„ . . . MB in
which PQ, when produced, will cut the curve, remain the same, and
consequently there are the same number of scalar roots                      as before.
   5. But as the terms themselves                    of the equation f(x, y)=0          are
altered,  the radical loci of          R and S in (3) will       be altered,   and as the
distances    are   now measured              from Q and not from P,              the lines
QR',+i     . QS'„ QR',+i          .  QS'4  will now    be different and    =Qm',,    Qto'a.
If then   OQ=xa OT,   .          and    QP=ya BO= -ya . OB, then

 sides of which, when produced, cut the radical loci                of a known alge
 braical equation of n dimensions in known points.                   Let the product
 of   the series   of ratios formed         as  above (3),    corr3sponding to lines
 drawn from the point Or in the direction OrOr+i (on which last-
 named line the unit line Or 0'r+ ,, corresponding to 01 in (3), is mea

                                [Or,r+,M-=-OrO'r+1].
 And let Ar,r+i       be the coefficient necessary           to make this product a
 correct representation of the formation on the left-hand side of the
 given equation for the values of x and y, corresponding to the point
 Or and the direction OrOr+i-
     Then for the point Or+i and the direction Or+] Or (for which the
  corresponding unit line is 0r+ iO'r), we shall have the product of the
  corresponding series of ratios represented           by

     Proceeding then round the polygon, and forming the products for
  each of the two sides terminating at each point, we have by (7),

Plucker does not give the equation in the form above written, but places the pro
duct of all the antecedents of the ratios on one side, and the product of all the
consequents on the other.     As, however, these antecedents and consequents are
directed lines, such products have no proper meaning.      He has in fact considered
those directed lines as scalars, but has neglected to assign the directed unit lines
with respect to which they are to be considered as scalars.     Hence his error.
 t   Plucker makes the second side of this equation = —        which    manifestly     1,          is
erroneous.   But    0,0, 02A, Oac be drawn from O,, 02, Os through any point M

the asymptotes            of   an hyperbola      meeting at O,, and suppose the
third side 0a0, to cut the curve in A, and Aa, then since both
0,0a and 0,0a cut the curve at an infinite distance, the equation
 reduces      to
                                 2A OA-!.'
                                 OA,     0aAa
 whence we readily find
                                 OA=OA,           or  =-OA-
 The first      value is impossible, because Aa lies between           0a and 0a    ; the
 second gives the well-known property                of the hyperbola    %.
      11.    As regards the clinant roots, or the intersections of the sides
 of   the   polygon with the clinant radical loci, the wording of the pro
 position (9) requires to be changed to adapt it to the more compli
 cated form of the product ; and perhaps it may be considered suffi
 cient to refer to the forms of the products in the final equation of (8),
    * Pliicker    interchanges the two cases, and makes the positive result show the
 intersection    of the three lines in a point, which is shown to be wrong in the last
 note.      He rejects the first case, " because a conic can only be cut in two points by
 a straight line
                    " (p.        But in this case both the conic and the triangle reduce
                          45).
 to a straight line (that is, the points 0„ Oa, 0a, A, B, C all lie in the same straight
 line), and the points A, B, C do not indicate contacts, but double-intersections,
 which have the same analytical expression, owing to the rejection of infinitesimals
  in the above calculation of contact.
     t  Pliicker says that " in every such case there must be a fresh change of sign "
 (p. 46).     This apparently arises from his having neglected to particularize the
 directed unit, or to note the primary relation 0,0 = 0,0a+0,0.
    t   Pliicker makes 0,A,=OsA, (p. 46); that is, he neglects            the relation of
 direction,   which is all-important in such investigations.

  Communications           received since the end of the Session.
I. " On        some Varieties of      Tanniu."      By John Stenhouse,
        LL.D., F.R.S., F.C.S.          Received June 28, 1861.
    In    two   communications      "On    some   Astringent      Substances    as
sources of Pyrogallic         Acid,"   read  before    the    London    Chemical
Society in the years 1842, 1843, I showed that the usual division of
the varieties of tannin into two genera — to wit, those which give black,
aud those which give green precipitates with salts of iron, — though
called in question by Berzelius, is still well-founded : and likewise, that
these two genera consist of a great variety of species, which, though
closely resembling each other in properties,             are still dissimilar   in
nature ; the only instances in which the same            species of tannin had
been procured from two different plants, being those of nut-galls and
sumach.         Professor Strecker's important observation made some
seven years ago, that grape-sugar is produced when the tannin of
gall-nuts is boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, seemed              to render a
further examination of the varieties of tannin desirable.
                                    Sumach.
     As the tannin of Sumach cannot be obtained in such a high state
 of purity as that of nut-galls by Pelouze's ether process, I was
 obliged    to employ other methods by no means             so satisfactory, but
 which still yield      a tolerably pure tannin.      A strong     decoction    of
 sumach was therefore treated with acetate of lead, which threw down
 a pale yellow precipitate.       This was washed by decantation,        and then
 decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen and filtered              : the filtrate ha
 ving been boiled with dilute sulphuric         acid,   on standing for some
 time, deposited     crystals of impure gallic acid.      These were collected
 on a filter, and the mother-liquor,      when neutralized with chalk, gave
  abundant indications of sugar, both by Trommer's test and when sub
 jected to fermentation.       A  second decoction    of sumach,     when    cold,
  was treated with sulphuric acid, which threw down a copious preci
  pitate ;  this when boiled was also resolved into gallic acid aud giape

                                                 402
sugar.          This reaction, therefore, in addition               to former experiments,
serves to confirm the identityof tannin in oak-galls and sumach.
     When sumach is long kept, the tannin it contains appears to                             be
resolved        in a great measure into gallic acid and grape-sugar, owing
to its undergoing              a species      of natural fermentation.            Accordingly
under these circumstances when simply boiled with water, sumach
emits an odour resembling that                  of   tea, and yields a large quantity        of
sugar and gallic acid, but mixed with much                             impurity.      Sumach
therefore,        though it contains much gallic acid, owing to the impuri
                                         good source of that acid.
                      it,
ties present in       is       not   a
I     may also remark that the amount of tannin in sumach varies
considerably, some specimens                   being very rich and others very poor.
This- probably arises from the circumstance that the sumach of com
merce    the product of various kinds of Rhus, such as Rhus cotinus,
           is
Rhus coriaria,         &c.
                                          Chinese Galls.
     These singularly-shaped               galls,    which    are    angular and slightly
translucent, have been imported into this country in small quantities
for the last fourteen           or fifteen years.        They      are said to be found on
the branches of           a    plant which grows in Japan.                  From the small
amount of the colouring                    matter they contain, Chinese galls are
greatly preferred for the manufacture of gallic acid. Oak-galls, on
the other hand, are the best source of pyrogallic acid. The decoc
tion of Chinese galls gave                a    copious white precipitate with acetate
of lead. This       was decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and filtered                       ;
the clear liquid, when boiled with sulphuric                       acid,   was resolved   into
gallic acid aud grape-sugar, as in the two preceding instances.                       Another
portion of the filtered liquid was evaporated                      to dryness,    and destruc
tively distilled.         It    yielded    a   very large quantity of pyrogallic acid.
It   is   clear, therefore,      that gall-nuts,        Chinese galls,      and    the various
kinds of        sumach,   contain the same species of tannin.
                                     The Tannin in Tea.
     The tannin both of green and black tea                   is    invariably accompanied
by   a    small quantity of gallic acid, which does not arise from the de
composition of the tannin in the tea,                    as   is   the case with nut-galls,
sumach,         or Chinese galls.         On treating   a   strong decoction of tea, when
cold, with nearly         half its bulk of sulphuric acid,             the tannin falls as   a

                                       403
dark brown precipitate.         This was collected on a cloth filter, strongly
compressed,     and washed with a Utile cold water to free         it as much   as
possible from adhering impurities.            The precipitated tannin, when
boiled with dilute sulphuric acid,       did not yield a trace either of grape-
sugar or gallic acid, but was changed            into a dark brown substance
nearly insoluble in water.          It  dissolved pretty readily in alcohol,
forming a dark brown solution, from which, however,                   no crystals
could be obtained.
                   Oak- bark from Quercus pedunculata.
    A decoction of oak-bark       gave a dark brown precipitate with ace
tate  of lead.    This  was decomposed      by sulphuretted hydrogen.         The
filtered solution, when boiled with sulphuric acid, yielded grape-sugar
and a reddish-brown       precipitate, but no gallic acid.          The reddish-
brown precipitate dissolved with difficulty in spirit of wine, but gave
no crystals on standing.         Rochleder has stated that tea and oak-
bark contain the same species of tannin.               They certainly resemble
each other    in their  general  characters   ;   but as the tannin of oak-bark
yields sugar when boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, while that of tea
does not yield a trace     of sugar,   it is clear that the two tannins        are
not identical.
                Valonia, the acorn     of the Quercus     jEgilops.
    This  species   of tannin, which has        a  bright yellow colour, when
treated in the way already described,        yielded sugar, but no gallic acid.
    The tannin of pomegranate rind         also gave abundant indications       of
sugar,   but no gallic acid.
    The tannin of Myrobalans, the fruit of Terminalia             Chebula, gave
similar results.
      Tannins which give green precipitates with permits             of Iron.
    Salix triandra    and  Salix undulata (the willows generally used for
basket making). — A quantity of the bark of these two willows, when
boiled with water, yielded a dark brown solution.             This, when treated
with acetate of lead, gave a copious precipitate of a brownish-yellow
colour.    This lead-salt   was decomposed         by sulphuretted     hydrogen   ;
and   the clear filtered liquid,     when boiled with sulphuric          acid and

                                          404
  then neutralized with chalk, gave abundant indications of grape-
 sugar.     Another portion of the solution from the decomposed                 lead-
 precipitate, when digested with nitric acid, yielded only oxalic acid.
     When a decoction of willow-bark is boiled with dilute sulphuric
 acid,   the brown-coloured        liquid becomes very red, and a flocculent
 brownish-red precipitate falls which is nearly insoluble in water, but
 dissolves   pretty readily in hot spirit of wine and in alkaline leys.
 The brownish-red precipitate, when dissolved               in spirit of wine and
 left to spontaneous evaporation, did not crystallize, but formed a dark
 brownish resin.       It  consisted    chiefly of impure saliratine, resulting
 most probably from the decomposition             of salicine in solution.   When
 it was digested with nitric acid it yielded a good deal             of nitropicric
 acid.    Willow-bark,    therefore, is a    tolerably good source of this acid.
    Alder-bark (Alnus glutinosa). — Alder-bark             yields a dark red de
 coction with water.        It was precipitated with acetate      of  lead, and the
 lead-salt decomposed       with sulphuretted hydrogen.          It formed   a dark
 red solution, which on digestion with sulphuric acid yielded no sugar.
     Catechu. — It was the light-coloured           cubical variety of catechu
 that  I  employed.      The tannin from this astringent substance,            when
 digested with dilute sulphuric acid,         yielded no sugar,    a  result which

 Pharm. vol. xcv. p. 103).
    Larch-bark (Pinus larix, Linn.). — The bark of the larch is em
ployed in Scotland to some extent in tanning, though the leather
made with it is inferior in quality.           Larch-bark contains a good deal
of  a peculiar tannin, which yields olive-green            precipitates with salts
of iron.     The aqueous solution of larch-bark is strongly acid to test-
paper, and has at first a pale yellow colour, which exposure to the air
renders    brownish-red.       Acetate of lead threw down a copious yellow
precipitate    : this was decomposed          by sulphuretted      hydrogen      and
boiled with dilute sulphuric           acid,  when   the liquid   assumed    a fine
scarlet colour, like infusion of Brazil-wood.           The altered tannin pre
cipitated on cooling in beautiful red flocks, as it is but little soluble
in cold water.      It  is very soluble in alcohol, and its solution has a
rich scarlet colour, which is characteristic of this species of tannin.
Its alcoholic solution, when left to spontaneous evaporation, did not
yield crystals, but formed a dark resinous             mass.    The    clear liquid
from which the red flocks were precipitated, when                neutralized with

                                          405
chalk, gave no indications of sugar.             Sugar, however,        together with
a   good deal of mucilage and resinous matter, with some larixinic acid,
is contained in the crude decoction          of larch-bark.
     Bark of the    common black Mangrove (Rhizophora Mangle                  of bota
 nists). — This   species    of mangrove-bark is           used in tanning, and       is
 occasionally imported into Great Britain for this purpose.                   It  has a
 brownish-red     colour  :  the colour     of its decoction      is the same.     The
 tannin it contains is precipitated from its solution both by acetate of
lead and concentrated sulphuric acid.              When boiled with dilute sul
 phuric acid no sugar is produced, and the brownish-red precipitate
 which falls cr.nnot be made to crystallize.
     In conclusion,    I  would observe       that it is somewhat         remarkable
 that   so many of the tannins which give bluish-black               precipitates with
 persalts of iron are glucosides        ;  whereas     of   those which give olive-
 green precipitates with persalts          of iron, so far as I know, only          one
 — to wit,    the tannin    of the willow   — is a glucoside.
 II. " On      Larixinic Acid,     a crystallizable       volatile principle found
         in the Bark of the Larch Tree (Pinus Larix, Linn.)." By
         John Stenhouse, LL.D., F.R.S., F.C.S. Received July

                                     (Abstract.)
     This  acid is prepared by digesting larch-bark              in water at 80°    C,
  evaporating the infusion at the same temperature to the consistence
 of syrup, and distilling it in        vessels    of   glass,  porcelain, or silver     ;
 i. e. of a material not liable to     be attacked by the acetic acid present
  in the infusion.     The larixinic acid distils over, and partly crystal
 lizes on the inner surface of the receiver,              but chiefly remains       dis
  solved in the distilled liquid,        which,    after being concentrated by
  cautious evaporation, deposits        the impure acid in form            of crystals.
  These are of     a  brownish-yellow       colour   ;   they are to be dissolved
                                                                                          *
  and recrystallized, and may be obtained quite pure by sublimation,
  which takes place at the low temperature             of   93° C.
      This acid exists as a proximate principle           in  the larch-bark    ; most
  abundantly in that from trees of not more than 20 or 30 years'
   growth, or from the smaller branches of older trees.                When pure, it
   forms beautifully white crystals, often more than an inch long,                 of  a

                                             406
 silvery lustre, and much resembling benzoic acid in aspect.                         They
 sublime at 93° C. and melt at             1 53° C.   ; but in aqueous solution the
 acid volatilizes at ordinary temperatures.              The crystals belong to the
 oblique system,      and usually occur in twin form.                The measurement
 of  the angles, as determined at the author's request by Professor                    W.
 H. Miller, is     given in the Paper.
    Larixinic    acid, like naphthalin and camphor, emits a sensible                 smell
 at ordinary temperatures ; its taste is slightly bitter and astringent.
 It  very feebly reddens litmus, and a single drop of potash or ammo
 nia suffices     to  render a large quantity of it alkaline.                It   is very
 soluble in boiling water, but takes 87 or 88 times its weight of water
 at 60° to dissolve it       ; it dissolves also in cold alcohol, but much more
 largely in hot alcohol, and sparingly in ether.                   The crystals are in
 flammable,      and burn with a bright flame, leaving no residue.
    Three analyses of the crystals gave the following results                 : —

    The carbon,       hydrogen, and oxygen are therefore in the propor
 tions Ca, H,, O,, and the author adopts                 Ca0,   H,0, O,0   as the most
 probable actual multiples of these numbers.
    With     ammonia,      larixinic acid forms a combination so feeble             as to
 be severed by the mere volatility           of the ammonia       ; in this respect, as
well   as  in forming no hydrate, resembling pyrogallic and oxyphenic
 acids.      With    potash      it forms long flattish crystals of a reddish-
brown colour, which deepens on recrystallization.                       This combina
tion is decomposed by carbonic acid ; it was not obtained of constant
composition.         Larixinic acid      gives no precipitate with lime-water or
saccharate      of lime  ;    with baryta it forms       a bulky, gelatinous preci
pitate, like hydrated alumina, easily decomposed                     by carbonic acid,
and found from          two experiments          to contain 34-92 per cent.            of
baryta.
    Solution of larixinic acid gives no precipitate with basic or neutral
acetate    of  lead, perchloride       of platinum (even with heat), nor with
nitrate or ammonio-nitrate of silver, although, when boiled with the
latter salt, it reduces the silver.

   This acid contains     no nitrogen      ;  it does not reduce oxide        of copper
in Trommer's test      ; it  dissolves   in concentrated sulphuric acid with
out forming any conjugate combination.                   When boiled with a mix
ture of hydrochloric       acid and chlorate of potash it is decomposed,
but without giving rise to chloranile ; it gives no coloration when
boiled with solution of hypochlorite of lime. Nitric acid, especially
when aided by heat, attacks larixinic acid, leaving oxalic acid                   as the
only fixed product.        When heated with bromine it is destroyed,                 hy-
drobromic     acid vapours are given off,            and an uncrystallizable       resin
remains.      Salts of copper give           to   solutions of larixinic       acid   an
emerald-green colour, but cause no precipitate                ;  chloride of manga
nese    produces neither coloration nor precipitation.                   Characteristic
effects   are produced by salts        of iron     :  perchloride    and persulphate
give    a  beautiful  purple     colour which          stands   dilution    well ;   and
larixinic acid   becomes in this way an excellent reagent for detecting
the presence     of iron,   even in minute quantity.              It  does not affect
neutral proto-nitrate of mercury in            the cold, and on the application
of heat no mercury is reduced.
   This acid    appears    to be peculiar to the larch tree            ;  at least the
author    has not been able to find any trace               of it in the     spruce   fir
(Abies excelm), or in      the Scotch fir       (Pinus syhestris). It evidently
belongs to that small group of substances, of which pyrogallic acid
and pyrochatechin, the oxyphenic acid of Gerhardt, are the only
 other members      yet known.        It  is much less easily oxidizable than
oxyphenic acid, which again is less easily oxidated than pyrogallic
acid.     Larixinic acid volatilizes     at a much lower temperature than
either of these two substances,          from which it also differs in being
a ready-formed proximate principle, and not an educt.

    During the latter part of August, and the beginning of September,
 1859, auroral displays of almost unprecedented magnificence were
                                                                                          *

               very widely throughout
variably the case) with excessive disturbances of the magnetic needle.
  The interest attached to these appearances                   is,
                                                    possible, enhanced
                                                                  if
by the fact, that at the time of their occurrence a large spot might
have been seen on the disc of our luminary,     celestial phenomenon

which we have grounds for supposing to be intimately                               connected
with auroral exhibitions and magnetic storms.
     The auroral displays just mentioned                 were very attentively observed
throughout Europe, America, and Australia.                           In many places       these
were     of   the most gorgeous      character, and other places were visited
by this       meteor where its appearance           was an event       of very rare occur
rence.        Even from   as   low   a   latitude   as   Cuba we have       a   description of
it by the Director of the Havannah Observatory, accompanied with
the remark that only four previous displays had been recorded in
the traditions of the island. In not few instances telegraphic com
                                                    a
munication was interrupted owing to the current produced in the
wires and in some cases this proved so powerful that
        ;                                                  was used              it
instead of the ordinary current, the batteries being cut off and the
wires    connected     with the earth.          The descriptions of this              meteor,
given by various observers, have been collected together by Professor
Loomis, and published in a series of papers communicated
                                                           by him to
the American Journal of Science and Arts. From all these accounts
there appears to have been two great displays, each commencing at
nearly the same absolute time throughout the globe the first on the     ;
evening of the 28th of August, and the second on the
                                                     early morning
of   the 2nd of September, Greenwich                time.
     Magnetic disturbances of unusual violence and very wide extent
were observed
               simultaneously with these displays.    These were re
corded more or less
                    frequently at the different Observatories  but at                 ;
Kew there    the advantage of set of

                                          means of which the state of
the elements of the earth's
                              magnetic force may be known at any
moment.
     The author then      refers to curves, which
                                                         his paper, and
                                                  accompany
shows       that the   first
                      disturbance commenced about
evening of August 28th,

                          affecting all the elements simultaneously.
At about    p.m., 29th August,
               7i                 the violence of this
somewhat abated, and
                                                       disturbance had
                       things remained nearly in
                                                       this state until

                                       409
September 2nd, 5 a.m., about which                time another very abrupt
disturbance simultaneously affected all the elements, and continued
with great violence until about 4 p.m. of the same day, when it
somewhat abated.        The   elements,    nevertheless,    remained in   a state
of considerable disturbance until        September      5th, and only attained
their normal positions on September 7th.               It  thus appears that we
have   two distinct well-marked        disturbances,     both commencing ab
ruptly and ending gradually, the first of which began on the evening
of August 28th, and the second on the early morning of Septem
ber 2nd.
    These two great disturbances correspond, therefore,              in point of
time, to the two great auroral displays already alluded to.
    The  average   effect of both of    these disturbances was to increase
the declination, and to diminish the horizontal and vertical compo
nents  of  the earth's magnetic force.
    The author then alludes       to a disturbance which took place about
 15  minutes past    11 o'clock on the forenoon of September 1st, simi
lar in its mode of action to the            two great      disturbances already
mentioned,    but not equalling them in extent or in duration.               This
disturbance affected       the magnetograph          simultaneously     with   the
breaking out, near      a spot on the sun's disc, of        a bright star, which
was fortunately observed both by         Mr. Carrington       and  Mr. Hodgson,
independently.
    The study of the curves furnished by the magnetograph during
this great storm, in the author's opinion seems to throw light upon
the connexion which subsists between magnetic disturbances, earth-
currents, and auroral displays.        These curves show that at the com
mencement      of the disturbance, the horizontal           and vertical compo
nents   of  the earth's force remained depressed             below  their normal
values for at least seven hours.        The   curves for this portion     of time
have also a peculiar serrated appearance,          as if  on the great wave of
disturbance whose period was seven hours, there were superimposed
smaller waves whose period might be perhaps only               a few  minutes, or
even less.
    Now Mr. C. V. Walker, in         a paper    communicated to the Royal
Society (January 3 1 st, 1861), shows that the earth-currents which
accompany     auroras   are  of very short period (say a few minutes), and
the auroras themselves also appear to be of a very fitful nature.              We
    vol. xi.                                                       2 a

                                       410
cannot, therefore,     well imagine how any combination of auroras and
earth-currents could cause the period of seven hours, which                  the
magnetic curves exhibit        ; while at the same time we cannot fail to
 associate     the rapidly reversed earth-currents     with    those   serrated
appearances which the curves present.
   The author suggests the following explanation of these phenor
mena.        The earth itself may be likened to the soft iron pore of a.
ftuhmkorff's machine,         and the lower strata of the atmosphere      to an
insulating material interposed between the earth and the upper            strata,
of the     atmosphere,    which, being very rare, become conducting,         and.
form as it were the secondary coil of this arrangement.
   Now      suppose a primary current, probably in our luminary, to ins
fluence     the earth, and suppose its general     direction to remain the
same     for at least     seven  hours.   This current would       apt on the
magnetic matter of the earth in the same manner during these              seven,
hours    ;  and would, therefore, account for the magnetic wave        of seven
hours' duration.
   But although this current         has  been  supposed   to remain in the
same direction for seven hours, yet we may suppose             that its intent
sity, especially    if it  have an atmospheric origin, is    of  a fluctuating
character.       Now any    sudden increase or diminution in the intensity
of this current, heightened by the iron       core on which   it acts, i.e.  the
earth, will produce secondary currents,
    1st.   Along the surface of       the earth, which is sufficiently con
ducting for this purpose.
    2ndly. Along the upper strata of the atmosphere,           which are also
sufficiently conducting.
   These will be the earth-currents and auroras which, according to
{his hypothesis,      are therefore due to the fluctuating nature       of this
primary current ; while, on the other hand, the magnetic disturbances
are due to its absolute intensity.

       hranchiate     Mollusks."        By George Rolleston,             M.D.,
       F.L.S., Linacre Professor of Anatomy            ; and   C. Robertson,
       Esq., Demonstrator of Anatomy, Oxford.                  Communicated
       by Dr.    Acland.      Received August 20, 1861.
                                  (Abstract.)
   After recapitulating the      views which have been held by various
authors    as to   the means by which         certain Lamellibranchinta       are
enabled to distend their muscular foot, the authors of this paper
proceed to make a retractation of the opinions they put forward as
to the oviducal system in these mollusks in          a  paper read before the
Royal Society, February        3,   1859.     But, though they       have some
reason to agree with     M. La  Caze Duthiers's      views, as expressed    in a
paper read before the Royal Society, December 15, 1859, so far as
the oviducal outlet is concerned      ;  they are not prepared to coincide
with that writer in denying altogether the         existence in these animals
of an aquiferous system distinct from their        blood-vessels.     Upon this
point their views remain much the same as those they enunciated                in
their paper already referred to, and they may be briefly summed up
thus.
   They hold that,    side by side with, and yet distinct from, the blood-
vascular system in the Lamellibranchiata,           there exists    another sy
stem   of tubes forming an aquiferous tree, the trunk          of which   serves
as   an   outlet  for   the  generative     products,    whilst   many of its
branches spread throughout the foot into regions not occupied                 by
the organs of reproduction.        This   system is such an one     as the peri
visceral chamber has been          shown to be by        Mr. Hancock in the
'Philosophical Transactions' for the year 1858, spreading itself into
ramifications, some of which are, whilst others are not, in connexion
with the reproductive glands.             The authors allow, and indeed
show in the way of experiment, that it is possible for the water in
which the animal lives, to become intermingled with the blood within
its vessels by the route of the organ of Bojanus, and it will be seen
from what has even already been said, that they suppose               the aqui
ferous system to be fed with water by transudation                of that fluid
from the blood-vessels.
                                                             2  g2

                                            412
     They     begin   by describing three sets of experiments in the way of
 injections, to show that water             can find its way into the pericardial
 blood-lacunte through the organ of Bojanus                     ;   and from thence into
 the vessels which carry the systemic                blood towards, and only into
 those which carry it towards, the gills.
     The results of two other sets of experiments are next adduced in
proof of the non-existence in the blood-vascular                           system,     first,      of
any lacuna save in this pericardial space                ;   and, secondly,     of any       com
munication with the exterior by pores, save such as the two sacs of
the organ      of Bojanus     may be held to represent upon a gigantic scale.
     What     is new, however,     in this part of the paper, is not so much
the conclusions as the methods              the authors have adopted for demon
strating them.
     In proceeding         to argue   for the existence             of   a system     of     tubes
distinct from the blood-vascular system,                     the authors begin by con
trasting the appearance           which the non-generative                part of the foot
presents      when it is injected,     as    it   is easily,    from the orifice which
serves as generative         outlet, with that which it presents when injected
from the blood-vessels.
     Secondly, they show that it is possible when the blood-vessels                              are
already fully occupied by an injection of one colour to cause                        a second,
or when the artery and the vein have been filled with differently
coloured fluids,      a   third system of vessels to make their appearance
throughout the foot-mass by throwing                 a   differently coloured injection
into the oviducal outlet.
     Thirdly, microscopic examination of              animals       thus treated excludes
the idea that the fluid thus interposed between and amongst                              blood
vessels has found its way simply into interstitial spaces left between
them and the tissues, as         it shows that       it.
                                                     is      contained within        a   system
of   tubes as well defined and limited off from the surrounding tissues,
as   is   the fluid which has been thrown into the blood-vessels                            them
selves.
     That    the water which has been shown to enter the body                               by   the
intermediation of the organ of Bojanus finds its exit                         by     the same
route, the authors believe to be rendered in the highest degree im
probable,      by
              the fact that they have found     impossible to make
                                                               it
fluid pass in the direction this hypothesis postulates                    ;   that    is,   from
the blood-vessels,        into the pericardium.

                                        413
    Similar improbability      attaches to a view which supposes a fluid            of
 such chemical and such morphological characters               as the  blood of the
 Lameliibranchiata,      to suffer dilution     to such an extent        as  the ob
 servable distention of their foot would necessarily imply             ;  and which
 argues from phenomena        noticed on the sudden removal of the animal
from the water,      as though they could be regarded            as identical with
 normally occurring physiological processes.
    As their injections    seem to them to prove the existence           of a system
 of vessels distinct from and yet in most close apposition to the blood
 vessels, and permeating the several         tissues of the body in company
 with them, the facts of the case seem to the authors to necessitate the
 belief that  a transference   of fluid   takes place, ns in other organisms,
 from the latter to the former set of vessels.
    The animals    experimented     upon were Unionidaj of the two species,
 Anodonta Cygnea and Unto margaritifera.
 V. " Notes of Researches on the Poly-Ammonias." — No. XVI.
    Triatomic Ammonias.             By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.It.S.
    Received    July   5, ]861.
    In  a short   paper which     I  had the honour of submitting to the
 Royal    Society about a year ago,          I  endeavoured      to delineate     the
 general results to which my experiments on the Polyatomic Bases had
 led me.     I  showed     that the construction of these bodies             may be
 accomplished in two essentially different ways.              In  the first place, a
 number of     ammonia-molecules may be joined by the insertion                  of a
 polyatomic    radical, the atomicity of the radical determining                  the
 number of the ammonia-molecules thus united.
                    R" Brn+«H3N=[R"             H3B    N„]» Br„.
    Examples of compounds formed upon this principle have been fur
 nished by my researches on the phosphonias.
    Again,   the   accumulation      of  the    ammonia-molecules           may    be
 attempted   by increasing the number of polyatomic radicals of given
 atomicity used    as  binding material.       It   is obvious that theoretically
any number     of ammonia-molecules may           be held together by diatomic
molecules,    provided we appropriately           increase   the   number of the
latter.

                                     Viamine.
      In   a general form this second      method may be expressed       by the
  equation
»RU  Bra+    2» H, N= [RB"    H(1B+4)  N(fl+ „] c+i) Br(B+1) + »- 1
                                                                     ([H4 N]Br),
  which represents      the formation of the first term in each     series of a
  succession    of basic groups  of increasing atomicity.
      The simplest case involved in this equation is the formation of the
  first term of a series of diammonium-compounds.              When n= 1, the
  above equation assumes the simple form
                       RuBra+2HJN = [RuHaNJ]uBra             ;
  and    if R'^(CjHJ",       we obtain    in this manner the dibromide of
  ethylene-diammonium
                            [(C,Ht)UH,NJ"Br„

                                           415
   the diamine of which, undergoing further substitution, furnishes the
   higher members of this class of diatomic bases.
       When n=2, the      above equation leads us to the conception           of  the1
   first term of  a series  of triammonium-compounds,           for
              2RU  Bra+4Ha N=          [Rau H6   NjwBr.+L^NJBr ;
   and in attempting the experimental verification of this equation in
   the ethylene-series,  we are justified     in expecting, among the products
  of the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia,               the
     Tribromide of Diethylene-triammonium.             . [(Ca H4)au H8 Na]m Bra,
  or among the volatile bases liberated from the bromides by the action
  of an alkali, the
                      Diethylene-triamine           (C»**^
                                                              |n„
  capable, under the continued influence of dibromide of ethylene,                 of
  yielding triamines of     a  higher degree of substitution.         These expec
  tations have been fully borne out by experiment.                 I have  satisfied
  myself that the volatile bases obtained by the action of dibromide of
  ethylene upon ammonia, which after several rectifications boil between
  200° and 220°      consist almost exclusively       of  the two compounds,
           Diethylene-triamine        C4 Hu N3=(C'       ^     j N,, and
           Triethylene-triamine       C6 H,5 Na=(C» jj4))U

      The separation of these two compounds, which, owing to the
 proximity of their boiling-points, could scarcely be effected by distil
 lation, was attempted        by transforming them into saline compounds.
 But    here an unexpected      difficulty presented itself in the observation
that the triammonias are capable            of forming three      classes of  salts,
which may be generally represented             as
                                 K4UH5N„3HC1,

                                 R/H.N,,        HC1;
and that the platinum-compounds              of   the triatomic   bases exhibit a
still  greater diversity   of composition,       these bases being not only apt
to form the salts corresponding to the chlorides, viz. —
                         RauH,,Na, 3HC1, 3PtCla,
                         RauH,Na, 2HC1, 2PtCla,

                                           416
but appearing cnpoble          even       of    forming;    compounds in which the
number of dichloride-of-platinum-molecults                       diminishes whilst the
amount of hydrochloric acid remains constant, such                            as
                        R»"H5Na, 3HC1, 2PtCla,
                        Ra"H5Na, 3HC1, PtCL,.
     Fortunately most of the salts, and more especially                            the platinum-
compounds, crystallize with remarkable facility, so that the above fact
being once established, the circumstances                  were soon determined under
which the more important saline compounds could be with certainty
reproduced.       The separation of the triamines was chiefly effected in
the form of chlorides, bromides, and iodides, or of platinum-salts
and gold-salts.
     Both diethylene-triamine       and triethylene-triamine                   are powerfully
alkaline liquids, soluble in every proportion                    in water           and alcohol,
almost insoluble in ether.          They boil respectively                at 208° and 216°;
but owing to the comparatively small quantities with which                                         I   have
had to work, these determinations may require some slight corrections.
Both bases neutralize the acids completely, giving rise to the forma
tion of well-defined, and in most cases beautifully crystallized salts,
which are generally very soluble in water, difficultly soluble in alcohol,
insoluble in ether.     The    aqueous solution             of the       salts is not precipi
tated by the solutions    of    the alkalies, owing to the solubility                              of   the
bases ; but solid hydrate      of   potassium         separates them in the form                             of
nearly colourless oily liquids, which                 rapidly        attract carbonic acid
from the atmosphere.
     The composition of diethylene-triamine                  was fixed by the analysis
of   the free base itself, which was found to be anhydrous,

     The platinum-salt of this,            as     well as of several other triammonias
-which      I    have       examined, cannot be recrystallized without at least
partial decomposition.              New platinum-compounds are thus produced,
in   some       of which the chloride is united with               a smaller number        of
molecules of dichloride of platinum,                   whilst others, almost insoluble
in water, to judge from the enormous                  amount of platinum which they
contain, appear to be produced by platinic substitution.
     Not    less definite are the results obtained in the analysis                    of tri-
ethylene-triamine, although, owing to the greater                        solubility   of the
compounds of             this base and its tendency to form imperfectly satu
rated salts,          the    preparation   of      these   substances    presents     greater
difficulties.          The analysis of the          free base has furnished         numbers
agreeing with the formula
which shows that this, like the diethylenated compound, is anhydrous.
It   deserves to be noticed that the tendency                 to form definite hydrates,
so prominent in the diamines,               is not met with in the case           of the tri-
amines.
     I                            of triethylene-triamine, both tri-
         have examined numerous salts
atomic and diatomic, which confirm the formula of the base. In the
presence         of   a large excess   of hydrobromic           and hydriodic acids, this
substance            forms well-crystallized        triatomic    compounds        containing

     The solutions of           these salts are powerfully acid.
     From feebly acid solutions, on the other hand,                     salts are deposited
in which only two equivalents of hydrobromic or hydriodic                               acids
are present.            These substances contain

   The addition of                  free base to the solutions              of the diacid salts still
further reduces the bromine and iodine.                                  I have    not, however, suc
ceeded in obtaining the monacid compounds in a state                                         of purity, but
the analysis        of mixtures             leaves but little doubt regarding the existence
of this class, and more especially                       of    the compound

water,       so that thepurity of the triethylenated base may be best
tested    in the form of this platinum- salt, since the platinum -salts of
the ethylene-diamines, as well as                        of diethylene-triamine, with which

suffering decompositions similar to those which alter the salt of the

    Mixed Triammonias            containing    Monatomic       and     Diatomic
    Radicals.       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                    Received
    July    29, 1861.
    Diethylene-triamine       and triethylene-triamine,   a  short history of
which     I  laid before the Royal Society some weeks ago, are the first
terms    of  a group  of  a series of triatomic nitrogen-bases,      whose con
struction      and  composition     may   be varied almost       ad infinitum.
Similar compounds, there can be no doubt, will be produced by all
the homologues of ethylene.           With the exception of        a few experi
ments on the action of ammonia on dibromide of methylene,                 I have
not hitherto entered upon this part of the inquiry.        Not   less numerous
is the series of triatomic bases derived from the ethylene-triamines by
the further substitution of either monatomic or diatomic radicals for
the remaining hydrogen-equivalents.           I  have   satisfied myself that
the ethylenated triammonias are powerfully acted upon by the iodides
of methyl and ethyl, and likewise by dibromide of ethylene.               I have
not examined in detail the substances          produced in these reactions,
but   I  have had occasion     to glance at the ethylated derivatives of the
ethylene-triamines      when studying the diatomic bases generated            by
the action of dibromide of ethylene upon the ethylated monamines.
   In   a former note    I  have pointed out that the action      of dibromide
of ethylene     on ethylamine gives rise to the formation       of
and
   These two compounds constitute the chief part of that portion              of
the volatile bases derived from ethylamine which, after several recti
fications, passes over below 200°.        The  bases boiling above 200° are
a mixture which, dissolved in hydrochloric          acid, yields with dichlo-
ride of platinum a splendidly crystallized platinum-salt.             By nume
rous crystallizations      this salt may be separated     into one which is
difficultly   soluble in water, and another which is far more soluble.

The analysis of       these platinum-compounds        proved   them to be the

    Both    these bases are oily liquids, powerfully        caustic, extremely
soluble in     water,   which boil between 220° and 250°.             I  have not
prepared them in quantity sufficient for an accurate determination of
their boiling-points.        Both form neutral crystalline       salts which are
extremely soluble in water, and also, though less so, in alcohol.

     The simple    salts  of triethylated triethylene-triamine are far more

 the analysis of the platinum-salt and of the gold-salt.          The platinum-

        Tetrammonium-Compounds.            By A. W. Hopmann, LL.D.,
        F.R.S.      Received   July  29, 1861.
     In  several previous communications     I have  submitted to the Royal
 Society a sketch of the triatomic bases which are generated by the
assimilation of three molecules of ammonia linked together by the
intervention of diatomic molecules.         In  the  same sketch      I endea
voured to trace the general principle upon which the bases of higher
atomicity arc formed.        I pointed out that the accumulation of am
monia-molecules is determined by the number of diatomic radicals
which are fixed; that, for the production of an (n-fi)-atomic am
monia, at least n diatomic radicals are required; and lastly, that
the number of molecules of diatomic bromides and the quantity of
ammonia involved in these accumulative processes are given in the
general equation
           nR11 Br,+  2n  H, N={R„li   H(an+4) N(,+I)]=»+i>  Br(,+I)
                    +»-l([H4N]Br).

                                     424
I  moreover   showed how this equation applies to the first terms         of  the
series  of diammonium-     as well as triammonium-salts.
    In following up   the natural development of these ideas,          I had to
search   for the tetrammonium-compounds.           For    if n=3,    the above
equation reduces itself to
         3R" Br,+   6 H, N= [R," Hl0     NJ" Br4+2([Ht        N]Br) ;
and the simplest tetramine       of  the ethylene-series   — the triethylene-
tetramine — is represented by the formula
I  have vainly searched for this compound among the difficultly            vola
tile bases resulting from the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
ammonia,     which distil after the triammonias have passed.           But it   is
obvious that so complex a compound must have            a   very high boiling-
point, and thus be liable to decomposition by distillation.           To  avoid
this decomposition, the product of the action of dibromide of ethy
lene upon ammonia was treated with an excess of oxide of silver ; the
liberated bases were then submitted to a long-continued current of
steam,   by which all the volatile matter was carried over.            A consi
derable proportion    of non-volatile   bases remained     behind, the mixed
character of which was easily proved by progressive           precipitation by
dichloride of platinum.      The analysis of these platinum-salts has con
vinced me    that this liquid indeed contains the tetramine in question,
mixed, however, with other compounds of very similar properties              ; so
that my endeavours       to obtain  it in a state of purity    have failed.      I
have, however,    succeeded in preparing the pure compound by a some
what different process, viz. by submitting ethylene-diamine, instead of
ammonia, to the action of dibromide of ethylene. The formation of
the tetrammonium-compound          in this reaction is represented       by the
equation
 2[(CaH;>U       Ni]+(C,H,)"BrI+2HBr= [(C'h^"                         nTbt,-
               }                                                   }
The hydrobromic acid which figures in this equation arises from an
other phase of the reaction, which I have not yet completely studied.
   Triethylene-tetramine is a powerfully alkaline liquid which is sepa
rated from the bromide by means of oxide of silver.             It dries up to
a syrup, which shows       no tendency    to crystallize.     Its composition

                                             425
was fixed by the analysis of the pale-yellow, amorphous, almost inso
luble platinum-salt, which was found to contain
            C8   HM N4 Pt, Clia=          [<ca   §•)¦¦   }   N4]   "ci* 4PtCL..
Although         less intricate than the result          of the reaction     between       am
monia and dibromide of ethylene, the products obtained under similar
circumstances from ethylene-diamine present still considerable com
plexity   ;   and the impossibility of separating the tetramines by distil
lation, together with their rapidly diminishing                        faculty of yielding
crystalline compounds, render the investigation of these substances
rather difficult, more particularly since time, temperature, and even
relative proportion         of the reacting compounds                 are apt to vary the
nature of the products formed.
  A     simplification of these difficulties appeared                  to present itself by
adopting the method which had so greatly facilitated the study of the
bases of lower atomicity, viz. by examining the deportment of some
of the ethylated monamines under the influence of dibromide of
ethylene.
  As    a   chemical theory expands and becomes more and more conso
lidated, the interest attached to the individual                        compounds used as
scaffolding in raising the structure becomes less and less, diminishing
in fact in the inverse ratio of the number of the compounds which the
theory suggests.     It thus became     matter of comparative indiffer
                                                   a
ence, in what series and by what materials the construction                              of the
group of tetrammonium-compounds was attempted. Ethylamine and
diethylamine appeared                to recommend themselves             by their accessi
bility. Owing to the greater simplicity of the reaction,                          I   will first
mention the results elicited in studying the deportment of the di-
ethylated monamine.
            Action of Dibromide of Ethylene                  upon Diethylamine.
   The reaction       is   rapidly accomplished, both in the absence and pre
sence     of alcohol.      On opening the tubes after several hours' digestion
at 100°, the liquid        is   found to be acid     ;   the powerful evolution of bro
mide of vinyl, which            is   invariably observed, at once points out the
existence,        among the products of the reaction, of considerable quan
tities of bromide of diethylammonium.                        In addition to this bromide,

   The separation   of these three salts presents         no difficulties.     Libe
rated  by oxide of silver and submitted to a protracted current of
steam, the mixture of bases separates on the one hand into diethyl-
amine and ethyleue-tetrethyldiamine,         which pass over with the steam,
and   hydrate of triethylene-octethyltetrammonium,                which     remains
behind.-
    The octethylated tetrammonium-compounds                 are remarkable for
their definite characters   : they are still crystalline,       — a circumstance
which has facilitated their study in no common degree.                   The com
position of the series was fixed by the analysis of the platinum-salt,
of the gold-salt,  and of the tetriodide.        The platinum-salt is         almost
insoluble in water.    Precipitated from        a  dilute and gently warmed
solution, it is obtained in small crystalline plates containing

from the number of unreplaced hydrogen-equivalents in ethylamine,

VIII. " On     the Lead-Zinc and Bismuth-Zinc                 Alloys."       By A.
       Matthiessen, F.R.S., and M. von Bose.                   Received August
       28, 1861.
    The fact that lead and zinc, and bismuth and zinc do not alloy
together in every proportion is well known, but there have been, we
believe, no determinations made as to the extent in which these metals
alloy with each other.
    The following experiments        were made       to ascertain   quantitatively
what amount of zinc will dissolve           in lead and bismuth, and, on the
other hand, the amount of bismuth and lead in zinc.
    The metals*      were fused    iu  a  Hessian crucible over a 4-Bunsen
 burner, stirred with     a tobacco-pipe stem for      a quarter of an hour, and
 then allowed   to remain quiet for    half   an hour in a fused state     : during
 the whole time    a  jet of  gas was directed on the surface        of the melted
 metals.   They    were after this cast in a porous cell, which had been
 previously heated to redness in       a  large crucible filled with sand.        It
 was generally about two hours before             the metals became solid       : in
 some cases the crucible was placed in a furnace with a low fire so as
 to cool much slower, but the separation           of the  metals did not appear
 to be more perfect than when cooled             in the usual manner.         When
 cold the cell was broken, and the top of the alloy separated from the
 lower part by a blow of the hammer.
     The weight of    each casting was about 300 grms., its height about
  100 millims., and its diameter abont 25 millims.
                               Lead-Zinc Alloys.
     The Zinc-end.   — About     12 grms. were taken from the middle              of
 the end, avoiding the outside.         The greater part of the zinc was dis
 solved in dilute hydrochloric acid, the residue dissolved           in nitric acid
 and precipitated by sulphuretted             hydrogen ; the washed sulphide
 oxidized by fuming nitric acid, and the lead weighed as sulphate.
 Or, instead of precipitating by sulphuretted hydrogen, the mixed
 nitrates were precipitated by ammonia and carbonate                  of  ammonia,
 and the lead weighed as oxide.
     The Lead-end.   — 8 grms.    were dissolved      in nitric acid, precipitated
 by sulphuretted hydrogen, the filtrate evaporated almost to dryness,

1  of carbonate  of ammonia.        The filtrate      was mixed with carbonate

  conditions detailed above, dissolve only
  1 -2 per cent. lead ; that zinc

IX. " On        some Gold-Tin         Alloys."             By A. Matthiessen, F.R.S.,
        and    M. von Bose.               Received August 28, 1861.
  It    was observed        in a former research* that the gold-tin alloys had
a great tendency          to crystallize, and it was deduced from results then
obtained that some of them were chemical combinations.                                      With     a
view to ascertain whether these would crystallize out from the fused
metals, the following experiments were undertaken.
  The       metals    f   were   weighed        out in the proper proportions, and
fused      together in a crucible over                 a   4-Bunsen burner, a jet of gas
playing on the surface from above to prevent the oxidation of the tin.
When        fused,    the lamp was removed and the alloy allowed to cool
(the jet of gas still playing upon until the surface began to solidify,
                                                 it)
when the liquid alloy was poured off from the crystals.     Of course
the two metals were always stirred well, and cast several times before
the alloy was crystallized and analysed.
  When the           metals   were    fused     together in the proportion to form
AuSn, (62-9 per               cent.   Au) and AuSn, (53-l per cent. Au), no
crystals could be obtained in either case.                      When, however,             more tin
was added,           so as to make        the alloy Au8n4 (45*9 per cent. Au),                      a
separation took place into            a   non-crystalline mass with glassy frac a
ture and      a   very crystalline one      :    these may be easily separated                    from
each other by fusion, for the former has                      a   much higher fusing-point
than the latter.         The alloy containing 43-5 per cent. gold behaved
in the same          manner. The analyses of the different parts of these
alloys are given in the following Table.                          The gold    was determined
by dissolving the alloy in nitro-hydrochloric                        acid, and precipitating
the gold from the strong hydrochloric                       acid solution with        sulphite of
soda   :—

   The weight of     each   of   the alloys experimented with was generally
about 260 grms., and that of each crystallization                  on the average
40 grms.      In the last alloy, crystals fit for analysis could only be
obtained in the first crystallization.            The mother-liquor was, how
ever, crystallized four times, and the last mother-liquor analysed.

    No other forms of crystals than those just described               were observed
in any of the alloys experimented with.
   The largest and best-defined crystals            were obtained from the alloys
containing about 41 per cent. of gold.               The plates      were sometimes,
when crystallized from 300 grms., about 30 millims.                      long and    15
millims.     wide,    being the height and depth              of the alloy in the
crucible   ;  they were generally of a bronze colour, proceeding from                  a
Blight oxidation of the tin         : their true colour was that of tin.            All
the alloys emit a grating sound when cut through,                   as  tin does, and
are all exceedingly brittle.
   From the        above    experiments it        appears,    first, that    the well-
defined crystals are not limited to one definite proportion                of the  con
stituents of the alloy, but are common to all gold-tin alloys con
taining from 43 to 27*4 per cent. gold; secondly, that crystals and
mother-liquor are never of the same composition.                    These facts coin
cide with those found by Cooke1"                in his  research    on tin and anti
mony alloys, who observed             that zinc and antimony are capable of
uniting and producing definite crystalline forms in other proportions
than those of their chemical equivalents.

   In   a  brief account of the         effects   of compression of the human
vagus and sympathetic nerves           f,  I mentioned as one of the symptoms
produced,      "a  tingling and heat of the ear corresponding to the side
compressed,      often lasting upwards       of half an hour after removal of the
pressure."
   The    sensations    thus experienced      are frequently     of a hot, mordicant
character,    as  if  arising from the passage of a hot fluid through the
vessels, extending progressively and causing a flush over the surface

                                       437
of the lower part of the ear. The feelings in fact              resemble   those
experienced in ordinary cases of blushing.
   In my     observations   on compression       of the vago-sympathetic,      I
found that the above-mentioned           auricular symptoms are more un
certain than those affecting the          organs   controlled   by the vagus.
Thus in the      same individual where six observations        were made suc
cessively  at about an interval       of  an hour between      each, dyspnoea,
irregularity of the heart's action, and uneasiness of the stomach were
produced on each occasion, while the ear-symptoms were obtained
twice out of the six, and lasted but a few minutes after removal of
the pressure.
   On  the other hand, sometimes the auricular symptoms predominate,
whilst the others are scarcely perceptible.
   Although the auricular symptoms are certainly due to the influence
of some branch of nerve, we find considerable difficulty when we
endeavour    to ascertain  the exact branch that is affected,        as besides
the vascular branches of the cervical sympathetic which exist over
the part compressed,       we   have   also the auricular     branches   of the
cervical plexus close by, which may likewise give rise to the symptoms
in question,   either by their direct influence or by reflex action.
   For many     reasons,  which   I  will not  enter upon at present,    I  have
come to the conclusion that most,       if not all of the symptoms    produced
by compression of the vagus are the result of reflex action in all the
nerves governing the organs affected, viz. heart, lungs, stomach, &c.
I  have arrived at the same conclusion respecting the mode              of pro
duction of the auricular symptoms, viz. that they are reflex.                 As
the complex arrangement        of the    nerves  in the neck prevented       my
obtaining any precise knowledge of the nerve acted upon, I was led
to make a careful study of the effects of various agents on those
nerves which are more accessible          to examination, in order to ascer
tain how far the spinal nerves distributed to other parts are suscep
tible of giving rise to the same symptoms         as those experienced    in the
ear.
   My present experiments        have been made chiefly on the ulnar and
internal popliteal nerves, but it is not my intention on this occasion
to describe them in detail    ;  I shall   accordingly state only the leading
results, and for the present        shall confine   myself to those obtained
with the ulnar nerve.

                                         138
    I have generally made use         of refrigerating     agents, such as ice and
water   at 0° Cent.         The symptoms produced by either of                  these
applications     relate   to— 1st,   the sensibility;       2nd, the excitability;
3rd, the temperature of the nerve under examination, or of the parts
which it supplies.
    Sensory symptoms.       — The first     effect   of the application of ice to
the ulnar nerve, as is        well known, is a state of hyperaesthesia de
 scending apparently to the inner fingers, which gradually increases
 until it  becomes very painful.           After    a minute or two the hyper
 aesthesia diminishes, and the pain suddenly disappears.
    Sometimes the nerve passes from this condition into                  a state    of
 complete anaesthesia, when both the nerve and the integuments below
are insensible.
    In other   cases, before these parts are rendered insensible, we have
hyperaesthesia      and   analgesia   of the      nerve  recurring   several    times
before the supervention        of the stage     of anaesthesia.
    Symptoms      of motrieity.   —The       first change    in the excitability of
the nerve, or its power of inducing muscular contractions, is that of
increased action on either mechanical or electrical irritation,            and is so
manifest,    that an ordinary degree of irritation, which in the norma)
state  will   scarcely    produce     any muscular        contraction,  will    cause
strong movements        of the wrist    and fore-arm.
    The   second    stage   of nerve-excitability      is that in which     there   is
 decreased muscular action terminating in its complete loss.
    The   passage    from the first to the second          stage is marked by no
distinct symptom, as the one gradually blends into the other.                 While
the nerve is passing through these stages, the muscles subject to the
 nerve likewise present      changes.      At the inner part of the fore-arm
 they slightly     contract, and     the little and      ring-fingers particularly
become     somewhat     flexed and     stiff, and their movements       imperfect.
Finally,   these muscular parts become quite paralysed, and               the little
 finger remains permanently flexed.
    Temperature.     — For the purpose of measuring accurately the               tem
perature of the parts supplied by the nerve during the various changes
in its condition, very delicate instruments are indispensable.                I  have
used for the present       experiments two standard thermometers of                M.
Geissler of Bonn, in which, although the reservoir is very small, the
tenth part of    a degree   Centigrade is easily read off by the naked eye.

    It  is almost unnecessary       to state that, in measuring the changes of
 temperature taking place in different parts of an organ such as the
 hand, two points as nearly homologous as possible in temperature
 must be chosen.         On the hand the intervals between the index and
 middle finger and        that between       the annular and little        finger are
 found to present       as   nearly   as possible the same temperature in the
 normal state.
    As thermometric         measurements       admit of far greater accuracy of
 expression     than those relating to sensibility and muscular action, but
 at the same time any general or average results require to be founded
 on a much greater number of observations to be entitled to value,                   I
 have thought     it preferable,   until such have been obtained, to state the
 numerical thermometric results of a few separate observations.

After the     lapse  of nearly    an hour, when the      little finger had    become

    From this point, as the paralysis gradually became complete,                  the
temperature over the hypothenar               eminence,     the inner side of the

                                          440
hand, and the two last fingers became gradually more elevated until
it reached 36° Centigrade.           At the   same time the temperature      of the
fingers and outside of the hand became                 lower, at length reaching
28° Cent., where it became stationary.               At this time the inner part
of the hand       presented   symptoms of active congestion of blood, being
red, and very hot to the touch, and the pulse strong, — symptoms
the more evident, by comparison with the outer fingers of the same
hand, where the temperature was                 so  much lower, and the pulse
weak.
    After the removal of the        ice from the nerve, sensibility and move
ment returned into the little finger, &c. in          a few  minutes without the
supervention of any hyperesthesia.
    The restoration of the normal temperature               was,   however, much

     The preceding observations show that considerable                  advantages
 may     be  derived from refrigeration        in physiological investigation on
 man     of the functions of    the superficial nerves.
    The following are the principal results : —
     1 . The first effect of the application of cold to the ulnar nerve on
 its sensory function is a state of hyperaesthesia              in the course of
 the nerve.
     2. This hyperaesthesia        is succeeded     by a state of quiescence      or
 freedom     from pain, which is followed by anaesthesia.

                                            441
     3. The first effect on the motory functions of the nerve is that of
 increased      excitability.
     4. This increase in its turn subsides, until all the parts below the
  refrigerated portion of the nerve are paralysed, owing to the inter
  ruption of its conductivity.
     5.   In this paralytic condition the        muscles    remain contracted to a
 certain extent, and the inner fingers in          a state   of flexion.
     6.   The first thermal     effect  of cold  on the nerve is frequently a fall
 of  temperature       of  0o-5 Centigrade at the inner fingers below that           of
 the outer fingers.
     7.   As the     nerve becomes     paralysed, the temperature of the two
 inner fingers rises above that of the outer to the extent of 5° or 6°
 Cent.      This is owing to the paralysis of the vascular nerves and
vessels     of the parts supplied by the ulnar nerve, and is of the same
nature as that in the ear after section              of   the sympathetic       nerve,
where, as       I   have   demonstrated,     the temperature may be lowered or
increased      at will by acting on the nerve by galvanism.
    8.    In my experiments        on the sympathetic*,         I have  observed    an
increase     of  1 0°  Cent. on the side operated on over that of the sound
side.    In the   above observations on man the increase at the inner fingers
was     =  5° Cent.     ; and it is probable that in cold weather a much
greater difference will be found in the temperature of the two sides,
because as the range is between            blood-heat, which is the maximum,
and the temperature of the part before the experiment, the extent of
the range is much greater in cold weather than in the present month
of August.
    9. While       the temperature     of  the inner part    of  the hand is rising,
that of the outer decreases, on account of the diversion of part of the
blood of the radial into the ulnar artery.               The same effect is wit
nessed after section        of the sympathetic, where a fall of temperature
of the sound          ear  coincides with elevation of temperature in the
opposite ear.
    10.    After the removal of     the refrigerating body, the nerve quickly
regains     all its original powers, except that the normal equilibrium of
temperature of the two sides of the hand is but slowly restored.                 It is
probable that this is to be attributed to the slowness of contraction
of the organic muscular fibres of the ulnar artery.

XI. " Note      on the Oxidation and Disoxidation effected by the
       Peroxide of Hydrogen."            By B. C. Brodie, F.R.S., Pro
      fessor of Chemistry in the University of Oxford. Received
       September 9, 1861.
   In  a former communication*          I laid before the Society        a detailed
investigation    as   to the remarkable disoxidation         of certain metallic
oxides   (of which the decomposition of the oxide of silver                may be
regarded   as  typical) by the peroxide of hydrogen.             I suggested   that
this decomposition was of a simple and normal chemical character                   ;
that the element oxygen was formed according to a molecular law
identical with that according to which compound substances                      are
formed   ;  and that the mutual decomposition             of the two    oxides was
determined by the synthesis of the particles of oxygen                 in opposite
polar conditions, according to the equation
                       AgaO+H,Oa=Aga+HaO + 0a.
   After   an interval    of nearly ten   years,    this explanation, together
with various facts bearing upon the theory of this action, and which
were   given   for the first time in the paper alluded to, have                been
reproduced     as   original discoveries   by Schonbein, Professor of Che
mistry at Basle f.
   The reaction      docs not, however,     present    itself under this simple
form.     The amount of oxygen lost by         the oxide    of silver is a variable
tpjantity, comprised between the extreme limits of the catalytic action
in which the reduction is zero, and the normal chemical action as
expressed    in the above equation.        The     reason   for this variation is
to be sought in the disturbing influence          of the metal     formed during
the decomposition.
   It is my intention shortly to communicate to the Society a prose
cution of the above inquiry, in which        I  investigate    the decomposition
by  the peroxide of hydrogen of certain           oxygenated      substances   con
tained in solution, where the perturbing causes which affect the de
composition of the solid oxides          and conceal      the simplicity     of the
reaction, do not exist.
   The methods by which the following results have been obtained
       * Phil. Trans, ii. 1850, 759.             t  Phil. Mag. [4] xvi.  178.

                                         443
will hereafter   be given    in detail.     I confine  myself to   a  brief resume
of the conclusions.
        * When an acid solution of permanganic acid is decomposed
    (1)
by peroxide of hydrogen, the decomposition is in an invariable atomic
proportion, according to the equation
                Mn40,+5Ha0a=2MnaO + 5Ha0 + 50a.
   (2) An alkaline solution of ferricyanide of potassium is reduced
by the peroxide of barium to ferrocyanide, with the evolution of
two atoms of oxygen, thus
     2 K3 Fea Cy8   + 2 KHO + Baa 03 = 2 K4         Fea Cye  + 2 Ba HO + Oa.
    (3) An alkaline solution of hypochlorite of barium is reduced by
the peroxide of barium, according to the equation
            BaC10 + BaaOa + HaO=BaCl+2BaHO+Oa.
A similar    change      takes   place,    as might    be anticipated,     with    an
aqueous    solution of chlorine         in the acid solution of peroxide of
barium, but more slowly.            I  have elsewhere    shown that the action
of iodine is    expressed    by the equation
                            Ia+BaaOa=2BaI+Oa.
    (4) The decomposition of chromic acid is of special interest.                  In
this case there are two distinct reactions, the first of which takes
place when chromic acid is in excess, according to the equation
                 2 Cra 03   + 3 Ha 0a= Crt 03 + 3 Ha     0 + 3 0a ;
the second, which occurs when a large excess of peroxide of hydrogen
is present,     and in which       the peroxide of hydrogen loses            exactly
double the amount of oxygen lost by the chromic acid, so that the
final result is expressed by the equation
                   2 Cra 03  + 6 H3   0a
                                          = Cr4 03 + 6 Ha0 + 08.
    In the interval     between     these reactions the ratio       of the   loss   of
oxygen from the peroxide to the loss from the chromic acid varies
between    the limits     1  and 2 according to a definite law, being pro
portional to the ratio of the masses of the substances               employed.       I
am able to show, by direct experiment, that the reaction between
   * This reaction has, I find, been published by Aschoff
                                                           (see Repertoire de Cliimie
Pure, August 1861, page 296).      It was last year made the subject of a communi
                                            " On the
cation by me to the British Association,              Quantitative Estimation of the
Peroxide of Hydrogen."

 the extreme limits is the sum of two distinct and simple atomic de
 compositions.
     The alkaline peroxides which produce            these   peculiar effects of
 reduction, under other conditions act         as  powerful oxidizing agents     ;
 thus an acid solution of ferrocyanide of potassium is oxidized by
 peroxide of hydrogen to ferricyanide.            Hydrated protoxide of man
 ganese is oxidized by peroxide of barium to the condition of peroxide
 of manganese.      A concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid evolves
 chlorine from peroxide of barium.
    This last reaction   I have made      the subject of a special investiga
 tion, with the view of determining the conditions under which the
 two reactions,
                  4 H CI + Ba,  Oa
                                   = 2 Ba CI + 2 H, O + Cl3,.
 and              2HCl+Baa0a = 2BaCl+HaO„
respectively take place     ; and  I  find that when      a solution of hydro
 chloric acid is boiled with peroxide of barium,        if the solution be con
centrated, chlorine,    if the solution be dilute, oxygen, exclusively is
evolved    ; and that for each intermediate degree of dilution chlorine
and oxygen together are evolved         in  a constant ratio.
    It  is thus seen that those differences         in the behaviour of the
different classes of peroxides, from which an imaginary distinction
has been drawn between        the oxygen respectively contained in them
as   positive   or negative,   are   not fundamental        and characteristic
differences.     The oxygen in the peroxide of barium is the same             as
that in the peroxide of manganese,            according to the only      test of
identity which we can apply, for we can produce with it the same
effects.     Nor are the peculiarities in the reactions of the oxygen of
the alkaline peroxides of such a nature as to need any special hypo
thesis to account for them ; for in no case are the combining proper
ties  of the particles of matter, like their atomic weights, constant for
each chemical substance,      but they are variable properties, depending
on the physical conditions in which the particles are placed,          and the
chemical substances with which they are associated.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF DECEASED FELLOWS.
    Sir Charles Barry            was born on the 23rd          of May,      1795, and
  was the son   of a respectable     stationer in Bridge Street, Westminster.
  Having displayed      an early and        striking   talent for drawing, he was
 articled at the age of sixteen to Messrs. Middleton                and Bailey, sur
  veyors in Lambeth, with whom he remained five years, acquiring the
 elementary    principles of his future profession,            and    those practical
 technicalities in which they were more particularly                   engaged  ;  and
 he was    occasionally a contributor to the Exhibition of the Royal
 Academy.
    In  1816 he lost his father, and having succeeded to a few hundred
 pounds, he determined        to go abroad in order to perfect himself in
 the highest walks     of his art.       He   there studied the masterpieces         of
 ancient  and modern architecture existing on the continent, making a
 most diligent use of his time        ;  for he was untiring in his application,
 and conscious of the great fruits to be derived from availing himself
 of every opportunity      of laying up       a rich treasury   of   reference  for an
 after time.     He    spent    several    months at Rome        ;    and with    some
 other brother artists of like tastes,         as  Sir Charles Eastlake, the pre
 sent President of the Royal Academy, and Mr. Kinnaird, Editor of
 the most recent edition of Stuart's 'Athens,' he passed on to Greece,
where he studied the Parthenon, Theseum, and other monuments of
the Periclean age, views of which he subsequently exhibited in the
Royal Academy.
    Having    exhausted     his means, he was on the point of returning
home, when an English traveller, Mr. Baillie, who was struck by the
freedom of his pencilling, and who wished to preserve some records
of   a projected tour in       Egypt      and Syria, engaged        young Barry to
accompany him       as  his artist  ;   and during 1818 and 1819 he had the
opportunity    of drawing the remarkable monuments                 and sites  of those
interesting countries.       In  1820 he returned to England, married, and
entered upon the practice of his profession.               He had for      some years
to struggle with the difficulties which usually fall to the lot of young
men commencing a professional career,                  even those      endowed    with
the highest qualifications, until they can procure opportunities of
showing the extent of their acquirements               and capacity for the actual
    vol. xi.                                                              a

                                           <<
business    of life.    His earlier works of      note were     St. Peter's Church
at Brighton and the Manchester Royal Institution,                which he gained in
competition.         These at once gave him a name.             He then built three
churches in Islington       ; and having thus established his standing in
the profession, he became           very largely employed.          The Traveller's
Club House, which he also gained in competition, the Free Grammar
School at Birmingham,          and the Reform Club, are remarkable speci
mens     of  the elegance and vigour       of his   taste in various styles     of art.
But the     great    monument of the present age is the Palace of West
minster, or Houses of Parliament,             the prize for which he carried off
from nearly 100 competitors.              This  was in 1836 ; but      it was not   till
 1840 that the works were actually commenced                ;  and considering the
immense       extent   of the building, the      elaborate    nature of its decora
tion, the variety of uses to which the several                 portions were to be
 applied, the accommodation to be provided, and the questions of
 light, ventilation,     and    selection   of materials which demanded the
 laborious and incessant          attention of the architect upon           this, the
 largest of modern edifices in Europe, we must feel surprised that he
 was    able   to go through       the harassing and arduous duties, and to
 complete it in twenty years.           We may quote the opinion, and words
 almost, of his able biographer, Mr. Digby Wyatt, and say that " no
 public building       of Europe      possesses   a  more ingenious or effective
 plan,    a more     perfect homogeneousness         of parts    and   style,  a more
 graceful outline under every point of view, and                   greater   technical
  excellences     and   beauty.      In vain will the most critical           observer
  wander into every nook and corner of that enormous structure and
 detect a neglected      point where the failing attention or ability of the
  architect has allowed        a degeneration      into meanness      of finish, dis
  symmetry of axes or leading features, or faulty proportion of line or
  detail."
     It  would constitute     a  long list to enumerate       the buildings of more
  or less importance in the metropolis and the provinces of which
  Barry    was the architect.       He   was a Royal Academician, and on the
  occasion    of the opening of the Houses of Parliament, he received the
  honour of knighthood from Her Majesty.                 To him also were awarded
  the great Gold        Medal of the Paris Exhibition of 1855,                and the
  Royal Gold Medal of the Institution of British Architects.                   He died
  somewhat suddenly on the 12th of May, 1860, at the age of 64, and

                                                    iii
he was buried in the nave                  of Westminster Abbey,           near the grave         of
his friend, Robert Stephenson,                  with all the public honours due to his
genius and worth.
     Barry      was   a   man    of rich    and varied imagination, and so difficult
to please, that he incessantly studied modification upon modification
during the progress of his works.                         He had   great power        of drawing,
and    a      thorough appreciation of form                ;   and so perfectly master was
he    of both Italian       and Mediaeval            art, which have        elements         of pro
portion, form, and decoration apparently at utter variance with each
other, that he treated them with equal judgment and taste.                                      But
it   was remarked that he had not an                           harmonious eye for colour.
He    was      untiringly laborious, and as practical architect he brought
                                                          a
to bear       a vast fund of scientific resource and daring intelligence. He
was    justly held in high professional estimation by the architects of
all countries, and was honoured                     by    all who knew him for his worth,
integrity, and independence                ;   and his name will descend to posterity
associated with the grandest and finest edifices of his time.
     Sir      Thomas      Macdougall Brisbane,                     Baronet, was the eldest
son and representative                of   an old family        of considerable       note    in the
west      of Scotland.          He   was born       at Brisbane House, the family seat
in Ayrshire, on the 23rd of                 July,    1773, and after    a   long, active, and
eventful life passed in various parts of the world, died at the same
place on the 27th         of January, 1860.
     As   was     usual with the sons of the landed gentry in Scotland, Sir
Thomas received            his early education at home under                a    private tutor,
and then studied for            a    time at the University of Edinburgh.                 He    was
finally sent to an Academy near London, where he had the oppor
tunity of attending lectures                   in the metropolis on various subjects,
including mathematics and astronomy.
     In   1   789 he began military life as an ensign in the 38th Regiment,
but having, on the breaking out of the war in                          1   793, raised        an in
dependent          company which was attached to the 53rd Regiment, he
joined the army in Flanders                    as   captain, and was present at the en
gagement          before Valenciennes and at the siege and capture                        of that
place, which were the first operations of the war.                          He   shared in the
severe winter's retreat through Holland in                       1794, and continued with
the Duke of York's army until its return                         to England      in   1795.      He
                                                                              a
                                                                              2

                                       iv
then sailed with the expedition under Sir Ralph Abercromby                  to the
West     Indies, where he remained for five years, and               was   at the
reduction of St. Lucia and St. Vincent, the capture of Trinidad, and
the attack on Porto Rico.         He also served throughout the whole
Caribbean war, and then went to Jamaica              as Lieutenant-Colonel       of
the 69th, where he remained till his regiment was called home.
    Having     in 1812 received   the appointment         of Brigadier-General
under the Duke of Wellington,          Sir Thomas immediately proceeded
to the Peninsula.       In the course of his services there he commanded
 a brigade in five general actions, besides a great many minor affairs             ;
 and he received the thanks of Parliament for the part he took in the
 battle of Orthes, where he had 700 men of his brigade killed and
 wounded.        At the termination of the war      he accompanied a portion
 of the Duke of Wellington's army to North America and served
 in the campaign of 1814, but returned to Europe the year following
 with twelve regiments to join the army of occupation in France,
 where he remained during         the three years         of its   stay   in that
 country.      A   year or two afterwards        Sir Thomas      was    appointed
 Governor     of New South Wales,          aud   entered  on the duties      of his
 office  in 1821.     During the four     years   of his government he made
 important ameliorations in the management of the convicts, turning
 their previously profitless labour to account in the clearance of the
 land and the service      of the colonists,     as well  as  to their own ad
 vantage    ; he introduced   the cultivation of the vine, the sugar-cane,
 cotton, tea, and tobacco,      and   improved      the breed of horses, by
 importations     at his own expense       from Mocha       and  Calcutta.      On
 his departure for Europe, he received the grateful acknowledgements
 of the colony, and    a prosperous district of that interesting region now
 bears his name.
     For  these eminent services, military and civil,      Sir Thomas     received
 the usual honours.       He  was created a Baronet and a         Knight Grand
 Cross of the Bath, and finally rose        to the rank of General.        But his
 military career, distinguished    as   it was, and his wise and beneficent
 colonial administration, are matters of less immediate interest here than
 the services he has rendered to science, and especially to astronomy.
     From his schoolboy days Sir Thomas was devoted to mathematical
 studies.     To his favourite pursuit of astronomy,          he was turned, as
 he himself states, by exposure to imminent danger in one             of his early

                                            V
voyages      through    a mistake     of the commander of the ship in                esti
mating the longitude;           an incident which        left on his mind         a deep
sense    of the practical    advantages    of   a  knowledge of astronomy.            His
warm attachment to the science which thus arose, never abated, and
he found means to indulge          it  even amid the distractions          of  an active
and adventurous military life, by making observations with a pocket
sextant    ;  and we have the testimony           of the Duke of Wellington that
he kept the time      of the army.        In the    same spirit he availed himself
of  a  brief interval during which         he returned home         in   1808, to erect
an observatory at Brisbane, his native place, in which he personally
worked       as an observer.      But it     was when appointed Governor                of
New South Wales that he was enabled                   to perform his greatest         ser
vice to Astronomy.           With this object in view, he carried with him
to the colony an         outfit of costly instruments, and immediately on.
his arrival in 1821, selected the site for an observatory at Paramatta,
and     set about the erection         of  a suitable    building; all       at his own
 expense.       Before leaving England           he had engaged         the services of
 Mr. C. Rumker, then          an astronomer        of considerable     experience,     and
 now one of our Foreign Members, to conduct the contemplated ob
 servatory.      His own public duties would, of necessity seldom admit
 of his devoting any material portion of his time to actual observa
 tion, yet he frequently took          a  personal share in the work            ;  and in
 particular,    a great    portion of   the transits were observed           by himself.
     On the return of Sir Thomas               and   Mr. Rumker to England,               a
 volume of the Observations made at Paramatta by Mr. Rumker and
 reduced      by him were, with Sir       T. Brisbane's approval,         presented     by
 Mr. Rumker to the Royal Society,              and constitute    Part   3 of the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 1829.
     It was through       the labours at this observatory that astronomical
 science became enriched with the large series             of observations of South
 ern Stars, for the most part communicated in the first instance                    to the
  Royal Society, but afterwards collected and published in                  1 835,  under
 the well-known title of        "The Brisbane Catalogue of Stars;" and                  on
 account of these observations,         and the great services rendered by him
  to Astronomy in the Southern Hemisphere,                 Sir Thomas       received the
  Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in                 1 828.     In   announ
  cing this award, the President, Sir           John    Herschel,     refers also to the
  observation of the solstices of 1 82      1 , 1 822  and  1 823 ;  the rediscovery of

                                       vi
Encke's Comet in its predicted place on the 2nd of June, 1822, when,
owing to its position in the heavens at its perihelion passage, it could
not be seen in Europe     ;  and the determination    of the length of the
pendulum at Paramatta.          Speaking of the observations of the places
of Southern Stars, the same pre-eminent authority characterizes them
as forming one of the most interesting and important series which
has ever been made, and considers that they must ever be regarded
as marking a decided era in the history       of southern astronomy   ; and
he concludes his address       in the following words : — " It   is for this
long catalogue of  observations,   whether scattered through the journals
of Europe, printed in our own memoirs, or deposited as a precious
charge in the care of a Body so capable of appreciating their merits,
but still more for the noble and disinterested example set by him in
the establishment of an Observatory on such a scale in so distant          a
station, and which would have equally merited the present             notice
had every observation perished on its voyage home, that your Council
have thought     Sir Thomas M. Brisbane deserving of the distinction
of a medal   of this Society."      It  may be added that this distinction
was not the less deserved, although it has been since found that from
causes which   Sir Thomas could not well      have obviated, the Catalogue
of Stars  has turned out to be a less valuable result     of the Australian
Observatory than its enlightened and munificent founder had reason
to anticipate.
   On his return from New South Wales, Sir Thomas founded                 an
Astronomical    Observatory at Makerstoun, a residence         he possessed
near  Kelso  ; and he subsequently established at the same place a
Magnetical Observatory, which he furnished with the best instruments,
and appointed with    a staff of able assistants, at his own charge.    The
magnetical observations made at this observatory since its erection
in 1841, up to 1849, have been published in three quarto volumes,
and a fourth, containing the later observations, is now in the press.
The copyright of these volumes has been presented to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and they now form part of the record of the
Society's Transactions.        For these magnetical observations,        the
Society awarded Sir Thomas the Keith Medal in 1848.
   Sir Thomas Brisbane        became    a Fellow  of the Royal Society in
1810  ;  he was also a   Fellow and Vice-President of the Royal Astro
nomical Society.     lie  entered   the Royal Society of Edinburgh      as a

                                       vii
Fellow in 1811, and in 1832 was unanimously elected President as
successor to Sir Walter Scott.         During his presidency he founded
two medals for the reward of scientific merit, one to be conferred by
the Royal Society of Edinburgh,          the other by the Scottish Society
of Arts.
    A list of Sir Thomas Brisbane's published contributions to science,
drawn up by his friend Alexander Bryson, Esq., F.R.S.E., will be
found in a memoir entitled " Reminiscences of General Sir T. M.
Brisbane," printed for private circulation, 4to, Edinburgh,              1860, to
which we have been chiefly indebted in compiling the present notice.
    Lieutenant-Colonel     William Martin Leake,              born in London,
January     1 777, was the son  of John Martin Leake,       a commissioner for
auditing the public accounts, and grandson of Stephen Martin Leake,
 Garter    Principal King-at-Arms.         He   was   educated     at the  Royal
Military Academy, Woolwich,         and in   1 794  obtained   a  commission in
the Artillery, and entered on the active duties of his profession in the
West Indies.       Five years later he was sent to Constantinople on             a
mission for the instruction of the Turks in the use of artillery            ; and
in 1800 he was one of the English           Officers selected to advise and
assist the Grand Vizier in his defence        of the southern provinces of
the Turkish Empire against the French.           Captain Leake consequently
travelled through Asia Minor, and, after some delay, ultimately joined
the Turkish army in Syria.         In  1801 he crossed the Desert with the
army into Egypt, and on the surrender of Alexandria he was appointed
to visit Upper     Egypt in company with Mr. William Hamilton, for
the purpose of making a general survey of that country.               The results
of their exploration were a map of the course of the Nile, from the
Cataracts to the sea    ; a determination of most of the ancient sites            ;
a  description of the monuments of antiquity, and a large collection of
observations    on the agricultural and commercial state         of  the country.
An account of their travels     was published by       Mr. Hamilton in      1809.
    Having returned to Syria in 1802, Capt. Leake there continued his
travelling researches     until the time of his departure for England.
He embarked on board the         vessel in which     the Elgin marbles were
placed for conveyance       to London,     and narrowly escaped with his
life from shipwreck off the Island of Cerigo.            In   1804 he received
orders    to survey the coasts and      interior of European Turkey,           the

                                         Vlll
fortresses     and means of defence, and to make their condition known
to the native chiefs and governors.           In pursuance of        these orders he
travelled during two years in Northern Greece                 and the Morea, and
discharged his duties to the full satisfaction of the home authorities,
while,     as  has been remarked,       " his peculiar      tastes   and talents for
research      received  full development in       a country where every day's
journey produced an historical problem, which it taxed his erudition
and critical acumen to solve."
     On the breaking out of hostilities between England and the Porte
in 1807, Capt. Leake was detained and held prisoner by the authorities
at Salonica, from which place            he, however, escaped          to the frigate
 ' Thetis,'         returned to               for the restoration of his health
              and                 England
 in 1808.
     From October of the same year until            1810     he again    travelled in
 the Levant, under command to open communications with                      Ali Pasha
of Joannina,       and other authorities     of the Ottoman government, with
a view to induce them to proceed            to offensive    operations against the
 French, by offers of naval assistance along the coast, and presents of
 ordnance and ammunition.            To    these  successive     years   of travel  he
 owed his knowledge        of the various countries, their        people and monu
 ments,     which afterwards proved so valuable and instructive in his
 literary labours.
     These labours were resumed          on his retirement from the army in
  1823, and      were  continued to the time of his death             on the 6th of
                1860.     His works                    ' Researches in
 January,                                 comprise                            Greece,'
  '
    Topography       of Athens,'    an   edition   of    *
                                                           Burckhardt's      Travels,'
 ' Travels in Asia Minor,'        ' Historical   Outline of the Greek Revolu
          '
 tion,'     Demi of Attica,'     besides    other books of travels         in Greece,
 and on the topography          and   coins   of that country, — a country for
 which he always felt the liveliest interest.           His sympathy for Greek
 nationality gained him the gratitude of the people, as manifested by
 the voluntary attendance        of the Greek minister        at his funeral.
     In  1838    Col. Leake married Mrs. Marsden, widow of William
 Marsden, Esq.,       F.R.S., the historian of Sumatra, and daughter of
 the eminent oriental scholar Sir Charles Wilkins, F.R.S.
     Col. Leake was a member of various learned societies, English and
 foreign.      He   became a Fellow    of the Royal Society in         1815, and was
 elected a member       of the Royal Society Club in           1828.     His intellee

                                       ix
tual vigour remained unabated to the close of a life prolonged to the
age of 83, and its results are left to us in works which
                                                                 " are models
of painstaking observation, available erudition, and perspicuous            sim
plicity."
   Joseph Locke       was born at Attercliffe, near Sheffield, in 1806, and
educated    at the Grammar School        of Barnsley,   whence he passed to
Newcastle-on-Tyne,      and there learned the elements        of engineering
under George Stephenson.         He   commenced      the active duties of his
profession on the Liverpool       and Manchester Railway, where during
four years he had full opportunity for applying principles to practice,
in the overcoming of ' engineering difficulties.'        And he was one of
those who, after the opening     of the line in 1830, aided in demonstra
ting the superiority of the locomotive engine over the other kinds of
motive power then proposed.         He next completed       the Grand    Junc
tion line connecting the Liverpool         and Manchester       Railway    with
Birmingham,      which   had been begun by George Stephenson,                and
established   a reputation   for economy       which he always afterwards
retained,   by keeping the cost within the estimate.           To this proof
that a railway could be made for less than          £ 15,000   a mile, and to
his habitually cautious methods,       he owed most     of his  success.     His
other principal works are the London and Southampton Railway              ;  the
Havre and Paris Railway, via Rouen           ;  the line from Barcelona to
Mattaro, and the Dutch-Rhenish         line.   Moreover, the Lancaster and
Carlisle, the East Lancashire, the Caledonian, the Scottish Central
and Midland,     the Aberdeen lines and Greenock Railway and Docks,
the Paris and Cherbourg line, were all constructed under his super
intendence, jointly with his partner, Mr. Errington.              He planned
lines also which were constructed by other engineers.
   Few men have excelled        Joseph Locke in resolute adaptation of
means to ends     ; even his greatest works display no signs of extrava
gance, and yet are efficient,   and appropriate to their situation.          He
had no unimportant share in the improvement of the locomotive, and
showed    the practicability  of making it travel over unusually          steep
gradients.
   Mr. Locke    succeeded Robert Stephenson as President          of the Insti
tution of Civil Engineers;       he was elected     a Fellow    of the Royal
Society in   1838, and from the year 1847, to the time         of his  decease,

                                           X
  he sat in Parliament        for Honiton.        He    was suddenly    and prema
  turely cut off by an attack of iliac passion at           Moffat, on the 1 8th of
  September,     1860.
     Charles May,         son  of   a member     of   the Society   of Friends, was
  born at Alton, Hampshire,           in the year 1800.         At  an early age he
  began   to exhibit proofs of the mechanical genius which became con
  spicuous in his later years, and with but little help from              schooling,
  for his education is said to have been scarcely             better than  that now
  within reach of workmen.         He   was apprenticed to     Mr. Sims,   a  chemist
  and   druggist of    Stockport, whose       daughter he afterwards       married ;
 and having returned to           Ampthill, to which town his parents had
 removed     from Alton, he     commenced business on his own account, as
 a  retail and manufacturing chemist, and to this in course of               time he
 added the business      of  a millwright.
     In  1836 he accepted       a  partnership with Messrs. Ransome,             agri
 cultural implement makers of Ipswich,                taking charge    of the engi
 neering department, and the results of his vigorous management
 were speedily     shown by the rising importance of the firm and increase
 of  business.    During this connexion Mr. May constructed a dome
 for the observatory at Hartwell House, and for Mr. Barclay's obser
 vatory at Bury      Hill, the   equatoreal   mounting for Ross' large object-
 glass, which occupied a conspicuous place in the              Exhibition of 1851,
 and the great Transit       Circle and the Altazimuth,          now in use at the
 Greenwich Observatory.            The latter   are deservedly    admired for their
 perfect construction, which completely realized the conceptions               of the
 Astronomer      Royal, and improved to an unprecedented                extent    the
mechanical resources         of astronomical       science.    Mr. May moreover
erected     an observatory for his own use, and              furnished it with      a
transit    instrument     and   clock, and a Merz achromatic telescope of
6| inches aperture.         And in other departments of the engineering
business    he  instituted experiments on the strength of iron, effected
improvements in the permanent way of railways, invented the com
pressed tree-nails for fixing railway chairs to the sleepers, and was the
                                           '            '
first to introduce the process of            chilling     for the pivots of large
instruments.
    Mr. May     was a member         of the Royal Astronomical Society           and
of the Institution of Civil Engineers         ;  he was elected into the Royal

                                       xi
Society in 1855.      He removed from Ipswich to London in 1851,
and died suddenly on the 10th of August, 1860, leaving behind him a
reputation for high professional ability, and for an amiable and bene
ficent disposition, varied by keen humour, in private life.
    The biography of Lord Macaulay belongs rather to the history
of Literature than to that of Natural Philosophy : he takes his pro
per place among the Statesmen,        Orators, Poets, Essayists, Historians
of England, not among her        men   of  Science.      With   a  mind so active
and wide-ranging, he could not but take deep interest in the progress
and in the marvellous discoveries of modern science; but he was
content to accept those results on the authority         of others,  and to dwell
on their political and social consequences,            rather than himself      to
follow out their slow and laborious processes, for which, indefatigable
as he was, he    had no. time, probably no inclination.           Yet the annals
of the Royal Society, which       has ever been proud to enrol among its
Members statesmen and men of letters of the highest eminence, can
not pass over in silence a name so illustrious      as  that of Lord Macaulay.
    Thomas Banington Macaulay                was born October 25, 1800, at
Rothley Temple in Leicestershire, the seat of his paternal uncle Thomas
Babington.      His father, Zachary Macaulay, resided at Clapham, one
of  those  earnest and zealous men who, with Mr. Wilberforce, led the
way in the strong religious reaction which followed the French Revo
lution,   and whom posterity     will honour      as   among    the earliest  and
most steady adversaries     of the African     Slave Trade, the advocates       of
the emancipation of the negroes           in our Colonies.        The perpetual
agitation of such questions,      involving the most        sacred principles of
human liberty, could not be without its effect on the precocious             mind
of   the young Macaulay.        Perhaps to his birth and training in that
school he owed in some degree his command of biblical illustration,
which, however, his strong sense and sober judgement always kept
within the limits of serious       and respectful reverence.          Family tra
ditions, happily only traditions, of his early promise, of his childish
attempts at composition in prose and verse, were not likely to be lost
among a strong religious party, bound together by common sympa
 thies, and maintaining      an   active    correspondence       throughout    the
 country.     The  fame of young Macaulay         reached the ears     of Hannah
 More, and, after receiving    a visit from him, the High Priestess of the

                                       acii   /
brotherhood, in an agreeable        letter, still extant, uttered an oracle
predictive of his future greatness.
                                            After a few years of instruction
at a small school in Clapham, at the age of 12 he was placed under
the care of the Rev.      Mr. Preston, first at Shelford, afterwards near
Buntingford, in the neighbourhood of Cambridge. Mr. Preston seems
to have been a man       of attainments and judgement.        He must   have
taught the Latin and Greek authors extremely well, for under his
instruction Macaulay became a sound and good scholar.                 He did
more, he fostered, that love for the great classical writers, without
which all study is barren and without durable impression.             He re
spected   too that great maxim, that no one is so well taught as by
himself.      Having    given or strengthened the impulse, he left the
                                                       for learning, and for
young scholar to his own insatiable avidity
books of all kinds.        The schoolboy sent an anonymous defence of
novel reading to the serious journal of his father's friends, the Chris
tian Observer, which was inserted. This passion for novel reading
adhered to him to the last ; he swept the whole range, not only of
English but of foreign fiction, not without great profit to the future
historian.       The higher   tastes which he then imbibed were equally
indelible  ;  his admiration of the unrivalled writers of Greece and Rome
grew deeper to the close of his life.           Homer and Thucydides, and
Tacitus, remained among his constant and familiar studies, and no
 doubt, without controlling him to servile imitation, exercised    a powerful
influence on his mode       of composition    and on his style.   Among his
father's friends holding the same religious opinions, was Isaac Milner,
 Dean of Carlisle, and Master of Queen's College, a man with a singu
lar union of profound mathematical acquirements, strong evangelical
views, and a peculiar broad humour.              During his visits to Milner
at Cambridge,        Macaulay   acquired that     strong attachment to the
 University, which, like his other attachments, seemed to become more
 strong and fervent with the progress of years.
    In his   1 9th year he began his residence at Trinity College, Cam
 bridge.     His career at Cambridge was not quite so brilliant as the
 sanguine expectations of his friends had foretold.          He had a repug
 nance for mathematics, or rather he was under the jealous and
 absorbing      spell of more congenial studies. That repugnance in
 after life was a subject of much regret ; he fully recognized the
 importance, almost the necessity, of such studies for perfect educa

                                         xiii
tion;     even   his scholarship,     probably  far more extensive,        wanted
that exquisite polish and nicety acquired only at our great public
schools, from which came his chief rivals.              He carried away, how
ever,    the Craven Scholarship,         two prizes for English verse,         and
finally, the object of his highest ambition, a Fellowship               of Trinity
College.      On this success he dwelt to the close of his life with pride.
It gratified   two of his strongest feelings, — attachment to Cambridge,
and the desire of some independent provision which should enable
him to enter on his professional career.           On the inestimable advan
tages    of such fellowships to young men of high promise and ability
but of scanty means, he always insisted with great earnestness, and
deprecated      any change in the academical       system     which should dimi
nish the number of such foundations, held,           as   he would recount with
his unfailing memory, by         so  many of our first public men.
     The Law     was the profession he chose     ;  he was called to the    Bar at
 Lincoln's Inn, February 1826; he took chambers, he read, he joined
the Northern Circuit. But literature was too strong for law. His
legal studies were no doubt of infinite value           ;  they were in truth in
dispensable      for his historical writings, and were hereafter to bear
fruit in    a sphere which his wildest imagination could not anticipate.
 He had       received,  indeed,   from    the discerning judgment         of Lord
Lyndhurst,       a Commissionership      of Bankrupts, 1827.         No doubt his
 Cambridge fame and general promise recommended him for that office.
 But it    was to letters that he was to owe his first opening to public
 life.    In letters  he had begun with modest contributions to a maga
 zine,   Knight's     Quarterly,    of  no great circulation,     but which was
 mainly supported by some of his Cambridge friends                  :  in this  ap
 peared     some   of his finest ballads.     On a sudden he broke out with
 an    article on Milton      in the Edinburgh Review, which perhaps
 excited greater attention than any article which had ever appeared,
 not immediately connected        with the politics of the day.        Taking the
 field in the same pages with the brilliant copiousness            of Jeffrey, the
 vigorous and caustic versatility of Brougham, the inimitable wit and
 drollery and sound sense of Sydney Smith,                 to say nothing of the
 writers in the rival Quarterly Journal, the young reviewer had struck
 out his own path.         In comprehensiveness       of knowledge, in the ori
 ginality and boldness of his views, in mastery over the whole history
 and the life    of the eventful times of Milton, in variety and felicity of

                                         xiv
illustration,    in vigour, fulness,   and vivacity of style, he seemed to
make an epoch and a revolution in review-writing.              Up to this time,
with   some excellent exceptions,       the articles in reviews had confined
themselves     to notices, more or less excursive, of new books, and to
discussions of the political or polemic questions of the day.                 The
article now aspired to be a full dissertation on the history of any great
period, on the life of any great man of any time, on the writings, on
the influence, on the merits of authors of the highest fame.              From a
review   it became an historical, biographical,        philosophical essay.
    This paper      was   followed by others of equal,        some    perhaps of
superior excellence,      each opening a new view into the vast          range  of
the author's       reading, showing his boldness and           independence of
judgement, the wonderful stores of his memory, his prodigality, some
times perhaps uncontrolled,         of allusion, illustration, similitude.      A
young Whig, of high and blameless               character, popular with        his
 friends, with the reputation of oratorical power in the Debating
 Rooms at Cambridge (he delivered one speech in London, we believe,
 at an Anti-Slavery Meeting, which made some noise), and the ac
 knowledged author of such articles in one of the two popular jour
 nals of the day, could not but command the attention, and awaken
 the hopes of his party.         If ever there was a nobleman a patron          of
 letters from a deep and genuine and discriminating love of letters, it
 was   Lord Lansdowne.         Lord Lansdowne      offered a seat in Parliament
 to the author of the admirable articles in the Edinburgh Review.
 On the     acceptance    of this offer there could      be no hesitation ; his
 political opinions were in the strictest unison with Lord Lansdowne's.
 Few public men have been so calmly, deliberately true to their first
 political opinions    as  Macaulay.     Unquestionably, change of political
 opinions, on full unselfish conviction, according to change of circum
 stances, may be the noblest act     of moral    courage,   especially in the face
 of  obloquy and misrepresentation.          The   best men may become wiser
 as  they grow older.       But to this trial Macaulay was never subjected,
 he was never     called upon to this effort of self-sacrifice. He was a libe
 ral in the highest and widest sense        ; some   may think that he carried
 these views too far, some not far enough.          But during life   he was un
 swerving, without vacillation.        The line which     he drew between con
 stitutional   liberty and     democracy in his early speeches on Reform
 and on the Charter, was precisely the same with that which he drew

                                            XV
late in life, in a remarkable letter on the prospects and probable
destiny of the United States of America.
    Four   years after he had been called to the bar, in               1 830,  Macaulay
was    returned to Parliament           for Calne.        His public life had now
commenced.         That public life it     may be convenient briefly to survey
in its  several phases, as Statesman,         Orator, Poet, Essayist, Historian.
 Such was his remarkable variety and versatility.                    Very few men in
deed have achieved         great things in such       different kinds of excellence.
    In Parliament       he    had too much wisdom, too much self-respect,
too much respect for his auditory (an auditory                  just in the main but
severe, sometimes        capricious in its justice, and jealous above all even
of merit,    if  obtrusive, importunate, or too self-confident), to thrust
himself forward at once into the foremost ranks.                       Till  the Reform
 Bill he was content to try his arms on rare occasions ; he would not
waste his power on desultory skirmishes and on trivial subjects.                    Upon
 that momentous question, the Reform of                 1 832,   he first put forth his
 strength. But of his speecheshereafter. Thereputationacquiredduring
 these   debates    secured     him a seat in Parliament, independent even
 on generous      and unexacting friendship        ;   he was returned, December
 1832, for the wealthy and populous borough                   of Leeds, enfranchised
 by the Reform          Bill.    In the year      1834, a great,          and no    doubt
 unexpected      change    took place in his prospects,           it might seem in his
 destination.      In   1832 he had accepted         the office of Secretary to the
 Board of Control.          In his official capacity (in 1834) he made a
 speech on      the   renewal    of the Indian Charter, a speech which may
 be read in no unfavourable comparison with Burke's                        most splendid
 orations.     In breadth      and comprehensiveness         of  view   it may compete,
 in fulness and accuracy surpass, in richness of diction rival the re
 nowned     orator  ;   of  course,    as the occasion was          so different,  it had
 nothing of the passion, the terrible picturesqueness,                the vituperation     ;
 but it had calm statesmanship,           and philosophical, or rather, perhaps,
 historical thought.         This    speech   of itself might seem to designate
 him to the Government            as a member of the New Council which was
 to legislate for     India.      The offer  was made.         The   vast field of   India
 was   of itself likely   to seize on his imagination        ;  he might aspire to be
 the legislator, as Heber          the religious missionary, of that wonderful
 realm. He had many friends, the family of Grant especially                     (the pre
 sent  Lord Glenelg      was the President      of the Board of Control),          closely

                                         xvi
connected     with India  ;  how much he had read or thought on the
 subject,  his papers on Clive and Hastings (written later) may never
 theless   bear testimony.       Still, no doubt, prudential motives, and
 those   of no  ungenerous   prudence, influenced his determination.                   By
 a few years     of economy,    careful but not illiberal, he might make a
 provision for his future life (he was a man with no expensive or
 prodigal habits) which might place him above dependence either on
the servitude of office, or the servitude of literary labour.                       There
 was   another incentive — his family had never                  been     affluent.   He
might add to the comforts and assist in the advancement                      of  those to
whom he was attached by the strongest domestic affections,                         a duty
which he discharged with unsparing generosity.                       In India    he took
his seat   as  Member of the Council and          as  President of the Law Com
 mission.     It has been supposed,      and indeed asserted, that this legis
lative mission was barren and without                result  ;   now, however, it is
 bearing its mature fruits.      After much, perhaps inevitable,              delay, and
 repeated    revisions, the Indian Criminal Code, in the formation                      of
which he took a leading part, and which he had enriched with most
valuable explanatory notes, will, with some alterations, and those not
substantial, from January next have the force of law throughout
 British India.      Macaulay's     share in this great         work, especially      his
notes, is declared    by those who have        a  right to judge on such sub
jects, to have placed his reputation         as a  jurist   on a solid foundation.
 It is the first, and therefore the most important, of                  a series  of ope
rations upon the judicial        system   of India, which will            have    a great
effect   upon the state of society in that country                 ;   and will not be
without influence upon the jurisprudence of England.
    Soon after his return to England            in 1838, in January 1840, he
was elected by acclamation,        representative      of the   City of Edinburgh ;
that seat he filled undisturbed till      July 1847.           He had already been
named on the      Privy Council,    and had accepted the office            of Secretary
at  War. He      was Secretary     at War, with      a seat    in the cabinet, about
two years, from 1839         to   1841.    On the return of his friends                to
power, he became,       July  12, 1846, Paymaster           of the Forces.
    But throughout this period of his life            the  great      inward struggle
was going on within his mind between the ambition                     of public useful
ness,  of parliamentary     and official distinction, and         the love of letters,
which will rarely brook a rival on the throne, the still higher ambition,

                                         xvii
as he thought,      of adding   some great work to the treasures                      of English
thought      and English literature.            In the   office at         Whitehall or the
Horse Guards, on the benches of the House of Commons, amid the
applauses     or admiring       silence    of the House, his heart                was     in his
library, and among his books.              He yearned for        a place not so much
among the great parliamentary leaders andthe famous statesmen of the
land, the Chathams, Burkes, Foxs, as among the immortal writers
in verse and prose,        the Miltons,         Clarendons, Addisons,                  Gibbons.
The auditory which           he coveted         was    that vast       expanding world
throughout which the English language is spoken                        ;    the fame, that
which will only die with the death of English letters.             Throughout
the whole time of his absence             from England, on his voyage to India
and on his return, in India,        as    far as leisure would allow, and during
his parliamentary and official career, he was still with his indefatigable
industry     heaping up stores of knowledge, stores which                             could not
overload his capacious and retentive            memory, —memory,                 whose grasp
and self-command seemed to expand with its accumulating treasures,
— memory,         which disdained nothing        as   beneath    it,   and was never per
plexed or burdened by its incalculable possessions.                              As   a   curious
instance of his range and activity of reading, among the books which
he took with him to India, were                 the many huge volumes of St.
Chrysostom's works. Their still almost pure and harmonious Greek,
and their importance in the history of religious opinion (always                               a
subject of deep interest), carried him through                a   task which has been
achieved     by few professional theologians.             As     au illustration           of his
powers of memory, he has said, and he was                 a   most unboastful man,
that   if   Milton's great   poem were lost, he thought that he could ac
curately commit to writing           at least all the first books of Paradise
Lost.
  This life-long inward strife, which perhaps might have remained
unreconciled till towards the close of his days, came to sudden and           a
unexpected issue.         At the election in             1847,     Macaulay             was   the
rejected candidate      for the City of Edinburgh.               Nor       can   it   be denied,
though those who admire Macaulay will not admire him the less,
that he was accessory to his own failure.                  The         event turned on          a
religious question, in which Edinburgh,                 true to its old Scotch pre
judices, adhered to the less liberal view.                 Macaulay              could not be
persuaded to humour, to temporize, even to conciliate.                            He took the
   vol.     XX.                                                                   b

                                                xviii
loftiest tone, boldly, indignantly rebuked the voters for their narrow, in
his estimation, discreditable bigotry. He felt, there can be no doubt,
this blow at the time bitterly.              He     was perhaps not suited for,      he
had never before         been   tried in the rough and coarse work of the
popular canvass and the hustings             ;    he was distressed at the desert ion
or the lukewarmness           of friends      ;    he was   ashamed,    as  he openly
declared,   of the   disgrace which        Edinburgh inflicted on herself. In
a striking poem, recently published, in which are some of the finest
stanzas in the language, he gave full vent to his feelings of indig
nation. and sorrow.        But    at the same time, and in the same poem,
he finds and expresses          his lofty sense of consolation.             The great
debate was ended ; he was released              ; he was emancipated from public,
from parliamentary life.          He might retire with diguity and honour
to the undisturbed, undistracted cultivation of letters ; henceforth his
study was his scene of action         ;  literary fame was to be the undivided
mistress   of his  affections,    his earthly exceeding great reward.           Edin
burgh made      a few     years after noble amends by returning Macaulay
(at the election in 1852) without solicitation, without expense, even
without the usual flattery of a personal canvass ; he had but to
appear,   to accept, and return thanks for his ovation.                    He  sat  for
Edinburgh from July         1852 to 1856.             But  he sat without the tram
mels, without     the least desire of office           : he spoke rarely, but never
without effect.      In    1856,    failing health compelled him to resign
that honourable post.           Some      other honours, but          honours which
belonged to a man of letters, awaited him and courted his acceptance.
He   was   Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1848 ; Trustee
of  the  British Museum, February 1847 (an office which he highly
esteemed, and to which he attended with                   much assiduity, and with
great   public advantage)       ;  Fellow of the Royal Society, November
 1849;    Foreign    Member of the French Academy, May 1857, and
of the Prussian Order of Merit (1857); High Steward of Cam
bridge (1857).         In the same year he was raised to the peerage, a
tribute to his high and blameless                 character and transcendent lite
rary distinction,     and an act of royal favour, quite unexpected,                 but
highly approved by all        whose approbation was            of real value.
    So far our imperfect        sketch has exhibited Lord Macaulay                 as a
public man, as a jurist, and as a statesman ; some words must follow
as to his rank as an orator.                It is remarkable how rarely in this

                                        xix
country the famous and commanding public speaker, either in par
liament or even at the bar, and the great writer, have met in the
same person.       Bolingbroke,      Burke,   and Macaulay      (the unrivalled
comedies    of Sheridan,   the State Papers and exquisite political satires
of Canning are hardly in point) stand perhaps alone.                    If  all the
writings of Chatham, Pitt, Fox, Erskine, Peel, had been              suppressed,
 the world would have suffered          no great    loss.   Macaulay       had no
 thought of resting his fame on his parliamentary speeches            ;  he would
 willingly  have left them to the rarely visited cemetery          of the parlia
mentary history. He was placed under compulsion by the act of a
 piratical bookseller, who printed many of them (insinuating that he
 did so by authority) bristling with blunders, bad English, loose argu
ment, errors and mistakes about events and persons,            everything most
abhorrent      to Macaulay's taste and judgement.            He   was under the
necessity    of publishing     a more    trustworthy    edition.    We     confess
some gratitude for this bad act      of the unprincipled Curll of our         days,
for some of these speeches appear to us oratorical compositions of the
highest order.      By all    accounts     Macaulay's    delivery was far too
 rapid to be impressive     ; it wanted    also variety and flexibility      of in
 tonation.     Even the most practised reporters panted after him in
 vain  ; how much more the slower intellects of country gentlemen              and
 the mass    of the House   !  This,  however,   only heightens our astonish
 ment    that speeches    so full,   so profoundly     meditated,   yet with so
much freedom, with no appearance of being got by heart, with such
prodigality of illustration and allusion, should be poured forth with
 such unhesitating flow, with such bewildering quickness of utterance.
To    read them with delight and profit, we read them rather slowly ;
we can hardly conceive that they were spoken less deliberately.                   It
maybe questioned, and has been questioned, whether Macaulay was, or
could have become, a masterly debater.          This accomplishment,        except
in rare   examples,  is acquired   only by long use and practice.            When
Macaulay entered the House, the first places were filled by men of
established influence and much parliamentary training.               Even if he
had felt called     upon to make himself more prominent, it may be
doubted whether he could have sufficiently curbed his impetuous
energy, or checked his torrent         of words.     He would    have found       it
difficult to assume the stately, prudent, reserved,         compressed      reply  ;
he might      have  torn his adversaries'      arguments to shreds,        but he
                                                                  b2

would not have been content without             a  host of other arguments, and
bo  would have destroyed        the effect  of his own confutation.         Still it is
remarkable that on two occasions             a speech     of Macaulay's actually
turned the vote of the house, and carried the question (a very rare
event) in his own way,
                            — the debate on the Copyright Act, and the
question of Judges holding seats in the House of Commons.                   Though
he took his seat,    Lord Macaulay       never spoke in the House          of Peers ;
he went down, we believe,           more than once, with the intention of
 speaking, but some unexpected turn in the debate deprived him of
 his opportunity   ;  his friends, who knew the feeble state of his health
 at that time,    were almost rejoiced at their disappointment                in not
hearing him in that which would have been so congenial a field
for his studied and matured eloquence.
    As  a poet, the fame    of Macaulay       rests, with the exception        of the
stanzas    above   alluded to, and        one     or two small pieces, on his
                 '                                                              '
                   Lays of Rome,' his          *                    *
Ballads,    his                                  Armada,' his         Cavalier    and
'Cromwellian,'      and his   '
                                 Ivry  and Moncontour.'           In other depart
ments    of poetry  he might have been endangered             by his affluence and
prodigality   ; his prize poems, and some of his early writings betray
the danger.      But the   essence     of the ballad, of popular poetry (for
which in all its forms, from the Prince of ballad writers Homer,
to the common street ballad, which he caught up instantaneously,
and    could repeat     by the score,       he had an        absolute passion), is
simplicity — simplicity not inconsistent with the utmost picturesque-
ness, with the richest word-painting.              Its whole    excellence is in ra
pidity of movement,      short sudden transition, sharp emphatic touches
of  tenderness    or of the pathetic, in above          all, life, unreposing, un
flagging, vigorous, stirring       life, with words enough, but not an idle
word, words which         strike home to the heart, and rivet themselves
on the memory ; a cadence which enthralls and               will not  die away from
the ear.     The popularity of Macaulay's ballads is the best proof of
their excellence ; they have become the burden of a host of imitators.
Popularity may be a bad test of some of the higher kinds of poetry.
Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, to be fully appreciated, may require a
thoughtful, refined, enlightened constituency ; ballad poetry may be
safely left to universal suffrage.
   Even in his famous        Essays Macaulay had not satisfied              his own
ambition, nor reached that place after which he aspired in English

                                          xxi
 letters.    He   seemed disposed     to leave them buried in the voluminous
 journal in which they had appeared. Here, however, it was the honest
  admiration of the public, not the base desire of a bookseller for
 gain, which suggested        and indeed compelled their separate publica
 tion.    America      set the example : the first collection was made         to
 gratify the laudable curiosity of those who are spreading our language
  and our literature over a continent to which our island is but a
 speck in the ocean.        However flattering this homage, American edi
 tions are not to be implicitly depended upon, and are confined to their
 own use.     It  became necessary to answer the demand in England, and
 edition after edition has followed in rapid unexhausted succession.
 On these essays (not perhaps fitly so called, at least very unlike the
 short essays on religious, moral, social subjects, such as Bacon's,
 Cowley's, Addison's, Johnson's,         Goldsmith's) we cannot of course
 speak    at length.      They are rather philosophical, or historical dis
 quisitions, and are remarkable in the first place for their vast range
 and variety.        Some grapple with         the most profound       questions,
 — the Baconian philosophy, the law of population against Mr. Sadler,
 and what is called the Utilitarian philosophy.            This  essay Macaulay
himself, with noble moderation and self-respect,           refused to include in
his own selection, not because he was disposed to retract one argument,
 or to recede from the severity of his judgement on the opinions which
 he undertook to refute, but because he had not done justice to the         high
 character of his adversary, the late        Mr. Mill.     Some belong to lite
rary criticism, on which he delighted to mingle singularly acute and
original observations on the biographies of distinguished authors, their
place in society ; and the articles on Dryden, the Comic Dramatists
of Charles       II.,  Temple, Addison,       Johnson,   Byron,   are  the most
full, instructive, and amusing views           of the literary life of their re
spective ages, as well as     of their specific works. The greater number,
however, and doubtless the most valuable of the essays, are those
which belong to history        ;  a few to the history    of Europe,  — Machia-
velli, Ranke's       Lives of the Popes, Frederick        the Great, Mirabeau,
Barrcre.      In   these two Inst, his judgements on the acts and on the
men of the French Revolution are very striking.               But the chief and
the most important are those on English History.                This  was mani
festly the subject which he had thought on most profoundly, inves
tigated with the greatest industry, and studied down to what we may

                                          xxn
call the very dregs and lees of our political and social and religious
life.    There     is hardly an important         period, at least    in our later
history, which has not passed under his review.                  With the justly
honoured exception of Hallam's              Constitutional   History, Macaulay
usually dismisses        his author with a few        words of respect or con-
tempt, and draws almost altogether on his own resources.                     So Bur
leigh gives us the reign of Elizabeth             ;  Bacon that of James          I. ;
Milton, Hampden, of Charles I. and the Republic                  ;  Temple (with
Mackintosh's        History), Charles II.       and the Revolution;           Horace
Walpole, Chatham, Pitt, the Georges ; Clivc and Hastings, the rise
of our Indian Empire, The variety of topics is almost as nothing
 to the variety of information          on every     topic ; he seemed       to have
 read everything, and to recollect all that he had read.
   -
     As to the style of    these essays,  of Macaulay's style in     general, a few
 observations.       It was eminently his own, but his own not by strange
 words, or strange       collocation of words, by phrases of perpetual oc
 currence, or the straining after original and striking               terms of ex
 pression.     Its characteristics   were vigour and animation, copiousness,
 clearness, above all, sound English, now a rare excellence.             The vigour
 and life were unabating ; perhaps in that conscious strength which
 cost no exertion he did not always gauge and measure                   the force of
 his   own words.         Those who      studied the progress of his writing
 might perhaps sec that the full stream,             though it never stagnated,
 might      at first overflow its banks       ;  in later days     it ran with       a
 more direct undivided torrent.           His   copiousness  had nothing tumid,
 diffuse, Asiatic; no ornament for the sake of ornament.                   As to its
 clearness, one may read         a sentence     of Macaulay    twice,    to judge of
 its full force, never to comprehend its meaning.                His English     was
 pure, both in idiom and in words, pure to fastidiousness             ;   not that he
  discarded,   or did not make free use of the plainest and most homely
 terms (he had a sovereign contempt for what is called the dignity of
  history, which would keep itself above the vulgar tongue), but every
  word must be genuine English, nothing that approached real vul
  garity  ;  nothing that had not the stamp of popular use, or the au
  thority of sound English writers, nothing unfamiliar to the common
  ear.
     The Essays,      however, were but preparatory, subsidiary to the great
  history, which was the final aim, and the palmary ambition of Macau

                                           xxiii
  lay.  On the function, on the proper rank, on the real province and use
  of history,    he had meditated long and profoundly.                 His ideal of   the
  perfect historian, such as he aspired to be, may be found in an essay,
  somewhat      too excursive, in the    Edinburgh Review, republished in the
  recent volumes.        A  perfect    history, according to Macaulay, would
  combine the unity and order of the great classical historians, with the
  diversity and immense        range    of modern affairs.           This  was but one
  condition   ;   the history would       not be content with            recording the
  wars and treaties,      the revolutions and great constitutional changes,
 the lives of kings, statesmen, generals         ;  it would     embrace the manners,
 usages, social     habits, letters, arts, the whole life of the nation.                It
 would cease to be haughtily aristocratic             ;  it would show     the progress
 of the  people in all its ranks and orders.            There can be no doubt that,
 as to the actual life      of certain periods,         Shakespeare     and Scott are
 more true and trustworthy historians than Hume or even Clarendon.
 Why should not         romance    surrender up the province which it had
 usurped    1    Why should not all this, which is after all the instructive,
 not to say amusing part of the annals of mankind, be set in a frame
 work of historic truth, instead of a framework of fiction?                If we would
 really know our ancestors,         if  we would really know mankind,                and
 look to history for this knowledge, how can history, secluding itself in
 a  kind of stately majesty, affect to disdain this most important part
 of her office 1 Nothing can be more clumsy than the devices to
which the historian sometimes has recourse.                   It  may be excusable     in
historic dissertations (the form which Hallam's works have assumed)
to have the book half text, half notes, — broken, fragmentary, without
continuity.       Hume and Robertson took refuge in appendices,                in which
they sum up with unsatisfactory brevity, what they have wanted
skill to   inweave     into their narrative.        Henry's history may         be read
as  containing what Hume left out.            If there is      in notes much beyond
citation of authorities, perhaps comparison of conflicting authorities
(we may perhaps pardon in Gibbon something more), this can only
show that the historian has an unworthy conception of his high art, or
that he wants the real power and skill of an historian.                    But to this
lofty view of the historian's function who is equal ?                   It  required all
Macaulay's        indefatigable   research    ;    for     the historian,     the   true
historian, must not confine himself to the chronicles and annals, the
public    records,    the state   papers, the          political   correspondence      of

                                                                 xxiv
 statesmen          and ambassadors                     ;    he must search              into, he must make
 himself          familiar with               the lowest, the most                   ephemeral,         the most
 contemptible of the writings of the day.                                        There is no trash which
 he must not digest                     ;    nothing            so   dull and wearisome that he must
 not wade through.                          Nor    are books all          ;   much is to be learned from
 observation         ;      and Macaulay delighted in rambliug over England,                                     to
 visit the scenes of historic events, the residences of remarkable men                                                :
 the siege of Derry was described                                from Derry and its neighbourhood ;
the exquisitely true and                           vivid epithets with                   which he paints the
 old Italian towns in his Roman ballads owe their life and reality to
his travels          in Italy.               Finally, to order,               dispose,    work into a flowing
 and uninterrupted narrative, the whole of this *matter demanded                                                no
 thing less than his prodigious memory, ever at the command of his
imagination             ;   to arrange it without confusion, to distribute it accord
ing to the laws of historic perspective,                                 to make     it,   in short,   a   history,
as difficult to lay down as the most stirring and engrossing romance.
       Alas   !   that all this matchless power and skill should end in                                           a
torso, — yet        a       torso   if,     as we       fairly may, we take the Revolution and
the reign of William                        III.   as   a    whole, nearly complete in its stature,
and in all its limbs                    !     It   is       deeply to be lamented that Macaulay
allowed himself to be called off by generous and grateful friendship
to write the lives in the Encyclopaedia.                                        All of     these, even that      of
Pitt (as far             as   it   goes,      a    perfect biography),              we would willingly          sa
crifice      if    we could         fill up the few                  chasms in his history.            And what
would we not give for his Queen Anne?                                          William      III.,   to whom he
first did justice, and not more than justice, when looked upon from
a   European, not from an English point of view, was                                        a   labour of love   :
but what would have been the more congenial                                         age    of Anne, in which
he knew every one, the Queen and her Court, Harley, St.                                             John, Swift,
Pope, Arbuthnot,                   as   if   he had lived with them on the most intimate
terms    ?        That in the main Macaulay                            possessed the still higher quali
ties    of    a   historian, truth and impartiality,                             we hesitate        not to avow
our opinion  of this posterity will judge, we quietly and confidently
                    ;
await its award.   He spoke out too freely, too strongly, not to en
counter some prejudices, some no                                       doubt very honest political              or
religious feelings.                 He did not perhaps always nicely                                measure    the
strength of his own language                                ;    and he so abhorred meanness                  and
dishonesty, that they appeared                                  doubly mean and dishonest in men

                                                   XXV
of great         fame     and high       pretensions.           As     to Marlborough,            we are
content to place            Mr. Hallam's           even more condemnatory verdict by
the side of Macaulay's              ;    and Macaulay had not reached the brighter
part of Marlborough's               career    ;   in the last volume that great man is
already shaking off the slough of his baser life.                                 Penn's double and
conflicting character (assuredly no rare occurrence in history) must
be viewed           on all sides.        In   Pennsylvania, the wise, Christian legis
lator, worthy of all praise,                he was, in England,                   a vain busy man,
proud Jof his influence with the king, who found it his interest to
flatter him, and unable to keep himself out of the miserable intrigues
of that miserable court.
     A     few    sentences       on Macaulay's            conversational powers, on his
private life still fewer.           There is a common impression that in society
he was engrossing and overpowering.                              Every one has                heard the
witty saying of his old friend (no two men could appreciate each
other more highly or more justly) about " flashes of silence." But
in    the quiet intercourse with                   the single friend, no great talker
was more free,             easy and genial, than Macaulay.                            There was the
most equable             interchange of thought             ;    he listened with               as much
courtesy,         as    he spoke with             gentle    and pleasant               persuasiveness.
In    a   larger circle, such       as he     delighted to meet and assemble around
him to the close of his life, a few chosen                              intimates, some accom
plished       ladies,      foreigners      of the highest                distinction,         who     were
eager to make his acquaintance, his manners                                  were frank and open.
In conversation in such                  a circle, a commanding                      voice,    high     ani
mal spirits, unrivalled                 quickness of apprehension, a flow of lan
guage       as rapid as inexhaustible,               gave him perhaps a larger share,
but       a share      which few were not delighted to yield up to him.                                 His
thoughts were             like lightning,         and clothed themselves                      at once     in
words.        While other        men were     thinking what they should                  say, and how
they should say            it,   Macaulay had said          it       all, and    a   great deal more.
And the          stores which his memory had at instantaneous command                                 !   A
wide range of Greek and Latin history and literature, English, French,
Italian, Spanish; of German he had not                          so    full   a   stock, but he knew
the best works           of the   best authors; Dutch he learned for the purpose
of his History.             With    these     came       anecdote,           touches of character,
drollery,        fun, excellent stories           excellently told.               The hearer often
longed for Macaulay's memory to carry off what he heard in                                       a   single

                                           XXVI
   morning, in an after-dinner colloquy, or in a few hours in a country
   house.
      Lord Macaulay       was never married      ;  his strong domestic affections
  were chiefly centred in his sister, happily married to his friend                   Sir
   Charles Trevelyan, and her family.              Her children       were   to him as
  his own, and cherished with almost parental tenderness.                  As  a friend,
  he was singularly stedfast ; he was impatient            of anything disparaging
  of   one for whom he entertained sincere         esteem.      In the war of political
  life, he made, we believe, no lasting enemy                ;   he secured    the un
  swerving attachment of his political          friends, to whom he had been
  unswervingly true.        No  act inconsistent with the highest honour and
  integrity was ever whispered against him.               In all his writings, how
 ever     his opinions,   so  strongly uttered, may have given offence                 to
 men      of different   sentiments,    no sentence      has been       impeached     as
 jarring    against the loftiest principles   of honour, justice, pure morality,
 rational religion.
      In early life  he was robust and active         ; and    though his friends at
 a later period could not but perceive the progress               of some mysterious
 malady (he was long harassed by            a distressing cough), yet he rallied
 so frequently, and seemed to have so much buoyancy                   of constitution,
 that they hoped he might have life to achieve his great work.                       He
 himself felt inward monitions        ;  his ambition receded         from the hope
 of reaching     the close   of the first Brunswicks       ; before    his last illness
 he had reduced       his plan to the reign     of Queen Anne.
     His   end, though not without warning to those who watched him
 with friendship and affection,         was sudden       and singularly quiet ; on
 December 28, 1859, he fell asleep and woke not again.
     He   was buried,   January    9, I860,   in Westminster Abbey, in Poet's
 Corner, his favourite haunt        ; and he was known to have expressed               a
modest hope that he might be thought worthy to repose there with
the illustrious dead.      He   lies at the foot     of Addison's     statue,  near to
Johnson, and among many other of our most famous statesmen and
men     of letters.
     The following notice of Professor Powell is taken from the Report
for 1861 of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society, of which
he was a distinguished member.
     "The Rev. Baden           Powell       was the      eldest    son   of the    late

                                            xxvii
Rev. Baden Powell,            of Langton       in Kent,    and was born at Stam
ford Hill,    near London,        in 1796.       He graduated      at Oxford,      where
he took     a  first-class degree in mathematics in 1817.                  In  1820     he
entered     into holy orders, and in the following                year obtained the
vicarage     of Plumstead in Kent.            He  was appointed Savilian Professor
of Geometry in        1827, and       Public Examiner      soon afterwards      ;  a post
with which he was again honoured in 1831.                       He thus     stood,   as  it
were, the acknowledged representative                of mathematical and physical
science    in the elder English University, — we may almost                       say the
only representative        ;   for when he first obtained the professorship,
science was at the lowest ebb at Oxford.                Mr. Powell     exerted himself
 to bring this state      of things before the educated world, by which he
 incurred some        obloquy.         But he persevered, and succeeded ; the
 honourable position which Oxford now holds, and the bright pro
 spects   of the future,      are due in good part to the exposure and remon
 strance   of the Savilian Professor.
     " He performed the duties of his chair with urbanity,                   seeking    to
 encourage      his students       by explaining and familiarising           each point
 that would allow of it            ;  towards which he had a happy talent of
 constructing his own models, of the simplest materials,                   for his prac
 tical illustrations.        Thus, whenever         requested   to deliver lectures      at
 public institutions,        he came armed with          appropriate diagrams and
 forms that essentially aided the comprehension of those who crowded
  to hear him.       We    have      thus seen the Undulatory         theory of Light
 treated,    and Diffraction         made  — we   may say — palpable.          The Pre
  cession   of   the   Equinoxes,        and the     phenomena of Aberration and
  Nutation,     were rendered equally visible ; and the hurried progress
  of Comets when approaching                 the   perihelion,   was    so   attractively
  shown,   that the audience           flocked down, after the lecture, to watch
  the comet      vary its speed through its long ellipse towards the sun.
   His style of delivery         was     peculiarly quiet, showing his own clear
  conviction and comprehension of his subject               ;  and his calmness        was
  caused by depth        of thought.         This   sedatcness   of manner      pervaded
  all his writings      and discourses,       enabling him even to preach extem
  pore on the most intricate doctrinal points without wandering from
  his subject.
      " Meanwhile he had produced various works, as well scientific as
                                                                      '
   theological.      Among the first class may be cited his             Treatise on the

                                         xxviii
  Differential and Integral Calculus;' and another on the 'Geometry
  of Curves.'       In   1834 he published        his 'History of Natural Philo
  sophy,' and in 1841 the 'Undulatory Theory of                    Light;'     besides
  which   he was the author of several                                '
                                                             in the Philosophical
                                                     papers
                   '
  Transactions        on  Light, Heat, and Irradiation.         Moreover, his tracts
  appear in the records of this [the Astronomical] Society, the Ash-
  molean collections, and the volumes of the British Association.                   In
  the other order of his writings              we have     to enumerate — besides
 those for the elucidation of pure religion — the ' Connexion of Natural
 and Divine Truth,' 1838 ; the ' Unity of Worlds,' 1855 ; ' Christianity
 without      Judaism,'      1857;   on     the 'Study       of the Evidences of
 Christianity,'      1860, &c.
     " During    the last years of his life        Mr. Powell   was a controversial
 theologian.       His writings    were   of  a cast  which is called liberal by all,
 but by some in one sense, by some             in another.     The   freedom    of his
 criticism could not but provoke strong attack from his opponents.
 Of the controversy this Society         can take no cognisance,         but it must
 be remarked, as a mere matter          of biography, that in his       assault upon
 some modes       of theological thought, to which the University once
 appeared    unalterably given, Mr. Powell seems to have been as much
 of  a precursor as in his efforts          to stimulate science.         The last of
                                                 '
 his writings appears as one of seven Essays and Reviews,' most                     of
 his colleagues being Oxford men           ; and    the whole of this work, which
is in its fourth edition, shows          that Oxford names of no mean note
 are now pledged to admit that freedom              of examination which brought
so much assault upon the isolated individual who first used it while
actually connected with the University.                Every meeting of educated
men will contain          those  of the most opposite        views  as to his con
clusions   ;  but all will admire the fearless manner in which, without
reference    to his own interests,      he spoke out the conclusions           of his
mind.
    "In   the year 1850         Baden     Powell     was   appointed one of the
Government Committee of inquiry into the studies enjoined in Oxford                  ;
he being well known as an ardent educational reformer, a fact pretty
well evinced in his tract on ' State Education,' considered with refer
ence to 'prevalent        misconceptions on religious grounds.'             In  1854
he was selected, at Aberdeen, one            of  the three judges to award the
valuable Theological Burnett Prizes in that city.                Nor  was the range

                                      xxix
of his capacity confined to argumentative studies only ; for he not
only possessed a large fund of general information, but was also a
proficient in painting, and was well practised in the choral harmonies
of church music, in which      science he was a strong amateur.
    " The   Professor's lamented death, on the       1 1th    of June,   1860, was
the result of an attack on the lungs which commenced in the previous
winter.     He had    been duly warned       of his    danger     by his medical
friends and attendants, several weeks before he expired              ;  but he was
resigned to the last, his only uneasiness being      a   difficulty of breathing,
which, after a few days of extreme debility, terminated his existence.
He died at his     house in Stanhope Street, Hyde          Park Gardens,     at the
age   of 63, having   scarcely ever been    ill before."
    Professor Powell was elected into the Royal Society in 1824, and
repeatedly served on the Council.         He    was three times married, and
leaves a numerous family.         His widow is the daughter of Admiral
W. H. Smyth, Fellow and formerly Foreign Secretary of the Royal
Society.
    William      Simms was born at Birmingham,               in December 1793.
His parents having      removed    to London, he was apprenticed to            Mr.
Bennet, a mathematical instrument maker, who had formerly worked
under the eye of Ramsden.          Mr. Simms afterwards          commenced    busi
ness at Bowman's Buildings, Aldersgate Street,            where he constructed
 the large theodolites required by Colonel Colby                for the Ordnance
 Survey, and established his reputation for excellence                of workman
 ship.    In   1826  he joined   Troughton,      and   ultimately became sole
 proprietor of the well-known business          in Fleet Street.         The Cam
 bridge Mural Circle, the whole of the instrument maker's part of
 the   Greenwich    Altazimuth,    Transit    Circle    (for which be ground
 the 8-inch object-glass), Reflex Zenith-tube and Great Equatoreal,
 are monuments       of his skill  and   ability.    By     the invention    of his
 self-acting dividing machine, he reduced          the process of graduation
 of instruments from     a work   of weeks to a work          of hours, and with
 greater accuracy than before.       The   best evidence       of the  value of this
 machine appears in the fact that it was used to graduate the Zenith-
 distance   Circle at the Greenwich Observatory.             He took part also in
 the preliminary experiments required for the           construction of the new
 Imperial Standard yard, and in the completion of that instrument.

                                          XXX
     Mr. Simms       was a man      of quiet unobtrusive        manners,   and of a
fair and candid disposition, which won the esteem and, in not                   a few
instances,    the friendship     of those with whom he transacted business.
He    became a Fellow      of  the  Royal Astronomical Society in 1831, and
served several times on        the Council. He was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1852.            He died    at his residence,    Carshalton,   June
21, 1860.
     William Spence          was born     of   a respectable   Yorkshire family     at
 Hull in    1 783  :  he commenced      business in that town, and        afterwards
 represented     it in Parliament.      At about      ten years   of age he was led,
 as he    mentions in one of his addresses to the Entomological              Society,
 " from    mere boyish imitation to collect and dry plants, and to copy
 out the names of the Linnean classes and orders."                 This pursuit   was
 interrupted by removal to a school, but he resumed it later, and when
 he had exhausted the plants of his neighbourhood, began the study
 of entomology with Coleoptera. In 1 805, the present of a few insects,
 sent by the hand of a friend who was journeying to Suffolk, brought
 him into acquaintance,          and eventually a lasting friendship, with the
 llev.  W. Kirby of Barham.             To this friendship English literature
 owes a work which,         with White's ' Selborue,' may be said to have
 done more to promote a taste for the study                of natural history than
 any   other of its class, and the         first notion of this work was sug
 gested by     Mr.    Spence   in a letter to       Mr. Kirby in 1808; but the
 authorities to be consulted were numerous, and the labour was great,
 so that the first volume did not appear                until 1815.     The   second
 volume was published in 1817, the first having in the meantime
 passed through three editions.            Mr.     Spence   now became subject to
 severe headaches       and other signs of illness, which compelled him to
 abandon      his studies    for a while     ;   he therefore,   persuaded    by his
 medical advisers, shut up his books, and quitted Yorkshire for Devon
 shire.     During his residence at Exmouth             he occupied himself      with
 outdoor observations       of  insects ;  and his health having improved, the
 third and fourth volumes of the               '                to Entomology,      or
                                                 Introduction
 Elements of the Natural History of Insects,' were brought                     out in
  1 826 .   Of this remarkable work it may           be said without exaggeration,
 that it has charmed thousands of readers, and induced many to in
 terest   themselves    in the study      of insect life, who without it might

never have     bestowed   a thought    on natural history.       The   complete
work, including fifty-one letters,    of which   the whole   of nine and parts
of twenty-two others      are from the pen     of Mr.  Spence, went through
six editions prior to the decease of      Mr. Kirby.      In   1856 a seventh
edition was published by the surviving author, more compact in form
and lower in price than any which had preceded.
    Seeking further to improve his health,        Mr. Spence journeyed with
his family to the continent in 1826, and remained            abroad for eight
years, during which he visited many         of the principal cities of Europe,
and passed     the summer months in Switzerland.           After returning to
 England     he  took up his residence       in London,    and    employed his
leisure in the promotion of science, particularly in the formation of
 the Entomological     Society in 1833.       Of that Society he remained,
 since   Mr. Kirby's    death,    the sole  honorary English member, — a
 distinction now confined exclusively to foreigners.          In   1847, and on
 other occasions, he was elected President of the Society, and raised it
 by his exertions while in the chair, from weakness and depression, to
 strength of numbers         and activity.     He frequently      attended   the
 Society's meetings,   as  well as those of the Royal and Linnean Society,
 until increasing   deafness deprived him      of the pleasure   of intercourse ;
 but though thus withheld from his fellows by infirmity, he was always
  accessible  when his advice      was wanted, and ready to take trouble
  where encouragement       could be given or assistance bestowed.
     Mr.   Spence was elected a Fellow      of the Linnean Society in      1806,
  and of the Royal Society in 1834,           and was chosen into their re
  spective   councils.   He    was author    of numerous papers published
  in the Transactions of the Linnean and Entomological Society.
     During his parliamentary career he laboured to promote measures
  for rendering Great Britain entirely independent of foreign commerce,
  and published a pamphlet on the subject, which at the time attracted
  much attention.      He died    on the 6th   of January,     1860, at the age
  of 77.
      Theophilxjs Thompson, M.D.,           was the son   of Nathaniel Thomp
   son, Esq., and was born at Islington on the 20th       of September, 1807.
   His professional studies    were commenced      at St. Bartholomew's     Hos
   pital, prosecuted at Dublin and Paris, and completed at Edinburgh,
   where he took his degree in 1830. He settled in practice in London,

                                        xxxii
and was soon after elected Physician to the Northern Dispensary, and
for fourteen years zealously discharged the duties of that office.                 In
 1847 he was appointed Physician to the Hospital                for Consumption,
and much of his subsequent             labour was specially directed to the
investigation and treatment         of that disease.
    Dr. Thompson's       chief writings      are   the following: — 'Annals        of
Influenza,'   published by the Sydenham Society, 1851                 ;   'Lectures
on Diseases   of   the Chest,' 1854, and        'Lettsomian Lectures on Con
sumption,' 1855      ; besides the chapters       on  "Hysteria," "Neuralgia"
and   " Chorea "    in the  '
                              Library of Medicine,' edited by Dr. Tweedie,
 1840.    He    also   contributed     various     papers   on professional sub
jects to the Medico-Chirurgical         Transactions, and to different medical
journals.    He    was elected      a Fellow   of   the  Royal Society in 1846,
and is the author of two papers             on the changes produced in the
blood by the administration of oils, printed in the ' Proceedings ' in
 1854 and 1858.
    Dr. Thompson        was    held in high        esteem    by his    professional
brethren, and was greatly beloved           by his patients.       He   was gentle
and modest in nature, but of inflexible moral integrity            ; and through
out his useful life he was actuated           by a disinterested desire for the
 advancement     of medical knowledge and the promotion of the right
interests of his profession.         He was a man of unaffected piety, which
influenced him through           life, and   sustained     him   in resigned     and
 cheerful submission under the afflicting malady which preceded                   his
 death.    This   consisted    in   a species  of atrophy, which invaded his
 frame, and, without affecting his mind, eventually deprived him               of all
 muscular power.        He died on the 11th of August,             1860, from the
 immediate   effect  of bronchitis, which speedily prevailed         over his well-
 nigh exhausted     strength.
    Dr.  Robert Bentley Todd               was born at      Dublin on   the   9th of
 April, 1809.      His father, Charles Hawkes Todd, Professor of Ana
 tomy and Surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, after
 attaining the greatest eminence and success in his profession, was cut
 off at the early age of 46, leaving sixteen            children.    Of this large
 family Dr. Todd was the secoud son              ; he   was educated     at  Trinity
 College, Dublin, where he graduated in Arts and in Medicine,                    and
 afterwards passed a year in Paris in prosecution                  of his medical

                                                xxxiii
 studies.     He then          commenced           practice as          a   Physician in London,
and having obtained the Degree     of M.D. from the University of
Oxford, was in 1 837 admitted" a Fellow of the College of Physicians.
About the time of his settling in London Dr. Todd became Teacher
of Anatomy in the Aldersgate School of Medicine; and in 1836 he
was appointed Professor of Physiology and of General and Morbid
Anatomy in King's College.                    This Professorship              he held       until     1 853,
when he felt himself compelled to withdraw from                                   it,   in consequence
of his increasing occupation as Physician in large practice mean
                                               a                                                 ;
while the opening of King's College Hospital, in the establishment of
which he had taken an active part, afforded him                               a   field for acquiring
experience     as    a   hospital physician, and for exercising his talent in
clinical instruction,        a    duty he continued to perform until within                           a    few
weeks     of his    death.
   Dr. Todd's        was   a      life of active thought and steadfast work                           ;    and
accordingly he soon acquired distinction                           as   a    medical       teacher and
writer, and    as   a    scientific inquirer.          About       the outset           of his   career in
London       he projected the well-known                     Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and
                                                         '
Physiology,' of       which he was the             Editor,    and to which he contributed
several     important articles.               Some years       later he published, in asso
ciation with Mr. Bowman,                 'The Physiological Anatomy                        and Physio
logy of Man,'         a    work abounding in valuable original matter.                                      Of
various subjects           in Physiology           which      engaged          his attention, the
nervous     system       was perhaps that which interested him the                                    most,
and   he has ably and lucidly written on its structure, functions, and
diseases.     But     it   was as    a   practical physician and clinical professor
that Dr. Todd attained his greatest eminence.                               Some years before his
death he had risen to the foremost rank in medical practice, and
his clinical visits and lectures were assiduously attended                                       by   many
devoted     pupils.        A      selection     of   these    lectures was               published          in
three successive         volumes.        The last of          these,         completed only im
mediately before his death,               contains an exposition of his views on
the nature and treatment of acute inflammatory diseases, —                                        a       sub
ject on which medical opinion has, from time to time,                                         fluctuated
between     two extremes.              Considering           the    zeal with which                  he in
culcated his views and the boldness with which he exemplified them
in actual practice,          as   well as his eminent and influential position,
Dr. Todd may             be said     to have         taken the lead among those who

opposed      to the    antiphlogistic      and    depleting    mode    of treatment.
The     present     is not    a   fitting    occasion    for criticising   opinion  on
questions      in practical medicine        ;  but this     much we may be per
mitted to say, that even should the views maintained by Dr. Todd
not ultimately prevail,         a balance     of good    can scarcely fail to accrue
from his rational exposition and discussion of the doctrine in his
lectures    and writings, and especially from his fearlessly submitting
the results      of its practical application         to open scrutiny in a clinical
hospital.
    Dr. Todd      was elected a Fellow         of  the Royal Society     in 1838, and
 in 1838 and 1839 he served on the Council.
    For    some years      before    his death it was evident to Dr. Todd's
 medical friends that he was labouring under some serious internal
 disorder, but he continued actively to discharge his professional
 duties  ;  at length, however,         the crisis arrived, and he was cut off on
 the   30th of January,          1860, by repeated         attacks of Iiaematemesis,
 which was afterwards ascertained               to have been caused by disease      of
 the liver.      He   has left a widow and four children.
    Besides the works       of which     the titles have been already mentioned,
 and single clinical lectures        reported from time to time in the Medical
 Journals, Dr. Todd is the author of the following                : —
    '
      Clinical    Lectures on Paralysis, Disease of the Brain and other
 affections    of the Nervous System,'           1854.

    Horace Hayman Wilson              was born in 1786, and died in London
on the 8th     of May,      1860, at the age    of 74, leaving a reputation     of
Eastern scholarship which has no equal among Englishmen,                  except
in Sir William Jones and Henry Thomas Colebrooke.                   After  recei
ving a good classical     and professional education, he proceeded to      India
in 1808, in the Medical Service of the Government.              He  never, how
ever, engaged       in the practice of his profession, but being        a skilful
chemist and metallurgist, he was at once attached to the Mint of
Calcutta, which stood in need of such services             as he  could render,
and in due time he became Master            of the Mint,  a post which he held
during his whole stay in India.
    At Calcutta Mr. Wilson         became acquainted with Colebrooke, and
by his example and advice was induced to engage in the study of the
Sanskrit language and literature.            The fruits of his devotion     were
seen as early as 1813, when he published his first work, the trans
lation in verse of a Sanskrit poem, called ' The Cloud Messenger.'
This performance, equally distinguished by fidelity            and  good   taste,
at once established the author's           reputation  as  an oriental scholar.
 From this time, the list of Mr. Wilson's various publications                 on
oriental questions is too manifold for citation, and we need only name
a few    of the most remarkable.          In  1819 he published the first, aud
in 1832 the second edition of his Sanskrit            and  English Dictionary,
 the first work of the kind that had ever been given to the public, the
 work which has been the main guide ever since of the student of the
 Sanskrit language and of comparative philology.             This  was followed
 by  a lucid grammar of the complex and difficult Sanskrit, and by trans
                  '        '
 lations of the      Vedas    and ' Puranas,' the most sacred writings     of the
 Hindus.      In   1840 he published his continuation       of Mill's 'History
 of India,' in   three volumes,     and as late as 1854,   his ' Glossary of In
 dian Terms,'     a  quarto of above 700 pages,     a  work replete with useful
 knowledge and ingenious criticism, in which Mr. Wilson shows his
 knowledge not only of the recondite language of India, but of its
 many vernacular idioms, as well        as of the abundant Arabic   and Persian
 words which have found their way into them.
    While     he was    still  absent  in India in 1833, the University         of
 Oxford chose him for the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit            ; and about
 the same    time the Home Government of India            named him    Librarian
 and Curator     of their Library     and Collection   of Natural History     and
                                                                  c2

Antiquities.      These lucrative appointments served only            as incitements
to further exertions, and         Mr. Wilson's useful       and valuable labours
were continued almost to the day            of his  death.
     Mr. Wilson    was not a laborious scholar and n prolific writer only,        he
was also a careful and judicious inquirer.              He was, indeed, a highly
accomplished man        ; for with his profound knowledge of the languages
 and literature    of the East, he combined a familiarity with the ancient
 and modern ones        of Europe.      To   these he added      skill in music and
 in the histrionic art, in which he was an excellent performer.
     Mr. Wilson     was elected    a Fellow     of the Royal Society in 1834.
 He married      a grand-daughter      of  the celebrated Mrs. Siddons, and by
 her, who survives him, had         a  family of sons and daughters.
     M. Louis Poinsot         was born in Paris on the 3rd      of January,    1777 ;
 quitted the Ecole Polytechnique in the capacity of Ingenieur des
  Ponts et Chaussees in 1 796 ; was appointed Professor at the Lycee
  Bonaparte    ;  Professor and Examiner of the pupils who had completed
  the course of instruction at the Ecole Polytechnique, and member of
  the Council for improving that institution.             He was elected Member
  of the Institute in     1813, in the place       rendered  vacant     by the death
  of Lagrange, by whom his future eminence had been predicted. He
  became Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, Peer of France and
   Senator.    He   died, unmarried, on the 5th        of December,      1859, at the
   age of nearly 83 years.       The    greater part   of his life  passed happily ;
   while still young his talents were appreciated by the most eminent
  judges   ; in his advanced years he received the highest rewards from
   his countrymen.        With his simple habits, the emoluments of the
   numerous and honourable appointments he held, and the profits                    of
   nine large editions of his ' Statics,' in addition to a moderate            family
   inheritance, enabled him to leave at his death            a   fortune of upwards
   of 1,200,000 francs.
      He  was regarded      as one of the most profound geometers in Europe.
   Hisphilosophic mind suggested newmethods of scientific investigation.
   His writings, always remarkable for their clearness and elegance, are
   frequently expressed in language divested of the technicalities of
   algebra.    M. Chasles, alluding       to Poinsot'snew      theory of rotation in
   the preface to his 'Geometric supericur,' expresses himself nearly in the
   following terms    : — Nothing     can be more beautiful than these direct,

                                              xxxvii
lucid and graphic considerations, by means of which a great geometer,
employing the ingenious doctrine of couples in dynamics, has un
folded all the geometric and dynamic properties of                      a  heavy body in
motion.     . .  .With the        sole aid   of geometric reasoning, M. Poinsot
renders palpable, and depicts               all the circumstances of the motion of
a solid.

    Heinrich Rathke                  was the son     of  a  ship-carpenter of Dantzic,
and was born in that town on the 25th                       of August,      1 793.    Being
destined for the medical profession, he studied with that view in
Gottingen and in Berlin, and in 1818 he commenced                          practice in his
native city.        While      at Gottingen,       however, he had acquired under
the mastership of Blumenbach a decided taste for zootomical and zoo
logical pursuits,          and had, even in his student years,                  undertaken
original researches in these branches of science.                     Accordingly,     amid
the more        pressing occupations of professional life he continued to
pursue with eagerness his favourite studies, and soon acquired the
reputation of an able and accomplished biologist.                       His appointment
to the chair of Physiology in Dorpat, to which he was called in 1828,
enabled      him thenceforward to give himself up entirely to scientific
work    ; and,     by the death of Eschscholtz,              the sphere     of his profes

                                        xxxviii
  sorial duties was soon extended          to Comparative        Anatomy and Zoo
  logy.    After   seven years' agreeable and successful           labour in Dorpat,
  Rathke was recalled to his native country to succeed his distinguished
  friend Von Baer, whom we still happily number among our Foreign
  Members,      as Professor     of Anatomy and Zoology in Konigsberg,
  where he    continued till the time of his death.
     The   chosen task     of Rathke'  s scientific life was the investigation     of
  the laws    of formation of     the animal body        ;   and he soon perceived
  that the solution of the great questions involved was to be sought
  for not only in the examination of the mature structure, but also,
  and indeed with the best promise         of success, in the study      of the body
  in its embryo state, and in tracing its several               parts through their
  successive phases      of development up to their final condition.            Zoo
  tomy and     the study of embryonic development were in his hands
  mutually elucidative in determining the morphological equivalence
  of apparently dissimilar forms ; and, in this way, passing from the
  one course of investigation to the other as the object of inquiry
*
  demanded,       and   labouring    unremittingly      as    well   as successfully,
  Rathke has earned a foremost place among those who have advanced
  the science    of Animal Morphology.
     Rathke'   s  earliest researches     were   directed to the anatomy and
  development      of Amphibia and Fishes.           The most notable results
  were his various papers on the internal structure, in many ways so
  remarkable, of the Cyclostomes, and his mouography on the deve
  lopment of the        lilennius  viviparity,   the   first thorough history of
  the embryogeny of a fish that had' then appeared.
     He next applied himself         to the difficult      problem of tracing the
  development of the genital        system    in the series of vertebrated       ani
  mals,  following     out the metamorphoses          of the Wolffian       body in
  reptiles, birds, and mammals,         and investigating its relation to the
  sexual   organs.     With the     results   of  these     inquiries appeared   the
  account of his researches on the development of the respiratory appa
  ratus, and the announcement          of his well-known and important dis
  covery   that the embryos of all vertebrata           have at a certain period
  the rudiments of     a   branchial system in form of arches and apertures,
  although without formation of real gills in the higher classes.
     These extensive labours having been accomplished, and Von Baer's
  celebrated    work on animal development            having in the mean time

                                        xxxix
 appeared,    there remained, of the vertebrata, only the three orders
 of reptiles   whose   embryological history was stilled untouched.            To
 these,  therefore,    Bathke    resolved   to extend his inquiries,      and in
 1838 produced his account        of the embryogeny of the snake (Coluber
 natrix), and    ten years  later that of the Testudines.        Both works are
 replete with new matter, and in that on            the serpent    especially the
 development of the several organs from commencement to maturity
is handled with      a  depth and thoroughness of treatment hitherto un
surpassed.      The third monography on the development of Crocodiles
has been    left by him nearly complete, and, we learn, will be published
as a   posthumous work.
    The foundation of our more        accurate   knowledge of the embryology
of the Articulate      may be said to have been laid by Rathke's            well-
known memoir on the development of the river- crab, which appeared
in 1829, and for which he obtained the Gold Medal of the French
Academy of Sciences.          He afterwards     availed   himself of the oppor
tunities afforded him by his residence           at Dorpat to extend his re
searches    on the Crustacea      ; and with the view of prosecuting          his
inquiries    on   marine Invertebrate,     he made      a voyage  from   Dorpat
to the Crimea in     1 833,  and another from Konigsberg to the shores of
Norway in 1839.
    In the latter   years   of his life Rathke     was engaged     in two works
which he has left nearly in a          complete state — one     on the develop
ment of the snail, the other on Nephelis and some allied annelides.
He   had long intended to publish a systematic treatise             on Embryo
logy and Comparative Anatomy founded on his academical                 lectures  ;
this intention he did not live to carry out, but since his death the
outlines of his lectures on the development of the vertebrata have
been    published    under the title of       " Entwickelungsgeschichte       der
Wirbelthiere,"     8vo. Leipsic,    1861.
   Indefatigably employed        as an   original inquirer, Rathke was none
the less attentive to his duties as an Academical Professor.               Up to
the year of his death he was favoured with excellent health, but after
suffering some time from severe catarrh, -from which he partially
recovered,    he was cut off suddenly by an apoplectic seizure on             the
15th of September, 1860.
   Most of the eminent Societies of Europe enrolled Rathke among

 pointic    contact with     any plane curve;         but his method does not
 appear to admit of direct        extension     to curves of higher orders than
 conies having contact with            any plane curve.         The method here
 suggested     would admit of such extension          ;   and it may therefore be
 said to contain potentially the solution of the general problem of
 contact.      But the labour of completely working out even the case
 of  a  cubic of nine-pointic contact would be very great. The case of
 the conic of five-pointic contact has been worked out, and the result
 agrees with     Mr. Cayley's.

XIV. "       On the Action of Hydriodic Acid upon Mannite."                      By
        J.  A. Wanklyn,        Esq., and Dr.       Erlenmeyer.         Communi
        cated by Dr. Frankland.                Received October 24, 1861.
    Mannite     may be regarded          as a six-atomic alcohol, or better as
hydride     of hexyl, in which       six atoms of hydrogen are replaced by
six atoms of peroxide of hydrogen.
                            Mannite=C8 He (H0)5.
                                                                    2 k2

                                        448
    This formula is   established   by the reaction between            mannite and
 hydriodic acid.    When the two bodies are heated together iodine is
 evolved,  and   a heavy oily    liquid distils. This liquid is iodide of
 hexyl.    By using a sufficient excess of hydriodic acid — 8 grms. of
 manbite to 100 cubic centimetres of strong acid boiling at 125° C.
 — and   by transmitting    carbonic acid through           the hot liquid, so as
 to remove the oily product     as  rapidly    as  possible from contact with
 hot iodine,  a  quantity of iodide of hexyl, approximating              closely to
 that required by the following equation,          may be obtained      :—
                 Mannite.              Iodide of Hexyl.
              CvEUHO), + 1 1 HI                H„ I + 6Ha Q + 1,0.
    From   96 grms.   of mannite      we have      obtained 83 grms. of very
 nearly pure iodide of hexyl.
    The equation requires      182 grms. mannite to 212 grms. iodide              of
hexyl.
   The identity of our product with iodide of hexyl                 was shown    by
its analysis, and by the following reactions         : —
   Digested with water and oxide of silver, it yields an oily liquid
lighter than water, differing completely in smell from amylic alcohol,
and having the composition of herylic alcohol.                   Its analysis gave
carbon 70*21 per cent., and hydrogen 13'84.
   The calculated numbers for hexylic alcohol             are —
                          Carbon    ..     ..     70 59,
                          Hydrogen         ..     13-/3,
which agree completely with our result.
   When caustic potash and common alcohol are employed instead of
oxide of silver with water, a different result occurs          ;  the iodide splits
up into hexylene and hydriodic           acid, which     latter reacts upon the
potash.
   Hexylene    prepared by this process         is an oily liquid, lighter than
water, of very penetrating odour, and boiling at about 68° C.                   Its
constitution was proved on the one hand by its analysis and vapour-
density, and    on the other by its deportment with bromine, upon
which it reacts with extreme       violence,    combining without        evolution
of HBr, and yielding     a heavy liquid,      whose composition, ascertained
by analysis, is €8 H»a Bra.
   We defer the further description of our compounds, as it is our

                                                 449
intention to make an extended investigation of the bodies belonging
to the hexyl group, which are very imperfectly known, as may be
inferred from the fact that Faget, the discoverer of hexylic alcohol,
has not even published its analysis.

away from        it,   for about nine miles, in        a    south-easterly direction, and
terminates three and    half miles north-west of Torquay.
                                a                             It appears
a lake-like expansion of the valleys of the Bovey and Teign, and                                     is
surrounded on all sides               by
                            lofty hills of granite and other rocks.
    Excavations in various parts of this plain, especially in the north
western part of         it,   known   as   Bovey Heathfield, have disclosed, beneath
an accumulation           of gravel mixed with clay and                sand,     a   regular series
of strata of lignite, clay and              sand, well known to geologists                    as the
" Bovey       deposit,"        whilst the lignite      is   equally familiar as
                                                                                             " Bovey
coal."
    The most important                of the     excavations     is     that known as the
"Coal-pit," whence lignite                  is   extracted, which           is   used,    in small
quantities, at    a    neighbouring pottery, and also by the poorer cottagers
of the immediate neighbourhood.
   The deposit has long attracted                 the attention      of both the scientific
and commercial world, and many authors have given descriptions
and speculations respecting it.
    In   1   760 the Rev.       Dr. Jeremiah Milles           sent   a   paper on        it    to the
Royal Society. His aim appears to have been to prove the mineral
origin of the lignite, in refutation of Professor Hollman, of Gottin-
gen, who had described,               and assigned     a    vegetable    origin to,      a    similar
substance      found near the city of Munden.                     In    1   794 and      1   796   Dr.
Maton described the deposit,                and mentioned the existence                  of   a   large
turf bog,      near the pit, in which            whole trees were often discovered,

                                        450
but   " none of    them bearing the least resemblance         to Bovey    coal."
In 1/97 Mr. .Hatchett            brought   the subject    before   the  Linnean
 Society, in a paper iu which his object seems to have been the refu
tation of the mineral theory of Dr. Milles.        In his ' History of Exeter,'
published in 1802, Mr. Brice next gave an account of the deposit,
and the state of the lignite workings        ; he supposed    the basin to have
formerly been a stagnant lake or morass           into which trees were suc
 cessively   transported from the neighbouring slopes.             The twelfth
letter in Parkinson's      '
                             Organic Remains,' published in 1804, appears
to have been written by        Mr. Scammell, of Bovey Tracey,         and  is de
 voted to the lignite    ;  from it we learn that the coal had been worked
 upwards of ninety years,        and that the trees found in the bog, men
tioned by Dr. Maton, were of the fir kind.             Mr. Vancouver, in his
 ' General View of the
                               Agriculture of the County of Devon,' pub
lished in 1808, supposes the lignite to have been the product of pine
 forests    which   grew where it is found, and that clay and other
moveable      matter must have been poured over them, in a fluid state,
at different periods, from the craggy eminences around.             Mr. Austen,
in his    *
            Memoir on the Geology of the South-east of Devonshire,'
states that the Bovey beds rest on a gravel equivalent to the lowest
tertiary deposits,     and is thus the first writer who addresses himself
to the chronology      of the formation.       He makes the overlying gravels
post-tertiary, but belonging to        the " period prior   to the most recent
changes     of relative level of   land and water and   of climate."      Sir H.
De la Beche, in his ' Report of Cornwall,             Devon, &c.,' expresses
surprise     and regret that, excepting the lignite itself, no organic
remains have been detected in the deposit, so that we are deprived             of
any aid by which        it may    be referred to    any  particular geological
date   ; and adds that    " if the wood be, as has been supposed,      analogous
to oak and other existing trees, we should suppose the Bovey beds to
have     been formed towards the latter         part of the supracretaceous
period."      In 1855, Dr. Hooker read a paper before the Geological
                         " On some Small Seed-vessels
Society of    London,                                       (Folliculites minu-
tulus) from the Bovey Tracey Coal," which was the first announce
ment of the discovery of identifiable fossils in the deposit. Besides
the fossil just named, Dr. Hooker described          a cone   of the Scotch fir,
Pinus sylvestris, said to have been found in one of the uppermost beds
 of lignite, and from it he came to the provisional conclusion that the

                                                    451
                             •
Bovey beds belong to the Post-Pliocene epoch.                                 In 1856 , Dr.      Croker,
of Bovey Tracey,            sent to the same Society a paper                        in which     he men
tioned the occurrence of large                  " flabelliform leaves," together " with
tangled masses of vegetable remains in some of the higher beds."
   In      1860    Sir Charles Lyell            and        Dr. Falconer visited Bovey, and
returned with the impression that the formation belonged to the
miocene      age.        The latter introduced the subject to Miss Burdett
Coutts      as    one    which it was eminently desirable to have fully and
carefully investigated.                 Miss Coutts having                   soon   after visited the
district with the author, requested him to undertake an investigation
of the deposit, which              he accordingly did              ;   and at once engaged              Mr.
Keeping, the well-known and experienced                                fossil collector of the Isle
of Wight.
  Sections of the deposit at the coal-pit show                               a series    of    beds natu
rally dividing          themselves        into three parts,            namely, —
   1 st,   or uppermost,           a bed   of sandy clay, containing large angular
and subangular stones,              chiefly of Dartmoor derivation, unconformably
covering the lower beds.                   No   stones occur below this.
  2nd.      A     series   of twenty-six beds of lignite, clay and sand, the base
of which is        a bed     of ferruginous quartzose sand, in some places 27
feet thick, in others less than one foot, but which everywhere occurs
as a well-marked             feature       in the pit-sections.                Excepting        this bed,
sand is almost entirely confined to the uppermost part of the division.
   3rd.     A     set    of forty-five       beds    of regularly alternating lignite                   and
clay.
   The      stones by which it is characterized, and its unconformability,
show that the uppermost division could not have been formed under
the same conditions, nor probably in the same geological period                                           as
the two lower series.               This view has            been' confirmed by the identifi
cation of certain fossil leaves found in the clays of the uppermost
series.
   The two lower                 series     are strictly         conformable,            and    dip     12£°
towards S. 35°              W. (mag.).              Five     beds, — one of          clay and four        of
lignite, — in the          second         series, and nine, — one              of clay     and eight      of
lignite — in the lower,             a   total of fourteen, have yielded fossils,                      all of
them remains of plants only.                     A    few only          of   these beds require par
ticular mention.             The     seventh bed           is,   in many       places,   a     mat    of the
debris of        a      coniferous tree, the Sequoia Couttsice,                          and fronds of

                                                  452
                                                                        •
ferns, chiefly Pecopteria lignitum.                      The     seventeenth     bed contains a
large number of dicotyledonous leaves.                            The twenty-fifth is that in
which the so-called " flabelliform                 leaves
                                                                " of Dr.    Croker occur; they
have been decided to be large rhizomes                          of ferns.     The twenty-sixth,
a bed  of clay, is richer than any other in the number and variety of
its fossils, which consist of dicotyledonous leaves, seeds of various
kinds, and debris of Sequoia stems, leaves, fruits, and seeds. Remains
of     the   last occur, in well-marked                  specimens,        in the fortieth       and
sixty-third          beds     ;   so that it ranges throughout              the formation, both
divisions of which, therefore, belong to one organic period.                                     The
forty-sixth          bed abounds in the seeds described                      by Dr. Hooker         as
Folliculites minutulua, but which Professor Heer                             has recognized as
Carpolithea Kaltennordheimenaia.
   The lignite has frequently a " charred " appearance, and it is diffi
cult to believe that it has not undergone true combustion in the beds,
the ignition being spontaneous.
     Coal has been found upwards of                      1   70 feet below the surface         of the
plain, and there are reasons for believing that the deposit is fully 300
feet     in depth.
     On the advice of Dr. Falconer, the fossils have been submitted to
Professor Heer of Zurich, who has found amongst them 49 species of
plants, eight of which were found by himself during a personal inves
tigation of the deposit.                   Many of   these are entirely new to science,
whilst the others are well known as continental representatives of
the lower miocene age.    In addition to these, four species have
been identified in the uppermost, or gravel division, as belonging to
the diluvial period,              " that    is,
                                            a     period when the climate of Devon
shire was colder than at present."
     The deposit     eminently freshwater, and must have been formed
                         is
in   a   lake, the bottom of which                 is,
                                        at present, at least 30 fathoms
below the level of ordinary spring tide high water.                             It   appears    pro
bable that the waters                of this   miocene lake were            separated from the
ocean by    barrier which crossed the present tidal estuary of the
                 a
Teign, and over this the surplus waters passed to the sea or that                       ;
they formed          a   lower outlet in the valley between                  Newton and Tor
quay     ;   the first seems,          from the physical            characters of the two
valleys, to have been the most probable course.                             During the investi
gation       a   search       was   made     for fossils at the clay-werks              of Aller,

                                    453
Kingsteignton     and Decoy, all near Newton        Abbot;     nothing    was
found except at the last place, where a stem of Sequoia Couttsice was
met with, thus showing that the deposit is identical with that at
Bovey Heathfield.
XVI. "The       Fossil Flora of Bovey Tracey."            By Dr. Oswald
       Heer, Professor of Botany        and Director of the Botanical
       Gardens in Zurich.      Communicated by Sir       Charles Lyell.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The surface-covering of the Bovey plateau consists of             a  light-
coloured quartzose sand, which contains here and there considerable
beds   of white clay. By the plants contained in it this formation is
assigned to the Diluvium.
   Immediately under it come the beds of clay and lignite, which
belong to one formation, far older than that of the overlying white
clay; the plants found in them determine them         as belonging unques
tionably to the miocene      period.    Hence    the formations must be
treated of separately.
                 A. The Miocene Formation of Bovey.
   Of the forty-nine     species  of plants hitherto      discovered in the
lignite beds of Bovey, twenty occur on the Continent in the miocene
formation.     Those beds are therefore undoubtedly miocene.           *When
tabulated, it is seen that fourteen of the twenty species occur in the
Tongrien Stage, thirteen in the Mayencien, five in the Helvelien, and
eight in the CEningien    ; hence  the Bovey lignites must be ranged in
the under miocene, and in the Aquitanien       e*tage  of it.
   Moreover, the new species at Bovey are closely allied to well-known
continental forms on this horizon.
   It  is remarkable that Bovey has no species in common with Ice
land, although    the tertiary flora of the latter belongs to the same
period, and two of its species have been found in the miocene de
posit of Ardtun Head in Mull. The Bovey flora has a much more
southern character, manifesting, indeed, a sub-tropical climate.
   It  has certainly some points of connexion with the eocene of the
Isle of Wight, but on the whole         possesses  an essentially different
 character. The fact that but one      species is common to     it and  Alum
Bay, whilst it has   so many in common with the more remote miocene

                                        454
formations of the Continent, satisfies us that it belongs to a different
horizon.
    Among the twenty-six new species found at Bovey, several inter
esting forms are found.       The first   place belongs to Sequoia     Couttsia,
a  conifer which we can illustrate by branches of every age, by cones
and seeds.       It  supplies  a  highly important       link  between   Sequoia
Langsdorfii and S. Sternbergi, the widely distributed representatives
.of S. sempervirens     and S. gigantea     ( WeUingtonia),    whose occurrence
in the present creation is confined to California.
    Of   great interest also are two species      of Vitis, of which the grape-
 stones lie in the clays of Bovey.         Three remarkable species of Fig,
 the seeds   of three new species     of Nyssa    and two   of Annona,   one new
 water-lily (Nympheea),      and many highly ornate          Carpolithes  impart
to our knowledge of tertiary plants a most essential extension.
     It is highly probable that, at the period of the lower miocene, the
 Bovey basin was occupied by an inland lake.               The entire absence   of
fresh-water shells, and, indeed,        of aquatic animals generally, is cer
tainly very extraordinary,       and   so is the absence of fruits of the
 Chara, so abundant elsewhere          in miocene     freshwater deposits   ; the
Nymphaa seeds, however,          furnish a secure indication of fresh water.
We must not omit to notice that the parts of the basin hitherto
explored were towards the middle of the lake, and, in the case of the
under beds at least, at a considerable depth, which explains the
absence     of bog-plants  as well as   of mammalian relics.
     The lignite    beds consist    almost entirely of tree-stems      (probably
 belonging in great measure to Sequoia Couttsice) which have appa
 rently been floated hither, not only from the circuit of the immediate
 hills, but doubtless also from greater distances.
     The twenty-sixth bed in the series, immediately above the " thick
 bed of sand," is a soft clay with numerous leaves of plants, and ripe
 cones and seeds     of Sequoia Couttsia? ; the bed was probably formed
 m autumn, and       the plants it contains are due to the driftings of that
 season.     Higher up follows the bed (twenty-five) with fern rhizomes,
 and occasionally pinnules of Pecopteris lignitum.            The latter appears
 in great abundance with branches of Sequoia still higher.
     As this under      miocene    formation is immediately succeeded          by
 that of the gravel and white clay, we have here                a great hiatus   :
 either the middle and upper miocene,          as  well as the pliocene  periods,

                                                  455
must have passed without the formation of deposits in this place, or
they must have been removed again in the diluvial period.
                                    B. The White Clay.
  While      the lignites and their alternating clays                         present     us with a
sub-tropical vegetation,            the plants of the              White Clay exhibit      a totally
different character,         and must have had their origin in an altogether
distinct period.
  Four    species   — three of Salix              and one of         Betula — have      been found
in this overlying mass, no one of which appears to differ from species
now living.      The     presence          of   the   Betula (B. nana)          is conclusive for
a diluvial    climate,       that    is,   a    colder climate than Devonshire has at
the present day     ;    for this dwarf birch                 is    an Arctic plant, which has
no British habitat south of Scotland, and                          which occurs in Mid Europe
only on mountains and Sub-Alpine                         peat mosses.          The      evidence    of
the willow-leaves        is   to the same effect,              indicating that at this period
Bovey Heathfield was            a    cold peat-moor.

    The President then         addressed     the Society as follows       :—
       Gentlemen,
 The peculiar circumstances under which the Council thought fit to
 propose me for re-election as President at the last Anniversary are,
 I apprehend, sufficiently known to make it unnecessary for me to
 trouble you with any observations on the subject. There was then
 reason    to believe     that in a short time        I  should be in that state
 which would enable me to resume all the duties of my office.                         Un
fortunately those expectations were not realized                ; and    you will,  I am
 sure,  easily conceive      how deep was the disappointment to myself,
that   I   should have been prevented, during the whole of the last
session, from being present at our Meetings.                 The President of your
 Society, however,       has other duties besides         that of presiding in this
 Chair, and to these       I hope that      I  have not been altogether inatten
tive.     Various     subjects connected         with   the affairs of the Royal
 Society have from time to time demanded                   the attention of myself
and the other Officers        ;   and the discussions to which these have led
have,    I   have   reason   to believe,      not been unproductive          of a good
result.
    Referring     to the events of the last year,           I  feel that   I may with
perfect confidence congratulate you on the position which we occupy.
We    have not, indeed,      had to record any of those grand and startling
discoveries     by which some former epochs of our history have been
distinguished.        There     never,    however, was a period at which               so
many individuals, well qualified for the task, have been engaged in
scientific investigations       ;    and  our published       volumes bear         ample
testimony to the fact, that it is not in one only, but in every depart
ment of physical knowledge that                a steady    progress is being made.
The Fellowship of our Society has never been a greater object of
ambition than it is at present, nor do I believe that it has ever been
held in higher         estimation by the public.            Our weekly Meetings
as  I am    informed, have been          often productive of great interest, and
sufficiently well attended         :  but on this last point       I  take this oppor
tunity of making        a few remarks, in order that             I   may correct what
appears     to me to be a great misunderstanding                   under which some
have laboured on the subject.
   Probably not more than one third of our Fellows are permanently

                                             458
  resident in London,         and     of  these   a large proportion       are   engaged
  in occupations which leave only a limited portion of time at their
  own disposal. The subjects which are brought under consideration,
 'though frequently of paramount importance, are not of that general
 interest which would attract ordinary persons                   ;  nor, indeed,     if we
  take any one of them, can it be regarded as equally attractive to
 every individual        belonging to our own body.                In the progress of
 knowledge, science has become                divided and subdivided into many
 departments, and the principle of the division of labour has neces
 sarily come into operation in these             as  well as in all other pursuits.
 A    communication, which would be highly attractive to a chemist,
 would not be equally           so  to a comparative anatomist or a               physio
 logist  ;  nor would the results of the inquiries on the subject                  of ter
 restrial magnetism, which have of late been carried on in almost every
 part of the world, important            as they may eventually prove to be, be
 well comprehended except by the few who have bestowed their special
 attention on them.          It  seems to me, therefore,           not reasonable to
 suppose      that    the  Meetings        of the Royal Society should be so
numerously attended          as more popular assemblies.
    There is another matter           as to  which    I conceive that some misap
 prehension has at times prevailed, namely, the relation in which our
•Society stands, or ought to stand, to the Government                  of the country.
In    many of the continental states there is a society                 of individuals,
under the name of an          " Academy,"       engaged in the pursuit       of  science,
limited in number, and each of them receiving an annual stipend
from the public treasury.             Such    a system   may be regarded        as  offer
ing a premium to those who engage in scientific investigations                     ;  and
the great results which have been obtained sufficiently demonstrate
that where it has been established it has had               a very beneficial opera
tion.      It would be, however,          entirely inapplicable to an institution
such as ours, consisting         as  it does of between 600 and 700 Members.
Then the foreign Academies to which                   I  have referred     are entirely
subjected     to the Government, without whose approbation the election
of   a new member is incomplete.                 Now, it is plain that         a system
so   inconsistent with the sentiments              and  habits of the inhabitants
of   these    islands would find little         favour here    ;   and   I  apprehend
that    there     is no individual       among those       whom     I  have   now the
honour of addressing,         whatever his opinions on the abstract prin-

                                      459
ciple may be, who would not think it                a  most rash proceeding to
apply it to the reconstruction of        a   Society such       as ours,  which has
been     steadily advancing in its career, and which is now, after the'
lapse    of  200 years, more active and vigorous and useful than at any
former period of its existence.
     The    best inducement to the cultivation          of   science is the love   of
knowledge, combined with that desire of honourable distinction — "that
last infirmity of noble minds "—of which we must not complain, as it
has led to such grand results ; and experience shows that these are
 all-sufficient    for  the purpose.         If   any worldly       advantage    ever
 accrue     to those who are thus engaged,            that may be regarded         as
 almost an accidental circumstance, which no one could have antici
 pated in the beginning.
      Such being the state of things among us,           I feel  bound at the same
 time to say, that       I cannot join with those         who complain that the
 interest of science has been neglected               by the Government.          The
 Fellows      of the Royal Society      have      never  wished to forfeit       their
 independence,       by claiming, in their capacity as Fellows, any personal
 benefit for themselves.        The connexion of the Royal Society with
 the Government has been simply that of a mutual interchange of
 good offices.       On the one hand, the Society has always been ready
 to assist those who are intrusted with the management                      of public
  affairs with its opinion and advice      ;  and the occasions       on which such
  assistance    has been required have been           sufficiently numerous.       On
  the other hand, it has rarely,     if  ever, happened that any representa
  tion made by the Royal Society in the interests of science                  has not
  received    the attention which it required.          A  sum voted annually by
  Parliament      for the purpose of assisting those who are engaged                in
  scientific investigations has been placed at the disposal of the Royal
  Society, to be distributed at the discretion of the Council.                The  ex
  tensive suite    of rooms which    we now occupy are the property             of the
   State,   and a similar accommodation has been afforded to four other
   of the chartered scientific     societies    ;   while another more popular
   institution has an annual grant from the public treasury, in order that
   it may    be the better enabled to carry out the objects for which it was
   established.
       There is nothing by which the pursuit of science in the present
    day is more signally distinguished than the greater                  accuracy and

                                                 460
precision with which              those    investigations             to which         mathematical
reasoning is either not at all or only to a limited extent applicable are
conducted as compared with what was the case when men's minds were
first directed to these subjects             ;   nor is there any prospect of our ever
returning        to those    hypothetical             systems         which     prevailed          among
scientific inquirers formerly.               If    there be at present             any danger to
the cause of science, it is of a totally different kind.                               The time has
arrived when the discoveries                 of    science           are becoming extensively
applied to commerce and manufactures, and the arts of common life.
The   greater part     of   society contemplate the achievements                             of science
under this point of view, and estimate its value only                             as   it   affects the
material interests of the country or of themselves.                               The prevailing
study of political economy            — and I      say this without denying the great
advantages which the community has derived from this comparatively
new science — by directing men's                   minds        so   much to the increase               of
national wealth, as the object most deserving of our attention, has
the effect of promoting the extension                        of this utilitarian              principle
more widely among us.                 The danger           to which       I    allude       is,   that the
cultivators of science            might themselves               be led to        participate          too
largely in these utilitarian views.                   If   it   should be so, science must
undoubtedly        descend        from    the high station which                   it       at present
occupies.  Nor can this happen without great injury to the cause of
knowledge itself. The mere utilitarian philosopher, having his views
limited to some immediate practical result, might, like the alchemists
of old, elicit     some new facts,          but would discover no new principle,
and after    a   long life would know no more of the laws of nature than he
knew in the beginning.                Eventually, even as to their gross material
interests,    society would be        a   loser.      The sailor would           never have had
placed at his disposal the means of ascertaining the longitude,                                        if
philosophers,       without       reference        to this           object,    had not studied
mathematics and the laws of planetary motions                            ;     nor would London
and   Paris have ever been placed,                    as   they now are, in instantaneous
communication with each other,                   if   those who began            with       the simple
fact of      the muscles     of   a   frog's leg being made to contract by the
contact of certain      metals had not pursued these inquiries                              until they
reached the laws of Voltaic               electricity, never dreaming of the great
invention which was ultimately to arise out of these researches                                        in
the shape of the electric telegraph.

                                          461
    The time has arrived for my resigning into your hands the office
to  which you were pleased to elect me three years ago.                   This has
not only been the greatest honour which has ever been bestowed on
me, but it has also been one          of the most gratifying circumstances of
my life, to have received          such a testimony of the good opinion of
individuals    so   distinguished for tReir genius and knowledge             as the
Fellows of the Royal Society of London.                      I  have sincerely to
thank not only the other Officers, but the Fellows generally for nu
merous marks of attention and kindness, of which                I am all the more
sensible in consequence        of the peculiar circumstances under which           I
have been placed.
    The Copley Medal         has been awarded to         Professor Louis Agassiz
of Boston, in the United          States, for the   eminent services which he
has rendered      to various branches      of physical science by the incessant
 labours of more than thirty years          of scientific activity.
    Commencing his career as a zoologist, Professor Agassiz early
turned his attention to Ichthyology,              and his 'Histoire      Naturelle
 des Poissons d'eau douce' not only was in itself a very valuable work,
but doubtless      led the way to the still more important services which
Professor Agassiz was destined to render to the same department of
natural history — not the least of which was the great step in ichthyo-
logical classification, made by the establishment of the order of
Ganoids, a group which has now taken                a   permanent place in the
Systema Naturae.
         '
   The     Monographie d'Echinodermes,' published between the years
                                '
 1838 and    1842, and the        Nomenclator      Zoologicus,' which appeared
in   the latter year        contemporaneously       with other investigations
of quite    a different      character,    need  only    be mentioned     to   bear
witness to the remarkable combination             of originality, industry, and
versatility   which     characterizes     their author.        To these excellent
qualities may be added tenacity of purpose              ;  for after a long inter
ruption, Professor Agassiz, on his removal to the United States, re
sumed    on a great      scale those investigations       of  the lower forms    of
animal life which had occupied his younger days.                   The results of
these inquiries, and those of his fellow-labourers           Clark and Weinland,
are  embodied in the magnificently illustrated monographs entitled
" Contributions      to the Natural     History of  the United States," works
    VOl. Xi.                                                       2  l

                                          462
which do equal credit to the naturalists who planned them, and to the
State and people whose intelligent munificence renders their publica
tion possible.
                                   '
    Cuvier's great work, the         Ossemens       Fossiles,' embraces,   as is well
known, an account of the fossil remains of all the higher classes of
vertebrated     animals   ;  but the founder of palaeontology         left the diffi
culties of fossil ichthyology to be grappled with by others, and dis
cerning the especial aptitude of Agassiz for the undertaking, indicated
him    as  his continuator in this department.               Nor can it be denied
that the author of            '
                        the Recherches sur les Poissons fossiles,' and the
' Monographie des            Poissons    fossiles    du vieux gres     rouge,'    has
amply justified       the    sagacious    anticipation     of Cuvier.     Travelling
over the Continent and these islands from one collection to another
— never      possessing     specimens    of his    own,   but obliged to trust     to
notes     and  to the sketches       of the excellent artist who accompanied
him — dealing with remains            which were almost always fragmentary
and presented far less definite characters              to the anatomist than the
bones    of higher animals, — Professor Agassiz, nevertheless, succeeded,
in the course of eleven years, in producing works which form a worthy
continuation of the ' Ossemens             Fossiles ;' and this not merely on
account of the excellent descriptions and figures of fossil fish, in vast
number, which first appeared in their pages, but because associated
with the history of extinct forms are all the complementary investiga
tions into the osteology,        dentition, and scale-structure of their recent
allies required for their elucidation.
    The award of the Copley Medal for these investigations alone would
be regarded but as an act of justice by the students of Palaeontology,
but it must not be forgotten that Professor Agassiz has made many
other contributions of no slight value to this branch of science.
    It  might be supposed         that labours of such magnitude and diffi
culty   as those   which have just been mentioned, would suffice to give
full occupation     to one mind, whatever its activity         ; but while Professor
Agassiz was thus becoming familiar to zoologists and paleontologists
as one     of the most active members           of their confraternity, geologists
and physical geographers           knew him       as a vigorous worker and bold
theorist iu their departments.            In   fact, what is now known as the
 *
   Glacial Theory,'      although not altogether originated by Professor
Agassiz, was greatly extended by him, and assuredly owes the position

                                          463
  it  has acquired in science        in very great measure to his efforts       — his
                                                                '
  work, 'Theorie der erratischen B15cke der Alpen                  (1838), his other
  writings, and his genial eloquence at scientific meetings,             having done
  more than anything else to attract the attention of geologists to the
  efficiency of ice   as a   modifier of the earth's surface, and      as a means   of
  transport.       Thus    led to the consideration      of glacial phenomena in
  general,     Professor Agassiz, accompanied           by M. Desor and others,
  next devoted       many months of several successive             years   to the sy
  stematic study     of the glaciers of his   native  country—especially      to that
  of   the Aar, where       under the mighty boulder nicknamed by those
  whom it sheltered the         " H&tel   des Neufchatelois,"        inquirers of all
  nations found not only a welcome, but the nobler hospitality of a
  free access to all that was being thought            and planned and done by
  the little party of savans of whom Agassiz was the head.                The results
  of the investigations thus laboriously carried            on, were embodied in
        '
  the Etudes sur les Glaciers,' published in 1840, and the 'Nouvelles
  Etudes,' which appeared          in 1847; and apart from all minor con
  tributions,    Professor    Agassiz    will   be   admitted by all who duly
 acquaint themselves with the history and present state of the question,
 to have made two important additions to our knowledge of glaciers.
 For, in     the first place,    the general     account of the glaciers       of the
 Aar given by Professor Agassiz in the                 ' Nouvelles     Etudes,'   and
  the trigonometrical survey of the same glacier            executed by      M. Wild
 under his auspices, were works of unrivalled excellence when pub
 lished, and have never been surpassed.                 And in    the second place,
 without      detracting in any way from the merit due to others,                   it
 may with certainty be affirmed that Professor Agassiz was the first
 to    take the     proper    means    to  ascertain     the relative motion       of
 the central and lateral parts of          a   glacier, which was done in the
autumn of 1841         ;  and that he also had the good fortune to reap the
fruit of his     arrangements,     by being the first to make public (in the
 'Comptes Rendus' for August the 29th, 1842) the novel and to him
unexpected       result that the centre of a glacier moves faster than the
sides.
          Professor Miller,
     It  is the happy combination of intellectual genius with diligence
and perseverance         that has enabled M. Agassiz to arrive at the great
results, a brief statement of which has just been read by the Secretary.
                                                                  2   l2

In your hands,   as Foreign Secretary,        I place the Copley Medal which
the Council have awarded to         M. Agassiz, requesting you that, when
you have the opportunity of transmitting it to him, you will at the
same time express that as      it is the   greatest honour the Royal Society
has to bestow,    so  it sufficiently shows the high estimation in which
they hold his scientific labours.
    A Royal Medal     has been adjudicated to        Dr. William B. Carpenter,
F.R.S., for his     Researches     on the Foraminifera, contained in four
                  '
memoirs in the Philosophical           Transactions,'    his Investigations into
the Structure of Shell, his Observations on the Embryonic                Develop
ment    of Purpura,   and his various other writings on Physiology             and
 Comparative Anatomy.
    Dr. Carpenter    has long held a high place as a systematic writer on
 Human      and Comparative        Physiology,     and   his well-known      works
 have served, more perhaps than any others              of their time,   to spread
the knowledge of those sciences and promote their study among a
large class of readers.      These writings, moreover,         while they admi
rably fulfil their purpose as systematic            expositions of the current
 state  of knowledge    on the subjects which they comprehend, afford
 evidence   throughout    of much depth         and extent  of original thought
 on most of the great questions of Physiology.
    While not unmindful,      however,      of these merits on the part     of Dr.
 Carpenter, or of his earlier special           contributions    to  science,   the
 Council have awarded him the Medal, in accordance with the existing
 terms of its adjudication, on account of his researches                on various
 branches of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology published in later
 years.
    Among those researches which more especially               demand    notice on
 this occasion, the first in point of time is the series of elaborate in
 vestigations on the intimate structure of Shell.             By   these inquiries
 Dr. Carpenter    discovered    that   a  very definite structural arrangement
 exists in the shells     of many mollusca,         and  presents    modifications
 which serve, in many instances,           to characterize   natural groups, as
 being in harmony with the general affinities of the animal.                   The
 group of Brachiopoda,        in particular, he showed         to be thus distin
 guishable from other bivalves       ;   and he further found that, among the
 Brachiopoda themselves,        certain groups of species are differentiated

                                         465
 from the rest by having their shells perforated with large canals, oc
cupied in the living animal by           "caecal  prolongations of the mantle.
The     presence   of  these perforations, which had previously been con
sidered to be mere surface        markings,      Dr. Carpenter      showed    to be a
constant character of the Terebratulidae, and their absence an equally
constant character of the Rhynchonellidae            ;  whilst, in other families,
certain genera or subgenera are distinguished by their presence from
those      in which they     are absent.      The validity of this distinctive
character has since been amply confirmed by                 Mr. Davidson in his
elaborate investigations       of British Fossil Brachiopoda.
    Dr. Carpenter's first contribution         to the minute study        of the Fo-
raminifera was       a  memoir read before the Geological Society in 1850,
in which he showed the necessity             of  a  careful microscopic inquiry
into the structure of the organisms of the class in question,                  for the
 elucidation of their real nature and affinities         ; and,   taken in connec
 tion with Professor W. C. Williamson's            previous memoirs on Poly-
 stomella crispa, this memoir may be considered                as having laid the
 foundation for the truly scientific study of the Foraminifera, which
 has     since   been    vigorously   prosecuted by Professor Williamson,
 MM. D'Archiac and Haime, and Messrs W. H. Parker                        and Rupert
 Jones, as well as by Dr Carpenter himself.
     In   the four memoirs on the minute structure            of the most highly
 developed      forms of this class 'which Dr. Carpenter has contributed
 to the '    Philosophical    Transactions,' he has described some most re
 markable types which were previously quite unknown                   ; he has given
 a detailed account       of the very complex organization existing alike            in
 the foregoing and in types previously well known by external con
 figuration; he has demonstrated the entire fallacy of the artificial
  system     of classification hitherto in     vogue,    the primary divisions       of
 which are based on the plan           of growth ; he has laid the foundation
 of   a  natural system, based on those characters in the internal struc
 ture and conformation of the shell which are most closely related to
  the physiological conditions of the animal           ; and,  finally, by the com
 parison of very large numbers of individuals, he has proved the exist
  ence of an extremely wide range of variation among the leading types
  of Foraminifera      ; often reassembling under a single species,            varying
  forms, which, for want of       a sufficiently careful study, have been not
  merely separated into distinct species, but had been arranged under

                                                       466
different genera, families, and even orders.                             In      this last conclusion,
which has an important bearing upon the question of the real value
and meaning            of natural history              species generally,         Dr. Carpenter has
been   fully      borne out by the parallel inquiries                     of Messrs. Parker and
Rupert Jones, which, relating to an extensive series of less developed
types not especially studied by him, form,                          as   it   were, the complement
of his own.
  In his     researches on the embryonic development                              of Purpura Lapil-
lus, Dr. Carpenter's attention was specially directed to the elucidation
of the   fact, that, from the many hundreds                       of egg-like          bodies contained
in each nidamental capsule,                        only about thirty embryos are evolved,
each of them many times larger than the ovum from which it origi
nated.       It    had        been affirmed by some previous observers                               that the
entire assemblage of ova coalesces into                         a   single mass, which subse
quently breaks up into                     a    smaller number of portions, each of which
developes        itself into          an embryo.         Dr. Carpenter,           on the other hand,
was led to the conclusion, that                       of the total number of egg-like                 bodies,
a few       develope          themselves             into embryos after the usual plan of
aquatic gasteropods,                  while the remainder coalesce into                    a single      mass.
To this     mass the embryos attach themselves                                by their mouths, and
gradually ingest the particles                       of which it    is composed                until it is all
shared among them                     j   they thus become          distended          to many times
their original bulk,                  and       on the additional        store    of nutriment thus
obtained, their               development is carried on to an                          advanced          stage
within the         capsule.               Dr. Carpenter's account of the                       process    was
warmly attacked by certain observers                          who had given                a   different ex
planation of           it,   but   it     was   fully confirmed     by   subsequent            trustworthy
inquirers    ;    and there seems                a   strong probability that           it  is    true of the
Pectinibrancbiate Gasteropods generally, since in many of them the
like replacement of numerous small egg-like bodies by                                           a   few large
embryos has been observed.
       Dr. Carpenter,
  You       have been long engaged in the cultivation                             of   a   science which,
important         as   it    is   in various other ways,            has this peculiar interest,
that   it   leads us to           a   more exact knowledge than we could otherwise
obtain of that part of the creation to which we ourselves                                            belong   ;
not only explaining the structure and functions of the various organs

                                         467
  of which the human body is composed, but even assisting us to obtain
  more accurate notions of those higher qualities, those intellectual and
  moral qualities, by which man is eminently distinguished from all
  other animals.      In the name   of the Royal Society I present to you
  this Medal    as a token of their high appreciation of your labours.
     A Royal Medal has been awarded to Mr. James Joseph Sylvester,
  F.R.S., for his Memoirs and Researches in Mathematical Science.
     Professor Sylvester's mathematical writings extend over               a period
  commencing in the year 1837        ;  separately,  and as a whole, they dis
 play in an eminent degree the originality and inventive and generali
 sing power of their author, and they have very greatly contributed to
 the advance of pure mathematics, more particularly               as   regards the
 Finite Analysis or Algebra, in the widest sense of the word. Several
 of the earlier papers relate to subjects which are resumed and de
 veloped in those of the last ten years        ; and on this ground      it is right
 to allude     to the researches     on   the theory of determinants, and
 the dialytic method of elimination          ;   and also  to the remarkable
 discovery   as to  Sturm's Theorem.        It is well known that the theorem
in its original form gave only a process for finding the functions
which     determine the number and limits            of the    real   roots of an
 equation  ;  the determination        of the actual expressions of            these
functions in terms of the roots was an extension and completion of
 the theory, the merit of which belongs exclusively to Professor Syl
 vester.   The subject is considered in detail,          and various new and
valuable results in connexion therewith are obtained,           in the elaborate
memoir in the         'Philosophical     Transactions'     for   1853,     "On     a
theory of the Syzygetic relations of two rational and integral functions,
comprising      an  application to the theory of Sturm's functions and
that    of the    greatest  algebraical common measure."                The   same
memoir contains also a very original theory of the intercalations or
relative interpositions of the real roots of two independent algebraical
equations, and     a new   method of finding superior and inferior limits
to the roots of an equation,      characterized by the employment of for
mula involving arbitrary      coefficients   which may be determined          so as
to bring the limits into coincidence         with the extreme        roots.     The
memoir contains also, in connexion with the subjects to which                     it
primarily relates, valuable    researches on the theory    of Invariants.

                                        468
    In regard to this theory, several capital discoveries belong to Pro
fessor Sylvester, — the Law of Reciprocity considered as a law relating
to the number of Invariants, — Contravariants, which, although now-
seen to be included in the notion of an invariant, were a conception to
which is due much of the progress of the theory, — the theory of the
Canonical forms of binary functions of an odd order, and (less com
pletely developed) the more difficult theory for those of an even
order, — and Combinants,        a theory, the resources of which are still to
be developed,       but a first fruits of which was the determination, in a
manageable      form, of the resultant of three ternary quadratic functions.
    Only   a sketch     of  a singularly elegant     geometrical theory of the
derivative points of a cubic curve has            as  yet been published, in a
                  '                            '
paper in the        Philosophical  Magazine       (1858).
    The very original investigations forming the subject of the Lectures
on Partitions are also as yet published in an incomplete form.
     There    are   many other papers       which might        with propriety be
 specially noticed, but it is obviously impossible on the present occasion
 to give anything like a complete account of the labours of Professor
 Sylvester   ;  among the latest of them are the researches on the Invo
lution of six lines.       The nature of the relation    can be easily explained.
 Six lines may      be such that, considered as belonging to a rigid body,
 there exists forces acting along these lines which keep the body in
 equilibrium ; or, what is the same relation between them, they may
 be such that the equilibrium        of a system     of forces  about these lines
 as axes, does not imply the complete            equilibrium    of the  system  of
 forces.    But the consideration of such          a system    of lines leads to a
 long series of geometrical theorems relating to curves in space, and
 ruled surfaces of the third and fourth orders, and opens a wide field
 for future researches.
        Professor Sylvester,
     Passing over the metaphysical question as to the origin of those
 simple conceptions from which          as a starting-point     all mathematical
 inquiries must set out, it is plain that whatever is done afterwards is
 the result of the exercise of the pure intellect ; and there is perhaps
 nothing more remarkable in the history of human nature, or which
 tends to give us so exalted a notion      of the powers of the human mind,
 as   that out of such simple materials so marvellous a fabric should

   On the motion of Sir          R. Murchison,      seconded by   Sir H. Holland,
it was resolved,      —
   " That the thanks of the Society              be returned to the President for

of their     sincere regret for his retirement, and for the cause which has
led to    it."
   The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers having
been read, and Mr. John Bishop and Mr. John Lubbock having been,

       The President      stated     that Mr. William Robert Sievier, who was
    readmitted     into  the      Society     on      the 17th   January, 1856, after
    having ceased to be a           Fellow through default of payment of his
    annual contribution, had from a similar cause again ceased to                       be a
    Fellow in November 1860, and had applied for readmission.                            Mr.
    Sievier' s letter to the Council was read, explaining the circumstances
    under which, during his absence on the Continent, the omission of
    payment had taken place.            The Statute applying to the          case was also
    read, and in accordance        therewith notice was given that the question
    of Mr. Sievier' s readmission would                be put to the vote at the next
    Meeting.
       Mr. Charles     Spence Bate was admitted into the Society.

          ceived October 12, 1861.
     In   a paper submitted to the Royal                 Society, and printed in the
'Proceedings'                for April 25th, 1861,1          directed attention in            a note
(page 201), to the question               of how     the surface       of a bar of ice in ice-
cold water,            as   distinguished from the interior of the bar, may, by the
application of tension to the bar, be influenced in respect to tendency
either to melt away,               or to solidify to itself additional ice from the
water     ;   but did not then venture to offer          a   positive answer.            I pointed
out   as a     matter deserving of special attention, and                    as   affording scope
for much additional theoretical and experimental investigation, the
distinction between the application to ice in ice-cold water, of stresses
tending to change its form, the stresses not being participated in by
the water          ; and the      application directly to the water, and through
that to the ice, of cubical or hydrostatic pressures or tensions, these
being participated in by the water and the ice alike                             ; and   I   pointed
out that the theory and quantitative calculation which I had origi
nally given * of the effect of pressure in lowering the freezing-point
of   water, or          of diminution of    pressure in raising            it,   applied solely to
effects       of   pressure      communicated to the ice through the water, and
therefore equal in all directions, and equally occurring in the ice and
the water          ;   but that when changes of pressure in one or more direc-

tions are applied to the ice as distinguished from the water, the theory
does not apply in any precise way to determine the conditions                      of the
melting of the ice, or of its growth by the freezing of the adjacent
water to its surface       ;  and  I expressed     the hope that       I  might subse
quently communicate to the Society some further developments                           of
the subject.
   On following up various considerations which had then occurred
to me,   I  soon formed positively the opinion that any stresses what
ever, tending to change the          form of a piece of ice in ice-cold water
(whether these stresses be          of the nature of pressures or tensions, that
is pushes or pulls, and whether they be in one direction alone, or m
more directions than one), must impart to the ice a tendency                     to melt
away, and to give out its cold, which will tend to generate, from the
surrounding       water, an equivalent quantity              of   ice  free from the
applied     stresses.      I  came also to the more general              inference   that
stresses   tending to change the form of any crystals in the saturated
solutions from which they have been crystallized must give them a
tendency     to dissolve away, and to generate, in substitution                for them
selves, other crystals       free from the applied stresses or any equivalent
stresses.      In the month of May last, I tested this inference by ap
plying stresses to crystals of common salt in water saturated with
salt dissolved from the crystals themselves             ;   and found the crystals
to give way gradually,          with a plastic yielding,        like the yielding of
wet snow,       but very much slower.            The crystals, with the brine in
which they were immersed, were, in the first set of experiments,
placed in    a glass   tube,    like  a test-tube, and a glass piston, or ram
mer, fitting the tube loosely, so as not to be water-tight,                  was placed
on the top      of the  salt which lay     like  fine sand in the bottom, and the
piston was loaded with weights.                The piston      went     on   descending
from day to day through spaces, which, though small, nud though
diminishing      as the crystals        became     more compacted against one
another, were        still   distinctly   visible.    When     the rate of descent
became very slow,         I added    more weights, and found that the rate of
descent increased,        as was to be expected.          I  afterwards procured a
strong brass cylinder with a loosely fitted, not water-tight piston, or
rammer, and in this I subjected crystals of common salt in their
saturated brine to very heavy stresses, and thus compressed them
rapidly and easily into a hard mass like rock-salt.                   The top surface

                                                             475
    presented           a perfect impression                of the tool marks            on the bottom           of the
    piston, such as might have been made in wax.                                      The expulsion of the
    minute quantities of brine remaining in pores                                  in the salt when it has
    become very closely compacted,                               appears    to be a slow and difficult
    proeess        ;    as, after the pressure               had been continued for about a fort
    night,     I
            still found a slight oozing of brine from a pore which hap
    pened to exist in the side of the cylinder.
       Experiments by the application of tensile stresses, or of any other
    stresses than those mixed and chiefly compressive ones which arise
    when the crystals are pressed in a close vessel by a rammer,                                                 would
    probably not be very easily carried out                            ;   and     I    have not as yet tried
    any except those by pressure.                            I   feel quite convinced, however,                    that
    melting, or dissolving, must result from all kinds of stresses tending
    to change of form.                    I
                            think the following statement may be assumed
    as a general              physico-mechanical principle or axiom, and                                 I   think it
    involves the truth of the opinion just expressed                                    :—
         If any        substance,         or any system of substances,                       be in a condition
    in which it is free to change its state (whether of molecular arrange
    ment, or of mechanical relative position and connexion of its parts,
    or of rest or motion), and                       if mechanical work            be applied to it (or put
    into     it)   as    potential energy, in such                 a   way    as    that the occurrence of
    the change             of   state    will   make    it   lose (or enable            it   to lose) (or be ac
    companied by its losing) that mechanical                                work from the condition of
    potential energy, without receiving other potential energy                                          as an     equi
    valent   ;         then     the substance           or system          will pass into              the changed
    state.         The consideration of                 a   few cases, in some                of which       there   is
    not freedom for the substance or system to change its state, and in
    others of which there                       is   freedom,      will render the meaning of this
    more clear.
         Gunpowder may be cited                       as an example          of   a    substance        in   a   condi
    tion not free to change its state, although when      made to explode               it   is
    by   spark,
         a         passes to an altered condition, and, in doing so, even
                           it
    gives out          a   great amount          of mechanical work.                    That      is   to say, that
    on the whole              it   is   more than free to change to the exploded state, or
    it   tends so to change, but there                      is   some kind         of   obstacle       at ordinary
    temperatures,             to the change, which either vanishes at
                                                             high tempera-                     a

 coining of it.      When the change is once hegun, the requisite help is
 given to the succeeding       parts by those which have gone off first.
     Again, water confined in a high reservoir is not free to go to a
 lower one    ; although   a  siphon, primarily filled with water, may help
 the parts successively     over the obstacle by lending to each the requi
 site mechanical work in advance, which it afterwards pays to the parts
 which are to follow, besides that it gives out in its fall a great addi
 tional amount of power or energy applicable otherwise.              Two   reser
 voirs of water,      on the same level, and having an opening between
 them under the water surface,         would represent the case of perfect
freedom for change of state ; and two on a level with one another,
 but separated by a partition, would represent the case in which no
 mechanical work would finally be either given out or absorbed by the
 change,    but in which there is not perfect freedom to change, until a
 siphon or other means of help is applied.
    A  bell hung from an axle and then turned up, and left resting
 against a stop a little beyond its position        of unstable equilibrium, is
 not free to go down, but a slight       pull will bring it   over this position
and make it free to swing, which the work stored             as potential energy
in the raising of it from its low or hanging position, will cause it to
do ; its fall   till it comes to the bottom being essentially      accompanied
by the loss of that potential energy,        as  such,   though not    as  actual
energy,    out of the system of which it and the earth are the two parts,
and in which change of their distance asunder constitutes change of
their potential energy.
    If in  an atmosphere     of steam resting on water at its boiling tem
perature for the pressure of the steam        ; as,  for instance, in the inside
of  a boiler partly filled with water, and partly with steam, an inverted
cup, or bell-shaped vessel, be suspended,         and  if it then, being  full of
steam, be forced down under the water, mechanical work               will be im
parted    as potential energy to the system         of which the     steam   and
water in the boiler form one part, and the earth is the other part               ;
though, for brevity of expression,         the work may be spoken of as
applied to the steam and water.          In this case there is perfect freedom
for the steam forced under the water to condense and cause by com
munication of its latent heat the generation of an equal quantity              of
steam at the surface       of the water under which the bell          was sunk.

 The occurrence of this change of           state   will enable the system to lose
 the potential energy which had been imparted to it by the submer
 sion of the steam, or will release that energy which had been stored,
 and the system       will pass into    the changed state        ;  that is to say, a
 certain part of the steam will change to water, and, instead of that, a
 different part of the water will be changed to steam               ;  and this change
 will   be accompanied      by a transmission        of heat from the part          con
 densing to the part evaporating.            This is all in     accordance     with the
 axiom    ; and we know otherwise that           it must take      place, as  the steam
 being pressed when submerged             must condense and give its latent heat
 to the water, and that heat must generate an equal quantity of steam
 at the surface    of the water, where the      pressure is less.       Thus the truth
 of the axiom      is confirmed.
     If  a quantity of ice and water be enclosed              in a cylinder with a
 water-tight piston, and      if  this be put into a completely closed vessel
 filled with other ice and water, and          if the  piston then be pulled with
 any given force and fixed in its new position (which might be done
 in many ways, as for instance, by the use of an axle passing air-tight
 through the side of the outer vessel), mechanical work will be intro
duced     as potential energy into the system consisting of all the things
enclosed in the outer vessel.            But there is perfect freedom for the
water enclosed in the cylinder to proceed to freeze,                     obtaining   the
requisite cold from the ice in the water confined around the cylinder
and within the outer vessel.          The occurrence of this          change would be
accompanied by the system's losing or giving up the potential energy
which      had been stored       in it.    According       to the axiom, then, the
change ought to occur.           But  we know otherwise that            it must occur   ;
because the diminution        of hydrostatic      pressure    in the cylinder raises
the freezing-point of the enclosed water, and makes it freeze by the
cold of the surrounding mixture of ice and water, which, besides, by
being itself subjected to increased pressure,            tends to give out cold      by
the lowering of its freezing-point.           Thus the truth of the axiom is
«gain confirmed.
     Lastly,  if a  bar of ice in ice-cold water be subjected to any stress
(a pull for instance) tending to change its form, it will receive me
chanical work from the force, or forces, applied, and that work will
be stored as potential energy         in the elasticity of the ice.             Now,   if
there be another piece of ice in juxtaposition              with this piece, seeing

that, at the beginning, both these pieces were free from externally
applied forces, and were both in the state in which either was perfectly
free to melt and cause an equal                         quantity of water to freeze to the
other*, it will follow according                       to the axiom, now supposed to be
established,         that the application of the stress                        will    cause this         actio*
to occur.
     The case of crystals in their solutions might                             be stated almost in             the
same words as the case of ice in ice-cold water : but                                it is to      be observed
thnt, in their case, the necessity for the translation of one chemical
substance through another (the salt through the dissolving liquid),
and not of heat or cold alone, causes a great slowness of the process,
as compared with that                   of the yielding of the                 ice, in ice-cold water,
to applied stresses.
     At    an early stage          of the considerations which led to the opinions
on the influence          of stresses          on crystallization and liquefaction described,
in the present paper, the question arose to me                                   :   — Is      a   spiculum or
single crystal of ice, which has solidified itself in the interior of water,
and is therefore not colder than the water, plastic                                        ?       Or would      it,

than water in contact with       and that the water must continually be giving off
                                         it,
heat to the ice.  Both these opinions are inconsistent with the supposition here
assumed.     I          however, that that supposition
                     conceive,                               amply confirmed by  is
tho fact that   was involved essentially throughout the reasoning, by which
                  it                                                                                             T

and to calculate the amount of the lowering.     That reasoning led to true results
and  I believe   could not have done so unless the supposition were true, that

 the part already formed undergoes            permanent change of form, such
 as would be due to any plastic or ductile yielding.                I think  we must
 suppose the molecules       in the interior of      one crystal to be so locked
 into one another, by the forces            of crystalline    cohesion,     that any
 one   of them, or   set of them, would      experience    a difficulty in making
a beginning     of  the change    of  state from solid to liquid.         Ihave not
 succeeded    even in forming any clear conception             of continuous cry
 stalline structure admitting of what may be called ductile or malleable
 bending (that is, bending beyond limits of elasticity such as occurs
 in lead, copper, tin, and many other metals), and still remaining of
 the nature of one continuous crystal.              What in soft or malleable
 crystals of copper or other metals, deposited in the electrotype process,
may be the nature of the change of molecular arrangement induced
by bending them,       I  cannot say   ; but    I suppose  that, in their yielding,
 their crystalline structure is materially altered, and rendered discon
 tinuous where, before, it was continuous.
    In  a mass   of plastic  ice, I incline  to think that the internal melting,
to which      I attribute the plasticity, must occur at the surfaces               of
junction of separate crystals or fragments of crystals          ;  though probably
pores formed by melting, by pressures, or by stresses, may penetrate
 crystals by entering them from their moistened                   surfaces   or their
junctions with other crystals.           It  now becomes clear,        I think, that
the influence of stresses affecting the ice, and tending to make it melt
without     there   being necessarily any consequent          pressure applied to
the water in contact with the ice, must come to be taken into account
in   any theory    of the plasticity of ice approaching to completeness.
This    view does not, however, I think, supersede the theory of the
plasticity of ice sketched out by myself in former papers, but rather
constitutes an amendment,           and further       development       of it.   Any
complete theory of       the plasticity   of  ice, and   of the nature of glacier
motion,     must comprise the conditions              as  to 'fluid pressure and
structural arrangement of the water and air included in the ice, and
 must so explain the lamination of the glacier, seen as blue and white
veins.     My brother, Professor William Thomson, in papers in the
 '                                            '
   Proceedings of the Royal Society for February 25 and April 22,
 1858, endeavoured        to follow up my previously published views on
the plasticity of ice with an explanation of the laminated structure,
based on the same principles.             The explanation       he then offered,    I
                                                                   2 m 2

think, cannot fail to        assist in suggesting the direction in           which the
true solution is ultimately to be sought for                  ;  yet  I feel  confident
that no full and true solution has            as yet been found*.
    In the foregoing part of the present paper,                 I  have shown reason
why stresses applied to crystals when in contact with the liquid from
which they have been produced, should be expected                       to cause them
to melt or dissolve away.           The following line of reasoning to show
that stresses applied to a          crystal will cause a resistance to the de
position of additions to it from the liquid, or, in other words, a re
 sistance    to its growth, will,     I think,    prove to be correct.         When     a
 crystal grows, the additions, it seems to me, must lay themselves
 down in a state of molecular fitting, or regular interlocking with the
 parts on which they apply themselves               ; or, in other words, they must
 lay themselves       down so   as to form one continuous crystalline structure
 with the parts already crystallized.              It  thus seems to me that,       if  a
 crystal grows when under a stress, the new crystalline matter must
 deposit itself in the same state of stress             as the part is in on which      it
 lays itself.     If,  then, we consider a spiculum          of  ice growing in water,
 and   if we  apply any stress, a pull for instance, to it while it is thin, and
 then fix it in its distended state, and           if  then by the transference     t to
 the water beside it of cold taken from any other ice at the freezing-
 point we cause it to grow, which it may do                     if there be no other
 crystal of ice beside it more free than it to receive accessions, then
 the additional matter will,         I  think, lay itself down in the same state
 of  tensile stress as the original spiculum was put into by the applied
 pull.     The contractile     force    of the crystal will thus        be increased   in
 proportion to the increase         of its cross sectional area.          If  it now   be
 nllowed to contract and relax itself, it will give out, in doing so, more
 mechanical work than was applied to the original spiculum during
 distention.       Hence there would be          a  gain of mechanical work with-
    •  I  have my brother's authority for stating that, although he believes the
 physical principles suggested in his papers here referred to to be capable of
 being developed into a true explanation of the phenomena, yet he considers
 further investigation necessary, and does not feel confident as to the correct
 ness of that part of the explanation he offered, in which the mutual action of
 two vesicles in a line oblique to that of maximum pressure is considered.
    t A theoretic air-engine for making such transferences of heat or cold was
 used in the reasoning by which       I  determined theoretically the lowering of tho
 freezing-point by pressure   ;  and the same is admissible here.

                                       481
out any corresponding expenditure          ;  or we could theoretically have a
means     of perpetually obtaining mechanical work out of nothing,
unless it were the case that greater cold is required to freeze water
into ice on the stressed crystal than on a crystal free from stress.
Hence we must suppose that          a greater    degree   of cold will be required
to cause the stressed crystal to grow.            The reasoning just given has
been for brevity stated        somewhat      in outline ; but I trust the full
meaning can readily be made out, and that what has been said may
suffice.
    I wish   now to suggest     as  an important       subject for investigation,
The Effect of Change of Pressure (hydraulic pressure) in changing the
 Crystallizing Temperatures of Saline or other Solutions of given
 Strengths, — as    I feel  sure that such effect must exist,          but am not
 aware that   it has   been hitherto    discussed      or experimented on, and
 as it is intimately connected with the matters under consideration in
 the present paper and with subjects             discussed   in previous   papers,
 which   I  have submitted to the Royal Society, on Ice.

     [Note by the Communicator.
                                       — Colonel Smythe is known to mag-
 neticians as having been Director of the Magnetic Observatory at St.
 Helena from 1842 to 1847.           Being about to . proceed, in December
 1859, on a Government Mission            to the      Fiji Islands, which would
 require his residence there for some months, he addressed a letter to
 the Council of the Royal Society expressing his readiness to make
 any scientific observations     that might be suggested         to him as   likely
 to be useful in a part of the globe           hitherto so little known.       The
 Council directed that the Committee of the Kew Observatory should
 be informed     of the opportunity thus offered of obtaining a reliable
 determination of the present values of the magnetic elements at the
 Fiji Islands  ;  and Colonel Smythe was in consequence supplied with
 the necessary instruments from that establishment.
    In communicating       to the Society this paper, containing the results

                                       482
 of Colonel Smythe's observations, Major-General Sabine is desirous
 of drawing the attention of the Fellows to the thoroughly business-like
 manner in which Colonel Smythe has performed this useful service
 and to the illustration which it affords of the advantages anticipated
by   M. Gauss from the establishment of the British Colonial Magnetic
 Observatories — that " they would become schools for many good ob
servers who would subsequently extend their activity over a wider
 range, and would contribute       to arouse, to nourish, and to extend      to
other parts of natural knowledge that desire for the greatest possible
accuracy in observation which was formerly met with only in Astro
nomy and in the higher Geodesy."             (Letter to Sir John Herschel
printed in the Reports of the British Association for the Advance
ment of Science for 1845, p. 45.)]
    The accompanying observations          were   taken at a wooden      house
 erected for the purpose on a clay soil       1 06  feet above the mean level
of the   sea, and distant 2G5 yards *West (19° 07'       S.) from  the spot on
the beach where      I have  been informed      Captain Denham's observa

III. " On      the Calculus of Functions."              By W. H. L. Russell,
       Esq., A.B.      Communicated by A. Cayley, F.B-.S. Received
       October     31, 1861.
                                      (Abstract.)
   One of the first efforts toward the formation of the calculus of
functions is due to Laplace, whose solution of the functional equation
of  the first order, by means        of two equations in finite      differences,  is
well known.        Functional      equations were afterwards treated syste
matically by     Mr. Babbage      ;  his memoirs were published in the Trans
actions of this Society, and there is some account of them in Professor
Boole's Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences.                  A  very im
portant functional equation was solved by Poisson in his memoirs on
Electricity; which         suggested    to me the investigations        I have now
the honour to lay before the Society.
    I have commenced         by discussing the linear functional equation of
the first order with constant coefficients, where the subjects of the
unknown functions are rational functions of the independent variable,
and have shown how the solution              of such  equations   may in a variety
of  cases be effected by series, or by definite integrals.             I  have then
considered      functional     equations with       constant coefficients     of the
higher orders, and have proved that they may be solved by methods
similar to those used for equations            of the first order.     I  have next
proceeded     with the solution of functional equations with variable co
efficients.     In connexion with functional        equations,  I  have considered
equations     involving definite integrals, and containing an unknown
function under the integral sign           ;  the methods employed for their
resolution depend         chiefly upon the solution of functional equations,
as effected    in this paper.       The calculus of functions       has now for a
long time engaged the attention              of analysts  ; and   I  hope that the
present     investigations will    be found to have      extended    its power and
resources.

fx    is a rational and integral function of x.                                      In fact, considering for

the transformed equation in                  y        has the following property                      :    viz., every
function of the coefficients which, expressed                                   as   a   funtion of a,         b,   e,   d,   e,

of the two quantics

This       comes to saying that                        be so determined that in the equation
                                            if
                                            T
for   y    the coefficient of the second                         term (y*) shall vanish, the other
coefficients       will     be invariants         ;    or      if   in the function of                    y    which      is
equated          to zero we consider             y     as an      absolute constant, the function
of   y   will    be an invariant           of the two quantics.                          It   is   easy to find the
value of      T
              ;      this   is   in fact     given         by    the equation
                                 0=aT+3bB + 3cC+dD                               ;
and we have thence for the value of y,
     y   = (ax    +

so that for this value                 of   y    the function              of   y    which equated to zero
gives the transformed equation will be an invariant                                        of the two quantics.
It    is   proper to notice that in the last-mentiond                                         expression for y,
all the coefficients except those of the term in x°, or 6B                                           +     3eC      +3rfD
are those         of the binomial (1, 1)',                      whereas          the excepted coefficients
are those         of the binomial (1, 1)'                  ;    this suffices to show what the ex
pression for       y   is   in the general case.

       lysis."     By George Gore, Esq.             Communicated        by Pro
       fessor   Tyndali.       Received     November      12, 1861.
                                    (Abstract.)
    In this communication, which is          a continuation    in subject (but
different in title) of a previous investigation      " On   the Movements of
Liquid Metals and Electrolytes in the Voltaic Circuit," the author has
described    the most convenient and effective          method     of obtaining
vibrations and sounds by electrolysis.
   The paper contains      a full account of the influence of various cir
cumstances     upon the vibrations and sounds     :  viz., of the electrodes,  —
the electrolyte, — mechanical circumstances and temperature, — the
electric current, — size and number of voltaic elements,         — quantity of
the current, — coils of wire in the circuit,     — induction coils and iron
cores, — electrolytes in the circuit,    — and of   magnetism    :  also the  in
fluence  of the vibrating medium itself upon the electric current.
   The   best liquid for producing the vibrations and sounds consists          of

                                          492
  10 grains  of cyanide of mercury and 100 grains of hydrate of potash
 dissolved in 2| ounces of aqueous hydrocyauic acid containing 5 per
 cent. of anhydrous acid.
     The vibrations and sounds occur only at the              surface  of the negative
 mercury electrode,       as   already described (Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 44,
 page   1 77) ; and out of a large number of liquids examined, the only
 ones in which phonetic vibrations occurred were solutions                  of alkaline
 cyanides containing dissolved mercury           ; and these only give the      sounds
 with electrodes      (or at least a cathode) of mercury, not with solid
 metals nor with fused alloys.
     The vibrations     and     sounds vary considerably           according to the
 size  and number of the voltaic elements              ;  with a few elements         of
 large surface, the vibrations were small and the sounds high, and with,
 many elements of small surface they were much larger and the tone
 lower.     The   most suitable number         of  elements     to produce them is
 either two of Grove's or five of Smee's.
    The interposition of       a coil  of stout copper wire in the circuit made
 the vibrations wider and the sound more base               ; and  if an iron core was
 suddenly thrust into the axis of the coil, they became still wider and
 the sounds still more base, and remained so as long as the iron con
tinued there    ;  but   if  a secondary coil containing           a great length    of
 fine copper wire surrounded the primary coil              (with or without    an iron
 core), and the ends of the secondary wire were suddenly united, the
vibrations instantly became narrower and the sounds more high, and
remained so     as  long    as the secondary circuit was closed.
    The vibrations of the mercury and electrolyte make the electric
current which produces them sensibly intermittent,                     similar to the
influence of a vibrating coil-hammer           ;  and they may be used to some
extent in a similar way to that instrument to produce shocks, &c.
by means of a secondary            coil.   A  strong electro-magnet placed           in
various positions near the locality of the vibrations had no perceptible
influence upon them.
    The author    considers the vibrations to be         of electro-chemical origin,
and to result from an attraction between             the mercury of the negative
electrode    and the mercury of the electrolyte.               He   supposes   that to
produce the vibrations, either the voltaic force itself must be of an
intermittent nature, or the resistance           opposed      to that force by the
liquids    employed must be intermittent,              and    intends to make the

  III.   "On Perchloric Acid              and   its Hydrates."          By Henry
         Enfield      Roscoe, B.A., Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry in
         Owens College, Manchester.               Communicated by Professor
         A. W. Williamson.               Received December         12, 1861.
      Stadion*    in the year 1816 showed that perchlorate of potassium
  contains 45-92 per cent.           of oxygen, and that its composition is
 therefore represented          by the formula C1G4K (requiring 46*17 per
  cent.  of oxygen).      Mitscherlich t and ScrullasJ in 1830, and Marig-
 nac§ in 1841, confirmed this result, their experiments respectively
 showing that the salt in question contains 46-06, 46 20, and 46-17
 per cent. of oxygen.
     Upon these determinations is based nearly all the knowledge we
 possess    of the quantitative relations of perchloric acid. The anhy
 dride, Cla 07, has not been isolated ; no analyses of the hydrated acid
 itself have been published,          and the composition of only one or two
 of its  salts  has been ascertained.         Our acquaintance       even with the
 general characters of this substance is also most limited            ; and we can
 only account for the neglect           with which chemists       have   treated the
 highest and yet the most stable of the oxides of chlorine by the fact
 that the preparation of the acid in large quantity has hitherto been
 attended    with great difficulties.
     In the following communication           I have to detail the results     of ex
periments which        I believe somewhat       enlarge our views respecting the
nature and properties of this interesting acid.
    The first point to which attention was naturally directed, was the
best mode of preparing the pure aqueous perchloric acid in quantity.
After trial of a great number of methods, the following modification
of that    recommended         by Serullas was adopted as yielding          the best
results.     A  large quantity of a saturated solution of hydrofluosilicic
acid was prepared by heating dry sand and fluor-spar with more than
the equivalent quantity of twice-rectified oil of vitriol in large stone
ware bottles, and leading the gaseous fluoride           of silicon with   the usual

                                             494
precautions iuto water.    After straining off the precipitated silica, the
acid was    boiled down with chlorate of potassium (and not perchlorate,
as   Serullas advises), added in such quantity that for every kilogramme
of fluor-spar        6OO grammes      of chlorate        was present.            On heating    the
mixture, the liberated chloric acid undergoes                       quiet decomposition,
chloric oxide, and probably other oxygen compounds                            of chlorine,
escaping    as gas, whilst aqueous perchloric acid                  remains in the liquid.
After   the mixture has cooled, the aqueous acid was decanted from the
insoluble fluosilicate of potassium, and the clear liquid concentrated                           by
boiling until the perchloric acid began to volatilize. The acid                                was
then distilled, and freed from chlorine by perchlorate of silver,                              and
from sulphuric          acid   by perchlorate of barium.               According            to this
method, 4 kilogs. of chlorate of potassium yielded 500 grammes of
pure concentrated aqueous perchloric acid.
     The   aqueous acid thus prepared is a colourless, heavy,                        oily   liquid,
in appearance         undistinguishable from oil of vitriol              ;       its composition
and properties        will   be hereafter described.
     From this       substance   I   have           in preparing two definite
                                             succeeded
compounds.            One of these is the liquid pure perchloric acid, CI Ot H,
an interesting body which was previously unknown                             ;   and the other
is the monohydrated or crystallized acid, CI Ot H + H, O, originally
discovered by Serullas, but obtained by him in such small quantities
that he was unable to determine               its composition.
     If aqueous      perchloric acid be distilled with four times its volume of
oil of vitriol containing 98'5 per cent. of                    real acid,         decomposition
begins at a temperature of about 110° C.                       ;   dense white fumes            are
evolved and escape, whilst a yellowish, mobile, easily condensible liquid
is found in the receiver.            If     the distillation be continued, the tem
perature gradually rises to 200°             C,   and a thick oily liquid distils over,
which, on coming into contact with the more volatile liquid in the
receiver, immediately unites with              it,   forming   a   white, solid, crystalline
mass.      Both the first and the last portions of the distillate thus pre
pared were found to contain sulphuric acid mechanically carried over,
and were therefore unfit for analysis.                     In order    to obtain the sub
stances     in   a   pure state, the crystallized acid thus prepared requires
redistillation.        Heated, however,         to   a   temperature of 110°             C,    the
crystals themselves undergo            a    decomposition similar to that just                 de
scribed,   n   strongly fuming volatile liquid first distilling over, and                      the

oily acid appearing in the neck of         the retort when the temperature
rises to 203°       C,   and producing crystals on coming in contact with the
first distillate.        These crystals are likewise formed when water is added
to the volatile liquid             ;    and this      is,   in fact, the best mode of preparing
them in the pure state.
                                   1.    Perchloric Acid, C10tH.
     Pure perchloric acid may be obtained in quantity by the process
above described,             or, more easily, according to the following method.
Perchlorate of potassium                      is   distilled together with four equivalents
of strong sulphuric acid, until the drops of distillate no longer soli
dify on falling into the receiver  in this way 100 grammes of per
                                                     ;
chlorate yield 14 grammes of crystallized                               perchloric acid containing
traces    of sulphuric acid.                  The impure crystals are then              melted, placed
in   a   small bulb-retort, and gently heated.                 Ebullition               commences       at
110°     C, and the          decomposition continues for some time without fur
ther aid of heat         ;    dense white fumes, accompanied                      by   small quantities
of chlorine,        issue from the mouth                      of   the apparatus, and         a   mobile,
easily condensible,               heavy liquid        is    found in the receiver.            This liquid
is   pure perchloric acid,                 C104     H, which,         if   the distillation    has been
conducted slowly,                 is    perfectly colourless, but often has                   a   slightly
yellow colour, owing to the presence of lower oxides of chlorine.                                      As
soon as the first appearance                     of crystals in the neck of the retort                  is
noticed, the distillation                is   stopped. The liquid distillate should then
be at once sealed up in                  n    bulb with long capillary ends, out of which
any wished-for quantity may be obtained at pleasure.                                      The     greatest
care     is   necessary in working with this body, owing to its explosive and
corrosive properties.
     The composition of the liquid thus                               prepared    was determined        in
two ways        :   in the first place,              by the estimation of the quantity of
the potassium salt which                      a    given weight of the acid yielded, as also
of the quantity of chlorine, oxygen, and potassium which this salt
contained and secondly, by estimation of the quantity of barium
                ;
needed to form           a    neutral salt with              a     given weight of the acid.           As
the acid on exposure to the air absorbs                                moisture with the greatest
avidity,        producing              the crystals,        it   is   necessary   that the acid for
analysis should be quickly sealed up in weighed bulbs.

last described,  was mixed with water and neutralized by an excess of
pure carbonate of potassium       prepared from the tartrate.             Acetic   acid
was then added to the acid reaction, and               the whole evaporated to
dryness  on the water-bath.        Treated with absolute           alcohol,    the in
soluble* perchlorate was thrown upon               a  weighed filter, and com
pletely freed from soluble acetate by washing with absolute alcohol.
The weight of perchlorate of potassium obtained was 1 *080 gnn. ;
hence the liquid contained 0*7837 grm. of C104 II, or 99*93 per cent.
Of this potassium-salt,   0*9915 grm. lost, on heating in a long test-tube
with pure peroxide of iron, 0*457 grm.           ;   and the chlorine      in the    re-
sidsal chloride of potassium required 0*7683 grm. of pure silver for
complete precipitation.

0*9660 grm., heated with peroxide of iron, lost 0*4440                     grm., and
the residual chloride required 0 7440 grm. of pure silver for com
plete precipitation.     0*3165    grm. of the same perchlorate yielded,
on treatment with strong sulphuric           acid, 0*2010 grm.           of sulphate
of potassium. Hence the liquid contained                 1*2179    grm., or 99*95
per cent. of CIO, H.
    Analysis No.   3. — 0*3155 grm.      of pure acid      was diluted with water
and treated with an excess of freshly precipitated carbonate of barium.
On filtering and washing, the barium in the filtrate was estimated as
sulphate, of which salt 0*3660 grm. was obtained, showing that
the substance    contained      0*3157 grm., or            100*06     per cent.      of

       Perchloric acid is    a heavy, colourless, volatile liquid, which does
   not solidify at temperatures above —35° C.            At   150-5  C. the  specific
   gravity of the liquid was found to be I '782          as a mean     of two  deter
   minations.      The vapour of perchloric acid is colourless and trans
   parent   ; but when brought into contact with the air, dense masses of
  white fumes of hydrated acid are given off, owing to rapid absorption
  of atmospheric moisture.        Perchloric acid does not give up its oxygen
  to metals     at the ordinary temperature      as  readily as nitric acid    ; but
  when heated with finely divided iron, copper, zinc, &c., the oxides of
  these metals are formed,      with evolution of light    and heat   ; sulphur and
  phosphorus are likewise at once converted into their highest oxides
  in presence of this acid.      It is, however, when brought into contact
  with a carbonized material that the energy of the oxidizing action of
  perchloric acid becomes visible, as        a single drop of this substance
  falling upon charcoal, paper, or wood, causes an explosive combustion
  which in violence does not fall far short of the detonation produced
  by the sudden decomposition of the chloride of nitrogen.                 Dropped
 into ether or alcohol, an explosion occurs violent enough to break in
 pieces    the vessel containing the liquid.        This latter decomposition
 may possibly be owing to the formation of the explosive body,
 described by Messrs. Hare and Boyle as the perchlorate of ethyl.
 Perchloric acid likewise combines with the greatest energy with water,
 causing a loud hissing noise, and forming either the crystallized or
 the oily acid, according to the relative quantities of water and acid
 present.      In working with this     substance   the greatest     care must bo
 taken,   as one   drop falling upon the skin produces powerful cauteriza
 tion, and leaves      a  wound    which does not heal for weeks.              Like
 nitric  acid,   N03 H, which in many      respects   it  closely* resembles,   per
chloric acid cannot be distilled by itself under the ordinary atmospheric
 pressure     without undergoing decomposition.           The colourless liquid,
when gently heated, begins to decompose at 75°               C,   the temperature
gradually rising to 92°, at which point it remains constant for some
time, gives off dense white fumes, and quickly turns to           a dark blackish-
brown colour, large quantities of a yellow gas having the peculiar
sweetish smell     of chloric oxide being  evolved.       After  some time drops
of   a dark-coloured     liquid, resembling bromine in appearance,            distil
over, the decomposition continuing          in the retort     ;  this dark liquid
contained 9477 per cent. of CIO4         H.    On continuing the distillation

                                         498
the decomposition became more rapid, and a sharp explosion occurred                   ;
the receiver was broken to fragments, whilst the residual liquid                in the
retort became colourless, and, on cooling, solidified to a crystalline
mass which       contained 87'76 per cent. of C104H.                   I  propose to
investigate    the  composition     and   mode     of  formation   of  this  singular
body at   a future time   ; it may possibly prove         to be the black   explosive
substance    described by    Millon*     as produced by the action         of organic
matter on    the so-called chloroperchloric acid. Perchloric acid likewise
undergoes     spontaneous     decomposition at the ordinary atmospheric
temperature, even when not exposed                 to light.    The liquid, which
when freshly prepared has a slight yellow colour, changes to a deep
brown colour when kept in the dark for a few days ; and after the
lapse   of about   a fortnight   the bulbs containing the acid are found to
have exploded.        Hence it is impossible to preserve pure perchloric
acid for any length of time      ;   it must   be prepared when required         from
the crystallized acid.
                 2. Perchloric Monohydrate,           ClOjH+Ha0.
   The first hydrate of perchloric acid is the solid crystalline substance
discovered     by Scrullas, and supposed by some chemists to be the
anhydridef.
   It  is best prepared in the pure state by carefully adding water to
perchloric acid    ; great heat    is thereby evolved, and the crystals which
form on cooling generally possess         a slight yellow colour, which rapidly
disappears when they are exposed to sunlight.
   By partially melting the crystals          several times, and separating the
liquefied portions, the residue was found to be in              a fit state for ana
lysis, as is seen by the close approximation of the experimental num
bers to the calculated composition in the following determinations.

   The monohydrate of perchloric acid solidifies        at the ordinary tem
perature to long silky needle-shaped     crystals, which fume strongly in
the air, most rapidly absorbing        moisture, and        immediately deli
quescing on exposure.      Placed in a thin bulb in a water-bath, the
liquefied acid was found to freeze between 49°*5 and 50o,0             C,  whilst
the crystals melted between 50o-0 and 51° 0 C.          ; hence the melting-
and freezing-points of this substance lie within a few tenths of 50° C.
The specific gravity of the liquid monohydrate at 50° C. is               1-81 1 ;
but the solid acid is considerably heavier, owing to the large con
traction which the liquid undergoes on freezing. As has been
described,  the monohydrate splits up on heating into real perchloric
acid and a less volatile    aqueous     acid  ;   it therefore     possesses    no
definite boiling-point.    Heated to 110°          C,   the melted crystals
enter into rapid decomposition, which, when once commenced,                   con
tinues for some time, even when the thermometer sinks to 95°                  ; on
further application of heat, the liquid becomes of           a  dark yellowish-
brown colour, ebullition continues, and the temperature gradually

                                        500
rises to '203°   C,   at which point the mercury remains stationary, the
colourless oily acid passing over unchanged.
    Although not     so violent in its action on organic matter as the pure
acid, the fused monohydrate, when brought into contact              with wood
or paper, induces immediate combustion ; and when dropped into
water it combines with a hissing noise, forming the aqueous acid.
                         3. Aqueous Perchloric Acid.
    There is certainly no other known acid in which the acid and the
hydrates differ so widely from each other in their properties              as is
the case with       perchloric   acid,  — the acid itself being    a   strongly
fuming, volatile liquid, acting in a most violent manner on organic
substances,    and closely resembling nitric acid, whilst the monohydrate
is a solid crystalline      body, and the higher         hydrates oily liquids
 having high boiling-points,        being devoid of smell, and in outward
 appearance    bearing a striking analogy to oil of vitriol.
    When pure aqueous perchloric acid is concentrated by evaporation
until white fumes are evolved, an acid is obtained on distillation
which boils at a constant temperature (about 203° C), and has a
 constant composition.         The strength of such a residual acid was
 determined by volumetric analysis with a standard solution of soda             ;
 it  was   found    to contain    71 *6  per cent.    C104H.     As  a control
 analysis, 0*6550 grm. of the same acid was neutralized by carbonate
 of barium,    and yielded    0*5435    grm. of sulphate of barium, corre
 sponding to 71*57 per cent.       H C104.      Of this acid 25 cubic centims.
 was placed in a retort and distilled        until three-fourths of the liquid
 had passed over     ;  analysis with soda and with barium showed that it
 contained   72* 18   per cent. HC10t.
     The residual acid boiling at 203° C. left in the retort after distil
 ling the solid monohydrate was found to possess a composition iden
 tical with the foregoing.       Thus 1*1385 grm. of such residual acid
 yielded 1*136 grm. of perchlorate of potassium, corresponding to
  72*4 per cent.   H CIO,   ; and 0*954    grm. of the same acid furnished
  0*7995 grm.    of sulphate of barium, or contained          72*28   per cent.
  H CIO4.     It is thus evident that an acid containing less     H CIO4   than
  72*3 per cent. loses water, whilst an acid stronger than this loses real
 acid on distillation     ; so  that    both  liquids   yield a  residual acid
  possessing   a  constant composition of 72*3 per cent.          HCIO4,    and

                                       501
boiling at 203° C.       This per-ccntnge corresponds,            however,    to no
definite hydrate of simple atomic composition              ;   an acid having the
formula H C104 + 2(HaO) containing 73 63                     per cent.     II CIO,.
Aqueous perchloric       acid follows, therefore, the same general rela
tions respecting composition and boiling-point which                I  have shown
hold good for so many aqueous acids*; namely, that the phenomena
of constant composition and fixed boiling-point are in the above cases
dependent mainly upon physical rather than upon chemical attrac
tions. The specific gravity was found to he 1*709 at 11° C.
   The reactions of     aqueous     perchloric     acid have been sufficiently
studied by other observers.
   To the foregoing description of the properties of perchloric acid
and its hydrates,   I have to add the following analyses of a few of the
salts of this acid which have hitherto not been examined.                    These
analyses serve to confirm      the fact that the estimation of perchloric
acid by precipitation     as potassium-salt in alcoholic solution is in
accuracy second to few of the most exact methods                  of quantitative
determination.
              (1) Perchlorate      of Ammonium,       NH4C104.
   This compound is       one   of  the very few non-deliquescent salts           of
perchloric acid.     It is anhydrous and isomorphous, as              Mitscherlich
has shown with the potassium-salt.            The ammonium         was estimated
as the double potassium-salt,        and  the perchloric acid as potassium-
salt insoluble in absolute alcohol.        Analysis gave     : —

best prepared by dissolving carbonate          of copper in dilute perchloric
acid, and adding an excess of ammonia. The crystals are
                                                                            readily

    In  consequence    of the lamented Death of His Royal Highness

          Major-General     SABINE, President, in        the Chair.
    The President,     on the part of the Council,        submitted to the
 Meeting the following Address of Condolence to be presented                   to
 the Queen    : —
    We,   Your Majesty's       most dutiful and loyal subjects,        the Pre
 sident, Council,    and Fellows of the Royal       Society of London         for
 improving      Natural Knowledge,    desire   humbly    to offer to      Your
 Majesty      the sincere  expression of our sorrow for the irreparable
 loss which     Your Majesty and the nation have sustained               by the
 death   of His Royal Highness The Prince Consort.
     While  we deeply    share in the universal lamentation which            this
 great calamity has called forth, we claim the mournful privilege of
 giving expression to our special grief for the loss of a Prince who,
 to his other high qualities and claims to the nation's esteem and
 gratitude, united a just appreciation of the importance to mankind

                                               501
    of  those    pursuits to which        the    Royal Society is devoted,      and  an
    earnest desire to aid in their advancement.
       That it     may please Divine        Providence to soften the affliction       of
   Your Majesty             and Your Royal Family, and support you in this
   heavy     trial,  is   the earnest wish and prayer of Your Majesty's
   loyal   and    devoted     suhjects, the President, Council, and Fellows of
   the Royal Society of London.
      On the motion of          the  Lord Chief Baron, seconded by Mr.             Hey-
  wood, it was       Resolved, — That       the Fellows do most       cordially  concur
  in the Address now           read from the Chair.
      The Address         was then signed by the President on            behalf of  the
  Council and Fellows.
      The following communications              were read : —
  I. " Preliminary          Note on the Nature and Qualities               of  Voltaic
          Currents."         By George Gore, Esq. Communicated                      by
          Professor Stokes, Sec.R.S. Received January 9, 1862.
      1.   In   a recent paper         "On     the production     of Vibrations    and
  Sounds by Electrolysis,"           I  have shown that if a voltaic current of
 suitable quantity from two Grove's or five Smee's elements is passed
 by a mercury anode through               a solution composed        of 10 grains of
 cyanide of mercury and 100 grains of hydrate of potash, dissolved
 in 2f ounces of hydrocyanic acid containing 5 per cent. of anhy
 drous acid, into an annular cathode              of mercury about     2 or 3 inches
 diameter and       -J-th  of an inch wide, visible    and symmetrical vibrationt
 of the     negative     mercury, accompanied         by definite sounds, are pro
 duced ; and the current becomes intermittent as long as the vibra
tions continue, similar to a current made intermittent by means of
an ordinary break-hammer.
     2.  If two voltaic currents of suitable and         equal quantity (measured
by a voltameter in the circuit),              the one being generated by about
eight Smee's         elements     of large immersed        surface,   and the other
generated       by twenty Smee's elements            of small   surface,  are passed
separately through the arrangement just described, vibrations and
sounds are in each case produced ; but with the current from the few

                                                  505
elements     of large      surface       the amplitude of the vibrations is small
and     the sound high, whilst with the                     current         from the many ele
ments     of small     surface     the amplitude of the vibrations is large and
the sound base.            These differences             in the vibrations and sounds are
still more conspicuous            if a galvanometer of small                resistance         (**.   e. with
a short and thick wire) substituted for the voltameter, and about
                                   is
four Smee's elements employed instead of the eight.    In each of
these experiments the voltameter (or galvanometer)                                is   in the circuit
with the cyanide solution               ;   the quantities of the two currents are
made equal by suitably adjusting the relative depths                               of immersion of
the plates of the two batteries               ;   and each experiment (with the volta
meter) occupies        3   minutes.       of the mercury electrodes has
                                             The     size
also been     previously adjusted to the power of the current, so as to
give continuous definite vibrations and sounds.
      3. Further:    — If    a    current from two Grove's or five Smee's ele
ments   of large surface  passed through
                                    is        primary coil of about
                                                                  a
250 feet of thick copper wire, through the cyanide solution and
small-resistance galvanometer, the vibrations are moderate in size
and the pitch of the sound               is   moderately high          ;    but   if   the axis of the
coil contains      a   massive      bundle of soft iron wires,                   the vibrations are
much larger and the pitch of the sound                       is   much more base               ;       and   if
the primary coil        is   surrounded by           a   secondary         coil containing about
4000 feet of fine copper wire, the ends of which are closely united
together, and the iron core                 is    absent,   the vibrations are very much
smaller and the sound               is   much higher.             In    each case the quantity
of the current,        however,      remains the same.                 If   a    voltameter           is   used
instead of the galvanometer,                  a    greater number of elements
                                                             (about
eight Smee's) must be employed, and the difference in the effects                                            is
then less striking.  If battery of much greater intensity, say
                                     a
twenty Smee's elements,              is     employed, no difference in the vibrations
or sounds     is   produced        by    the introduction of the soft iron core, nor
 by    closing the secondary coil.
      Do not voltaic currents                 therefore      of   equal          quantities* from
 different sources, or under different external conditions, like heat
 and light from different sources, possess different qualities                             1
      4. From these results (as well                as   from additional ones that                I        have
    *     employ the word
                              "               " in its ordinary        sense, viz. as that indicated
      I                           quantity
 by measurement of gases from decomposition                 of water in      a   voltameter.

                                      506
obtained) it appears to me that voltaic electricity, like heat or light,
may be viewed as consisting of vibrations or successive impulses,
which under ordinary circumstances occupy so minute a period of
time   as  to be inappreciable, but when acting under suitable condi
tions upon suitable substances,      such  as the metal and liquid referred
to (1), the vibrations of the current are taken up by the substances,
and the oscillations of the substances thereby produced are gradually
increased    by the synchronous       impulses of the current until          they
become visible and attain their maximum             (see paper
                                                                  " On  the pro
duction of Vibrations       and Sounds by Electrolysis,"        paragraph     11),
like visible oscillations of      a pendulum      produced by minute          syn
 chronous mechanical impulses.           This  I  beg   leave   to state   as an
 hypothesis for the purpose of making the subject more clear and
 aiding future inquiry.
                           Note by the Communicator.
     [The results mentioned in this paper        are well worthy     of attentive
 consideration, in relation to that curious and still mysterious pheno
 menon which        the author is investigating with so much care.              As
 regards, however, the conjecture thrown out by the author,          — while the
 importance of such a conclusion      as that of the existence of qualitative
 differences    in permanent electric currents, according        as few or many
 voltaic elements      arc concerned  in their formation, or of periodicity
 as a necessary       condition of a voltaic current,      if fully  established,
 cannot be overrated, the conclusion does not seem to the Communi
 cator of the paper to be fairly deducible from the experiments de
 scribed.     It   would   rather seem that, from some cause yet to be
  investigated, the motion of the mercurial            cathode,    or rather the
  change    of figure resulting from the motion, alters the total         electro
  motive force or resistance        (more probably the resistance) in the
  circuit,  and thus, by altering the current, reacts upon the forces
  whereby the motion of the cathode is produced.                 In  a circuit   of
  small resistance,    it might be expected according to this view that a
  smaller motion of the cathode would suffice to bring about a given
  change in the current, and a corresponding change in the force pro
  ducing the motion, and accordingly that the period of the changes
  would be shorter than in a circuit of greater resistance,         although the

                                     507
mean currents in the two circuits, as measured        by a galvanometer   or
voltameter, might be the same.]
II. " On    the Diurnal Tides of Port Leopold,          North Somerset."
       By the Rev. Samuel Hatjghton, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow of
       Trinity College, Dublin. Received November 7, 1861.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The present is the first of a series of communications on the       tides
of the Arctic Seas which the author hopes to lay before                  the
Royal Society.      The MS. materials     at his disposal embrace both the
Atlantic and Pacific Arctic Tides, for which       he was indebted to the
llydrographer, Captain Washington, R.N., to Captain Collinson,
R.N., Captain Sir F. Leopold M'Clintock, R.N., and Captain
Rochfort Maguire, R.N.
   The present paper      discusses fully the diurnal tide of Port Leopold,
which is most remarkable from the proportion which it bears to
the semidiurnal tide, a proportion which is unusually large.          From
the discussion of this tide, the author is enabled to announce with
confidence    several   results or laws which      he had previously ob
tained and published from the discussion of the small diurnal tides
of  the coasts  of Ireland.
   These results are given in detail in the paper itself.       In the  con
cluding portion of the paper, the author calculates, from received
dynamical theories, the depth of the Atlantic Canal, from the pro
portion of the Solar to the Lunar coefficient, from the Diurnal Soli-
tidal and Lunitidal Intervals, and from the Age and Acceleration of
 the Luni-diurnal Tide.
    He  hopes   to forward shortly the discussion of the Semidiurnal
 and Parallactic Tides of the same locality.

       Surgeons.         Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec.                      U.S.
       Received November            20, 1861.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The substance    of this paper is contained in          one presented   to the
 Society June 20th, 1861 (see Abstract in 'Proceedings,'vol. xi.p. 376),
 with which further observations since made have been incorporated.
 A   more detailed    description of the posterior lobes of the brain              of
 Cereopithecut, Maeacus, and Cebus is given, as well              as an account   of
 the same parts in Presbytes and Hapale.                It is shown  that the brain
 of the last-named and that of Man, placed             at the opposite ends    of an
 extensive  series,   present   in the posterior lobes certain well-marked
 common characters, but that in the Marmoset this portion of the
 brain is proportionally     more     elongated,   the calcarine fissure is more
 deeply cut, the hippocampus minor more prominent, and the posterior
 cornu patent to    a  greater extent.
    The author having had         an opportunity       of dissecting the brain of
 a  Lemur in   a recent   condition, has substituted a description of the
 cerebral characters of this animal for that of the Galago previously
 given, which having been long preserved              in spirit, was not    so  well
 adapted for the purpose.          In   possessing   a well-marked     Sylvian fis
 sure, a median lobe, a calcarine sulcus, and in the general character
 of the convolutions, the brains of members of this family are evidently
formed upon the type common to the brain of Man and the higher
families of Quadrumana        ;  but while the gradations of this type arc
tolerably regular and unbroken             between     Tlomo and      Hapale,   the
 Lemurs do not follow in the same line of degradation, and should rather
be placed as a small subscries         parallel to the lower part of the large
series, but separated     from it by the shortness of the posterior lobes,
large size of the olfactory bulbs, and inferior characters of the cere
bellum.
    A Table  is added, showing the comparative length            of the posterior
lobes in certain Quadrumana            aud other Mammalia, measured           upon
a plan described in the paper.

   IV. " On     the General Forms of the Symmetrical Properties of
        Plane Triangles."       By Thomas Donson, Esq., B.A., Head
        Master of the School-Frigate ' Conway/ Liverpool.                Com
        municated     by Capt.   E. A. Inglefield.        Received Decem

                                  (Abstract.)
     The symmetrical properties of plane triangles      have been    fully ex
  pounded in a series of six papers dated 1835,          1836,   1842,   1843,
  1845, and 1848 respectively, in the     'Lady's and Gentleman's Diary,'
 published annually by the Stationers' Company of London.              Either
 from being the work of different hands, or from the earlier papers
 having been written before the importance of symmetry in mathe
 matical formula; was duly appreciated, the series of papers leaves
 much to be desired as to uniformity of method.
     By assuming the usual      expressions   for the area of a triangle,   as
 in the   present  paper, with a few other expressions    of an equally ele
 mentary nature, all the well-known       symmetrical properties of plane
 triangles may be readily deduced, by a little skill in the combination
 of algebraical symbols, without leaving the plane of the triangle.
    But the author has preferred to use a method which is at once
 general,   simple, and uniform.     This consists in referring the      sym
 metrical points connected    with  a triangle to an indefinite plane, and
 establishing by an elementary process certain general formulae, each
 of which    can be made to yield several cognate plane properties when
 different definite positions are assigned to the plane of reference.
V. "Note       on Ethylene-Dichloride of Platinum."          ByP.GiiiEss,
       Esq., and C. A.     Martins, Ph.D.         Communicated by Dr.
       Hofmann.        Received December       16, 1861.
    About thirty   years ago, Zeise obtained, by the action    of dichloride
of platinum upon alcohol,     a  compound which he found to have the
following composition,
                                Ca H4 PtaCla.
   This formula    was corroborated by the analysis     of a series of  com
pounds which this body forms with the chlorides of some of the
    vol. xi.                                                    2 o

                                         510
metals.       The chloride-of-potassium compound, according              to Zeise's
researches,      contains
                                 CaH4PtaCla,KCl.
      The chloride-of-ammonium           compound has an analogous           compo
sition.       Zeise further observed      that his platinum compound          unites
directly with ammonia, producing a substance of the               formula
                                CaH,PtaClJ,NHa.
      The   correctness   of these formulae    Liebig,  relying on certain theo
retical conceptions,        has called   in question.    The discussion       which
 followed his remarks has, however,          in no way decided the constitution
 of    these compounds.
      We   have undertaken to prepare and analyse some new            double   com
 pounds of this series, in order       if possible to elucidate the constitution
 of    Zeise's bodies.
      We first     endeavoured    to establish the nature of the gas which
 under various conditions is evolved from Zeise's              compounds.       For
 this purpose we exposed the potassium-salts above mentioned                   to a
  temperature of 200°, and collected the gas which was evolved, over
  bromine water.         In this manner     an oily liquid  was obtained, which
  was easily proved to be identical with dibromide             of ethylene.    The
  formation of the gas seems to ensue according to the following equation,
                    Ca Ht Pta Cla, KCl=Pta      CL. + KC1+C, H4.
       The formation of      ethylene-gas,   as well as the analysis    of  several
   salts which we prepared,       seems to indicate that the original formula;
   given by Zeise are correct, and that the existence               of the group

        We have succeeded in combining ethylene-dichloride of platinum
   (this is the name which we propose for Zeise's compounds) with
   mono- and diatomic bases.           We    have also combined this substance
   with the chlorides of the bases.
        The bodies thus obtained may       be arranged in two series, comparable
   in many respects        with certain classes of compounds which proto-
    chloride of platinum forms with organic bases.          If ethylene-dichloride

 most part beautifully crystallized,                  is   not yet completed            ;   but we take
 this opportunity of mentioning an observation                                which seems to give          a
 more decided support to the view we have                                expressed      regarding the
 relation of the series of ethylene-dichloride-of-platinum                                  and that       of

            In conclusion      it    deserves       to be noticed that the      compounds      of

       with the group of the ethylene-dichloride                  of platinum.       It is   with
       the intention of testing this view that we are now engaged                    in an in

          Mammalia, and Birds."             By   J. Lockhart         Clarke, Esq.,
          F.R.S.      Received November 21, 1861.
                                       (Abstract.)
     In   the domestic    fowl, until the beginning of the fifth day of incu
  bation, the so-called voluntary          muscular tissue       consists   only of a
  crowded multitude of free nuclei imbedded in a finely granular blas
  tema ; the nuclei are round, oval,         pyriform, and somewhat angular,
 with granular contents.           On the fifth and sixth days of incubation,
 fibres become superadded under two forms, — 1st,            as processes   extending
 from the ends, or from the sides of nuclei              ;  2nd,   as  narrow bands,
 either uniformly       delicate   and pale, or bordered by darker outlines,
 and containing nuclei at variable intervals.          They      are most numerous
 near the surface       of the layer, and probably belong, at least partly,
 to the    muscular layer of the skin.        In every case their first stage of
 development       is conducted on one general plan, which consists in the
 fibrillation of the blastema        along the sides of nuclei, to which the
 fibrillae   so formed become        adherent.     Sometimes these fibrillae          or
 lateral fibres     enclose a single nucleus with conical processes            of  blas
 tema, so that the object occasionally presents            some resemblance         to a
 fusiform nucleated cell.          More frequently, however,          they enclose a
linear series of nuclei at variable distances              from each other, but
 cemented       together by blastema,       which sometimes         assumes    around
each     a more     or less definite shape.      In the formation of the paler
fibres, however,       a series   of neighbouring nuclei may            sometimes     be
seen first to collect round themselves           granular masses of        a more     or
less fusiform appearance,         and then to coalesce with each other, in an
oblique or alternately          imbricate way.      Sometimes a series of the
nuclei themselves         overlie each other in au imbricate form               like a
     VOl. Xi.                                                          2 P

number of coins, and are cemented                  together by a common layer                of
blastema.
     In   the early part of the seventh day     of incubation, numerous fibres
of   a   much larger and more        striking description suddenly make their
appearance      in the nucleated blastema.They originate, however, on
the same general plan as the others, in a fibrillation of the blastema
between, or along the sides of, a variable number of nuclei ; but the
process goes on to form aggregate masses of a much larger kind, and
of   a more    or less oval, fusiform, or cylindrical            shape, in      which the
nuclei are ultimately enclosed.               Some    of   these bodies have a very
striking resemblance        to organic muscular-fibre-cells, which, accord
ing to my own opportunities of observation, are developed on the
same general plan, that    by the formation of sarcous substance,
                                   is,
first, in the shape of fibres or lateral bands along the sides of               a   nucleus
more or less encrusted with blastema,                 so that the organic muscular-
'fibre-cell would appear to represent an early stage in the development
of the striped muscular fibre.
     As incubation     advances,     the fibres acquire      a   tubular investment of
the contractile or sarcous               substance,   which gradually increases            in
thickness or depth, and appears                 on each side as       a    band of corre
sponding breadth.      As they grow in length, they also contract in
diameter,     and become of uniform structure throughout while their        ;
nuclei rise nearer to the surface,             and assume    a   more oval form.          At
this period the marks of striation, either longitudinal                     or transverse,
are only faint and occasional.
     By the fourteenth      day    of incubation, the        entire   substance      of   the
fibres separates into longitudinal fibrillae, which in turn become shortly
resolved      into particles or sarcous          elements.       After this the fibres
continue to grow in thickness by the addition, to their surfaces,                          of
new fibrillae, which,       as usual, are formed around nuclei encrusted
with blastema cementing them, in such cases, to the original fibre.
     In mammalia, although          there are some particular but unimportant
differences     in the development of muscular fibre, the general plan                     is
the       same as   in birds.     The nuclei — at
                                      least in the ox, sheep, and
   —
pig are larger, and have more distinct cell-walls or enveloping
membranes. The fibres of the sheep or pig first make their appear
ance,     in the foetus of from half to three-quarters of an inch in length,
as    thick and nearly parallel threads lying amongst                 a   densely crowded

                                           515
mass    of free nuclei. When isolated,         these fibres are seen to be attached
to one or more of the nuclei by                  a variable quantity of blastema.
Sometimes a single nucleus with conical processes of delicate granular
substance      is first enclosed     by fine fibrillae      or lateral bands, which
present somewhat the appearance of a cell-wall,                   so that the object
has   a  certain resemblance       to a nucleated fusiform            cell with a fibre
originating from one of its extremities.               Sometimes     several nuclei are
cemented      in a group around       a fibre, and become subsequently covered
by other fibres of the same kind              ;   and sometimes       they lie in linear
series, either at some distance apart, or overlying each other to a cer
tain extent like a series of coins.         The lateral     bands or fibres enclosing
the nuclei extend        around them      as a  tubular investment, which grows
in thickness from without, but not always uniformly                        on all sides.
In   the process of longitudinal        growth, the nuclei multiply by subdi
vision, become generally more oval, and approach nearer to the sur
face   of the fibre, which      at the same time contracts in diameter.              The
subsequent       changes    they pass through          are nearly similar to those
which occur in the chick.
    In man the development of muscular fibre                  proceeds     on the same
general plan as       in birds and mammalia, but differs from that of both
in certain unimportant          particulars.       In the early    stages there is no
distinct appearance         of  those   oval, cylindrical, and irregular masses
observable      in the chick on the seventh           day of incubation and in the
mammal at a corresponding period.                   In this respect there is a greater
resemblance        between    the two latter classes than between man and
either.      In the human      foetus, from about       half  to three-quarters     of an
inch in length, the first stage of development may he seen to com
mence by the formation           of fine lateral bands or       fibrillae along one or
both sides of one nucleus or more.                When, however,        there are more
nuclei than one enclosed by the same lateral bands,                    they are always
disposed     in linear succession,      with their longer axes in the direction
of the fibre,     and never occur in irregular groups, as is sometimes                the
case both in birds and mammals,              in which, consequently, the same
kind of fibres      arc often broader at       first.    Thus formed, they lie side
by side in bundles of different sizes, to which new fibres or new
 fibrillae are being continually added by a renewed process of develop
ment.       Every fibre is the rudiment of                several   fibrillae.  At this
 period each lateral band constitutes a single fibrilla, which is often
                                                                      2 p 2

resolved    into sarcous elements of great distinctness and beauty, while
new and similar fibrillae        are developed along its sides         in the way
already explained.         The  subsequent    series   of changes   do not differ
materially from those that occur in the inferior classes.
    It  is evident that this description of the development of muscular
fibre is entirely opposed to the cellular theory of Schwann              ;   while it
agrees in some points with that          of Lebert (Annales des Scien. Nat.
 1849-50), but more with that of Savory (Phil. Trans. 1855).                   In no
instance have       I  found that nucleated cells,       properly   so called, are
concerned     in the office of development      ;  for the finely granular blas
tema attached to the nuclei, although          it frequently    assumes the shape
of  a  fusiform cell, is not invested with a cell-wall, iu the proper sense
of the word.       Such an envelope, however, is sometimes           simulated by
the investing sarcous substance or fine lateral fibrillae when they are
first laid down on the sides of the fusiform mass and meet each other
at each extremity to form       a single fibre or process.      Indeed, according
to my own observations, as already remarked,                this is precisely the
mode in which the organic muscular-fibre-cell             is developed     ; so that
the striped muscular fibre, instead of being the product of nucleated
cells, would appear to be itself, at first, an instance or mode               of cell-
formation, which finds its prototype in the organic muscular fibre-
cell, and in which the cell-tea// is substituted and represented by the
investing sarcous substance.

         ducting Power of the Metals."            By A. Mattiiiessen, Esq.,
         F.R.S., and M. von Bose.             Received December          5, 1861.
                                     (Abstract.)
    Iu   the first part of the paper we have described the apparatus used
for the experiments, together with the precautions taken to ensure
correct results     ; in the second we have given the results obtained with
the pure metals       — silver, copper, gold, zinc, tin, arsenic, antimony,
bismuth, mercury — and the metalloid tellurium.                   The conducting
power of the wires, or bars of each, was determined at about               1 2°, 25°,
40°, 55°, 70°, 85°, and 100° C.        ;  and from the mean of the eight ob
servations made with each wire (four at each temperature on heating,

                                           517
and four on cooling), we deduced             a formula by the method of least
squares for the correction of the conducting power for temperature.
It   was found that the conducting power or resistancq              of  a metal does
not    decrease or increasa in direct ratio to the temperature, as stated
by Becquerel*,          Arndsten-f,    and Siemens^,       who assume        that the
formula       for the correction of resistance          for temperature between
0°-100° may         be expressed    by
                                      \=a+yt,
but that, on the contrary, the formula must               be
where     X  is the resistance     at t degrees, x the resistance at 0°, and y
and y constants.          One fact seems to have escaped the observation
of former experimenters, namely, that when                   a wire  of   a  metal is
heated for the first time to 100° and again cooled, an alteration in the
conducting power takes place            ; with most metals it is necessary to
heat them for several        days before      their conducting power becomes
constant.        In the third part    we have     deduced    from the results ob
tained, the law that all pure metals in a solid state vary in con
ducting power to the same extent between 0° and 100° C.                      In  cases
where very great accuracy is required,             it is absolutely    necessary     to
experiment on the conductor itself ; for we have found almost the
same     differences    between    formulae    obtained for wires of the same
metal as between the mean of those deduced for the different metals.
This behaviour may           be attributed      to the fact that the molecular
arrangement is not the same even in wires of the same metal                  ; for we
find that copper wires, when kept at 100° for several days, behave very
differently from each other       :  thus, in the case   of the three copper wires
experimented with, wire        1 increased in conducting power almost to the
same extent as       if it had been annealed, wire 2 partially so, and wire
3 hardly at all.       With bismuth, wire       1 increased its conducting power
16   per cent.; wire 2, 19 per cent.; and wire 3, 12 per cent.              Again, in
the case    of cadmium, which       becomes quite brittle and crystalline at 80°
(for cadmium may be powdered in a hot mortar), we found the
formula for each wire very different.            On the other hand, the formulae
of the wires of those metals which, after being kept at 100° for some
time, show a very slight         or no alteration in the conducting power

on again being cooled, agree very closely with each other.               Compare
those of lead, tin, and mercury.
   Metalloids conduct electricity better        when heated than when cold.
Hittorf* proved this to       be the case with selenium.           Gas-coke     and
graphite   f, and the gases   J, follow the same law.          Tellurium,     when
first heated to 70° or 80°    C, behaves as a metal, that       is to say, it loses
in conducting power up to that temperature, when it then begins                   to
gain.    The temperature of the turning-point becomes lower after each
day's heating, until, as with the first and third bars experimented with,
it is below the lowest temperature at which observations were made.
Taking the first observed conducting power of each bar — 100, we
found that the conducting power of bar           1 had decreased after thirteen
days' heating to 4, where it then remained constant; that of bar 2, after
thirty-two    days, became constant at     19 ; and that of bar 3, after thirty-
three days, at 6.      With bar    2 the conducting power decreased          up to
29°*4, when    it began again to    increase.   The behaviour of tellurium        is
therefore intermediate between          that of the metals       and that of the
metalloids.

    The method for producing            these    diatomic     compounds appeared

In conjunction with Dr. Muspratt               I have   myself, many years ago,
examined this reaction.         We did not, however,          succeed in producing
the desired     result, although      our exertions were          rewarded by the
discovery of nitrophenylamine          (nitraniline),

which,    being the first basic nitro-compound               with which chemists
became     acquainted, withdrew our attention for the time from the
original object of the inquiry.
   Nitrophenylamine       being obviously the first product of the action
of reducing   agents on dinitrobenzol, it appeared very probable that the
further reduction of the nitro-base or the prolonged treatment of
dinitrobenzol itself might furnish the compound.                  I have  repeatedly

                                               520
tried to accomplish the final reduction of nitrophenylamine                              hy the
protracted action of sulphide of ammonium or potassium, without,
however, obtaining definite results.                 Nor     have Messrs.      Church          and
Perkin, who         have    examined the action of nascent                  hydrogen       upon
dinitrobenzol,      been more successful.                Their experiments have                led
them to the discovery of an                    interesting    new compound,          nitroso-
phenyline;      but the formation of a diatomic ammonia was not observed.
M. Zinin, ou the other hand, to whom                      science    is indebted         for   the
important discovery of the reduction of nitro-compounds, has                               been
more fortunate       :   by exhausting the action of sulphide of ammonium
upon dinitrobenzol, this chemist has in fact obtained a substance                               to
which he attributed the formula set forth for phenylene-diamine.                               The
properties of the body described by Zinin under the name                             of    semi-
benzidam, are, however,            far from those which might have been anti
cipated     in the case of such         a   compound.        Distillation of an alcoholic
solution of dinitrobenzol with sulphide of ammonium, according to
Zinin (Gerhardt,           Traite, vol. iii. p. 104), leaves a brown resinous
substance,     soluble in water and containing much free sulphur.                              By
dissolving it in boiling alcohol or ether, the compound is deposited,
on cooling, in yellow flakes,               melting under water to a brown resinous
mass, which, on exposure to the atmosphere, rapidly assumes a green
colour.      This certainly is not the phenylene-diamine of our theoretical
conceptions     ;   and more than a year ago, when submitting                            to the
Society some experiments on the action of nitrous acid upon nitro-
phenylene-diamine*,           I   was led to express          this opinion: — "Those
chemists who have             had an      of becoming acquainted
                                              opportunity
with the well-defined properties of ethylene-diamine, will not be
easily    persuaded to consider the uncouth                    dinitrobenzol-product           —
sometimes      appearing in brown flakes,                sometimes    as a yellow resin,

phenylamine in a relation                similar to that which         obtains between
ethylene-diamine and ethylamine."                    I   have in no way to retract the
opinion then expressed.            The diatomic ammonia of the phenyl-series
has     obviously never been observed                in a pure state.          Phenylene-
diamine and the homologous diatomic aromatic bases are as well-
defined substances         as their collateral monamines.            This   class   of   bodies
is,   in fact, characterized      by   an extraordinary crystallizing power, — both

the bases and their salts being easily obtained in crystals, which are
often capable of measurement.
   It  was under peculiar circumstances that my attention was drawn
again   to the study of the aromatic diamines.              I am indebted     to
Dr. Alphons      Oppenheim for the communication of a specimen of a
crystallized base, which had been obtained as          a secondary   product in
the Aniline Works of       M. Ch. Collin of Paris.      The first combustions
proved to me that this substance was one of the diatomic compounds
which   I had   repeatedly endeavoured       to produce.     The crystals  were
found to contain
which is the formula of toluylene-diamine, the primary diamine of
the toluyl-series.      The intimate relation of this compound with the
ethylene-bases,    which   I have  lately studied, induced me to pursue the
subject further.      M. Ch. Collin      has had the kindness to furnish me
with a most liberal supply of this interesting substance,         accompanied
by a very lucid and elaborate         statement  of the circumstances under
which it is produced, drawn up by Dr. Coblentz, the chemical director
of the factory.     I have   thus been enabled to verify the formula above
given by the analysis of several salts.
    There could be no doubt about the reaction which, in the manu
facturing processes of M. Collin, had given rise to the formation of this
 substance.     It obviously owed its origin to dinitrotoluol      accidentally
 produced from the toluol invariably present in commercial benzol.
 Experiments have not failed to verify this view.           Dinitrotoluol,  pre
 pared by the usual process from toluol, when distilled with          a mixture
 of iron   and   acetic   acid — the method of reduction now generally
                                              —
 adopted in the manufacture of aniline has furnished the crystalline
 alkaloid of M. Collin with all its properties.       The identity  was proved
 moreover    by analysis.
    The   rest is rapidly told.      The examination     was at once extended
 to the dinitro- compounds of the homologues of toluol, and 'more
 especially to dinitrobenzol.      The behaviour of     these substances under
 the influence of acetate of iron, as might have been expected, is per
 fectly analogous to that of dinitrotoluol.         It  is my intention to lay
before   the Society a detailed account of the diatomic bases which

                                               522
are thus produced.            For the present         I will   mention only some of            the
properties of phenylene-diamine                 and toluylene-diamine,              in order    to
give an idea of the general character of this class of bases.
                                 Phenylene-diamine.
  Freshly distilled, it presents itself as              a    slightly coloured heavy oil,
which, like phenylamine, has a tendency to assume a brown coloration
on exposure to the atmosphere.     The] base remains liquid often for
days, and then gradually solidifies into a mass of crystals, which be
come   hard and white by washing with ether.                         The fusing-point           of
phenylene-diamine is 63°.               Its boiling-point         is near 280° ;        it distils
without       alteration.      This    substance       is very soluble in water aud
alcohol   ;   the solutions have a distinctly alkaline reaction.                  It is far less
soluble in ether.           Phenylene-diamine contains

   Phenylene-diamine            is remarkable for the facility with which                      its
salts, as well as its other derivatives, crystallize.                  In      this respect    it
worthily       emulates      its monatomic        correlative, phenylamine.                   The
bromide and iodide are separated                at once, in the form of crystalline
masses,       when phenylene-diamine             is   brought       in contact with           the
respective     acids.     The   Salts thus produced crystallize splendidly from
water, and more especially            from alcohol.          The nitrate and        oxalate   are
not less       beautiful.       The    salts   of phenylene-diamine               are   readily
decomposed        by    the fixed caustic alkalies      ;      the base   is   thus separated

separates       the phenylene- diamine from                      its saline       compounds       ;    the
slightest excess, however, redissolves                     it,   and the solution           is   apt to
become brown, and then contains products of transformation.                                           This
observation explains in             a   measure      why the diatomic base cannot be
conveniently obtained by the usual method of reduction by sulphide
of ammonium.
                                    Toluylene-diamine.
     This   substance      isa   crystalline solid.              It   dissolves    freely   in   water,
forming an alkaline solution.                   It   is   likewise soluble in alcohol, and
less so in ether.            Toluylene-diamine              is    one   of the most beautiful
compounds       I   have     ever   seen.        From boiling water    crystallizes   it
in    needles,    which      frequently         acquire an inch in length.    Like
phenylene- diamine, this compound                     is   apt to assume          a   yellowish tint
in   contact with the air.              Crystallization          from water does not remove
this tint, which only yields to treatment with animal charcoal.                                       The
aqueous     solution of toluylene-diamine rapidly acquires    dark-brown              a
colour.      The new substance fuses at 99°, and distils without change                                  ;
the boiling-point       is   above 280°,       a   little higher than that of phenylene-
diamine.    I      shall, however, determine the boiling-points                            more accu
rately as soon as     I         shall have procured myself larger quantities of
both substances.
     The analysis of toluylene-diamine                    has led to the expression

  The facility with which               acetate    of iron    effects   the reduction of
nitro-compounds in cases in which the sulphide                      of ammonium           acts

duction of the aromatic bases of higher atomicity, which are at pre
sent unknown. Trinitronaphtaline might thus yield a basic compound,
and even the triatomic       base  of the phenyl-series might possibly        be
obtained in this manner       ; for although we have not at present tri-
nitrobenzol at our disposal, we could submit the nitro-bases them
selves    to further   amidation.      I  have   satisfied myself by experi
ment that phenylene-diamine          may be just       as well obtained by the
reduction of nitraniline as of dinitrobenzol       ;   and it deserves therefore
to be ascertained whether dinitraniline will yield the compound
which would be the first aromatic triamine.
   In conclusion, I may be permitted to express my best thanks to
MM. Ch. Collin and Coblentz for the liberal manner in which they
have furnished me the materials for the experiments described.               By
facilitating the scientific elaboration of the new diatomic compounds,
these gentlemen have endeavoured most gracefully to acknowledge
the debt of gratitude which the aniline-industry            owes to theoretical
inquiries in organic chemistry.

    Reserving a detailed communication             upon this subject to a        future
occasion,    I  beg leave to submit to the Royal Society a              short  account
of  some    of the  substances    observed in the course      of these experiments.
             Action of Chloraeetie Ether vpon Triethylamine.
    A mixture of triethylamine and chloraeetie ether, both carefully
dried, was exposed        in  a sealed glass   tube for several hours to a        tem
perature of 1 00°. On cooling, the mixture was found to have                deposited
some crystals (chloride       of triethylammonium),       and on opening      the tube
a  small quantity 'of a gas, burning with          a green-edged     flame,   escaped.
Repeated experiments showed that these phenomena are                           due    to
secondary reactions.          The principal product of the action of chlor
aeetie ether upon triethylamine          is the chloride     of an ammonium       con

    The nature of the reaction         was fixed by the analysis         of the plati
num-salt of this complex metal.             Addition of dichloride of platinum
to the aqueous        solution of the product of the reaction produces                 a
rather difficultly soluble crystalline precipitate, which by several cry
stallizations may be obtained in        a state  of perfect purity, the platinum-
salt of triethylammonium,           which is exceedingly soluble, remaining in
 the mother-liquor.
    * The  separation of the ethyl-bases has been since repeatedly carried out.    The
process, as described in the ' Proceedings,' admits of a slight improvement.     I pro
posed to separate the mixture of diethyloxamide and diethjloxainate of ethyl by
filtration, and to purify the former by recrystallization from boiling water, the
latter by exposure to a temperature of 0°. The separation is simpler and more
 perfect by submitting the mixture at once to the action of boiling water, when
 diethyloxamide dissolves, the dicthyloxamate       of ethyl remaining as an insoluble
 layer floating upon the hot solution, from which it may be separated by a tap-
funnel.

     The only additional salt of this                series      which    I    have    examined     is
the iodide.         It    is   formed by dissolving the triethylated compound
in hydriodic        acid, evaporating, washing the crystalline residue with
strong alcohol, and recrystallizing from boiling alcohol.                              The   crystals
are    generally well-formed;               they     are    extremely          soluble in water.
The composition of this salt                presents some interest.             Analysis proved

     From the analysis of these salts           it is   evident that the action of oxide
of silver upon the compound of triethylamine                              with chloracetic ether
is   twofold   :   in the first place, the chloride               is   converted      into the cor
responding base          ;    in the second place, this base loses an equivalent                   of
ethyl, which separates in the form of alcohol                         :

    The crystalline            substance   which    remains after treatment              of the

The crystalline product             has no alkaline reaction whatever             ;    moreover,
we have seen the body

associated           with the iodide in the compound above described.
 I       lay some stress upon these facts, since they would lend at once an
additional interest to the compound under consideration, which would
thus appear iu the light of triethylated glycocoll,

    It    deserves to be noticed that normal glycocoll exhibits                   a    tendency
to form compounds similar in constitution                           to the iodide above de
scribed, one of the hydrochloric               acid compounds being represented

        The    new triethylated compound, whatever its constitution may be,
        remarkable for its stability.         Ebullition with the strongest potash
is is
        without effect upon it.        I    have boiled       it    with fuming nitric acid
for hours without producing                 any alteration.           A   current of nitrous
acid passed              through the nitric   acid solution leaves           it   unchanged.
Evaporated to dryness, the residue gave, with hydrochloric                              acid and
platinum- or gold-solution, the original platinum- and gold-salts.
        When submitted to the action of heat, the triethylated compound
is      entirely      decomposed.      A   powerful alkaline liquid distils,              whilst
a   charred residue remains behind.                 The alkaline distillate contains             a
highly volatile base, forming with hydrochloric acid and dichloride
of platinum     rather soluble salt.

some    light  on the constitution  of the compound whence it is       derived.
          Action of Chloracetic Ether upon Triethylphosphine.
    The reactions which     I have  described were also applied to triethyl
phosphine.       Repetition   of all the phenomena previously observed
with triethylamine.       Triethylphosphine     and chloracetic ether com
bine with evolution of heat and formation of a brownish liquid of
considerable consistency.        If somewhat larger quantities are to         be
mixed, it is desirable to moderate the action by the presence of a
volume of anhydrous ether, equal or greater than the aggregate bulk
of the two liquids.       Dissolved in water, separated by filtration or di
stillation from the excess of chloracetic ether employed,          and   mixed
with dichloride of platinum, the new chloride furnishes a beautifully
crystallized platinum-salt,      which,  after several crystallizations    from
boiling water, exhibits the composition
           C,0 Ua POa Pt Cla= [(C, H,)a         g» °»)p   ] CI, Pt CI.
Submitted to the action of oxide of silver, the chloride contained in
this platinum-salt undergoes the same change which was observed
in the corresponding nitrogen compound,
    It  is scarcely necessary to point out the perfect analogy of the      new
 phosphoretted compounds with the corresponding bodies in the nitro
 gen-series.     Whatever view be entertained of the latter, must also       be
 taken regarding the former.        Conceived in the anhydrous condition,
the product obtained by the action of oxide of silver upon the chloride
 may be considered as phosphoretted glycocoll with three equivalents
 of ethyl in the    place of three of hydrogen,
                       C8H,7POa=CaHa(CaHB),POa.
 The phosphoretted compound           resembles   in its properties the sub
 stance    derived from triethylamine.        The    aqueous  solution, when
 evaporated in vacuo, solidifies into a radiated crystalline         mass.    I

and      by   that of the iodide.               The latter       was formed by precipitating
the platinum-salt by sulphuretted hydrogen, decomposing the chloride
formed in this manner by oxide of silver, and dissolving the triethyl-
ated compound             in    hydriodic acid.           The solution            was evaporated    to
dryness,       the residue washed with absolute alcohol and recrystallized
from the same liquid.                 This iodide     is    more soluble and less beautiful
than the corresponding compound in the nitrogen-series.                                       Analysis
showed,        however,      that    it   has an analogous composition, viz.

   Whatever view may be taken respecting the composition of the
compounds described in the preceding pages,                                   it   is    obvious that
chloracetic ether,           in   its action on triethylamine and triethylphospbine,
exhibits the deportment of one molecule of hydrochloric                                     acid, and
that the complex atom,
                                  04i1,0,= C.H.rC.HOO,,
which in chloracetic ether                 is   united with one equivalent of chlorine,
represents in the compounds thus produced one equivalent                                  of hydrogen.
These substances                are ammonium-salts               of double substitution, the
compound atom, which replaces one of the hydrogen equivalents of
the ammonium, containing itself an equivalent of ethyl, substituted
in this atom for the hydrogen originally present.
   Compounds of             a   similar construction have been previously obtained.
In his beautiful        researches on the amidic acids,                    M. Cahours has proved
that the ethers of benzamic, toluylamic, and cuminamic acids exhibit
the same tendency to combine with acids which characterizes the
amidic acids          themselves.           In    these    ethers the ethyl-atom may be
exchanged at pleasure for hydrogen and metals                                 ;    it    obviously has
been introduced into the molecular                         system      of   these bodies by what
may be called           a    secondary substitution.                  The constitution of the
compounds obtained from the first salts                               by   the action of oxide of
silver   is   less transparent.            It   may be that there            is   between these two
classes   a    relation similar to that which obtains between amidic ethers
                                                                                  2    q2

 preted in another way. The question thus presented is accessible to
 experiment, being capable of solution in a variety of ways ; and it
 appears useful to postpone further speculation upon this subject          until
 it may   be raised upon a broader experimental foundation.
 II.   "Additional Observations and Experiments on the Influence
        of Physical Agents in the Development of the Tadpole
        and   the   Frog."     By John Higginbottom, Esq., F.R.S.
        Received Dec. 24, 1861.
    In  a former paper    " On   the Influence of Physical      Agents on the
 development of the Tadpole of the Triton and the Frog," which the
 Royal Society honoured with a place in the Philosophical             Transac
 tions for 1850, experiments were detailed to prove that the ovum            of
 the frog (the Rana temporaria) underwent its metamorphosis in the
 absence of light, contrary to the experiments of Dr. W. F. Edwards
 of Paris, related in his work 'On the Influence of Physical Agents
 on Life.'
    My most satisfactory experiment         was made    in  a  rock cellar 30
 feet deep, where no solar     light ever entered ; the mean temperature
 of the cellar    was 51°  Fahr., — I believe, the lowest temperature at
 which the transformation could be effected.
    The   ova  of the frog, just deposited, were placed in the cellar on
the 11th of March, and on the 31st of October the first was fully
 developed in the form of a frog ; while other ova deposited on the
same day, which were placed in a shady part          of a room at 60°    Fahr.
and covered with several folds of black calico, were fully developed
on   May 22nd, twenty-three weeks earlier than those in the cellar.
    The experiment proved that the development of the frog depended
upon the temperature, and not upon the presence of light.              I found
by other experiments that those in the light, and those deprived of
light,   were   equally developed    if  placed at the same, temperature.
I  observed   that an excess of light retarded the development.
                1. On the Influence    of Light  on the Ovum.
    My formerexperlments not being parallel with       those  of Dr. Edwards,
I was desirous of following    his steps.    Dr. Edwards    says, in his work

                                                      533
above        referred to, Part iv. chapter 15,                     'On the Influence of Light
upon the Development of the Body,'
                                                                       " This   process,          previous to
birth, is generally carried on in the dark                         ;   there are, however, animals
whose impregnated eggs are hatched, notwithstanding                                           their exposure
to the rays of the sun.                          Of this number           are the Batrachians.                   I
wished to determine what influence light independent of heat might
exert upon this kind of development.                           With this view                 I   placed some
spawn of the frog in water in a vessel which was rendered imper
meable           to   light by dark paper.              The other            vessel was transparent ;
they were exposed to the same degree of temperature, but the trans
parent vessel received the rays of the sun.                               The    eggs exposed to the
light       were        developed      in succession      ;   of   those in the dark, none did
well    ;   in        some, however,         I   remarked unequivocal indications of the
transformation of the embryo."
   Dr. Edwards                does not mention the depth                  of water in the               vessel   in
which he put the spawn of the frog, which he                               " rendered impermeable
to light." If it were a few inches in depth, it would materially pre
vent the transformation of the embryo.
    I   commenced             my experiment in a pool which had been the habitat
of frogs (the Ra?ia temporaria) for                       several years.
   Experiment 1st. — I put                   a    quantity of spawn, just deposited, into a
box perforated with small holes, so as to admit a free current of water
through           it,   and placed     it   about   3   feet below the surface                 of the water      ;
all the ova perished.
   The next experiments                     were made in an aquarium 20 inches deep,
containing seventeen gallons of water at 60° Fahr.
   Experiment                2nd. — A       quantity of spawn was put into the water,
which fell to the bottom of the aquarium                                 ;    the spawn when first
deposited             by   the frog,   is   specifically heavier than the water*.                            The
ova enlarged as usual, but did not arrive satisfactorily through the
branchial state; most of the ova appeared                                    to undergo no change
whatever.
  * It      is   found that the frog usually deposits her spawn in shallow water, often
close to the edge of        pool favourable to its development
                              a                                   at first     very ad
                                                                                ;                 it   is
hesive, and adheres            firmly to the ground       or weeds where            it   is   deposited.     The
same condition may be observed when the animal deposits her spawn in an earthen
ware vessel.   In this neighbourhood the deposition begins about the end of
February or the first days of March, and continues fourteen or sixteen days, when
the frogs quit the water.

                                         531
     Experiment      3rd. — Some spawn was placed             8 inches      below the
 surface   of the  water ; but none    of the ova passed through the         branchial
 state.
     Experiment 4th. — A quantity of spawn was placed on rock                     work
 near the surface       of the water.      Nearly all the ova passed satisfac
 torily through the branchial state to the formation of tadpoles ; each
 of the experiments       was made at the same time and at the same                tem
perature.
     Experiment 5th. —A quantity of spawn was put into two                       round
 shallow dishes, each containing two pints of water, which were placed
 on the stand of the aquarium at the same time as in the former experi
 ments; nearly all did well; and during the full branchial or fish- like
 state, great numbers       of the embryos had placed          themselves     close to
 the margin of the water, forming a dark circle, with their branchice
nearly exposed to the atmospheric air.              They do not appear to feed
 during this period on the jelly — their first food         ; atmospheric respira
 tion seems more needful than food for their existence                     for several
days during their       full branchial state*.
     There are two distinct metamorphoses from the ovum to the                      full
development of the frog: the first from the branchial or fish-like state
to that   of the tadpole     ; the second from the tadpole to that of a frog,
— the first requiring for its      existence   a close approximation to the at
mospheric air, the second requiring full atmospheric respiration, to
which    I  shall hereafter refer.
    The branchial      state continues about nine days, from the first bud
dings of the branchiae to their absorption.              About the      seventh    day
the branchiae are absorbed on the right side, indeed so quickly that
I  have observed      that scores have lost them during one night, whilst
the branchiae on the left side have apparently been perfect              ;  but these
in their turn become absorbed           during the next day       ; the respiration
of this newly formed tadpole now            depends    on the internal gills and
    * The ovi of  the toad appear to be less tenacious of life than those of the frog.
I have  observed, when they are placed 4 or 5 inches below the surface of the water,
they all die j but they live when the long jelly lines in which the ova are enclosed
are floated on weeds, or on a network of sticks on the surface of the water.         Iu
my note-book    on the tadpole of the toad in 1849, 1 found that after the gelatinous
lines began to break up on the surface of the water, and the ova to separate from
them, a number of the eggs undergoing      the metamorphosis    adhered   to the sticks
and weed, but those falling to the bottom of the vessel perished.

very apparent on the left side, but there is none on the right.
              2. On the Influence of'Light on the Tadpole.
   The experiments of Dr. Edwards indicate that a decided influence
is exerted by light upon the metamorphosis of Batrachians, since,
according to his statement,       when    tadpoles which     had arrived at
nearly their full growth were secluded        from the influence of light,
but supported with aerated water and food, they attained an extra
ordinary size, without undergoing any metamorphosis.             The follow
ing is Dr. Edwards's
                                           "
                          experiment : — I procured       a tin box, divided
into twelve compartments, each       of which   was numbered and pierced
with holes    so that the water might readily pass through           the box.
A tadpole (which had       been previously weighed) was put into each
compartment, and the box was then placed in the River Seine, some
feet below the surface.      A large number     were at the same time put
into an earthen-ware vessel, containing about four gallons of Seine
water, which was changed every day        ; these  tadpoles were at liberty
to rise to the surface    and respire air, and they soon went through
their metamorphosis.       Of the  twelve placed   in the box under water,
ten preserved their form without       any progress in their transforma
tion, although some had doubled or trebled their weight.            It should
be observed     that at the time when the experiment was begun, the
tadpoles had attained the size at which the change is about to take
place.    Two only were transformed, and these very much later than
those  which, in the earthen vessel, had the liberty of respiration in
air."    Dr. Edwards concludes that the      presence  of solar light favours
 the development of form.
   The situation in which Dr. Edwards placed the tadpoles, " some
feet below the surface of the river
                                        " in his
                                                  experiment, would inevi
tably prove unsuccessful in the full development of the frog.          I have
always found the transformation, both of the triton and of the frog,
equal in the same temperature, both in the light and in the absence
of light, if placed  in shallow water   ; but during their metamorphosis
they must be allowed to rise to the surface of the water to obtain
air,  or they    become   asphyxiated.     I  therefore   placed stones     in
the vessel, and allowed them to leave the water for the purpose of
atmospheric respiration.

                                        536
    The metamorphosis of the tadpole, when            at its full growth,    requires
 about fourteen days    to bring it to the condition of a frog.                About
 the termination of that period, the diminution of the body is so great,
 and also the absorption of the expanded caudal extremity is such,                   as
to diminish cutaneous respiration.            Respiration by the lungs becomes
absolutely necessary to prevent the animal from becoming asphyx
iated, which would be the case        if it  remained in the water — requiring
then not an aquatic, but an atmospheric medium of respiration.                       It
may be observed that after the tail is partially absorbed,             leaving only
a  portion of the solid part, the asphyxiated state has commenced :
the little animal, with open mouth, gasps for breath             ;  but  if removed
into atmospheric air, the mouth is directly closed, and respiration is
effected through the nostrils with perfect freedom ; the animal is re
stored directly, jumps about and is lively.
3. On the Influence    of the    absence      of Light   on the Tadpole      and    on
                                   the Frog.
   This time    I commenced       my experiments in three rock                cellars,
formerly only in one.
   The cellars in Nottingham,        cut out of solid rock, are most favour
able for experiment;     no solar light ever enters,            and they are not
subject to any great change of temperature.                The    deepest   cellar is
30 feet deep, the mean temperature 51° Fahr.               ;  the middle cellar is
18 feet deep, its mean temperature 53°            Fahr.   ; the uppermost cellar
9 feet deep, mean temperature 5G°            Fahr.
   June 11th. In    each cellar     I  placed a shallow glazed earthenware
vessel,  containing two pints of water, with grass for chlorophyll                 for
food, changing the water every second              day.    In   each vessel    I  put
twenty tadpoles,   approaching the period of their metamorphosis, fol
lowing the example of Dr. Edwards,             —a    much easier method than
commencing with the spawn.
   In the uppermost   cellar ten were fully developed in the form of a frog
on the 8th of September,    and were on the stones, having left the water.
   In the middle cellar      ten   were     fully   developed     on the 22nd       of
September.
   In the lowest cellar eight only had left the                water,   being fully
developed   on the 20th   of October.
   In  the following year,    July    1st,   I made    a  similar experiment in

                                            537
  the same cellars, three weeks            later.   The    tadpoles  were   of  a large
   size.      I obtained the same result, — the full development of the
   frog in the absence of light        ; but in this experiment        I had another
   object in view, that of observing the growth and obtaining the exact
   weight of the tadpoles before, during, and after their metamorphosis
  into   a  frog.
      Dr. Edwards      said that  in his experiment      " the  tadpoles attained an
  extraordinary size, doubling or trebling their usual full weight                  but
  he unfortunately does not mention any particular weight, or how long
  the tadpoles were preserved alive         ; in fact there is nothing definite.
      During my      several years    of experiments     I  did not observe any re
  markable increase        of weight or     size as mentioned by        Dr. Edwards,
  although my first experiment was from the ovum to the full develop-
- ment of the frog, and the two last when the tadpoles were approach
  ing the period of their development.
      In my first experiment on the ovum,             I   never obtained a tadpole
  more than 8 grains in weight in the absence of light                ;  but  I  found
  in a pool in the neighbourhood            a number of tadpoles, some between
   11  and 15 grains in weight; seven of them weighed 15 grains each.
  Of   these large tadpoles      I   took twenty for my experiment, weighing
  altogether 264 grains, and averaging about 13 grains each.                      After
  their transformation the frogs weighed 93 grains, averaging about 4                 J
  grains     each, — those of   15    grains in the tadpole state only weighing
  5 grains as frogs, having lost two-thirds of their weight during their
  metamorphosis.
      Subsequent experiments have been in accordance                with the above.
  III.     "Note on Internal Radiation."                By George G. Stokes,
          M.A.,    Sec.  R.S., Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the
           University of Cambridge.            Received December 28, 1861.
      In   the eleventh volume of the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,'
  p. 193, is the abstract of a paper by Mr. Balfour Stewart, in which he
  deduces an expression for the internal radiation in any direction             within
  a uniaxal crystal from an equation between                the radiations incident
  upon and emerging from           a  unit of area of   a  plane surface, having an
  arbitrary direction, by which the crystal is supposed to be bounded.
  With     reference  to this determination he remarks (p. 196),            " But   the

                                              538
    internal radiation,     if the  law of exchanges be true, is clearly indepen
     dent of the position of this surface, which is indeed merely                  employed
     as an expedient.      This is equivalent to saying that the constants w hich
     define  the position of the bounding surface must ultimately disappear
    from the expression for the internal radiation."                 This anticipation      he
     shows is verified in the case of the expression              deduced, according         to
    his principles, for the internal radiation within a uniaxal crystal,                    on
    the assumption that the wave-surface* is the sphere and spheroid of
     Huygens.
        In the    case   of  an   uncrystallized     medium, the following is              the
    equation obtained by        Mr. Stewart in the first instance.
        Let R, R'     be the external        and internal radiations in directions
    OP, OP', which         are connected as being those              of  an   incident    and
    refracted ray, the medium being supposed to be bounded by a plane sur
    face passing through       O. Let OP describe an elementary conical               circuit
    enclosing the solid angle       B<p, and let   5<p' be   the elementary solid      angle
    enclosed    by the circuit described by OP'.              Let I,  i" be  the angles      of
    incidence and refraction.        Of   a radiation proceeding along PO, let            the
   fraction    A  be reflected and the rest transmitted ; and               of  a radiation
    proceeding internally along P'O let the fraction                A'   be reflected,   and
   the rest transmitted.         Then by equating the radiation incident ex
   ternally on a     unit of surface, in the directions of lines lying within
   the conical circuit described by OP, with the radiation proceeding                       in
   a contrary direction, and made up            partly of      a refracted and partly of
   an externally reflected radiation, we obtain
                   R cos i      = ( 1 — A') R'  cos  t" fy''  + AR cos t ty,
   or              (1— A)Rcost'fy=(l—              A) R' cos t' fy'                       (1)
       In the   case  of  a crystal there are two internal directions             of refrac
 tion, OP„       OP^, corresponding to a given direction                PO of    incidence,
  the rays along OP,, OPa being each polarized in                  a  particular manner.
  ,
      * To  prevent possible misapprehension,   it may be well to state that I use this term
 to denote    the surface, whatever   it may be, which is the locus of the points reached
 in a given time by a disturbance propagated in all directions from a given point ;
  I do not use it as a name for the surface defined analytically by the equation
(^+y»+zs)(aJxJ+*V+^)-os(*»+cs)^-*s(c»+aV-^(as+*J)^+a!^=°-
 As the term wave-surface in its physical signification is much wanted in optics, the
 Surface defined by the above equation should, I think, be called FremePt surface,
 or the wave-turface ofFremel.

                                                     539
Conversely, there are two directions,                          P^, Pa0, in     which a ray may be
incident internally so as to furnish a ray refracted along OP, and in
each     case no second             refracted ray will be produced, provided the
incident ray be polarized in the same manner as the refracted ray
OPj or OPa.             In      the case of a crystal, then, equation (1) must be
     - A) R
replaced by
(1               cos   i ty=(l — A,) R,            cos   j',   ^+(1— A,)        Ra   cos   t«   SfV,.     (2)
     In the most general             case     it   does not appear         in what manner,              if   at
all, equation (2) would split into two equations, involving respectively
Rj  and Ra.    For an incident ray PO were so polarized as to furnish
                           if
only one refracted ray, say OVv ray incident along PjO and polarized
                                                   a
in the same manner as OPt would furnish indeed only one refracted
ray,   in   the direction OP, but that would be polarized differently from
PO   ;     so that the two systems                 are mixed up together.
     But    if   the plane of incidence be                a     principal plane, and        if     we may
assume that such           a    plane    is
                                          a    plane of symmetry as regards the optical
properties of the medium*,                    the system of rays polarized in and the
system      polarized perpendicularly                    to the plane of incidence will be
quite independent of each other, and the equality between the radiation
incident externally and that proceeding in the contrary direction, and
made up partly           of refracted and partly of an externally reflected radia
                           a
tion, must hold good for each system separately.                                In   this case, then,
(2) will split into two equations,                   each       of the form (1),     R   now standing
for half the whole radiation, and R', A', &c. standing for R\, A,, &c,
or R2, Aa,       &c,     as the case may be.                   It need   hardly be remarked that
the valne of       A     is   different in the two cases, and that R' has                          a    value
which      is   no longer, as in the case                of    an isotropic medium, alike in all
     According to Sir David Brewster (Report of the British Association for 1836,
 *
part ii. p. 13, and for 1842, part ii. p. 13), when light       incident on
                                                                          is   plane sur    a
face of Iceland spar in   plane aparallel  to the  axis, the  plane  of incidence,   which
is
a   principal plane,    not in general
                           is             plane   ofaoptical, any  more   than of  crystal
line symmetry as regards the phenomena of reflexion, although, as      well known,         is
all planes passing through the axis are alike as regards internal propagation and
the polarization of the refracted rays. Hence, strictly speaking, the statement as
to the independence of the two systems of rays should be confined to the case in
which the principal plane   also   plane of crystalline symmetry.
                                    is        a                    As, however,
the unsymmetrical         phenomena      were only brought out when the ordinary reflexion
was weakened,          almost    annihilated, by the use of oil of cassia, we may conclude
that under common circumstances                   they would be insensible.

                                                     5iO
directions.           In determining according to Mr. Stewart's principles                                    the
internal radiation in any given direction within                             a    uniaxal crystal,            no
limitation is introduced by the restriction of equation ( 1 ) to a principal
plane, since we are at liberty to imagine the crystal bounded by a plane
perpendicular to that containing the direction in question                                            and     the
axis of the crystal.
     Mr. Stewart further       equation (1) by remarking that in an
                                       reduces
isotropic medium, as we have reason to believe, A'=A, and that the
same law probably holds good in a crystal also, so                                      that the          equal
factors        1   — A, 1— A' maybe struck out.                          Arago long ago                 showed
experimentally that light is reflected in the same proportion exter
nally and internally from a plate of glass bounded by parallel sur
faces ; and the formula: which Fresnel has given to express, for the
case      of   an isotropic medium, the intensity                  of reflected light,                whether
polarized in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the plane                                  of incidence,
are consistent with              this law.          In   a paper published               in the         fourth
volume of the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical                                        Journal (p.             1),
I    have given       a   very simple demonstration of Arago's law, based                                     on
the sole hypothesis that the forces acting depend only on the positions
of the particles.                This demonstration,         I     may here remark,                     applies
without change to the case of                    a   crystal whenever the plane of inci
dence      is  a    plane of optical symmetry.                It   may be rendered still                  more
general by supposing that the forces acting depend, not solely on                                            the
positions of the particles, but also on any differential coefficients of                                     the
coordinotes which are of                    an even order with respect to the time,—                           a
generalization which appears                     not unimportant, as              it

that view of the mutual relation of the ether and ponderable matter,
according to which the ether                   is   compared to     a    fluid    in   which      a   number
of   solids are immersed, and which in moving as                            a    whole       is   obliged     to
undergo local dislocations to make way for the solids.

     In    the case of an isotropic medium,                       R      and R' are alike               in   all
directions, and therefore the ratio of cos                    i    ?<p   to cos   »'   c<p    ought to       be
independent of         i,   as   it   is   very easily proved to be.              The same applies
to   a   uniaxal crystal, so far as regards the ordinary ray.                                  But      as re

                                      541
gards the extraordinary, it is by no means obvious that the ratio should
be expressible in the form indicated— as a quantity depending only
on the direction OP'.       Mr. Stewart    has, however, proved that this is
the case, independently of any restriction       as  to the plane of incidence
being a principal plane, on the assumption that the wave-surface             has
 the form assigned to it by Huygens.
     It might  seem at first sight that this verification was fairly adducible
in confirmation of the truth of the whole theory, including the
assumed form of the wave-surface.             But a little consideration will
show that such a view cannot be maintained.           Huygens's construction
links together the law of refraction and the form of the wave-surface,
  n  a manner depending for its validity only on the most fundamental
principles of the theory of undulations.            The construction which
Huygens applied to the ellipsoid is equally applicable to any other
surface ;   it was a mere guess on his part that the extraordinary wave-
surface in Iceland spar was an ellipsoid       ; and although the ellipsoidal
form results from the imperfect dynamical theory of Fresnel, it is
certain that rigorous dynamical theories lead to different forms of
the wave-surface,      according to the suppositions         made    as to the
existing state of things.        For  every such possible form        the ratio
expressed by the right-hand        member of equation (3) ought to come
out in the form indicated by the left-hand member, and not to involve
explicitly the direction of the refracting plane       : and as it seemed evi
dent that it could not be possible, merely by such general considera
tions as those adduced by        Mr. Stewart, to distinguish    between those
surfaces which were and those which were not dynamically possible
forms of the wave-surface,      I was   led to anticipate that the possibility
of expressing the ratio in question under the form indicated was a
general property of surfaces.        The object of the present Note is to
give a demonstration       of the truth of this anticipation, and thereby
remove    from the verification the really irrelevant consideration of a
particular form of wave-surface       ;   but it was necessary     in the first
instance   to supply some steps of        Mr. Stewart's investigation which
are omitted in the published abstract.
    The proposition to     be proved may be somewhat generalized,           in a
manner suggested       by the consideration of internal reflexion within a
crystal, or refraction out of one crystallised medium into another in
optical contact with it.      Thus generalized it     stands as follows  : —
    Imagine any two surfaces whatsoever, and also a fixed point O ;

                                                   542
imagine likewise a plane                II   passing through O.                   Let two points P,              V,
situated on the two surfaces respectively, and so related that the tan
gent planes at those points intersect each other in the plane IT, he called
corresponding points with respect to the plane                                 II. Let P       describe,          on
the surface on which it lies, an infinitesimal closed circuit, and                                          V the
" corresponding "             circuit   ;    let ty,    if' be    the solid angles subtended at
O by these circuits respectively, and i, i' the inclinations of OP, OP'
to the normal to         II.      Then shall the ratio of cos                     iS<p   to cos    i'l<f>
                                                                                                             be   of
the form  [P] : [P'], where P depends only on the first surface and the
position of P, and [P'j only on the second surface and the position
of P\ Moreover, if either surface be a sphere having its centre at O,
the corresponding quantity                    [P] or [P'] shall               be constant.
    It may   be remarked that the two surfaces may be merely two sheets
of the   same surface,          or even two different parts of the same sheet.
    Instead of comparing the surfaces                        directly with each other, it will
be sufficient to compare                them both with the same third surface                               ;   for
it is evident that       if the     points P, P' correspond to the same point P,,
on the third surface,            they will also correspond to each other.                                       For
the third surface it will be convenient to take a sphere described
round    0   as centre with             an arbitrary radius, which we may take for
the unit of length.             The letters Pj, iv               <p,   will   be used with reference
to the sphere.
    Let the   surface and sphere be referred to rectangular coordinates,
O   being the origin, and           n        the plane of xy.               Let   .r, y,   z   be the coor

                        i        those       of Pj.      Then x, y, z will               be connected             by
the equation of the surface, and                   £,   n,   £   by the equation

     The frequent employment of            a pile   of plates in experiments relating
 to polarization suggests, as         a  mathematical problem of some interest,
 the determination of the mode in which the intensity of the reflected
 light, and the intensity and degree of polarization of the transmitted
 light, are related to the number of the plates, and, in case they be
 not perfectly transparent, to their defect of transparency.
     The  plates are supposed        to be bounded by parallel surfaces,            and
 to be placed parallel to one another.               They will also be supposed to
 be formed    of the   same   material, and to be of equal thickness, except
 in the case of perfect transparency, in which case the thickness does
not come into account.           The plates        themselves     and the interposed
plates   of air will  be supposed,        as is usually the case, to be sufficiently
thick to prevent the occurrence of the colours of thin plates,                  so that
we shall have to deal with intensities only.
     On account of the different proportions in which light is reflected
at a single surface according as the             light   is polarized in or perpendi
cularly to the plane of incidence, we must take account separately of
fight polarized in these two ways.                 Also,    since  the rate at which
light  is absorbed     varies with its refrangibility,         we must take account
separately of the different constituents of white light.                  If, however,
the plates be perfectly transparent, we may treat white light as a
whole, neglecting as insignificant the chromatic variations of reflecting
power.      Let  p be   the fraction of the incident light reflected             at the
first surface of a plate.       Then 1— p may           be taken as the intensity     of

the transmitted light*.            Also, since we know that light is reflected
in the    same proportion externally and internally at the two surfaces             of
a plate bounded by parallel surfaces, the same expressions p              and 1 — p
will    serve to denote      the fractions reflected and transmitted          at the
second surface.         We may calculate         p  in accordance    with Fresnel's
 formula; from the expressions
                           •  •(   sin  i                                         ,, v

according as the light is polarized in or perpendicularly to the plane
 of incidence.
     In the   case  of perfect transparency, we may in imagination make
 abstraction of the substance of the plates, and state the problem as
 follows : — There are 2m parallel surfaces (m being the number of
 plates) on which light is incident, and at each of which           a given fraction-
 p  of the light incident upon it is reflected, the remainder being trans
 mitted ; it is required to determine the intensity of the light reflected
 from or transmitted through the system, taking account of the re
 flexions, infinite in number, which can occur in all possible ways.
     This problem, the solution of which             is of a simpler form than that
  of the    general   case   of imperfect transparency, might be solved by
  a particular      method.        As, however, the solution is comprised in
  that of the problem which arises when the light is supposed to be
 partially absorbed,       I shall at once pass on to the latter.
      In consequence      of absorption, let the intensity of light traversing
  a plate be reduced in the proportion of 1 to 1 — qdx in passing over
  the elementary distance dx within the plate. Let T be the thickness of
  a  plate, and therefore       T  sec  i' the length of the path of the light
  within it.     Then, putting for shortness

  1 to  g will   be the proportion          in which the intensity is reduced by
    * In   order that the intensity may he measured in this simple way, which i
 trouhlc in the problem before us, we must define the intensity of the light trans
 mitted across the first surface to mean what would be the intensity if the light
 were to emerge again into air across the second surface without suffering loss by
 absorption, or by reflexion at that surface.

absorption in a single transit.           The light reflected by      a   plate will be
made up of that which is reflected at the first surface, and that which
suffers   1, 3, 5,    &c. internal reflexions.      If   the intensity of the inci
dent light be taken as unity, the intensities of these various portions
will  be
                          p,(i-p)V^.(i-p)VV,&c.
and   if r be the intensity     of the reflected light,     we have, by summing
a geometric series,

Similarly,     if t  be the intensity    of the transmitted light,

 which is in general less than         1, but becomes equal to      1  in the limiting
 case  of perfect transparency, in which case g=\.
    The values of fi, i, and q in any case being supposed known, the
 formulae     (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) determine r and t, which may now
 therefore be supposed        known.       The problem therefore is reduced to
 the following      : — There   are m parallel plates       of which      each  reflects
 and transmits given fractions r,          t of the light incident upon it : light
 of intensity unity being incident on the system, it is required to find
 the intensities of the reflected and refracted light.
     Let  these be denoted by tp(m), ip(m).            Consider   a system     of  m  +n
 plates, and imagine these grouped into two systems,               of   m and n plates
 respectively.        The incident light being represented by unity, the
 light   <p(m)   will be reflected from the first group, and >Km) will be
  transmitted.        Of the latter the fraction     \f^n)  will be transmitted by
  the  second      group, and    <p(n)   reflected.    Of the latter the fraction
  ^(m)   will  be transmitted     by the first group, and $(m) reflected, and
  so on.    Hence we get for the light reflected by the whole system,

whence    the equations (6),        (7)   are easily verified.         This verification
seems necessary      in logical strictness, because             we have        no  right to
assume   & priori that it is possible to satisfy (6)                and   (7) for general
values  of the variables ; and in deriving the equation (10), the equations
(6)  and  (7)  were only assumed              to hold good for general values of
tn and infinitely small values of n.
   The equations (13),          (14)    give      the following       quasi- geometrical
construction for solving the          problem: — Construct          a  triangle of which

                                        550
the sides represent in magnitude the intensity of the incident, reflected,
and refracted light in the case of a single plate, and then, leaving
the first side and the angle opposite to the third unchanged, multiply
the angle opposite to the second by the number of plates               ; the sides
of the    new triangle   will represent  the corresponding intensities in the
case   of the  system    of plates.    I say g,ua#i-geometrical,      because  the
construction cannot actually be effected, inasmuch as the first side

     The following Table gives the intensity of the light reflected from
or transmitted through a pile of m plates for the values 1, 2, 4, 8,
 16, 32, and     oo of m, for   three degrees   of transparency, and for certain
selected     angles    of incidence.      The   assumed     refractive       index    /*   is
 1*52.     i!=l—     e~vr is the loss by absorption in a single transit of a
plate at    a  perpendicular incidence, so that         ?=0 corresponds          to per
fect transparency.         The most interesting     angles     of incidence to      select
appeared      to be zero and the polarizing angle bj= tan-1 f,             ;  but in the
case   of perfect transparency the result has also been calculated for                    an
angle of incidence a little (2°) greater than the polarizing angle.                         0
denotes     the intensity of the reflected and         u/ that of the transmitted
light, the intensity of the incident light being taken at 1000.                        For
oblique incidences it was necessary to distinguish between light po
larized in and light polarized           perpendicularly     to the plane        of in
dence    ; the suffixes     1, 2  refer to these two kinds respectively.               For
oblique incidences a column is added giving the ratio of                           to   ip2,
which may be taken as a measure of the defect of polarization of the
transmitted light. No such column was required for 2=0 and                         i=w,

which is equal to   1  in the case of perfect transparency.             Accordingly
a substance  which is at the same time finely divided, so as to present
numerous reflecting surfaces,       and which is       of such    a nature as to be
transparent    in mass,     is brilliantly white by reflected light,           — for
example snow, and         colourless substances         thrown      down as preci
pitates in chemical processes.
    The intensity of the light reflected from a pile consisting of an
infinite number of similar plates falls off rapidly with the transpa
rency of the material of which the plates are composed, especially at
small incidence.     Thus    at a perpendicular incidence we see from the
above Table that the reflected       light is reduced      to little more than one
half when   2 per cent. is absorbed       in a single transit, and to less than
a quarter when 10 per cent. is absorbed.
    With imperfectly transparent       plates,  little is gained by multiplying
the plates beyond a very limited number,             if  the object be to obtain
light, as bright as may be, polarized by reflexion.                Thus the Table
 shows that 4 plates     of the  less defective      kind reflect 79 per cent.,
and 4 plates of the more defective as much as 94 per cent., of the
light that could be reflected by a greater number, whereas 4 plates
 of the perfectly transparent kind reflect only 60 per cent.
    The Table shows that while the amount of light transmitted at the
polarizing angle by a pile of a considerable number of plates is mate
 rially reduced by  a defect    of transparency, its       state   of polarization is
 somewhat improved.         This result might      be seen without calculation.
 For while  no part   of  the transmitted    light which is polarized perpen
 dicularly to the plane of incidence underwent reflexion, a large part
of the transmitted light polarized the other way was               reflected an even
 number of times ; and since the length of path of                 the   light within
the absorbing medium is necessarily increased              by reflexion, it follows
 that a defect of transparency must operate more powerfully in redu
 cing the intensity of light polarized in, than of light polarized perpen
 dicularly to the plane of polarization.       But the Table         also shows that
 a far better result can be obtained, as to the perfection of the polari

  zation of the transmitted light, without any greater loss of illumination,
  by employing a larger number of plates of a more transparent kind.
       Let      us now confine our attention to perfectly transparent plates,
  and consider the manner in which the degree of polarization of the
  transmitted light varies with the angle of incidence.
       The     of polarization is expressed by the ratio of
                degree                                      to                                                               tp,        \pv

    dfa =(sin» 6 cos a +      sin3 a cos 6)   dw= — 2(tn— 1 )    cos a sin5 8 dai,
and cos a is negative.           Hence   \,  decreases as w (and therefore t) de-
creases,    or     as m increases.       For tn=l,             an^    X^A4-8*      for

    For   a given number        of plates the angle     of maximum polarization
may be readily found from (24) by the method of trial and error.
But for merely examining the progress of the functions, instead of
tabulating t for assumed            values   of  m,  it will serve  equally well to
tabulate m for assumed values of i.                The following Table gives for
assumed      angles    of incidence,    decreasing   by 5° from 90°, the number
of plates required to make these angles the angles of maximum pola
 rization of the transmitted light, and the value of x,, which determines
the defect of polarization.

    This memoir is the continuation of             one on the calculus    of symbols

and which has since been published in the                  Philosophical     Trans
actions.'    I  commence       this paper with some extensions of the method
given in the former memoir for resolving functions of non-commu
tative symbols into binomial           factors.    I then explain a method,
analogous to the process for extracting the square              root in ordinary
algebra, for resolving such functions into equal factors.                I next in
vestigate  a process for finding       the highest common internal divisor
of two functions of non-commutative symbols, or, in other words, of
finding if two linear differential equations admit of a common solution.
After this,   I  give a rale for multiplying linear factors of non-commu
tative symbols, analogous to the ordinary algebraical rule for linear
algebraical factors.        I then resume the consideration of the binomial
theorem explained in the former memoir.               Two new forms of this
binomial theorem are here given ; and the method by which these forms
are proved identical will,       I hope,  be considered an interesting portion
of symbolical     algebra,    and as exhibiting in a remarkable manner its
peculiar nature.

    Continuing my researches in the calculus of symbols,              I have been
led to investigate the most general case of division, viz. that wherein
a function    of any     degree n in n is divided,      (1) internally, (2) ex
 ternally, by another function of any other degree m in x.                      The
investigations here subjoined give (1) the various terms of the quo

 and otherwise     ;  (2) the final remainder, and thence the conditions
 that the divisor may be a factor, internal or external as the case may
 be, of the dividend.         An example     has been added       in each case by
 way of illustrating      the processes.      A remarkable reciprocal relation

III. " On        the Absorption       and Radiation of Heat by Gaseous
         Matter."    — Second Memoir.            By John        Tyndall, Esq.,
         F.R.S.      Received January 9, 1862.
                                     (Abstract.)
     Resuming with a new apparatus his experiments on the influence
of chemical combination         on the absorption and radiation        of heat by
gases, the author in the present investigation           first examines   the de
portment of chlorine as compared with hydrochloric                  acid, and of
bromine as compared with hydrobromic                 acid,   and finds that the
act    of combination, which in       each  of  these two cases notably dimi
nishes the density       of the  gas, and renders the coloured gas perfectly
transparent to light, renders it more opake for obscure heat.                  He
also     draws attention to the fact that sulphur,            which is partially
opake to light, is transparent to 54 per cent. of the rays issuing
from      a source   of  100°  C,  while its compound, heavy spar, which is
sensibly transparent to light,          is quite opake to the rays from          a
source      of  100°  C.   He  demonstrates,   in confirmation of Melloni, the
transparency of lampblack in thin layers, and shows how irrecon-
cileable its deportment to radiant heat is with the idea generally
prevalent at the present day, that lampblack absorbs heat of all kinds
with the same intensity.
      He   has repeated all his experiments with gases, using a different
 source     of   heat, and finds    the result still more       pronounced    than
 formerly, that the compound gases far transcend the elementary ones
in absorptive power.            Taking air   as unity, ammonia at 30 inches
 tension is 1 1 95, — this latter figure representing all the heat that issued
from the source.          A  layer of ammonia 3 feet long is perfectly black
 to heat emanating from an obscure source.                   The coloured    gases
 chlorine and bromine, though much superior in absorptive power to
 the transparent elementary gases, are exceeded                in this respect  by
 every compound gas that has been hitherto examined.                When instead

                                                         559
of tensions of 30 inches we compare                           tensions      of   1   inch, the differences
between        the gases come out still more strikingly.                                  At this       tension,
for example, the absorption of sulphurous acid is eight thousand times
that of air.
  The author             also records a new and extensive                            series   of experiments
on the absorption of radiant heat by vapours.                                         The     least energetic,
as before,        he finds to be bisulphide                         of carbon, the most                energetic
boracic ether.   He shows that the absorption of the latter vapour,
which is quite transparent,  at 0- of an inch of tension, 600 times
                                                 is,         1
the absorption of the densely coloured vapour of bromine, while in
all probability          it   is   186,000 times that of air.
   The author            was led by          a   of perplexing experiments, which
                                                 series
are    fully   described           in the memoir, to the solution of the following
remarkable and at first                      sight utterly             paradoxical problem,
                                                                                                           "   To
determine the absorption and radiation                                 of   a gas or vapour without
any source         of heat external               to the gaseous         body itself."
   When air            enters      a   vacuum,          it   is   heated by the arrest of its mo
tion   :   when     a    vessel        containing air             is   exhausted         by an air-pump,
chilling     is   produced             by   the application of              a    portion of the heat of
the air to generate vis viva.                          Let   us call the heating in the first case
dynamic heating, and the chilling in the second case dynamic chilling.
Let     us further         call the radiation of                   a   gas which          has been heated
dynamically, dynamic radiation, and the absorption                                       by   a   gas which has
been chilled dynamically, dynamic absorption.                                    A     thermo-electric pile
being placed at the end of the experimental tube, and the latter being
exhausted, the gas to be examined                             is   permitted to enter              :   the gas      is
heated,      and   if    it   possess        any sensible           radiative power, the pile will
receive its radiation and the galvanometer connected with the pile
will   declare     it.
   Proceeding in this way with gases, the author found that the ra
diation thus manifested, and which was sometimes so intense as to
urge the needle of the galvanometer through                                          an arc       of more than
sixty degrees, followed the exact order of the absorptions which he
had already determined.                       After the           heat    of the radiating column of
gas    had wasted itself by radiation,                             the air-pump           was worked           at   a
certain rate       ;   the rarefied gas within the tube became chilled, and the
face       of the pile turned                    towards          the chilled          gas     became      corre
spondingly          lowered in temperature.                              The dynamic absorptions of

                                       560
 various gases were thus determined, and they were found to go
 strictly hand in hand with the dynamic radiation.
    In the   case   of vapours the following method          was pursued.     A
 quantity of the vapour sufficient to depress the mercury column 0-5
 of   an inch was admitted into the tube, and this was heated dyna
 mically by allowing dry air to enter until the tube was filled.            The
 radiation of the vapours thus determined followed exactly the             same
 order as the absorption which had already been measured.                   The
 dynamic absorption of the vapour was obtained by pumping                    out
 in the manner just described, and it was found to follow the same
 order as the dynamic radiation.          In  these experiments the air bore
 the same relationship to the vapour that a polished silver surface
 does to a coat    of varnish laid over it.      Neither   the silver nor the
 air, both of which are elements, or mixtures of elements, possesses the
 power of agitating in any marked degree the luminiferous                 ether.
 But the motion of the silver being communicated to the varnish and
 the motion of the air being communicated to the vapour, molecules are
 agitated which have the power of disturbing in a very considerable
 degree the ether in which they swing.
    The author    shows, by strict experiments, that the dynamic radiation
 of  an amount     of boracic ether vapour possessing a tension of only
 1 6,2^66666
                tk of an atmosphere is easily measurable,       lie also shows,
 and explains the fact, that with   a tube 33 inches long the dynamic radi
 ation of acetic ether considerably exceeds that of olefiant gas, while in
 a tube 3 inches long the dynamic radiation of olefiant gas considerably
 exceeds that   of the ether.    Aqueous vapour has been subjected to a
 special examination, and the author finds it         a common fact for the
aqueous     vapour contained in the atmosphere to exercise            60 times
the absorption of the air itself.      In  fact, the further he has pursued
his attempts to obtain perfectly pure and dry air, the more has the
air approached the character of     a vacuum.      The author further points
to the   possibility of determining the temperature of space by direct
experiment.
    Scents  of various kinds  have been examined.          Dry air was passed
over bibulous paper moistened       by the essential    oils and carried into
the experimental tube.       Small as the amount of matter here entering
the tube is known to be, it was found that the absorption by those
odours of radiant heat varies from 30 times to 372 times that of the air

                                       561
  which formed its vehicle.       In fact the author remarks that the           ab
 sorption of terrestrial rays by the odour of a flower-bed may exceed
 in amount that of the entire oxygen and nitrogen of the atmosphere
 above the bed.
     Ozone has also been subjected to examination.                The   substance
 was obtained by the electrolysis     of  water,  and from decomposing cells
 containing electrodes     of various    sizes.    Calling the action of the
 ordinary oxygen which entered the experimental tube with the ozone
 unity, the absorption of the ozone itself was in six different experiments
 21 j  36; 47; 65; 85;         136.    The augmenting action of the         ozone
 accompanied the diminution        of the  size  of the electrodes    used in the
 decomposing cells.      The author points out the perfect correspondence
 of  these  results with those of M. Meidinger by a totally different
 method of experiment.          The paper contains various reflections          on
 the nature of this remarkable substance.

    The following communications        were read     : —
I. " Remarks upon         the most correct Methods of          Inquiry in refer
        ence to Pulsation, Respiration, Urinary Products, Weight of
       the Body, and Food."          By Edward Smith, M.D., LL.B.,
       F.R.S., Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consump
        tion, &c., Brampton.        Received January 9, 1862.
    Having   been engaged in several researches         into the vital actions of
the human system, which          have   extended     over   lengthened periods,
I  have necessarily formed opinions as to the best methods            of inquiry,
and have noticed some circumstances which tend to induce incorrect
results.    On consideration it has appeared to me that it might serve
the interests   of science  as much to solicit the attention      of present and
future investigators to the circumstances connected with the mode of
inquiry, as to adduce the facts which the inquiries have elicited            ; for
it cannot be doubted that nearly all the errors which have found place
  inthis department of physiology have been due to deficiency in the
methods     of inquiry, whereby only     a part of the results arrived at were
    vol. xi.                                                      2 s

obtained from actual observation          ; and hence much valuable labour has
been lost and science has been led into erroneous channels.                    I  have
therefore ventured to lay before the Royal Society, with a view to pub
lication in its ' Proceedings/       a short summary of the conditions which
I  believe   to be essential     to the elimination of truthful results in in
quiries connected with the rate of pulsation and respiration, the quan
tity of air inspired, of carbonic acid expired, and of urinary water               and
urea excreted, the weight of the body, and the influence of foods ;                and
in so doing     I purpose first to consider the inquiries       into the daily quan
tities of each of them, and then to refer to each subject separately.
                  1.  The determination     of  the   daily quantities.
     In  none   of the subjects for inquiry will observations made at one or
 a few   periods of the day enable us to infer the total daily quantities,
 since there are scarcely any two hours in which the quantities remain
 unchanged       ;  and although the variations, for the most part, follow           a
 definite course,       the progression is not so uniform          that, even under
 the most favourable circumstances, they may be safely inferred.
     The   rate    of pulsation and respiration      varies in such a manner that
 it is increased      after each meal during about two hours, and then de
 clines for about an equal period, unless food be in the meantime taken.
 There is     a less    proportionate   increase    and decrease      after the early
 dinner and tea than after breakfast, and at about 8 or 9 p.m. the rate
 falls rapidly and continually until the middle hours of the night.                The
 nearest approach to a stationary rate          occurs — 1st, in the middle      hours
  of the night, with       a tendency to increase      ; 2nd, after rising and before
  breakfast, with a tendency to decrease             ;   and 3rd, in the afternoon,
  when the midday meal has been deferred, with a tendency to increase
  at the usual meal-hour.          The least stationary periods       are the three or
 four hours following each meal, and the late hours in the evening.                 In
 the total absence of food throughout a whole day, the rate remains
 nearly stationary from the hour of rising in the morning until about                 9
  p.m., with a tendency to change at the usual meal-hours.
     The quantity of air inspired and of carbonic acid expired is subject
 to similar variations       ; but the increase     after the early dinner is less,
  and that after tea is greater than that of the rate of pulsation, and the
 rate is more constant before breakfast and throughout a day               of fasting.
     The   rate    of evolution of urea is   less uniform than that of either of

                                                    563
the above-mentioned subjects of inquiry, since it depends more upon
the conditions of the preceding day, and upon the variations in the
amount of fluid ingesta.   It                 is,

of about     three hours, and then decreases                          even     more rapidly,         and
continues low, notwithstanding                  the early dinner, until the tea hour,
after which     it   again    rises, and finally           it   falls at about         9   or 10 p.m.
until the night-rate  attained.

  The rate of production of urinary water follows the order of that
of the emission of           urea, except           that the increase in the afternoon                is
much less, and there               is   an    approach to uniformity                of production
after about     3    p.m.
     Hence, with the exception of the excretion of urea after the early
dinner and of urinary water in the afternoon, there                               isa      progressive
increase    followed by       a    progressive decrease               in all the subjects of in
quiry after each meal, and therefore several such alternations occur
during each day.             There      is   also   a   low rate in the night and imme
diately before each meal.
     The only correct method of determining the daily quantities                                      is
to   collect the whole. This may be effected at rest, or with mixed
rest and exertion,          in    reference     to the urea and urinary water.                        So
also in reference      to the air inspired and carbonic acid expired, except
that as to the latter the degree of exertion must be limited, and at
tention to the daily duties of life nearly intermitted.                          I     do not   think
that the total number of pulsations and respirations can be recorded
except      the process of counting, since the registering instruments
           by
are liable to fail, and an error cannot be corrected.   The nearest ap
proach to correct results, short of the foregoing, will be made by ob
servations taken at regular and frequent periods during the 24 hours                                  ;
but the period of intermission must not exceed one hour, and                                  it   need
not be more than        a    quarter of an hour.
     A   rough estimate may be obtained                     by      taking the average         of the
four maxima and four minima of the rate of pulsation and respiration,
and the quantity        of air      and carbonic acid,              if    the inquiry be limited to
the 18 working         hours of the day, viz.                   6    a.m. to midnight.          If   the
meals be taken at 8^ a.m.,                           5^, and 85           p.m., the periods of in
quiry will be    8    and 10J a.m.,            1,    3|,   5,   7,   8,   and 10 p.m.
                                                                                 2s2

      The determination of        percentage       quantities is worthless for this
  purpose, unless the total quantities of air or urinary water be also
  ascertained    and employed in the calculation.                   As the per-centage
  quantities vary greatly, it is necessary that the daily quantities be de
  termined to    a  uniform hour       ; and the best period is that which imme
   diately precedes breakfast.
        2.  General considerations affecting each subject                 of inquiry.
                        Pulsation and Respiration*.
      In instituting any inquiries into the           rate   of pulsation and respira
   tion, the following conditions are required             : —
      The posture of the body must            be uniform       ; and as the sitting pos
  ture has     a   rate   nearly intermediate           between      that   of lying    aud
  standing, it should be universally preferred, except                  in inquiries into
  the influence of sleep, or on the sick often confined to the couch, when
  inquiries in the lying posture are alone practicable.                      The posture
  should remain quite unchanged during the whole time of the inquiry,
   also for at least five minutes before its commencement,                  if the person
  has been previously at rest, and fifteen minutes in the case of previous
  exertion.     The attention must         be withdrawn.           Care should be given
  to ascertain if the rate is influenced by a feeling of nervousness,                 or by
  any other disturbing cause         ;   and if so, the     inquiry must      be deferred
  until the   rate has become uniform.            There are also conditions, how
  ever absurd     it may   appear,    when the observer is liable to mistake the
  pulsation in his thumb or finger for that of the person under inquiry.
  The   rate should be counted during two minutes                  if practicable,   and in
  no instance less than one minute.              Half    a respiration      should be re-
^ corded   ; and the counting should be commenced                   only from    a long line
  on the watch dial.        It is often very difficult to count the respirations
  during quiet sleep in the night, and even during wakefulness, in many
  women, notwithstanding close observation of the movements                          of the
  alae of the  nose and    of the upper part of the chest             ; and in such cases
  the hand must be slightly applied to the chest.                   Coughing, yawning,
  and dreaming temporarily accelerate the pulse.                  It occasionally    occurs
  that the rate of respiration or pulsation becomes doubled or halved                       ;
  and intermitting pulsation often occurs in children and feeble persons
  during sleep, whether by night or day.               In comparing the         rates upon
               *  See Medico-Chirurgical     Transactions,    vol. xxxix. 1856.

 different days, care must be taken that the inquiries are all made at
rest, at the same hour, in the same posture, and at the same period
after meals       ;   and even then the results will be liable to great variation.
No comparison            can be made        of the   rates at different periods            of the
year, nor indeed on any two consecutive days,                       if there     have been any
considerable atmospheric changes or material variation of the daily
habits.         With    of temperature the rate of pulsation increases,
                       increase
whilst that of respiration declines. The effect of moderate exertion
continues for several minutes, and of severe exertion for about half
an hour.         An unusual rapidity of pulsation in                 one       half of the day
will   be attended by the opposite state in the other half,                        if   the condi
tions have been changed at those periods, —as, for example, an increase
from exertion, followed by rest, or a decrease from fasting, followed
by food.         Extreme differences of 30 pulsations per minute occur in
the 24 hours.             The chief objection to the               use    of instruments to
register the rate is their liability to miss the record from the diffi
culty of closely applying             them to the wrist or chest,                and the great
variations in the extent of pulsatory                   and respiratory movement               in
sleep and wakefulness.
   The usual practice amongst medical men of ascertaining the rate
of pulsation, regardless of posture of the body, of meals, and of the
hour of the day, is evidently liable to the greatest error.                         In order   to
obtain even approximately correct results, the visit should be made
at about the same hour daily, and the inquiry pursued always in one
posture.
                           Quantity of          Air    inspired *.
      The   same attention to posture               is required as that noted under
the previous heading.             It is more satisfactory          to measure the inspired
than the expired air, since no correction is required for expansion by
heat.       Moreover, when the object is to ascertain the vital capacity of
the lungs, it is important to remember that the inspiratory                              force at
the end of a deep inspiration               is greater than the expiratory force at
the end of a deep expiration.                  It   is necessary to cover or close the
nose, since otherwise a portion        of air is unconsciously inhaled through
it.    If   a   tube be    inserted into the mouth for the purpose of inspi
ration, the lips must be closely pressed against                         it,   and particularly
at the angles         of the mouth    ;     but there are many persons who cannot

close the lips perfectly with a tube placed in the iriouth.                                           When it      is
desired to measure                ordinary inspiration, it is advisable to use a mask
which encloses the chin, nose, and mouth, so that inspiration                                                    may
proceed easily and naturally                        through            both openings.                 The     sides
of the mask must                 be made      of   lead, so thick that when pressed upon
the features it will retain its position                          ;    and it should be lined with
sheet caoutchouc, the better to adhere                                to the skin.            The     face must
be well introduced into the mask, and the thumbs placed under the
chin whilst the forefingers cover the free edge of the mask so as to
press the lead to the face and prevent any ingress or egress                                                of    the
air either at the bridge of the nose or on the sides.                                             Persons with
large beards,           and those with very thin                       and sunken cheeks, cannot
use the mask effectually.                     After the mask                has been          worn for some
time the vapour condenses within                           it,   and the fluid trickles beneath
the chin, when              it   will   be very difficult to prevent   little air entering
                                                                                        a
until the mask shall                have been       removed and wiped.    The mask may
be held upon the features by bands which cross the head transversely
and longitudinally.                 Care must be taken that the valves                                 close well
and act easily.              If    the mask has been laid aside for some time, the
valves     will   have curled up          ;   and   it   will    be necessary           to place      it   in luke
warm water for half an hour, or to pour water upon the dry valves.
The measuring-instrument should offer but      very small amount of         a
resistance to the expired current of air so that,    be   gas-holder,
                                                                 ;                if    it        a
as in Hutchinson's                 and Davy's spirometer,                    it   should be accurately
counterpoised at every part of its progress                                  ;    or"   if   it   measure        and
register ordinary inspiration, the adverse pressure should not exceed
,j^jths    of    an inch     of    a    column of water.                   The person must breathe
normally, by the aid of previous training and by abstracting the at
tention.          If there        should be any sense of constriction about the chest,
it   may be inferred that the respiration                             is   not normal, and that the
chest      is   either too much collapsed, so that the act of expiration                                     is   too
prolonged, or          it   remains expanded above the ordinary degree, and the
act of expiration            is   shortened. The sense of ease and satisfactory re
spiration must be at all times present. Hence practice and intelligence
are necessary.              The experiments must                      embrace      several minutes at              a
time   ;   for   a   respiration rarely ends at                   a    complete minute, and must
therefore be recorded as                   a   fraction, and the attention cannot be
abstracted        in   the short period of one minute.                           Results obtained from

                                     567
 observations of so short a duration cannot be uniform.                 The aim
 must be to ascertain the precise         number of respirations and the
quantity of air inspired then occurring.           To control the respiration
 by inspiring  a predetermined number         of   times   per minute, or by
breaching with an assumed uniformity of depth, is to render the act
and the results alike unnatural.        It is doubtless possible to fix the
number of respirations, but it is impossible to regulate the quantity
of air inspired  except by the aid   of  a spirometer.      The  effect  of exer
tion may be accurately determined by fixing the mask upon the face
with bands, and by carrying the spirometer in the arms, or fastened
upon the back with knapsack straps. The instrument must not
exceed a very few pounds in weight.           The "distance to be traversed
must be accurately measured, and subdivided into short distances also
accurately measured, so that, with the watch in hand, the rate may be
tested   every "half minute and     over every small part of the course.
 Eaeh subdivision should be    a  known part of       a  mile, and at the rate
selected must be traversed in a given number            of seconds.     Thus, at
 the rate of two miles per hour, a course of 58f yards would be tra
 versed every minute ; and if that be subdivided into six equal parts,
 each one would be walked over      in  a very little less than ten seconds.
                   The Carbonic Acid expired*.
    The remarks already    made in reference to posture and rest are also
applicable to this subject.    It  is impossible so to regulate the respi
ration that a fair average of the carbonic acid evolved may be made
from inquiries of one or two minutes' duration, both from the impossi
bility of withdrawing the attention, and of obtaining an exact propor
tion of the expiration in so short a time.          We almost always found
that the rate of respiration was greater during the first than during
subsequent    minutes  ; and this was no doubt attended by a change
in the quantity of carbonic acid expired, and it        was due to the action
of the mind.     Five minutes is the shortest period during which such
an  inquiry should be continuous, and ten minutes would be better if
the duration of each experiment should not interfere with the neces
sary   frequency of repetition  ; hut the latter might be an essential
character of the inquiry.     An inquiry of      five minutes duration may
be repeated   every twelve minutes.       The apparatus' required must be

capable   of containing the products of respiration during five or               ten
minutes, or must absorb them as fast as they are emitted.                     There
must be no adverse pressure upon the respiration.                In collecting   the
expired air in      a bag,  there will be the fallacy of not being able to
empty the bag completely         ;  and unless    special care be taken, there
will  be an adverse     pressure    from the weight of the sides of the bag,
and from their cohesion.          Moreover, it is impossible to measure the
expired air by such means ; and if it be passed through
                                                                      a spirometer,
there will be a fallacy from the pressure required to move the instru
ment   ; or if it be passed   into  a  graduated tube, there will be a change
of bulk from temperature and           pressure.    If  only a part of the col
lected air be submitted to analysis, it        will be very difficult     to obtain
a fair sample,     since the specific gravities   of  the component gases vary
much.      In seeking    the absorption     of the  gas,  it is essential   that the
                                                     a layer of fluid, since the
expired air should not be forced through
adverse pressure upon the respiration would cause
                                                                  either defective
                                                       and in both cases error,
expiration or an increased effort to expire,
but in opposite directions, would occur.              No arrangement of solid
absorbents    with moistened       surface can be so made that       it shall absorb
all the carbonic acid during the process of expiration.               No combina
tion of tubes within tubes, with a view to increase the absorbing sur
face, can be arranged within a manageable            space and weight suited to
this purpose.        Hence it is requisite that the expired air be passed
 over a fluid  ;  and the fluid must be capable         of rapidly and certainly
absorbing the gas, and offer so large a          surface that it may be found
                                               the whole of the carbonic acid
by experiment capable of absorbing
 during the period of expiration.          The air should be exposed in thin
                                                 and only a small column of it
 layers to the surface of the absorbent,
be offered at the same moment, so as to allow a long period to elapse
 before each small portion       of the expired air shall      have traversed the
whole surface.        A test apparatus should be attached         at the end, and
the test be occasionally applied during the inquiry, so as to ascertain
if any unknown cause of error exists. Any portion of the absorbing
 fluid which may have been carried along by the current of the pre
viously dried air must be arrested before the air escapes into the at
mosphere, and no element of the expired air, besides the carbonic acid
which the absorbent might retain, must be allowed to enter the
absorbing apparatus.         By this method the amount of carbonic acid

                                       569
is determined by the increase      of the weight of the absorbing appara
tus  ; and hence it is necessary     that the latter be such that it may be
weighed to not less than the -j^th of a grain.             Gutta percha is the
only known substance of which the apparatus may be constructed,
since  it is not greatly acted upon by the caustic alkali, may be readily
formed by the aid of the hot iron, and does not allow the fluid to flow
over the floors of the chamber with            the readiness     observed    when
glass or metal is used, during the act        of weighing.       The only prac
tical absorbent is a solution of caustic potash, and its spceific gravity
should be l-270.       The atmospheric air which will enter the various
parts of the apparatus when not in use, must be expelled by blowing
expired air through them before they are counterpoised as a prelimi
nary to the inquiry.     The expired air must not       be reinspired.      Hence
boxes such as that employed by Scharling are inapplicable              ; for, how
ever rapid the current     of air which is drawn though the box, it is
quite certain that some portion of the air will be again and again in
spired, and moreover the dilution of the air charged with carbonic
acid renders the absorption of the gas much more difficult, whilst the
 determination of the carbonic acid remaining in the box is always                a
circumstance of great difficulty.        When a mask is worn, it should not
have a capacity larger than necessary           to contain the features,      or it
will retain expired air, which must         be reinspired.     When respiring
through a tube placed in the mouth, it is exceedingly difficult to pre
 vent the escape   of air, whether    as  it is introduced into or withdrawn
from the mouth, and the results cannot be relied upon.                If the   nose
be left unclosed, a variable and unknown quantity           of air will  enter and
leave by that aperture.       The   effect  of exertion may    be readily ascer
tained by using      a tube   15 feet   in length attached to the mask and
 the analytical apparatus.      The apparatus must       be placed in a central
 position, and   a space  of 30  feet marked out in a       right line, and this
must be walked over at a defined           rate of speed.      The potash-box
must be made of larger size than that required for experiments upon
quiet respiration, or two sets of the apparatus must be used at the same
time.     In the latter case there will be danger of adverse pressure from
 the air passing through       so many vessels       ; and  if  the exertion in
breathing be considerable, it will     be  impossible to measure the inspired
 air at the same time.      The  tubes must be      of sufficient diameter and
 of smooth material, and     be filled with expired air before the          experi

                                            570
 ment commences.          These observations also apply to experiments upon
 voluntary respiration, where the force, depth, and rapidity exceed that
 at rest.     A   space of  1000 to 1500 superficial inches     of absorbing sur
 face   will  be necessary   with exertion, whilst      700 inches is sufficient at
 rest.
     There is a variation in the quantity of carbonic acid expired on
 different days of the week, so that there is an increase          after a day of
 rest.     There is also a variation with the season of the year, so that
 the evolution is the greatest       in the spring, then in the winter, and
 then in the autumn, and it is the least            at the end of summer.        It
 increases with cold, and decreases with           heat.    Hence the quantities
 evolved at various seasons cannot be compared, neither indeed those
  in   a   short period of days,       if    there have   been  any considerable
 changes     of weather or habits.      The only     mode by which     the rate of
 evolution in different days and in different seasons may be compared
 is by making observations in the morning before food has been taken,
 and in absolute rest, so as to isolate the effects of season and meteo
 rological phenomena from every other influence except the small effect
 of the conditions of the previous day.            This method is almost with
 out fallacy.
                         Urinary Water           and Urea*.
     The urinary water should       be collected     in tall and narrow    glasses
 which are graduated to -jVth of an ounce, and covered                 to prevent
 evaporation.      When   travelling, J^th of the quantity emitted at a time
 may     be reserved,   and  the larger portion thrown away. The glasses
 must be used during defalcation          ;  and hence such inquiry cannot be
accurately made in women.           The various quantities must       be retained
and collected to the exact        termination of each 24 hours       ;  and after
they have been mixed and reduced to the temperature of the air,
a sample should be taken for analysis.               As the urine decomposes
readily in warm weather and when the specific gravity is very low,
the analysis must not be deferred later than two days ; but in the
opposite conditions four days may elapse.
     There are very great and rapid variations in the quantity of urine
evolved ; so that large and small quantities may alternate daily, or a
sequence     of  increase or decrease may be established,        or one may fol
low the other for many days. Hence a correct daily average can
                              * See Phil. Trans. 1861.

                                       571
only be obtained after perhaps ten days of inquiry               :  and the quantity
observed in one season will not apply to that of any other season                  ; so
that the effect of season can only be ascertained        by continued inquiries
through the year. Rest, diminished ingestion of fluid, increased
ingestion of animal solids, increased temperature and atmospheric
pressure, profuse discharges        from the skin or bowels, and increased
bulk of the body from whatever          cause, all other things being equal,
will lessen the excretion of urine.       The contrary conditions, each one,
other things being equal,       will increase the excretion of urine. The
 action of any two of these agents, each in an opposite direction, will
 modify the influence of the other.        It must not be inferred that there
 will be lessened excretion of urine       because    there is increased excre
 tion of   fluid by other outlets, as the skin, unless it be proved that
 there was no increase in the quantity of fluid ingested and no dimi
 nution in the bulk and weight of body.            Urinary water is largely and
 quickly    excreted   when fluid is drank without any solids having been
 taken on that day, viz. before breakfast, but to              a   much less extent
 if  solids   have   been previously    taken,   and     still     less  when solids
 are taken with the fluid.        The maximum        rate   of     emission  must be
 sought     for between the breakfast and        1  p.m., and by experiments
  made not less frequently than         a  quarter of an hour.             The mini
  mum quantities occur in the night, and continue for much longer
  periods.     All graduated   glasses, alkalimeters,    and pipettes should be
  graduated and carefully proved by the observer before using them,
  and    this may be conveniently and most accurately effected by the
  balance.
     In pursuing Liebig's volumetric method for the determination of
  urea in the urine, it is essential      that the operator have graduated
  the mercurial solution himself, or have made himself familiarly ac
  quainted with the tint of colour to which it is graduated by repeatedly
  testing it with the proper quantities of pure urea.               Moreover, as the
  recollection of the precise tint to which the solution was graduated
  fades from the memory, the test quantity         of urea should        be used from
  time to time to renew it.       The urea to   be used must be proved to be
  perfectly pure.      The solution should    be made in a quantity          of several
   gallons, and be drawn from the carboy by         a  siphon with the smallest
   apertures, so that the standard strength may be preserved.                       The
   quantity in daily use for the supply of the alkalimeter should not

                                       572
exceed a few ounces,       and the alkalimeter must be washed out with
distilled water after each operation has been finished.              Care must be
taken to force out the bubble of air which is retained in the neck of the
exit-pipe before the operation begins.          If it  be possible, the analyses
should always be made in the same amount and kind of light, since
otherwise there will be an incorrect perception of the proper tint.
The direct rays of the sun, and       even too bright an indirect      light, must
be avoided as much as a deficiency        of light. It is not possible to use
artificial light. The thickness of the layer of the solution of carbonate
of soda should be uniform, since there will be a difference in the tint
and the rapidity of its production in the shallower and the deeper parts.
From     one to two minutes must be allowed for the production                 of the
colour when it approaches the standard tint.              Dr. Guy's spatula is to
be preferred to    Dr. Beale's suction-tube,      since it retains a less quantity
of the thick fluid from the previous immersion.               It often occurs, in
the analysis of coloured urine (as in urine of high specific gravity),
that the distinction of the tint is not well appreciated           if the solution
be added in quantities of one division only             ;  and hence it is often
better for the experienced        investigator to add two divisions of the
solution at a time, so as to produce a little excess of colour, and then
to compute and deduct the excess.            In urine of low specific gravity,
the tint is quickly and distinctly produced by half a division of the
solution.     The specific gravity of healthy urine is a ready guide to
the addition of the first and large quantity of the solution.                    In a
healthy person, and one of regular habits and under ordinary condi
tions, the daily quantity of chloride of sodium which is eliminated
and must be deducted from the urea is tolerably uniform                  ;   and the
quantity having been ascertained         by numerous trials, it may be used
for the same person as       a constant quantity, where absolute accuracy
is not essential,    and thus the labour will be materially                lessened.
With urine of     a specific  gravity from 1012 to 1025, it is convenient
to add by the pipette £ an ounce          of urine to     $ ounce   of the baryta
solution.     When the      specific gravity exceeds      1025   (in the     absence
of sugar),    equal parts should be used      ; when it is below 1012, it is
needful to add 3 or 4 parts of urine to         1  part of baryta solution, and
with diabetic urine    4 parts should always be added.           A quarter of an
ounce    of the mixed fluids should      be taken with the pipette, and the
number of divisions of the mercurial solution used to produce the

                                         573
  tint must    be multiplied    by the following       factors to determine the
  amount of urea per ounce      :—
     With equal parts of each multiply by                                 8
     With 2 parts of urine and 1 part of solution of baryta            1
          multiply by                                                  J
     With   3 parts of urine and I part of solution of baryta 1
          multiply by                                                  /
     With 4 parts of urine and 1 part of solution of baryta 1
          multiply by                                                  J
     Considerable and constant practice is essential         to correct and com
  parable results.
     The periods of the formation and the elimination of urea are dif
  ferent, and there is no known method of showing the former.                 The
  urea from metamorphosis of tissue           and from the transformation of
  food is a mixed and varying product, and the two sources cannot be
  dissociated.   The direct relation of urea is with food,          since,  in the
  absence  of exertion, it nearly       represents    the nitrogen in the food
  supplied, less that remaining        in the     foeces.   The elimination     of
  urea chiefly varies with the quantity of urine, and therefore will be
 influenced    by the same agencies        as affect    the discharge of urine.
 Hence the duration of inquiries to determine the normal daily rate
 of elimination at distant periods of the year, must             be the same as
 that indicated in reference to the urine.         There are great and frequent
 variations in the daily elimination of urea in a person              of the most
jregular habits   ; and as  the effect of any agent is often carried on to
 the following day, inquiries which may be made for               a short period
 before breakfast will not faithfully represent the conditions of that
 day.
                             Weight of Body*.
     The only satisfactory method of determining the weight of a person
 day by day, is to weigh him naked directly after he has passed urine
 and before he has taken[any ingesta, and to do so as nearly as possible
 at the same hour every morning.            The error which will        be due to
 the varying amount of     faeces  contained in the bowel will still exist, but
it cannot   be large, and by no method can              it be entirely removed.
 The person cannot weigh himself           unless    stand-scales with a multi-
                            *  See  Phil. Trans. 1861.

                                        574
 plying lever be employed.       It will usually   suffice to weigh to  ^
                                                                          or  1 oz.
 The weight of the body will        be influenced by the quantity         of food
 taken, and by all the circumstances already noted in reference to the
 emission of urine.      Hence the body is heaver          at night than in the
 morning,    also after a day    of rest than after labour, in warm than in
 cold weather, and in all conditions in which the bulk of the body is
 increased,   and   the elimination    of fluid  lessened.      There is   a close
 relation between sudden changes in the quantity of urine evolved and
the weight of the body.         Among the excretions which cause           a vari
 ation in the weight of the body, the carbonic acid, although               a gas,
 must not be overlooked      ; and so far the weight will vary as the con
 ditions above mentioned vary the production of carbonic acid.            Hence,
upon the whole, the determination of the weight at night is attended
by greater liability to error than in the morning, and the latter period
would alone suffice for the inquiry.        A variation in the weight occurs
almost daily, and under some circumstances it amounts to from                 1  to
2 lbs.    The varying weight of the body        represents    the varying quan
tity of the fluid and solid excretions, the fat and the fluids in the
blood-vessels    and tissues,   besides   the nitrogenous      elements    of  the
body.     Under the discipline of a prison, there is the highest propor
tion of nitrogenous tissues to the weight of the body.
                                     Food*.
    The  effect  of food upon the system may be sought in two ways : —
1st,  the general effect of the ordinary dietary, which will represent the
actual condition of the body in the individual           or in the masses, but
not the separate influence of any food.          This is of great importance
when considered in relation to the community, and may show its actual
state under ordinary      conditions.     For this purpose the methods of
inquiry already referred to      under the different subjects will suffice.
2nd, the effect      of separate   articles of food only.        This  can only
be ascertained    in the absence of every agent acting upon the system,
except the one in question.          Hence the food must be taken alone,
and before     any other food has been eaten on that day, viz. before
breakfast.      The inquiry must     also be made with precisely a      uniform
degree   of exertion, and therefore at rest only, and in the         absence    of
all excitement    and meteorological changes.           If  an unusual   kind or
                            * See Phil. Trans. 1859.

                                        575
quantity of food be given, it will probably disturb the system and give
inaccurate results.       It is necessary to give      a moderate dose, and in
the customary form.          The  effect   of all  agents is temporary, and that
of all kinds of food begins quickly and attains its maximum within
 1  to 2£ hours.     If the maximum effect only be sought for, that period
will suffice for the inquiry ; but if the average or total influence be
 desired, it will be necessary to continue the inquiry until the whole
 period of increase and decrease, or vice versd, have passed over.                 In
 either case the experiments must be made every few minutes, and be
 regularly repeated.       The maximum quantities            are easily attainable,
 but the true average or the total effect is scarcely          if at all so, since it
 is difficult or impossible to ascertain the precise          period of the termi
 nation of the effect.       Hence only one dose of the food can           be  given
 on the same day, when great accuracy is desired.                 A  second   period
 may be found at about       4| hours after the breakfast; but, although it
 is next in value to the period before breakfast, it cannot be implicitly
  relied upon, since no proof could be obtained that the vital functions
  had subsided from the breakfast increase to their lowest point before
  the inquiry began.       All such experiments must         be tested by morning
  inquiries.      Whenever    there is a sense of craving for food, or any
  disturbed feeling, it is highly probable that the vital actions are varying,
  apart from the influence of the food, and the inquiry should be ter
  minated.       The addition of water      to the food does not vary the results
  connected with the respiration, except so far as it may enable the food
  to enter the circulation quickly.           If  the solution of the food have
  been imperfect, the subsequent         ingestion of water alone will cause an
   increase   in the effect equal to that     of taking   more food.
    II. " On     the Motions     of Camphor on the Surface of Water."
           By Charles         Tomlinson, Esq., Lecturer on Science,
           King's College School, London.                Communicated by Dr.
           William Allen Miller,                Treasurer and V.P.R.S.             Re
           ceived January 15, 1862.
                                      (Abstract.)
        The object of this paper is to show that the phenomenon in                ques
     tion is a much more general one than is commonly supposed                  ;  that

                                                 576
the explanations hitherto given of it have been insufficient or erro
neous.   The author endeavours to explain the real nature of the
phenomenon in             a series     of experiments and observations, and to                 esta
blish the following propositions                 :   —
    I. That       the camphors, or stearoptens                   of the volatile oils,      present
phenomena of rotation and progression when thrown                                  on the surface   of
clean water in a chemically clean vessel.
   II.    That        these phenomena belong also to certain salts, and to a
variety of vegetable                 and other substances            containing a liquid that
diffuses readily over the surface of water.
   III.   That solutions of camphor in benzole, in some of the essential
oils,   &c, present phenomena of rotation and progression on the sur
face    of water— a property which                   also belongs to creosote,         and to some
other liquids that do not contain camphor.
   IV. That           the motions of camphor may be imitated by placing on
water miniature rafts or coracles                      of inert      substances,      such as talc,
tinfoil, paper, &c., smeared with or containing the elaeoptens of vola
tile oils, or indeed any volatile liquid, such as ether, alcohol, chloro
form,     See.,   provided there be some communication and adhesion be
tween such        liquid and the          surface      of the water.
   V. That the camphors, &c, being slightly soluble in water, that                                  is,
the adhesion of the water partly overcoming the cohesion of the cam
phor,    a   film of camphor             is   thus detached from             it,   and spread over
the surface           of the water the moment that the camphor                            comes in
contact therewith.
   VI. That           the dimensions and form of this film depend on those
of the    piece       of camphor operated             on   ;   and, in general, the film sepa
rates more easily from broken                   surfaces        and angles         of the fragment
than from         a   smooth natural surface,              just as the crushed or broken
surface      of   a   crystal    is   more soluble than         a   perfect crystal.
   VII.      That such films being constantly detached from the cam
phor so long as           it    is   in contact with the water, displace each other                 ;
the preceding film being conveyed                          away      by the adhesion of the
water in radial lines, these produce motion,                          by   reaction on the frag
ment, causing           it   to rotate after the manner of              a   Barker's mill.
   VIII.      That       these       radial lines or jets being of unequal intensity,
the direction and intensity of the motion will follow that of their
resultant.

                                         577
    IX. That     the jets or films of camphor can be rendered sensible
by various     means   — as  by fixing the camphor partly        submerged      in
water, and dusting the surface          lightly with lycopodium powder        :  a
series   of horizontal     currents produced       by the films will then       be
made visible, which films or jets cause the camphor,                  when   free
to move, to rotate on      a  vertical axis.
    X. That the motions of the fragments of camphor               on water are
greatly influenced and complicated by their mutual attraction and
by the attraction of the sides of the vessel.
    XI. That     the film of camphor diffused over the surface of the
water is very volatile, disappearing as fast as it is formed, chiefly into
the air, only      a  very   small portion     being retained by the water.
Hence camphor wastes away much more quickly at the surface of the
water than in water alone or in air alone, because at the surface the
 film is being constantly formed at the expense          of the camphor,      and
is spread out to the united action of air and water.
    XII.   That whatever interferes with evaporation lowers or            arrests
the motions of the camphor and the allied phenomena                ;  so, on the
contrary,     whatever promotes evaporation exalts          these phenomena.
 Effects which are displayed with great energy on a bright and sunny
 day, are produced either sluggishly          or not at all on a wet, dull, or
foggy one.
    XIII.    That    a fixed oil forming a film on water      will displace the
camphor film, and so permanently arrest              the motions of the cam
phor   ;  but a volatile oil will only arrest the motions while it is pre
sent and undergoing evaporation.
    XIV. That       the presence     of the camphor film on water will, in
some     cases, prevent the formation of other films, the liquids that
would otherwise form them remaining lenticular.
    XV. That the camphor film, and other films, in many               cases repel
each other on the surface        of water.
    XVI. That     the motions of camphor on the surface            of water   are
accelerated    by the action of the vapour of benzole, and some other
volatile substances     : such vapours, condensing in the liquid form on
the camphor, and then being diffused by the adhesion of the water,
react on the camphor.

    The following communication      was read   : —
"   On Magnetic Calms and Earth-Currents."                By Charles V.
        Walker,     Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S. &c.         Received February
        3, 1862.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author     uses the word    "calm" in      a negative sense,     "not
storm",      and states   that very few notable        earth-currents     have
attracted attention since the date of his original communication             to
the Royal Society, which was read on February          14, 1861.
     Referring to that communication, he calls attention to the London,
Tonbridge, and Dover- London lines of telegraph, making an angle
of direction with    each other  of 149°,   and by means of which a few
groups of observations were made,          from which the prevailing        di
rection of earth-currents was determined to be approximately          N.E. or
 S.W.     He wished to multiply these observations     and to modify them,
 which he was well able to do from the circumstance that the Dover
 -London telegraph wires enter his own private office at Tonbridge,
 where, by means of the necessary apparatus, he is able at any mo
 ment, when the wires are not occupied by telegrams, to obtain pos
  session  of the whole wire from   end to end,   Dover-London     ; or either
  section,  London-Tonbridge, or Dover- Tonbridge, — the two former
  being the limiting lines, or those making the greatest available angle
  with each other, and the last, which is intermediate, being useful in
  confirmation of the observations made on the other two.
      The telegraph   needles have been rarely affected    of late, the earth-
  currents which form the subject of the present communication being
  feeble.    In order to their examination it     was therefore necessary     to
  prepare a delicate galvanometer, which is properly connected with the
  telegraph wire, and furnished with the simplest possible apparatus
  for bringing   it into action whenever occasion       serves.   It  is within
   arm's length of the author when in his office.         The pressing-down
  of   a spring allows any earth-current      that may be present to enter
   the galvanometer    ; a brass plug, placed in holes     1, 2, and   3, gives

                                        579
possession of the whole line, or either of its sections.          The  needle is
deflected    on   the side marked     "     " or  " down,"
                                        up                   according as the
current collected    is moving up or down the line      ; and in all the Tables
given in this communication the letters " u " or " d," placed beside
the degrees of deflection, give the direction of the current in the above
popular terms. The galvanometer, with its appliances, accompanies
this communication,       and is placed on the table as      in situ, and will
at a glance give an idea of the arrangement, of which also the author
gives a plan.
    A  Table is given of earth-currents collected at Tonbridge, in Oc
tober    1861, on the lines in question,      together with the Meteorolo
gical Register of the month. An analysis of these observations follows,
included with which is an analysis of all observations of a like cha
racter that were made in the subsequent month of November.
    A  few cases are recorded in which the earth gave no sign           of cur
rent.     No  stress  is laid on this, because a closer investigation with
more delicate instruments might have given positive results.
    The contents of the Table        are divided into Normal,        Abnormal,
and Exceptional.        Out of  a total  of 276 observations, 230     gave nor
mal results, confirming the conclusion already arrived at, that the
 prevailing direction of earth-currents was approximately N.E. or S.W.
 Whether    one or other     of these directions prevailed more or less at
 different periods of the day       did not appear,      the observations not
 being sufficiently consecutive.       Father Secchi's views of the relation
 between metereological phenomena and magnetic variation are re
 ferred to.    The author    has reason to conceive that sunshine or cloud,
 heat or cold, influence the relative values of the current collected
 from different parts of the same district        ; in connexion with which
 he refers to a group of night observations, which form part of the
 series made    in October, and     also to the want    of consistency in the
 relation between two derived currents collected at the same time from
 different parts of the same plane.       He   gives a few extracts from the
 Table,   showing how very variable are the relations          ;  for instance,
 15°: 15°; 15°: 30°; 15°: 35°; 13°: 38°; 18°:21°; and so on.
    Professor Loomis's
                          " Eighth Article " on the subject is referred to ;
 and the correspondence      between    the results at which he arrives by
 other processes, and those to which        Mr. Walker arrives by the       me
thods herein described, are given.
                                                             2  t  2

                                      580
    In addition to the currents    whose direction has been already noted,
42 cases occurred of currents which, for distinction sake, are called
Abnormal, and which were equally definite in character.               They are
found in the S.E. and N.W.          quadrants   ;   but the probable place in
these quadrants could not be determined with any approach to accu
racy from the lack of other lines of telegraph immediately at com
mand.      Four diagrams are given in illustration of the normals and
abnormal*.
    The author mentions that the South-Eastern               Railway Company
have cordially entertained the proposition, to which he has previously
 referred, of the Astronomer Royal ; and that he is now preparing to
 erect wires for  Mr. Airy, terminating respectively near Dartford and
 Croydon,    and which by combination will give an angle of 36° or
 107°,   the former, however, being without          the range    of normal di
 rection. The consecutive      observations to be made on these wires pro
 mise   to be very instructive.      The porcelain-ebonite insulator that
 will be used is described   ;  a specimen   is on the table.
     Among    the 276 October-November            observations, four cases oc
 curred which are exceptional and do not admit of similar discussion.
  Subsequent observations may explain these.
     Next follows  a survey    of the N. and S. boundaries of       a plane, the
  mean dimensions    of which   are 56 miles  x 20 miles, bounded on the N.
  by the Thames, and on the S. by the Dover-Tonbridge line of railway.
  This  was accomplished by aid       of the earth-plates     at Ramsgate and
  London, to the former of which access was had at Tonbridge, when
  required, by means of a switch at Ashford Junction.           A Table  is given
  of observations  made during      November and December, which show
  that the plane of the current is at least 20 miles wide, and the di
  rection is consistent at either limit of the plane.
     Tonbridge being very nearly midway on           a line joining London and
  Hastings, gave the opportunity of making observations on the whole
  or on either half of a same line of country.             The results collected
  in November and December         are given  in   a Table, and show a confor
  mity in direction in the whole and in both halves, but a marked
  excess   in value in the London-Tonbridge              as compared    with the
  Hastings-Tonbridge      section.    These differences are considered by
  the author as probably due to the different geological conditions of
  the country on either side of Tonbridge.            Sections kindly furnished

                                         581
 by  Mr. Robert Hunt      are referred to.       These differences    indicate the
influence of local conditions, as the differences         previously mentioned
point at the interference of meteorological variations.
   In order to satisfy himself that           he was     dealing with     currents
collected bond fide from the earth, and in no way from the atmo
sphere,    arrangements were made with the clerks at Ashford to
detach    the observing wire from the earth there when required.                 A
considerable    number of observations were             made    during    October,
November,      and December,          the results of which        are   tabulated.
Whether     the current, as shown by the galvanometer,              was weak    or
strong, it in every instance entirely ceased when the wire at Ashford
was detached    from the earth and held insulated          ;  so that no portion
of the result    was derived from         any other source      than the earth.
These observations were made at all periods of the day and night,
and in all weathers.
   Powerful artificial currents were repeatedly made to flow into the
earth by the earth- plates,         in order to    see  whether any effects of
polarization were produced        ;  but the value of the earth-current, as
observed before any such experiment, remained unchanged.
   That the currents collected        are in no way due to the electromotive
power of the earth-plates themselves,         is shown by the absence of any
sign of a tendency for one or other direction.               They   are indepen
dent in character and in value of all such influences.                To prevent
misconception, a list of the earth-connexions              used   at the several
stations that enter into the present investigation is given.
   The author     considers   it may     be premature to regard the subject
as tolerably exhausted,     as far as the means at his command are con
cerned  ;  but at this moment he does not notice any other salient point
within his reach.       When     the proposed special wires are ready for
Mr. Airy, and     consecutive   observations are made and compared with
the march of the     magnetometers,       the subject will be within the reach
of the  able hands   of Mr. Airy      ; and we may be well assured that the
various questions connected with it will be ably discussed by him.
   The results comprehended in this and the previous communica
tion are briefly summed up as follows          : —
   1st.  That currents of electricity      are at all times moving     in definite
directions in the earth.
   2nd. That their direction is not determined by local causes.

                                      582
    3rd. That there is no apparent difference,         except in degree, be
tween the currents collected     in times of great magnetic disturbance
and those collected during the ordinary calm periods.
    4th. That the prevailing directions of earth-currents, or the cur
rents of most frequent occurrence,      are approximately     N.E. and S.W.
respectively.
    5 th. That there is no marked difference in frequency, duration, or
value, between the    N.E. and the S.W. currents.
    6th. That (at least during calm periods) there are definite cur
rents of less frequency from some place in the S.E. and N.W. qua
drants respectively.
    7th. That the direction of    a  current in one part of     a  plane on the
earth's surface (at least as far as the S.E. district of England is
concerned) coincides with the direction in another part of the plane ;
and    if the direction changes     in one part, it changes         in all parts
of the plane.
    8th. That the relation in value between currents in a given part
of the plane and currents in another given part is not constant, but
is influenced by local meteorological conditions, and vnries from time
to time.
     9th. That the value of the current of      a  given length, moving in a
 given line of direction, is not necessarily the same as of    a  current of the
 same length on the same line        of direction produced, and that their
 relative value depends    on  the physical character of the earth inter
 posed between    the respective    points of observation, and is tolerably
 constant.
     10th. That the currents which have formed the basis of these
 investigations   are  derived currents     from true and proper           earth-
 currents, and neither in whole nor in any appreciable part have been
 collected from the atmosphere, nor are due either in whole or in any
 appreciable part to polarization imparted to earth-plates by the pre
 vious passage of earth-currents or of powerful telegraphic currents ;
  nor are they due to any electromotive force             in the earth-plates
 themselves.
      11th. That the earth- currents in question (at least the powerful
  currents present at all times of great magnetic disturbance) exercise
  a direct action upon magnetometers,         just  as artificial currents con
  fined to a wire exercise a direct action upon      a magnet.

     The following communication        was read   : —
  "  On the     Dicynodont       Reptilia,    with   a   Description    of some
        Fossil Remains brought by H.R.H. Prince Alfred from
        South Africa in November 1860." By Professor R. Owen,
        F.R.S. &c.      Received January 23, 1862.
                                   (Abstract.)
     In this paper the author describes some fossil remains obtained,
 at the suggestion of H.R.H. the late Prince Consort, by H.R.H.
  Prince Alfred, during his journey in South Africa.            They   are refer
 able to two genera     of Dicynodont Reptilia. The first specimen is an
 unusually perfect specimen of the skull, retaining the lower jaw in
 connexion with the tympanic pedicles, of a species of Ptychognathtzs,
 showing    distinctive   characters from previously         described    species,
 and which the author dedicates          to its discoverer under the name       of
 Ptychognathus      Alfredi.     The anatomical characters of this fossil
 were described in detail.      It was  obtained from     a greenish sandstone,
  probably Triassic, of the Rbenosterberg, South Africa.
     The  second specimen     is the skull, with the lower jaw, also in situ,
 .of a true Dieynodon, referable by its size to the largest known spe
 cies (Dicynodon      tigriceps, Ow.).       The right maxillary and zygo
 matic   arch having been partially         removed     in quarrying   the rock
 containing the fossil, a further       detachment of the matrix brought
into view the descending cranial plate             of the frontal, the inter-
orbital septum, the upper surface           of part of the bony palate with
the pterygoid,     and the rhinencephalic continuation of the cranial
cavity.    The presphenoid projects forward as a compressed plate,
exceeding    in relative length and extent of ossification that in Che-
Ionia, and more resembling that in Crocodilia.             Anterior  to the pre
sphenoid is the vomer, which expands laterally to join the palatines
and pterygoids.       Other cranial characters deducible from the pre
sent and not shown in previous specimens             are noticed.  As    a whole,
the skull exemplifies the near equality in size of this extinct two-
tusked reptile of South Africa with the existing Walrus                ;   and it

                                           584
shows that in the structure of the bony palate,                   as in some    other
parts of the skull, the Dicynodon             combines Crocodilian with Chelo-
nian and Lacertian characters.
   The    specimen   above      described     was obtained by        H.R.H.    Prince
Alfred, from the Karoo        beds, in the district        of Graaf Reinet, South
Africa.
   The author next        proceeds     to describe      the pelvis of a Dicynodon
equalling in bulk the D. tigriceps,            and most probably belonging to
that species.    It includes, with five sacral vertebrae, the last of those
of the trunk which supported             free ribs,    showing that there are no
vertebrae   having the character of lumbar ones in Dicynodon.                     The
length of the six successive centrums was               1 foot 2 inches.    The ribs
of the first sacral vertebra        resemble      in size and shape the human
scapula, but are much thicker         ;   their expanded terminations, 6 inches
in breadth, underlap or pass anterior to the iliac bones, to which this
rib   has been attached by syndesmosis.               The ribs of the succeeding
sacral vertebrae are shorter and thicker, and abut against the ossa
innominata,     as far back as the ischial              tuberosities.    The ilium,
ischium, and pubis have coalesced               to form one bone,        as in  some
lizards and in mammalia          ; and, as in the latter class, the symphysis
at which the ischio-pubic portion of each os innominatum joins its
fellow is continuous    ;   the pubic symphysis is not separated from the
ischial symphysis.        But ossification has          advanced    further than in
any mammal, to the complete obliteration of the obturator foramina,
which in most reptiles are represented              by very wide vacuities.       The
pubic bones show an oblique perforation near the acetabulum, homo
logous with that which co-exists              with large obturator openings in
most lizards.     The brim of this singularly              massive pelvis measures
 10 inches in antero-posterior,         and   11   inches in transverse    diameter:
the outlet measures        4 inches in antero-posterior,           and 9 inches iu
transverse   diameter.
    In the comparison of this, at          present,   unique type of pelvic struc
ture, it is interesting to observe, in connexion with the mammalian
tusks in the skull, a mammalian condition of the symphysis pubis,
and also a mammalian expansion               of the iliac   bone.    In the number
of   sacral vertebrae Dicynodon         resembles     the Dinosaurian reptiles, as
well as some mammalia         ;  and hence it may be inferred that, like the
Megalosaurus      and Iguanodon,         a  heavy trunk was in part supported

                                     585
on a pair of large hind limbs, the weight thereupon being transferred
by   a larger proportion     of the vertebral column than in the prone
crawling crocodiles and lizards of the present day.
   The author, from certain associated fossils, deduces a probability
of  the triassic age   of  the sandstones     including the above-described
South African Reptilia, and remarks that it is in        a sandstone   of triassic
age   in Shropshire where fossil remains occur of a reptile which, in
biting with trenchant edentulous jaws, also pierced its prey by a
pair of produced weapons analogous to the tusks of Dicynodon.                  Of
this reptile, the Rhynchosaurus articeps, Ow., the author describes

I. " Notices of     some Conclusions derived from the Photographic
       Records of the Kew Declinometer, in the years 1858, 1859,
        1860, and 1861."          By Major-General Edward Sabine,
       P.R.S.      Received February 6, 1862.
    The discussion of the magnetic observations which have                   been
made in different parts of the globe may now be considered to                have
established the three following important            conclusions in regard to
 the magnetic disturbances      : viz.,  1. That   these phenomena, whether
 of the declination, inclination,       or total force,   are  subject in their
 mean    effects to periodical laws, which determine their relative fre
 quency and amount at different hours of the day and night.               2. That
 the disturbances which occasion westerly and those which occasion
 easterly deflections    of the compass-needle,         those   which    increase
 and those which decrease the inclination,          and those which increase
 and those which decrease the magnetic force have all distinct and
 generally different periodical laws. 3. That there exists a periodical

                                          586
  variation in the relative amount of disturbance in different years,
  contituting     a cycle   of about   ten terrestrial   years,  which has been
  found to correspond, both in the duration of the period and in the
  epochs    of maxima and minima, with          a periodical     variation in the
  appearance     of  spots on the solar disk.
     In the introductions prefixed to the          several   volumes containing
 the observations      made at the colonial observatories, the concurrent
 testimony of the disturbances of the three magnetic elements                   to
 these conclusions is      fully exhibited  ; and in reference particularly     to
 the third, viz. the decennial       variation,   a rdsume    has been given in
 the second St. Helena volume, pages cxxii to cxxxvi.
     In that   rtsum6,   the particular form of the previously announced
 decennial    variation is more fully traced, and, from the analysis of the
 observations,     shown to be of the following character.            If we begin
 with the part of the cycle to which the maximum of disturbance be
 longs, we find, first, three consecutive         years   in  each  of which the
 aggregate amount of disturbance (measured from a constant value) is
nearly the same ; then, two years of diminished disturbance ; and
then, three years in each of which the aggregate                amount is nearly
the same, but is considerably less than in the two preceding years,
and very considerably less than in the three commencing years.
The three      years  of minimum      are then succeeded by two        of medium
disturbance, and these by the recommencement of three years of
maximum amount.             Thus, for    example,    referring to the years in
which the colonial observatories were in action, 1841 and 1842 were
years   of medium disturbance;          1843,  1844, and 1845 years       of mini
mum, differing little from each other; 1846 and 1847 years of me
dium, and 1848, 1849, and 1850 years of maximum.                     The  general
analogy of       these   particular features   with    Schwabe's observations
of the solar     spots, commenced    in   1826  (showing, on the one hand,
the number of groups of spots,            and on the other hand, the num
ber    of  days free from spots     in each year), may be examined by            a
reference     to the table in the third volume of 'Cosmos' (English
translation), page 292, and is as satisfactory as, from the nature of
the subject, could well be expected*.
   *  The variation in the aggregate amount of disturbance in the years of mini
mum, 1843, 1844, and 1845, compared with the two years of medium immediately
preceding,   1841 and 1842, and with the two years of medium           immediately

    The discontinuance of the colonial            observatories    occasioned    a tem
porary suspension       of investigations which         are now admitted to have
been   of very high interest ; but by the liberality and public spirit of
the British Association, and by the aid of occasional grants of money
from the Royal Society, apparatus for their resumption was com
pleted at the Kew Observatory in 1857,                and the investigations were
recommenced       on the 1st        of January, 1858.         The results obtained
from the photographic             records of the Kew declinometer in 1858
and    1859,   with   a    full description of the methods             and    processes
employed in       their     elicitation,    were    communicated        to the Royal
Society in 1860,        and are printed         in vol. x. of the 'Proceedings,'
pp. 624-643.         The two       years which      have   since   elapsed    have fur
nished similar results for the years 1860 and 1861, strictly compar
able with those      of   1858     and 1859,      having been obtained with the
same instruments        and by the same methods.               *We have    now, there
fore, the observations of four consecutive               years   from the Kew Ob
servatory, and we are thereby enabled to infer, by the comparison of
the aggregate amount of disturbance in each of those years, the pro
gression of the decennial           variation up to the close of 1861.              The
aggregate    amounts of disturbance in the four years were severally as
follows: —

The    observations   of preceding         years had led to the expectation that
 1858, 1859, and 1860 would be the three years                of maximum, in which
 succeeding, 1846 and 1847, is well shown by tbe results of the hourly observa
 tions made in those years at the Hobarton Magnetic Observatory.

    The aggregate values which are here given are the amounts in each year of the
disturbances exceeding 2'-13, reckoned from the normals of the several months
and hours.

the aggregate      amounts of disturbance would differ bnt little, and
that 1861 would be the first year of medium, showing an aggregate
amount of disturbance considerably below 1858, 1859, and 1860.
This expectation      has been realized    ;  and we have now before us the
prospect that the present year, 1862, will prove to be the second
year of medium, with an aggregate amount of disturbance nearly
resembling that in 1861,          but a little less; and that 1863,         1864,
and 1865 will be years of minimum,             differing little from each other
in the amount of disturbance, and all lower than the preceding years
1861 and 1862 on the one hand, or the succeeding                 years 1866 and
 1867 on the other.        Hence we     see   the importance of maintaining,
during the remaining portion of the decennial period, the photogra
phic records of the Kew Observatory, with as little change as may
be practicable in the instruments and methods which have been
employed during the first portion.
   The Table which is printed in vol. x. of the Proceedings, page 627,
shows the aggregate values of the disturbances in 1858 and 1859
distributed     into   the several   solar hours of their occurrence, and
distinguishing between the disturbances which produce westerly and
those which produce easterly deflections           of the  compass-needle.     It
also  exhibits the ratios of disturbance at the       several hours to the mean
of the 24 hours taken as the unit.           The subjoined Table contains the
same particulars for the four years,         1858 to 1861, inclusive.      It has
of  course   a somewhat      higher authority than the earlier table, inas
much as ratios obtained from the records of four years are to be pre
ferred to those derived from two years only.             But the principal point
of interest in comparing       them with each other is the evidence which
their correspondence       affords, of the substantial truth of the two first
of the  three general conclusions adverted to in the commencement              of
the present communication, viz., the periodicity of the disturbances in
respect to the several hours      of solar time,   and the distinct character  of
the laws which regulate the disturbances producing westerly deflec
tions, and those producing easterly deflections.          The principal features
of both    classes   of disturbance   are the same, whether viewed in the
record of the two or of the four years.            Regarded from either point
of view, both     classes follow progressions manifestly dependent          upon
the hours of solar time, the progressions of the westerly and those of
the easterly deflections      being as manifestly governed by distinct and

                                                589
different laws.         The westerly          deflections      have their chief prevalence
from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., or during the hours of the day, the ratios at all
the other hours being below unity.                     The     easterly     deflections, on the
other hand, prevail chiefly during the hours of the night, the ratios
being for the most part below unity at the hours when the westerly
are above unity, and, conversely,                 above when the westerly are below.
The    easterly have one decided maximum                       at   1 1  p.m., towards which
they steadily and continuously progress from                        5  p.m., and from which
they as steadily, and continuously, recede until                         5  a.m. the following
morning.         The westerly appear in both records to                          have   a double
maximum, one about               6  or  7  a.m., the other about 2 or 3 p.m.

    In discussions published       elsewhere     the preponderance of westerly
 over  easterly deflection,     or the converse,        has been inferred to be a
geographical characteristic         rather than an accidental feature.            AH
 the stations in North America, at which investigations                have hitherto
been made, concur in showing a considerable predominance                  of easterly
deflections,     whilst at Pekin in Northern Asia the converse                 is ob
servable.      Regarding Kew as the only representative station in the
British Islands (the only one in which this investigation has                    been
made), it is deserving of notice, that we find in this locality no               con
stant or decided predominance of either class of disturbance over the
other.     There is indeed a slight preponderance of easterly values on
the average      of the four   years,   but not of such amount or regularity
as to give    it the character of    a decided feature.
II. " On      the Action of Chloride of Iodine on Iodide of Ethylene
       and Propylene Gas."           By Maxwell Simpson, M.B.                  Com
       municated        by   Dr. Frankland.              Received    February 18,
       1862.
   I  have already shown*         that the cyanides of the diatomic radicals
can be prepared by submitting their bromides to the action                of cyanide
of potassium.        In the hope of forming the          cyanides   of the triatomic
radicals in    a  similar manner,    I  subjected the bromides of several of
these latter radicals to the action      of the    same reagent.       Finding, how
ever, the reaction not quite satisfactory,           it occurred to     me that the
iodides of these radicals might possibly yield better results.                  With
this view     I   endeavoured     to prepare      the teriodide      of aldehydene
(C4 Ha Ia), by exposing iodide of ethylene to               the action of chloride
                      * Philosophical Transactions,    1861, p. 61.

                                       591
of iodine, expecting that      the teriodide would be formed by virtue            of
the following reaction     : —
                       C,H4I,+ClI=C4HtIt+HCI.
   My expectations,     however,   were not realized, the product        of the  re
action being    a  body which    I shall call chloriodide of ethylene       (C, H4
I CI).     The experiment     was performed in the following manner            : —
   Action    of Chloride of Iodine   on   Iodide of Ethylene. — A solution of
chloride of iodine in water containing a trace of free iodine was
agitated vigorously with     a quantity of iodide of ethylene, till the latter
became black and changed into a fluid oil.                This  was  then washed
with dilute potash and distilled.           Almost      the entire liquid passed
over between 146° and 152° Cent.            It  gave, on analysis, results which
correspond perfectly with the formula         I  have given above.      I obtained
 12-43 instead of 12*55 per cent. of carbon.
    If   we regard the constitution    of iodide of ethylene      as C4 Ha 1,   HI,
the reaction which gives birth          to this body becomes         perfectly in
telligible.    It is simply the substitution of chlorine for iodine in hy-
 driodic   acid : —
                    C4 Ha 1, H I + CI I = Ct Ha      1,  H CI + 1 1.
    Chloriodide of ethylidene is     a  colourless oil.      It has a sweet taste,
 and is slightly soluble in water.       It  boils at about 147° Cent.        It is a
 remarkable fact that neither this body nor Dutch liquid is formed
 when iodide of ethylene is exposed to the action of chlorine-water.
     I  have also subjected    propylene gas, derived from amylic alcohol,
 to the action of chloride of iodine, and find that an oily body is formed
 in large quantity, which contains iodine.              This  I am at present en
 gaged in studying.        The action of chloride of iodine on propylene
 gas obtained from glycerine appears to be similar.

          Expediency of re-examining the Southern Portion of the
          Great Indian Arc of the Meridian ; and Report of a Com
          mittee thereupon.
      [Towards the close of the last session of the Royal Society a letter
  was addressed to the President and Council by Colonel Sir George
  Everest, C.B., advocating the expediency of re-examining the portion
  of the Great Indian Arc of Meridian               which was surveyed by the

                                       592
 late Colonel Lambton, and collecting in one volume the results            of that
 part of the survey.        The Council, having taken this letter into con
 sideration, appointed a committee, consisting of the Astronomer-Royal,
 Professor W. H. Miller, and Professor Stokes, to consider and report
 on the subject.    The report    was laid  before the President and      Council
 early in the present session     ; and by their direction the letter of Sir
 George Everest and the report of the Committee are here printed.]
                Letter of Colonel Sir     George Everest,     C.B.
                                          10 Westbourne Street, Hyde Park,     W.
                                                          April 8th, 1861.
 Sir, — In   a letter which    I took occasion to address to you some time
 back *, some remarks are made to which            I  am desirous to draw the
 attention of the President and gentlemen of the Council of the Royal
 Society.     They  are contained in page 7      of the printed copy of that
 letter ; and as they relate to a subject of considerable importance in
 the estimation of myself and many others, I hope no apology will be
 necessary   for the present intrusion.
    To enter into     a long narrative     of my   reasons for the statements
 therein made would but be to repeat what             I have frequently urged
 on other occasions    ;   but in this place it will perhaps be sufficient to
 mention that, 1st, the details of such portions of the late Colonel
 Lambton'    s operations on the Great Arc of India to the south of
 Damargida, as have been printed, are only to be found in a dispersed
 state in the volumes      of the Asiatic Researches of Calcutta        ;   and if
 it is intended that   these should be permanent data, they ought to be
 collated and combined into one volume, in keeping with that relating
to the portion north of Damargida, which was printed by me in 1847,
at the expense and by the desire of the late East India Company.
    2nd. The details of all trigonometrical          operations conducted by
Colonel Lambton        are to be found in manuscript, in the copies             of
what are denominated the General Reports of the Great Trigono
metrical Survey of India, which are deposited            amongst the records
at the India House       ; and as, in transcribing, there is always a liabi
lity to clerical errors, therefore     a volume such as is here suggested
ought to be drawn up after a rigorous comparison with the manu
script   ; and further, wherever it may be practicable, the observations
                    * Proceedings of the R. S., Jan. 27, 1859.

                                                        593
registered in the General Reports                             should be compared with those
originally noted in the Field- or, as they are called, Angle-Books                                                of
the department.
     3rd. There certainly has been one error,                                 if   not more than one,
committed in the computations                       ;   but where such error or errors exist
it is impossible      to say d         priori   :       the only decisive mode of detection
must consist in a thorough recomputation.
     4th.   All the   celestial observations for amplitude made by Colonel
Lambton        were   reduced many years ago                           ;   but     I   need hardly             point
out that the constants and formulae for aberration, precession, nutation,
&c,       have undergone vast alterations since that period, and                                      of   course
corresponding recomputations would now be necessary.                                                This would
not have been needed              if   the observations at each limit of the Arc of
Amplitude had been made simultaneously by two instruments on the
same set      of   stars, one instrument at each limit, as has been done                                          in
the two Arcs north of Damargida                         ;   but it becomes of importance when
not only the years, but the seasons of observations were different.
     If   this were effected, we should at least have the satisfaction of
knowing that the most had been made of the late Colonel Lambton's
operations, which            indeed might                    fairly    rank        with those of MM.
Bouguer and De la Condamine, or                               MM. Maupertius, Clairaut, and
others, though, from the inferiority of instruments and other causes,
of   course they could not be classed for accuracy with those                                        of    a   more
modern date.
     In proper time and           place   I have             abundance to say on this subject                      ;
but it will be evident that the revision and recomputation here sug
gested      constitute   a       task beyond the power of any individual,                                       and
are indeed a state affair, which, now that                            India and all belonging to it
has been taken under the control                            of Her Majesty's Government,                        can
only be accomplished as other state concerns usually are.
     What, therefore,        I   venture to recommend                      is,   that the President and
gentlemen of the Council of the Royal Society should take this sub
ject into their consideration, as                   a       national question falling peculiarly
under their superintendence, and that in their capacity as the parent
Society and leading scientific body of Great Britain, they should use
their influence to have such measures                           effected as            in   their judgment
may seem meet.
     Perhaps   a   recommendation from the Royal Society to the Secretary
     vol. xi.                                                                               2   u

                                      594
of State for India would        be the proper course to be pursued ;     but
 in any   case it seems very clear that   it is not creditable to leave this
 subject in its present disjointed state. India furnishes the largest
 extent of territory accessible to Great Britain in which arcs of the
 meridian can be measured,       and there can be no question that from
 Cape Comorin to the Himalayan          Mountains    one uniform triangula-
 tion ought to be formed.
    The most    effectual method   of accomplishing this desirable purpose
would assuredly have been      that which I counselled the Government of
 India to adopt in 1842; but as my proposal was rejected, it only
 remains to make the most of the materials we actually possess.
    As to now giving effect to my proposal, which was to revise the
 whole series south of Damargida.with the same instruments and ob
servers as had been employed       in the northern portion, there would be
difficulties which did not then exist. Not to speak of the fact that
 there are none of the observers of that day at present available, it
 must be remembered that the station-marks of the Bedu base and the
Damargida Observatory were then fresh and intact, as were indeed the
other station-marks in general      ; but the natives of India have a habit
peculiar to human beings in that state           of society, of attributing
supernatural and miraculous powers to our instruments, and the sites
which have been occupied by them.           In cases of death or any other
natural visitations they often offer up prayers to those sites ; and       if
the object of their prayers be not conceded,       they proceed to all sorts
of  acts  of destruction and indignity towards them : nay, as in all cases
where    it was practicable, my station-marks were engraved on the solid
rock in situ, they have been known to proceed in bodies armed with
sledge-hammers, and beat out every vestige of the engraving        ; so that
it is by   no means certain that the marks which        designate the limits
at Damargida and Bedu could now be detected.
    I will not  trouble you with any further remarks, but, with full con
fidence that the Royal Society will, after giving the subject due con
sideration, take such measures as the case may seem in their wisdom
to require,
                      I beg to subscribe myself, Sir,
                                    Your very obedient Servant,
                                                        George Everest.
To the Secretary      of the Royal Society.

                                       595
                         Report of    the Committee.
   The Committeo to whom          it was referred by Minute of tho Pre
sident and Council of the Royal Society of tho date of June 13, 1861,
to consider and report on a letter by Colonel Sir George Everest, C.B.,
dated  April   8, 1861, relating to the steps proper now to be taken         in
reference to Colonel Lambton's          Survey of an Arc of Meridian in
India, and on the subjects therewith           connected,  have to offer the
following Report     :—
    1. The Committee have examined the principal printed books on
the subject, namely,
    The several volumes of the Asiatic Transactions, containing tho
details, to the extent to which in works of similar character they are
usually published, of Colonel Lambton's Surveys.
   The recalculation of the celestial amplitudes by Bessel in No. 334
        '
of the    Astronomische Nachrichten.'
    The two printed volumes by Sir George Everest, containing the
details of his own Indian Survey with much information on Colonel
Lambton's Survey.
    A former letter    addressed   by Sir George Everest to the Secretary,
                                                                 '
and printed in     the ' Proceedings     of the Royal Society      for January
27, 1859 (vol. ix. pp. 620-625).
    The Committee have also been favoured by Sir George Everest,
at a personal interview which that gentleman at their request most
kindly granted them, with very important oral information on the
instruments, the methods of proceeding, and other particulars re
lating to Colonel Lambton's and to his own survey            ;  and they have
been permitted      by him to peruse a most valuable document, partly
of private and partly of semi-official character,       addressed    to him by
Mr. Do Penning, formerly Chief Assistant to Colonel Lambton in tho
conduct of the Survey.
   2.  The Committee      will first advert to the observations and pri
mary deductions from them (of the nature of adopted angles, &c.) in
Colonel Lambton's surveys.          And in regard to these, they have no
hesitation in stating their opinion that no good whatever would be
done by general examination         of the angle-books.    It  is evident from
Mr. De Penning's statements that the utmost           care was used, and the
best judgment of the Officers was exercised, at a time when all the
                                                            2   v2

                                            596
qualifying circumstances of the separato observations were known to
them, and that any attempt to depart from their conclusions at the
present time would probably lead to error.
    The Committee remark that the exhibition                   (in the Asiatic Re
searches) of the adopted angles with the corrections required to make
the sum of the angles in each triangle equal to two right angles,
renders    it impossible that any clerical or typographical error                  can
escape discovery     :    if any such should be found, of which the proper
correction is not obvious and certain, they think it proper that re
ference should be made to the manuscripts now preserved in the
Archives of the Department of State for India                ; but they recommend
nothing further.
    3.  In  regard to the accuracy of tho calculations of the sides of
the triangles, founded on the adopted                angles to which      allusion is
made above, there appears to be no check except the verifications by
the measure of widely-separated bases              ; and the comparison of these,
as presented     in the Asiatic Researches, shows            a degree of  accordance
which the Committee, guided by the results of Sir                  George   Everest's
experience, consider satisfactory.              Still they remark that the form
in which     these calculations        are printed makes their verification ex
tremely easy, and the Committee recommend that they be verified.
 Of the next    step     of calculation, namely the computation and aggre
 gation of successive portions of the meridian (including the astrono
 mical determinations of azimuth), thero appears to be no check what
 ever ; and the Committee recommend that this important calculation
 be repeated,     and in     a different form,  if the  oflicer entrusted with such
 revision should think         it desirable.
     4. The    details of the base-measure reductions, as founded on
 Colonel Lambton's           statements of the measuring process, admit of
 easy verification     ;   and the Committee recommend that they be veri
 fied.   But the evaluation of all         these measures, for application to the
estimate    of the length of Arc of Meridian at the level of the              sea, re
quires that the elevation of the bases be very approximately known.
The portions of the            Arc surveyed respectively by Colonel Lambton
and Sir Georgo Everest, join each other at Damargida;                      and there
is a large discordance between the elevation of this station, as given
first by Colonel Lambton,             and secondly by Sir Georgo Everest           and
 Sir A. Waugh. Guided by tho information which Sir George Everest

                                      597
has furnished, on the inadequacy of the vertical circles of the instru
ments employed by Colonel Lambton,           on the want     of attention to
atmospheric circumstances, and on the want of simultaneity in re
ciprocal observations (all which considerations have been carefully
kept in view in Sir George Everest's and Sir A. "Waugh's observa
tions), the Committee recommend that Colonel Lambton's determi
nations of height of base be rejected, and those of Sir George Everest
and Sir A. Waugh be adopted         ;  and that the resulting     corrections
be made to the estimated lengths        of Meridian Arcs,   as far as, in the
judgment of the Officer revising this work,         it is now possible to
 do it.
     5. The reductions of astronomical observations for celestial am
plitude of arcs and absolute determination of latitude admit of easy
 examination;    and the Committee recommend that they be thoroughly
 verified.    The Committee recommend that the original numbers of
 these observations, as well as those of celestial azimuths, be verified
 by collation with any manuscripts of the Survey which may now be
 preserved in England.
     6. The   reduction   of the    Latitude-observations     was   corrected
 several years ago by Bessel.         The Committee are of opinion that
 additional    accuracy can now be given to these corrections.          First,
 the proper motions of the stars are now bettor known than they
 were     in Bessel's time.    Secondly, the value of the coefficient of
  Nutation    used by Bessel is now universally       abandoned by astro
 nomers.      The alteration made in the result by the use of corrected
 values of these elements would probably be small         ;  but, remarking
 that they can     be introduced with great facility, the Committee re
 commend that the corrections be made.
     7. The Committee have had personal experience of the great in
 convenience caused by the dispersion of Colonel Lambton's accounts
 of the survey-operations through numerous volumes of the Asiatic
  Researches; and viewing the limited circulation of that work in
 continental libraries, they are inclined to believe that very few men
 of   science have  it in their power to form    a correct judgment      as to
 the value of Colonel Lambton's great work.          The Committee there
 fore recommend that, when the verifications and corrections which
 they have particularized      shall have been made, the whole be pub
  lished in ono volume, in a form as nearly similar as circumstances

                                      598
permit    to those   describing    Sir George Everest's operations and
results, and in sufficient number (say 500 copies) to allow of their
being presented    to all the known Libraries, Academies, and Obser
vatories of importance, throughout the world.
   8. The Committee unhesitatingly        express their   opinion   that tho
expense attending     all the recommendations which they have made
would be    small in comparison with the scientific value of the result.
And   even  in the event of ulterior operations (to which they proceed
to allude) being ultimately sanctioned, the adoption of the course
which they have recommended would give valuable facilities.
   9. The Committee      think it right, however, to call the attention of
the President and Council to the general quality of Colonel Lambton's
Surveys, which, though executed with the greatest care and ability,
were carried on under serious difficulties, and at a time when instru
mental appliances were far less complete than at present.           There is
no doubt that at the present time the Surveys admit           of being im
proved in every part.        The Standards of length are better ascer
tained than formerly, and all uncertainty on the unit of measure
can be removed.       The base-measuring apparatus can be improved.
The instruments for horizontal angles used by Colonel Lambton were
inferior to  those now    in use ; and one of them was most severely in
jured by an accidental blow, the result of which was more distinctly
injurious   because   the circle    was read   by only two microscopes.
Allusion   has already been mado to the circumstances        of observation
affecting the altitude of stations.       Though the astronomical obser
vations were probably good for their age, yet new observations con
ducted with such instruments and on such principles as those adopted
by Sir George      Everest    would undoubtedly be better.       The   Com
mittee therefore express their strong hope that the whole of Colonel
Lambton's Survey may be repeated with the best modern appliances.
The expense of such a work would be considerable           ; but no   Arc of
Meridian yet measured        has such claims on the attention     of the pa
trons of science as the Indian Arc, from its proximately equatorial
position, and from its anomalies and the reference of them to the
attraction of the Himalaya Mountains.
